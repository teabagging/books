Norman Cliff entered the army at the age of 21 towards the end of 1914, immediately joining the Grenadier Guards. His love for his friends in arms is matched only by his resentment of the system to which so many would peril needlessly. Mr. Cliff would see action at Loos, the Somme (where he is wounded) and the muddy hell they called Passchendaele, he would also witness the German offensive in the spring of 1918 and fight right to the end of the war. Norman Cliff was a sensitive soul, so it is riveting to read his depictions of the total world of devastation that he lived in for over three years. He saw most of his friends die and was haunted by the scenes of butchery until his death at the ripe old age of 83. He wrestles with that subject in his book, why he was allowed to live and yet so many of his friends would die, eternally young. His work paints a realistic and disturbing visual picture of warfare, which stems from his natural story telling ability (he would become a reporter after the war and eventually a friend to none other then the Mahatma Gandhi). He became an extreme pacifist after the war, spending his time in the pursuit of peace, only to leave the world without realizing that dream. His book is not proliferated with boastful heroic deeds, but is a strict anti-war creed which displays combat as it truly is; filthy and hellish. Though hidden by the horrors of combat to the private soldier was Cliff's popularity with his fellow Tommies, and his blank refusal to promotion or commission, though offered to him several times. He survived virtually unscathed two of the most horrible battles of the war and was decorated for valor, and served in the toughest outfit that the British army had. This book should not be passed up, as it is a true classic. Though it is not widely known, I imagine that is because of the unenlightening way he portrays the royal family and his disgust of the men who started the war and then destroyed the peace that might have been at Versailles. A truly beautiful human being it is a pity there are not more like him, and his legacy is this book, which is dedicated as follows: \\"to all who strive for world peace and an end to wars\\"."},{"Title":"The Eagles Daughter","review":"Judith Tarr has written another brilliant book! This rich tapestry of a story covers the shaky Roman Empire in the West and the Bzyantine Empire in the East. Good storyline, setting, charactors. A book I highly recommend to anyone who adores historical fiction and shuge sweeping novels."},{"Title":"The Eagles Daughter","review":"As I settled down to read about a little known period of history--the Byzantine Empire and Otto II--I purred with anticipation. The characters are well rounded. The story plot is solid. But missing is the breath of focus, the width of historical sweep that we readers of historical fiction have come to expect from other historical authors likes Margaret George and Mary Stewart. There are good heavy doses of minute period detail, yet they lack the ricness we want to feel. It seems to be written for someone already familiar with the period and tale. Not bad, but not great."},{"Title":"The Eagles Daughter","review":"We need more books written on the Byzantine Empire this is was a very interesting period in time and I would love to learn more about it. I really enjoyed this book; very intersting, great charactors, and a fast read.

Not only emotionally or financially, but in society's change in perception of a woman who becomes a mother.

I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially to the career woman who has recently become a mother."},{"Title":"The Night Sky","review":"This account of a woman struggling to find love and livlihood while in the throes of single motherhood is one of the most honest and moving portraits I've ever read. Mary Morris' talent in evoking both the absence of mother in the character, Ivy, as well as newly found rewards and challenges in her own new motherhood provides a story of both loss and redemption."},{"Title":"The Night Sky","review":"I enjoyed both of these books acts of God being the other. Having been a single mother I could relate, well written."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"The value of this book is not just the portrait it paints of its subject, Abu Nidal. His entire oranization is clearly and thoroughly documented: its structure, incidents (with dates), movements, and interworkings. Through his penetration into the organization and subsequent writing, Patrick Seale has written this remarkably detailed intelligence report. Anyone with any interest in international terrorism should go out of their way to procure a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"Abu Nidal purportedly committed suicide in Baghdad a few months ago by shooting himself in the head a few times. As English author Patrick Seale probably would agree, Nidal's mysterious death was appropos of a murky life given to terrorism for profit from whatever financial source was available.Abu Nidal: A Gun for Hire has many of the characteristics American readers find so grating about British journalism. Among these are the author's penchant for injecting himself into the story and then indulging in a baseless conspiracy theory which requires the writer to make every fact fit his premise (in this case, a far-fetched theory that Nidal worked for the Mossad). All that said, this book probably is more relevant in the aftermath of September 11th than it was when published a decade ago. The author gives textured explanations for the root causes of terrorism, and provides the mechanics of how these horrific crimes actually are implemented.Seale also gives us a look into the sad history of Abu Nidal and other Palestinians who suffered at the hands of Israeli settlers. He follows Nidal as he evolves from a young expatriate into the recipient of patronage from the likes of Saddam Hussein, and finally into a quasi-businessman who becomes a freelance killer for profit. As an interesting aside, Nidal had been expelled from Iraq at the time this book was written. The terrorist Seale portrays is essentially a cowardly, bigoted man who loves money and whiskey more than radical politics and the Palestinian cause. In fact, as his career gains momentum Nidal murders far more Palestinians than he does Israelis and other Westerners. To underscore his actual motives, in one grimly amusing vignette Nidal has an in-law slain to settle a business dispute.Abu Nidal: A Gun for Hire was published shortly before serial killers, terrorists and other criminals became media darlings and topics of the talk show circuit. It is interesting to read a relatively recent book that required the author to gather actual facts rather than rely on the self-serving declarations of his subject matter. Even with all its flaws, Seale's book is a valuable tool to understanding terrorism."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"Seale, a noted expert on Middle East affairs, uses his expertise to create an engaging story about Abu Nidal and his terrorist organization. Not only does the book provide a detailed history of Abu Nidal, but it explains the whole of the Palestinian problem in relation to Abu Nidal and his efforts. With close ties to influential sources Seale is able to add a thread of authenticity to the tale. In some parts of the book, Seale acts out the role of a private detective, piecing together clues about Abu Nidal and his possible ties to Mossad. However, the book is entertaining and educational, a great addition to one's library."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"Patrick Seale's \\"Abu Nidal: A Gun For Hire\\" is addictive and non-stop reading. A book tracing the inner working and operations of Abu Nidal's terrorist organization. Abu Nidal started a resistance group which splintered from the mainstream palestinian opinion in the 70's. Abu Nidal's would transform his group from an extreme palestinian group into a work-for-hire organization that would carry out terrorist attacks against the enemies of his sponsor of the day. Most importantly Abu Nidal broke early on with the PLO and did everything he could to destroy the moderate palestinian voices.The book recreates Abu Nidal's operations, its mode of operation and some missions it carried out by interviewing collaborators, defectors and opponents. The book starts by tracing the steps of a new recruit in the group, and then exploring the claim from a senior PLO officer: that either Abu Nidal's Organization was infiltrated by the Mossad or Abu Nidal himself was working for the Mossad. The exploration of this claim takes the rest of the book as Patrick Seale reconstructs the various terrorist strikes carried out by Abu Nidal. In this book, Lebanon appears only as a backdrop to the mainline story.In any case, Abu Nidal's strikes consistently undermined the efforts of the PLO and the palestinian cause which he claimed to be assisting. Attacks would set back any attempts from the PLO to become a political force to represent the interests of the Palestinians in the exile and on the occupied territories.It was Abu Nidal's group who carried out the attempt to assassinate the Israeli ambassador in London in 1982. This give Israel the excuse to start its long-planned invasion of Lebanon in 1982 by claiming that the the cease fire had been broken by the PLO.In addition to the detective work, the interviews and the puzzle that the book tries to assemble there are various bits of insight on the events of the 80's and early 90's on the Middle East which will help understand the mood in the region."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"The book is a very interesting account of this terrorist's career. It covers many of the different organizations he is part of or works with and the countries that use him or support him. The book also tried to give the reader a better understanding of the Israeli / Palestinians war and why it effects Nidal. I found the most interesting part was just the detailed accounts of what he has been involved in; this is a very sick person that is out for as much death and destruction as possible. The book is well written and detailed. The author keeps the books going in a straight timeline. I would say that it could use an update on what he has been up to the last ten years. If you are interested in terrorism, and right now who is not, then you should pick up a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"good stuff. need intel? need insight? this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Abu Nidal A Gun For Hire","review":"I owned this book many years ago but lost it before I could finish it. I finally decided to go through Amazon.com and the seller was very reliable and I received the book timely. Patrick Seale is a phenomenal writer and his writing style is clear. His long life in the Middle East gave him the advantage to depict the Arab culture.

Anthony, or a Mother Jones, or a Florence Nightingale, or a Margaret B. Sanger or a Rosa Parks, or a Sojourner Truth or - I suppose one could even say - a Joan of Ark.All these little girls are either good or evil depending on your point of view.Elizabeth Gurley Flynn is not so well known as some of these others because she was an American Communist. American Communists do not get a lot of space in American history books, whether they are male or female. She was, first a Socialist, and then a Communist.Ms. Flynn was an American, born and bread, Communist and proud of it. In \\"The Rebel Girl\\", an autobiography, she puts it this way; \\"Many have written as ex-Communists. This second book will be the story of an active American Communist and one who is proud of it. No matter what are the consequences, \`I will never move from where I stand.' ... I feel it is important for me to set down here my personal recollections of this earlier part of the century, a period full of heroic struggles on the part of the working class, especially the foreign born. As the reader will see, the years 1906 to 1926 were full of \`force and violence' used by the ruling class in America against the workers, who gave their lives, shed their blood, were beaten, jailed, blacklisted and framed, as they fought for the right to organize, to strike and to picket. Struggles for a few cents more an hour, for a few minutes less a day - were long and bitterly fought. Nothing was handed on a silver platter to the American working class by employers. All of their hard-won gains came through their own efforts and solidarity.\\"And that about says it!Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"\\"America on Strike\\" American Labor - History"},{"Title":"The Rebel Girl;: An autobiography, my first life (1906-1926)","review":"Elizabeth Flynn is not a gifted writer, so this book makes for &quot;choppy&quot; reading. But, she is a powerful, passionate and dedicated woman; an example to young people of the 21st century. She spent time in jail and served for several years as head of the Communist Party in the United States. Yet, I would call her a great American.Reading her story makes one appreciate the progress of Labor in this country and how much we owe those of the early 20th century who put their lives on the line for human dignity."},{"Title":"The Rebel Girl;: An autobiography, my first life (1906-1926)","review":"The Rebel Girl is a memoir by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn of her early work as a Socialist labor organizer for the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World). The first chapter tells of her life growing up in an Irish-American family. Her mother was an Irish nationalist and a feminist while her father was a Socialist. When she was 16 Elizabeth gave her first speech at a New York Socialist meeting on the rights of women.She was so good at public speaking that it became her life's work, traveling all over the US while still a teenager. Mining towns in the Rockies and Minnesota, lumber camps in the Northwest, textiles strikes in Massachusetts and New Jersey are all places she went to help workers fight for safe working conditions and living wages.Later on she talks of ideological struggles within the IWW leadership, her two marriages and raising a child, World War I, and the oppressive atmosphere in the US after the war against the Left. The Rebel Girl ends with the trial and appeals for the two Italian anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti.The book was meant to be the first volume of her autobiography covering 1906 to 1924, her years before joining the Communist Party, and was first published in 1955. She died before she could complete the second volume which was to cover the 35 years she spent as a Communist.Flynn is a great writer and tells her story of the early 20th century labor movement well. As a first person account, it is full of detail and personal perspective. At times I longed for a more objective account of some events for balance and this book has encouraged me to read further about the events described."},{"Title":"My fifty years in baseball,","review":"This book was written in the days when truths weren't revealed in baseball books or biographies: before the days of sensationalism. That certainly makes Barrow sound more level-headed than many of today's baseball writers. Barrow's story spans two centuries: the 19th and the 20th. He was active in baseball from the beginning: in the minor leagues and then the major leagues. He's the man credited with building the Yankees into the powerhouse team of the 1920s and onward. A book worth reading."},{"Title":"Two Years Before the Mast: And Twenty-Four Years After (The Harvard Classics: Collector's Edition)","review":"I know many people cringe at the thought of reading a narrative that seems to greatly resemble Moby Dick, but I tell you this better than Moby Dick and easy makes it into my top ten books I have ever read! Occassionally the text bogs down in obscure sailing terms, but that is an exception and not a rule, otherwise, it is sheer poetry and lights the fire of wonder of exploration, and makes a sea voyage from almost 200 years ago spring to life. I give you my favorite short little passage, which explains it so much better.\\"So quiet too, was the sea, and so steady the breeze, that if the sails had been sculptured marble they could not have been more motionless. Not a ripple upon the surface of the canvas; not even a quivering of the extreme edges of the sail, so perfectly were they distended by the breeze. I was so lost in the sight that I forgot the presence of the man who came out with me, until he said, 'How quietly they do their work!'\\"Dana so perfectly described sea life you will be a part of the crew, you will feel his fear, his wonder, his joy and his awe.You will not regret reading this, philosophy disguised as a travelogue, a must-read!"},{"Title":"Two Years Before the Mast: And Twenty-Four Years After (The Harvard Classics: Collector's Edition)","review":"I reread this book about every three years. It never gets stale. It intertwines history, philosophy, and a personal travelogue in a book that is so well paced and entertaining to read that it is hard to imagine anyone that would not find it worthwhile. And if you are interested in sailing ships or what California was like in the 1830s, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Two Years Before the Mast: And Twenty-Four Years After (The Harvard Classics: Collector's Edition)","review":"This is a great book about the merchant trade sailors on the Coast of California during the end of the Spanish period about 1835. Cattle hides were the hot commodity and large sailing ships moved up and down the coast for a whole year collecting hides from ranchos at the various ports. Richard Dana had been a young college student when a failure in his eyesight made it difficult for him to read so he decided to try his hand as a merchant marine. Leaving from Boston Harbor he sailed around the Horn on his way to and from the west coast of America. His tale of adventures both on the sea and land is engrossing and educational, as to the nature of life during our country's infancy. Any student of California history MUST read this book!"},{"Title":"Two Years Before the Mast: And Twenty-Four Years After (The Harvard Classics: Collector's Edition)","review":"This book is written by a Harvard lawyer about his experiences as a young man aboard a sailing ship in the 1830's. It is a fascinating piece of California history as well as a firsthand look at the life of a sailor in the early 1800's. It is extremely well written and includes a final dissertation about the powers of the captain and the rights of the common sailor."},{"Title":"Two Years Before the Mast: And Twenty-Four Years After (The Harvard Classics: Collector's Edition)","review":"Many read this book as a history of California during Mexico's time at the helm of governance. Far, far more, this is a history of one man, Richard Henry Dana. This is the story of a young man discovering himself through a perilous voyage from Boston to Yerba Buena, now San Francisco. Life is seen fragile when a shipmate is swept over the rail into the unforgiving sea. Compassion is seen as necessity when those with power flog a man with glee. Dana through his experiences returns a better man who makes a difference in lives of others. Cheers!

LUIS MENDEZ"},{"Title":"La Muerte De Artemio Cruz (Spanish Edition)","review":"As an intersection of two major themes - the illusion of independence pictured in a faint bourgeois environment (Las Buenas Conciencias, 1959) and the nightmare of transculturation in contemporary life (La Regi&oacute;n M&aacute;s Transparente, 1958), La Muerte De Artemio Cruz (1962) rebuilds mexican history on the ruins of individual and social consciousness. The protagonist (the &quot;yo&quot; instance) is led to seek the truth in his own past, while the voice of memory (&quot;t&uacute;&quot;) recalls the origins of a betrayed revolution (&quot;&eacute;l&quot;, the stream of historical action) and gives the dying man the last chance to imagine how things might have been from another point of view: the wish of community, a future raised by plural needs and dreams - &quot;nosotros&quot;. From the epigraphs to the end of the novel, death and memory join forces to restore that manifold identity, stifled by Artemio's overwhelming projects. The physical death of Artemio corresponds to the rebirth of mexican history as a social body made of facts but also of feelings and emotions, concealed under the rough mask of authority. Throughout the text the feminine figures accomplish this mission as well, reflecting, like mirrors (so often mentioned in this book), the reality Artemio wants to deny. Four women - Regina, Catalina, Lilia y Laura - symbolize different periods of Artemio's life strongly attached to main revolutionary commotions (from the beginnings to their later political and economic metamorphose). In each one of them, financial ascent and physical/moral degradation are but one painful and irreversible process. All these symbolic elements converge to the final scenes: the fulfillment of collective destiny in the death of his son Lorenzo; the recognition of social fountainhead through the analogous images of Artemio's mother, Isabel Cruz, and the mythical representation of La Chingada. At the end, the two most important moments of Artemio's life stick together: his birth and his death. All the lapse between these extremes is a synesthetic confluence of multiple perceptions, where past and future switch sides, creating what Jacques le Goff called &quot;the ontological rule of historicity&quot;: the rescue of memory as freedom."},{"Title":"La Muerte De Artemio Cruz (Spanish Edition)","review":"Artemio Cruz, on his deathbead, passes through the events of his life in this Fuentes masterpiece. The novel is narrated in the first, second and third person, symbolic of the character's ego, id and superego. Cruz explores the deaths that spared him. His lack of courage and personal sacrafice, ironically, bring Cruz to fortune and fame. He leaves battle only to be heralded as a war hero. He escapes execution. Through deception, Artemio Curz earns permission to marry the sister of the man killed in his place. The language of the novel is rich and varied. The reader enters into the morphine-induced train of consciousness of Cruz, finds deathbed observations laced with old memories and jumps through the life of Cruz. La Muerte de Artemio Cruz is a novel of self--judgement. Before dying, Cruz examines the value of his existance."},{"Title":"La Muerte De Artemio Cruz (Spanish Edition)","review":"Personajes : artemio cruz, catalina, Lorenzo, Teresa, Gloria, Gerardo, Gamaliel, padre Paez, Lilia, Laura, Lunero, Gonzalo , Regina, Locacion: M&eacute;xico A&ntilde;o: diferentes fechasLa historia de Artemio es la historia de la ambici&oacute;n por sobre todas las cosas, el deseo desmedido de poder, la corrupci&oacute;n, la degeneraci&oacute;n moral, dejar de creer en el amor y en las personas para empezar a creer en lo que se puede comprar y tener, en lo que se puede manejar, dominar, subyugar.....

Unity, in positivist rhetoric, was not so much a political or economic concept as it was biological. Since growth meant modernization and Europeanization, the most extreme ideologues (like Argentina's Domingo F. Sarmiento) advocated a combined policy of white immigration and Indian or Black removal, while others...[as the Mexican ideologues] settled for redeeming the \\"primitive\\" races through miscegenation and ideological whitening.\\"Doris SommerThe modern Mexican nation emerged in the third decade of the twentieth century during the cultural phase of the Mexican Revolution. The criollo (white) controlled government disseminated officially the myth that mestizos were the offspring of Spaniards and Amerindians exclusively, in that order. Thereafter, this discourse was reproduced and reinforced through various means of mass persuasion, including the novel, until 1968.The black African heritage of Mexican mestizaje was replaced in the collective memory and national imaginary with Jos&eacute; Vasconcelos' \\"cosmic race\\" myth. This philosophy, a continuation of Spanish colonial beliefs, codified blacks as tame and their genes as recessive. By insisting that Spanish genes were dominant and that black African genes were recessive in the mestizo, criollos, as supposed heirs of the Spanish genes, \\"legitimated\\" a paternity claim; hence, a protagonist role in carving out the Mexican nation. This enabled them to transfer historical glory to their name. The history of cimarronaje was erased and African Mexican national heroes were whitened, thus African Mexican national achievements became criollo based.According to Vasconcelos' creed, exposed in the first forty pages of his La raza c&oacute;smica, the black characteristics of the Mexican were receding through natural selection. In his Christian-rooted vision, \\"beauty\\" was overpowering \\"ugliness\\" and the mestizo population was steadily and eagerly whitening. The modern nation builders adopted Vasconcelos' views as the unequivocal road toward modernization. La muerte de Artemio Cruz (1962) (The Death of Artemio Cruz), by Carlos Fuentes, reintroduces and reinforces the myth of the Mexican populace's willing submission to whitening.In this canonized post-modern novel, the central character, a post-revolution Mexican prototype, on a level, appears as a \\"mestizo\\" oblivious of his African family tree; but as he reels through memory from his deathbed, the reader is informed that in the depth of his heart he despises his negritude. He is convinced that \\"the whiter the better.\\" La muerte is read in this study as a link in the chain of canonized criollo works reflecting the cosmic race-discourse on nation whose iron-like determination, from the start, was the cleansing of blackness from the population, if at least psychologically.La muerte continues the construction of a false national identity. The novel depicts and perpetuates stereotypes of blacks. It posits that for black characters to be rebellious, or to show intelligence, they have to be whitened. La muerte ignores that black Africans from the beginning of the Maafa or Black Holocaust have revolted. Alive in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, Yanga, the maroon leader in Veracruz, the home state of the protagonist anti-hero of the novel, is a case in point.La muerte is read in light of pertinent portions of Octavio Paz' \\"Los hijos de la Malinche\\" (1950), El perfil del hombre y la cultura en M&eacute;xico (1934) by Samuel Ramos, and La raza c&oacute;smica (1925) by Jos&eacute; Vasconcelos to track down the codification of blackness under its various Mexican signifiers. The aim is to exhibit the intertextuality of these canonized criollo works, pillars of the modern nation, and disclose how they codify the African Mexican Experience.La muerte uses chingar as substance in constructing Cruz' character (143-47). It thereby makes him a prototype of the Mexican pelado as pointed out by both Remigio Paez, the catholic priest, who brokers his marriage to the criolla Catalina (47), and Cruz himself (276). Regarding the Mexican pelado, Ana Mar&iacute;a Prieto Hern&aacute;ndez reveals, \\"zaragates, guachinangos, zaramullos, z&aacute;nganos, &iacute;nfima plebe, chusma, peladaje [plural pejorative of pelado] or \\"l&eacute;peros\\" were the postcolonial names given to the various mestizos of African descent (17-19) (emphasis mine). These euphemisms replaced part of the \\"sixty-four\\" Spanish colonial categories used to refer to a person's degree of African heritage (Davis 37).\\"Los hijos de la Malinche,\\" a parody of los hijos de la chingada (sons of the raped African Mexican woman), exposes that chingar is a \\"vulgar\\" word (Paz 67), and that the general population is master of its usage (Paz 67). It posits that chingar may be of Aztec origin (Paz 68). Thereby, it cleanses l&eacute;peros or pelados from their African heritage. \\"Los hijos\\" claims the mestizo, l&eacute;pero or pelado as the offspring of Spaniards and Amerindians, in that order.The Malinche, a synonym of national treason, embodied in a pre-Hispanic born Amerindian woman who gives into Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, is inserted in the place of la chingada. Through its thesis, besides glorifying the criollo and marking the Amerindian genes of the mestizo as inherently \\"malinchista,\\" it blocks the possibility of establishing the relations between La chingada, her Africaness and the African Kimbundu cradle of the verb chingar (P&eacute;rez Fern&aacute;ndez).\\"Los hijos de la Malinche\\" replaces the maroon history of mestizaje in the national imaginary. It omits mestizaje's African heritage. \\"Los hijos\\" annuls the connection between Africans, African Mexicans, alvarade&ntilde;os, jarochos, chinacos, l&eacute;peros, or pelados. \\"Los hijos\\" is another vehicle of cultural misappropriation. It confuses ownership of the verb chingar and blurs the African origins and identity of the Mexican mezclas or mestizos.\\"Los hijos\\" fuses all \\"social\\" classes through the word chingar. It presents Mexico and Mexicaness as one; this underlines the fallacy of Mexico as a racial paradise. By omitting its Africaness, it creates a \\"rightful\\" and preferential space for the criollo within a culture constructed by the Other. Ted Vincent exhibits the two separate worlds constructed in Mexico during the colonial period: the Spanish-criollo world marked by the minuet, wine and white bread; and the mezcla world marked by La bamba, tequila, and corn tortillas (5). For \\"Los hijos,\\" Mexicaness, embodied in the mestizo, has Spanish and Amerindian roots alone, in that order.\\"Los hijos\\" follows the \\"psychoanalytical profile\\" of the pelado in El perfil. After calling the pelado \\"fauna,\\" El perfil characterizes the pelado as \\"a being without principles, generally mistrusting, full of bluster and cowardly\\" (Ramos 76). El perfil manifests that as a subject, the pelado \\"lacks all human values\\" and that in fact he is \\"incapable of acquiring\\" said values (Ramos 76). El perfil's evaluation of the pelado is linked to Vasconcelos and his philosophy on education (Mu&ntilde;oz 24). El perfil forwards the perspective that Mexican culture is a culture of cultures whose most valuable manifestation is the criollo culture. In La muerte, the protagonist recognizes Mexico as \\"a thousand countries under one name\\" (274) where criollos are the mark of civilization (50).Cruz is narrated as a dying seventy-one year old (16) Mexican of African lineage who does not identify with his African heritage (276). He is the bastard son of a certain \\"Isabel Cruz, Cruz Isabel,\\" a Mulatto woman whose true name is unknown (314). Cruz' father, Anastasio Menchaca, is a criollo who during the Porfiriato had been a powerful landowner. Cruz is six feet tall and weighs about 174 pounds (247). He has \\"pronounced features\\" (41), a wide nose (9) graying curly hair (16, 251) that once was black (314). He has dark skin (16), as the \\"very dark\\" skin color of his son (168). He has green eyes that project a cold, unwavering look (171), an energetic mouth, wide forehead, protruding cheekbones (149) and thick lips (115).Cruz becomes Lieutenant Colonel during the armed phase of the Revolution. Through his cunning marriage to a criolla, the sister of a fellow soldier executed by a firing squad at the end of the armed conflict, he turns out to be first, a landowner and administrator, and later, a newspaper magnate and a millionaire by brokering government concessions to foreigners.In La muerte, the images are patchy and colored in a cubist fashion. For instance, when Cruz tells himself:Although I don't want it to, something shines insistently next to my face; something that reproduces itself behind my closed eyelids: a fugue of black lights and blue circles. I contract the face muscles, I open the right eye and I see it reflected in the glass incrustations of a woman's purse (...) I am this old man with the features shattered by the irregular glass squares. (9)The physical and ideological descriptions of the characters are introduced in scattered fragments and clues throughout the novel, as a puzzle that must be assembled. In the case of Cruz, this renders his heritage confusing. The analytical Afrocentric reader must amass the fragments to realize Cruz is an African Mexican. The level of difficulty of this decoding task is evidenced by the scattered page numbers where Cruz' characteristics and features are introduced bit by bit nonchalantly: 276, 324, 247, 41, 9, 16, 251, 314, 168, 171, 149, 115, and 316, among others.The reader is forced to travel back and forth in time. The images evoked by Cruz flash in and out of focus. Time, space, physical and metaphysical barriers are shattered as the plot develops in Cruz' psyche. He brings the past to the present at will. One case in point is when he recalls his childhood, as in a close-up scene, and transports the reader to a different place in time (271).The past and present dissolve into one plane when pain brings Cruz out of his lethargy and he becomes aware of the presence of others in the room (116). An uncertain future intermingles with the present when Cruz foresees what may happen (247). La muerte penetrates the memory of the reader lost in trying to put together the pieces and unexpectedly, subliminally lays an Eurocentrically idealized world in the place of historical facts. Thus, what never happened replaces maroon history. The novel shapes a national imaginary according to criollo beliefs.Julio Ortega interprets La muerte as \\"the first product of Latin American post-modernity\\" and as \\"a disenchanted reading of compulsive modernity\\" (2). This is correct to a point. La muerte provides a \\"fresh\\" look at the Revolution and indicts the corrupted patriarchal system. Thereby, it passes within the guise of the long awaited voice of self-criticism of a decadent structure.On a level, La muerte casts the illusion of condemning the existing political structure: the entrenched PRI system that from the onset of the cultural phase of the Revolution sought total control and power over the people. La muerte condemns the Mexican post-revolution's social situation in part; nonetheless, at a subliminal level, it endorses the color divide imposed since the colonial period.Through a close review, the Afrocentric reader is forced to question the authenticity of the character ascribed to Cruz as an African Mexican in modern Mexico, particularly in light of the prevalent criollo mentality that loathed even a drop of \\"visible\\" blackness in a person.Had racism subsided in Mexico by 1920 as to allow a visibly black person to rise \\"freely\\" from rags to riches? How many visibly black Mexicans can be found as tycoons in the Mexico of the first half of the twentieth century? If \\"it always has been an object of the novel to tell the other version of history, particularly starting after the nineteeth century\\" as Carlos Fuentes has declared (G&uuml;emes 2), would it not have been more true to life to have made the antihero a criollo?Why make a \\"pelado\\" (47, 276) or mestizo of African descent the villain? Is the novel repeating and reinforcing the white myth of the \\"evil nature\\" of African blood? Is La muerte reintroducing and reinforcing the Eurocentric colonial stereotypes of los hijos de la chingada and the pelados found in La raza c&oacute;smica, El perfil, and \\"Los hijos\\"?Snead clarifies that mass-produced images have political, ideological, and psychological effects upon an audience's beliefs and actions (132). Also, he states \\"Stereotypes ultimately connect to form larger complexes of symbols and connotations. These codes then begin to form a kind of 'private conversation' among themselves without needing to refer back to the real world for their facticity\\" (141).La muerte gets close to the origins of chingar and the pelado. It nearly makes the connections between the mestizo, his language, his worldview and his African heritage. This may have enabled a fuller explanation of the Mexican character and his sense of humor as early as 1962.However, La muerte continues the same criollo aesthetic found in La raza c&oacute;smica, El perfil, and \\"Los hijos.\\" Cruz is characterized as a mestizo who, notwithstanding, or because of his visible African heritage, the knowledge of his birth, and his having been raised in an African Mexican environment until the age of fourteen, has virtually repressed his black legacy.It is a sign of indecency for Cruz \\"to live and die in [the] Negro shack\\" of his lineage and cultural heritage (276). La muerte whitens Cruz' by making him particularly proud of his criollo identity. Cruz expresses that he has conquered \\"decency\\" for his children. He expects them to thank him for making them \\"respectable people,\\" and keeping them out of the \\"Negro shack\\" (276).According to Snead, a work \\"becomes 'propaganda' and no longer merely 'fiction' when its aim is to introduce or reinforce a set of political power relationships between social groups\\" (140). In La muerte, Mexicans whose African lineage is openly identified are characterized as rootless (302), backward, submissive, tame and servile (302-03). They are caricatured as simple, as jungle beings (302) with an endless sexual appetite (279, 288-89), as possessing an innate musicality (288), and as having a natural predisposition to relax (287).This is remarkable when juxtaposed to criollo portrayal. Criollos are conceived as civilized (50), rooted to the land (48); as history makers (35), with an identity (50); as having feelings, ideals, and even as being chivalrous at the moment of defeat (50). This perception echoes El perfil's notions about criollo supremacy. The Spaniards in La muerte are capable of understanding, and of sacrificing body and soul for family and beliefs (50, 54, 103).Snead explains, \\"'Codes' are not singular portrayals of one thing or another, but larger complex relationships\\" (142). He exposes how these relationships, under the will, imagination and ideological slant of the narrative maker, may \\"present fantasy or an ideal world that has nothing to do with the real world\\" as if it were the real world (134).According to Lanin A. Gyurko, Cruz is developed as a \\"single character, powerful and complex enough to be convincing, not only as an individual but also as a national symbol\\" (30). In La muerte, this national character is imagined by his uncle as a black Moses (285). But paradoxically, and as if marked by his African blood, Cruz is constructed as an innate traitor, a despicable being: polygamous (122), immoral, greedy (15-16), treacherous (24-25), cowardly, and corrupted (16, 21, 50, 56).Cruz is incapable of caring about high revolutionary ideals, or country (56). He is the opposite of Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Tecla Morelos y Pav&oacute;n (Vargas) and Vicente \\"el negro\\" Guerrero, each a Black Moses. In Gyurko's words: \\"Cruz is literally an hijo de la chingada. Violation gave him life -rape of a slave woman by his father, Anastasio Menchaca; violation pervades his life, and violation (mental and physical) characterizes his death\\" (35). For Gyurko, on the symbolic level, Cruz is a metaphor for the Frozen Revolution and a nation that \\"slavishly imitates the value systems of European and North American nations\\" (39).Cruz is rich, powerful and married into a criollo family. However, it is made obvious that these \\"attributes,\\" per se, cannot remove the color line that marginalizes him throughout the story. He enters a marriage where the color divide is kept and cultured within the relationship (103). All the power Artemio Cruz has is not enough to free his conscience from the knowledge of being \\"the Other,\\" even at home with his wife and daughter (31-32).This very power, impressive physique and ruthless character, given him so lavishly, mark Artemio Cruz and make him stand out as a whitened black (33). Cruz never gains control of his life, although a millionaire. This creates the illusion that the criollos he wishes to emulate are naturally superior to him and those he is the prototype of, nonwhite Mexicans (32, 33, 50). Snead identifies mythification, marking and omission as three particular tactics to forge and perpetuate black stereotypes (143). He points out that to make whites appear more civilized, powerful and important, they are shown in contrast to subservient blacks. La muerte does this.Lunero, Cruz' Uncle, is a well-tamed and criollo-loyal young Mulatto who quietly accepts his fate (284). He is still in bondage at the beginning of the twentieth century (295). He silently tolerates the sexual rape and physical abuse of his sister, Isabel, Cruz' mother, by the master, Cruz' father. Lunero helps Isabel during Cruz' birth (314). But he does nothing and stays quiet when the master, a known rapist of nonwhite women (229), beats Isabel with a stick and runs her off the property in his presence (286, 306). Lunero is unbelievably good and incapable of running away. He invents work to support his masters' household (285, 303) when they have become poor due to the war. He is very protective of Cruz and takes care of him for fourteen years even though, or perhaps due to Cruz' being a lighter black.Jackson points out that discrimination, based on place of origin, color of skin, social class, and religious beliefs, has been instrumental in developing a narrative that depicts black people in \\"one dimension racist images,\\" as purely sensuous, as merely musical savages waiting to be saved from their supposed incapacity to reason, and from their entirely emotional realm (Black Image 46)Lunero is narrated as having the rhythm in him (287-88). Every afternoon he sings to young Cruz the songs brought by Lunero's father from Santiago de Cuba \\"when the war broke out and the families moved to Veracruz along with their servants\\" (286). He is a prisoner of fear and nostalgia. He fears the New World: the sierra, the Amerindians, and the plateau (302); and is nostalgic of the continent where \\"one like him would be able to get lost in the jungle and say that he had returned\\" (302).Jackson exhibits that Latin American literature, guided by the white aesthetic, caricatures blacks, presents blacks as easily corruptible, with an endless sexual appetite, as possessing an innate musicality, as having a natural predisposition to relax, as inherently drunkard, as polygamous, as irresponsible parents and as devil-like (Black Image 49-59).According to Snead:The history that whites have made (...) empties black skin of any historical or material reference, except as former slaves. The notion of the eternal black \\"character\\" is invented to justify the enforced economic disadvantage that we enjoy (or don't enjoy)(...). [B]lacks' behavior is portrayed as being unrelated to the history that whites have trapped them in. Let me repeat: that behavior is being portrayed as something static, enduring, and unchangeable, unrelated to the history that whites have trapped them in. Blacks are seen as ahistorical. (139)Isabel Cruz or Cruz Isabel, Artemio Cruz' mother, is a woman without a fixed name that appears in the narrative only as a vessel to bring another hijo de la chingada into the world (314). Although she appears fleetingly, she leaves the impression of being nothing more than a victim, a fearful presence incapable of making a sound even at the moment of delivery. Jackson has found that even in cases where blacks are defended, they are depicted, among other ways, as backward, submissive, tame, and servile (\\"Black Phobia\\" 467).In La muerte, African Mexicans seem to inhabit Veracruz, and not to extend beyond the sierra. The hacienda of Cocuya is full of blacks (295), \\"Negroid\\" people (289), and \\"... clear eyed Mulattoes with skin the color of pine nuts\\" who were offspring of the \\"Indian and Mulatto women that went around bearing them\\" (289). One learns about blacks \\"brought to the tropical plantations with their hair straightened by the daring Indian women that offered their hairless sexual parts as a victory redoubt over the curly haired race\\" (279).In contrast to La muerte's narrative, it is well documented that black Africans of the Diaspora were taken all over New Spain wherever there was mining, farming, ranching, factories, domestic work, or transportation of goods. History shows that African Mexicans, the infamous mezclas, became the majority of today's mestizos (Aguirre Beltr&aacute;n 276).History confirms that the mezclas or mestizos of African descent fought valiantly under the name of \\"chinacos\\" and \\"pintos\\" during the War of Independence (1810-1821) (Riva Palacio's Calvario; D&iacute;az, xviii). It archives that later, they fought against the French and defeated them in Puebla (5 May 1862). History records that the chinaco and pinto liberals followed the French into the interior of the country and, against all odds, defeated and expelled them from Mexican national territory three years later.\\"The omission of the black [heroes], then, has meant the presence of the stereotype\\" (Snead 147). La muerte's reintroduction and reinforcement of black stereotypes does not end there. Cruz' daughter, Teresa, who is a mestiza of African descent as well, is portrayed as oblivious of her African lineage. They are ideologically whitened. She appears as happily Americanized, going shopping, eating waffles and talking about North American movie stars (22-23, 25). La muerte suggest that post-revolution corruption in Mexico is tied to miscegenation and that mestizaje, of the type embodied by Cruz and his lineage, had a negative effect on the Mexican Revolution (50).In conclusion, La muerte is a text where the modern Mexican nation is still being narrated in accordance to the \\"cosmic race\\" creed; a belief that the \\"improvement\\" of the nation rested on the cleansing, by mixing out, of all black African traces of the population. The novel perpetuates the myth of whitening that underlines the ideology of mestizaje in Mexico, as in other parts of the Americas. La muerte contributes to the erasure of the path that leads to the African family tree, of Mexican mestizaje. Just as La raza c&oacute;smica, El perfil, and \\"Los hijos,\\" among other pillars of the imagined modern Mexican nation, La muerte reproduces and reinforces the confusion of the origins of the Mexican mestizo and his culture: \\"a r&iacute;o revuelto ganancia de pescadores.\\"La muerte forges and perpetuates stereotypes of black people and their daughters and sons. It thereby codifies them as exhibited under Snead's perspective. The novel marks blacks, mythifies whites and omits mentioning, under a just light, Mexicans of African lineage who do not desire to be whitened and are not servile, tame, submissive, or backward. This renders the African Mexican ahistorical. Just as other Latin American writings studied by Jackson, La muerte replaces the historical image of prominent African Mexicans with caricatures."},{"Title":"Joe Pass Chord Solos: For Guitar, Vibes & All Keyboard Instruments","review":"These are not \\"Chord Melodies\\".

Every apparition which the Church has approved has typically been countered by him by false ones around the same time and place. The Church can tell the difference.

I wasn't blown away, and I wasn't disgusted, either. It was an enjoyable work of fiction, but rather low on romance.First of all, Grayson takes several chapters setting the stage for her characters. The reader has to plow through a lot of plot before the hero and heroine are even in the same room. Apart from a shared past, there's no interaction between them for a very long time.And even after she finally has them in the same house, they still don't spend much time interacting. The author focused on so many other storylines, such as: Baird's reluctance to be a father; Baird's newfound commitment to the ranch and life of exile that was forced upon him; Ardith's determination to do right by the children, even though she feels so inadequate as a temporary step-parent; life on the frontier; a torturous secret in Baird's past...etc, etc. Romance is at the very bottom of the list. Yes, the other storylines were interesting and well-written, but I bought this book because I wanted to read a romance novel, not a family saga.After a while I was so frustrated waiting for the romance to start that I cheated and skimmed ahead to see if things would pick up later. If it did, I didn't see it. Even more than halfway through the book, the romance wasn't really moving. Not that I need them to be kissing right away (in fact, I hate rushed romances), but the snail's pace made the book drag, and I couldn't muster enough enthusiasm to keep going.As I have one other of Grayson's books on my to-be-read shelf, I'll give her one more try. But this book certainly wasn't one to get her on my \\"auto-buy\\" list.Whether or not you enjoy COLOR OF THE WIND will depend on what you look for in a romance. If you like your stories laid-back, where romance is a very small part of the book that \\"spices it up\\", then you might enjoy it. But if you want romance to be the main focus of the plot, you're going to be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Color of the Wind","review":"Baird Northcross is a remittance man - the son of English aristocracy sent to the wilds of Wyoming Territory in exile after being responsible for the death of his cousin and in general a disappointment to his family. His aristocratic upbringing has done little to prepare him to run Sugar Creek, the family's cattle ranch. Cocky and standoffish, Baird is the antithesis of your usual hero. Awaiting the arrival of his wife and children, he is shocked to discover his sister-in-law, Ardith Merritt accompanying his offspring, bringing the sad news of his wife's death.Ardith, a children's book author and illustrator living in Boston, has no intention of staying in Wyoming. All she plans to do is to simply deliver her two nephews and niece to their father. But when she arrives at Sugar Creek and finds Baird isn't prepared for his children, she has no choice but to stay until they're settled in. She does so reluctantly after all, Baird had betrayed her years ago when, on the day they were to wed, he ran off to Gretna Green with her younger sister. Besides, she is more than just a little bit interested in her publisher and friend, Gavin Rawlinson.Baird is as ill-prepared to deal with his children as he is with the ranch. He has never been around them much in fact, wasn't even present at their births - his children being named China, Khymer, and Durban - after the places their father was when they were born. He finds Ardith rigid and cold, staid and proper -- not the fun young woman he once knew.Ardith isn't quite prepared to deal with the children either. She has little or no experience and is always afraid of saying the wrong thing or doing something that's not quite right. But she comes to care very much for them - and eventually, to her surprise, to the wild west and to the children's father.Baird is an enigma - from the English aristocracy he has never been content to remain just from the manor born, he is an adventurer. The wild west, much to his surprise, fits that bill just fine. While it is clear he cares for his children, he has no idea just how to show his affection. The turning point in Baird's personality for this reviewer was when he was so supportive of Ardith's drawings.As expansive in its reader appeal as the wild west in which it's set, COLOR OF THE WIND is a story to savor. Elizabeth Grayson is one of the best historical writers today. Her characterizations are top rate and her storytelling ability keeps the reader turning pages at a frantic pace. She details the cattle round-up with such skill the reader gets such a sense of place they can almost smell the cattle and feel the dirt and grime. Adding to the rich texture of this book were Ardith's letters back to her publisher in Boston and the appearance of Hunter and Cassandra from Grayson's previous book, SO WIDE THE SKY. Writing a review for this book was difficult in a way, I was so excited to share the story, I could have easily made it 2 to 3 times as long. But this is a book readers should experience for themselves; a mere review simply cannot do it justice. Grayson never disappoints. I am chomping at the bit for her next book!"},{"Title":"Color of the Wind","review":"A story of redemption, about how people can grow and change even when they feel their life is at a standstill, this was an absolutely marvelous read, a definite keeper. All the characters were very believable, an intruiging mix of good and bad, and their struggle for growth and meaning in their lives made you root for them every step of the way. I especially like the realism in the situations they faced, and the fact that not every conflict was neatly vanquished and tucked away. There are things these people will still struggle with, but the faith and love they share as a family will see them through. It reminded me a bit of Summer's End, by Kathleen Seidel, another good book about families."},{"Title":"Color of the Wind","review":"Contains some spoilers. I think this is a story that will work only in books and not much in real life. I know it is fiction and anything is possible, but it was very hard for me to believe the main characters. The story is about a man who ran away with the heroine's sister on the day of their wedding,and leaves her to face shame in 19th century England. Now 16 yrs and three kids later, the hero a recent widower comes in contact with her again and the story that follows is an apparent one of forgiveness, redemption and second chances.I found the hero quite pathetic and needy,and could not believe he really loved her. It seemed more like she was his crutch for everything,was emotionally and mentally dependent on her AND uses her for his security. I had a hard time trying to digest the fact that the heroine falls in love with him. I can understand her when she forgives him for the past, but nothing else. I don't know any woman that will get back with a guy that humiliated her in front of the whole world, showed her clearly that she was not his choice and in fact tells her he couldn't help it because her sister was his grand passion as he was hers. Basically she was chopped liver. But now that the wife is dead, and he needs the heroine he is in love again. I was rather happy that there were not many intimate scenes as I absolutely did not believe in this story, and didn't like it very much."},{"Title":"Color of the Wind","review":"In 1882 Boston, Ardith Merritt's sister-in-law dies while giving birth to a stillborn child. Her spouse Baird Northcross has never been home for his wife and three children. Currently, his aristocratic English family has exiled him to manage a ranch in the Wyoming Territory. Though she dreads seeing Baird who deserted her for her sibling, Ardith escorts his three children west so they can live with their father. Many years ago in England, nobleman Baird left fellow aristocrat Ardith at the altar and eloped with her sister Ariel.Initially, the arrival of Ardith and her entourage of his two sons and daughter shocks Baird. However, the reprobate soon falls in love with the ranch and not long after that his family and Ardith. Though she returns his love, she has never forgotten his betrayal of her. She plans to return east once the children are settled unless Baird can convince he otherwise.Elizabeth Grayson demonstrates a graceful skill in scribing an exciting western romance. The story line takes two transplanted Victorian aristocrats with an ugly past and moves them to the Wyoming Territory. Ardith is a genuine heroine who will be well received by sub-genre fans. The metamorphosis of Baird turns the plot into an arousing love story. The lead characters are a warm duo and the children add to their personal dilemmas in a realistic but charming way. The support cast provides insight to the English aristocracy's lifestyle in the American frontier. Though the treatment of wild horses is real but brutal, the COLOR OF THE WIND will garner Ms. Grayson numerous fans and much deserved regard.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Color of the Wind","review":"Romance readers and western fans alike will enjoy this moving story of courage, selflessness, and love, set against the wild, rugged grandeur of 1882 Wyoming. A powerful, sweeping story with well-drawn -- and all-too-human -- characters, Color of the Wind is wonderfully written. I loved the kids! Kudos!"},{"Title":"Color of the Wind","review":"All the sweep and drama of Montana itself characterize this ambitious, heartfelt romance of two mismatched people putting together a family with love and commitment.

Unknown to him, his wife has died and left their three children in the care of her sister. Ardith Merrit vows to keep a deathbed promise that she will deliver the children safely to their father. A promise made all the more difficult because years earlier, Baird left Ardith almost literally at the alter to elope with her sister.This is a &quot;western&quot;, and a &quot;romance&quot; of the best kind. Baird, Ardith, and all the secondary characters, are complex,interesting, and, best of all, completely believable.A richly textured story by a gifted writer who has done her period homework. Ms. Grayson cares about her characters, and it shows. Even the children, so often the weak point in a novel, actually think, talk, and behave like real children. How refreshing!COLOR OF THE WIND gives you a colorful, accurate look at life on a Montana cattle ranch in the 1880's,wonderful characters with genuine pesonalities, and a story of redemption, commitment, and second chances. All of this presented with humor, action, and great romance.Congratulations to Eliazabeth Grayson, and a big Thank You!"},{"Title":"The life of Jesus","review":"This has got to be the best book I've ever read. It's an absolute masterpiece. If you don't already own this book, you really must pick it up. It's a classic of classics and continues to be controversial even to this day.Renan presents us with a brilliant biography of Jesus, but one in which he's a mere man, not a god. He paints us a picture of a talented and wise man who gets caught up in the fervor he creates and provides us with logical explanations for the \\"miracles\\" that were said to surround him. This book created an enormous stir at the time it was written and still ruffles feathers even now.Renan certainly treads on sacred cows, but they are cows that deserve to be treaded upon. Of all the divisive factors, religion has been the main and most persistent one. Religion has greatly hampered the advancement of humanity and caused a great deal of suffering, privation, and death. It also kept women oppressed for millennia, and we are still working to undo that damage. It's only been in the past century that great strides have been made to improve the lot of women, and I believe that religion has been the main culprit to blame for the inequities that women have faced for so long.This book is a body blow to traditional Christian dogma and a supremely original work. It's a definite must-read."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus","review":"There are some books that everyone should read, and this is one of them. The idea was so fresh, and controversial, for its time and remains intriguing to this day. Renan was a brilliant and courageous man who dared to do what no one else had done before. He insisted on writing an unthinkable biography on Jesus, treating him like any other man, and critiquing the Bible like any other book. Naturally, a firestorm ensued. The book still causes firestorms today, but it also has been very influential. It's been an important steppingstone that's inspired other works, though I believe Renan's work is the best of them all. The original always is. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus","review":"Ernest Renan (1823-1892) was a French philosopher and writer, who was best known for this 1863 book. The book presents a very (some would say \\"excessively\\") \\"emotional\\" telling of the life of Jesus (remember that it was written at the height of the \\"Romantic\\" era in literature), and it became a best-seller in France.The book was intended as the first book of a history of the origin of Christianity, of which this volume \\"treats of the particular fact which has served as the starting-point of the new religion, and is entirely filled by the sublime person of the Founder.\\"As an example of the \\"emotional\\" character of his writing, here is a scene from the crucifixion: \\"The sky was dark, and the earth, as in all the environs of Jerusalem, dry and gloomy. For a moment, according to certain narratives, his heart failed him; a cloud hid from him the face of his Father; he endured an agony of despair a thousand times more acute than all his torture.\\"Here are some other representative quotations from the book:\\"That the Gospels are in part legendary, is evident, since they are full of miracles and of the supernatural; but legends have not all the same value.\\"\\"I beg those who think that I have placed an exaggerated confidence in narratives in great part legendary ... To what would the life of Alexander be reduced if it were confined to that which is materially certain?\\"\\"We do not say, 'Miracles are impossible.' We say, 'Up to this time a miracle has never been proved.'\\"\\"Jesus despised all religion which was not of the heart ...

How much longer will we continue to point fingers at others, harm each other, and limit ourselves in the name of a god? This is the 21st century. We're only just beginning to see the wonders we can achieve (and might have achieved ages ago if religious leaders hadn't kept insisting that the world was flat and viciously persecuting anyone who decreed otherwise).Renan was cruelly persecuted for penning his masterwork on the life of Jesus as a mere man. Now that we live in more enlightened times, it's easy to forget what a fearsome and powerful adversary the church used to be and how ruthlessly it dealt with anyone who crossed it.I strongly recommend this book.

He is THE, or at least one of the most important founders of the secular interpretation of Jesus, amazingly derived essentially from John's Gospel rather than from the Synoptics. His book is an important landmark to have, if not on our bookshelves, at least in our memories. For the happy few, it's easier as always to read in the original French rather than the translated version. Writing styles have also considerably changed since the romantic literature era. And many ideas and discoveries have been made since Renan's mid-nineteenth century days and he would have loved all the material disclosed a hundred years later by the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library as well as all the archaeology related in the \\"Bible Unearthed\\". The book may seem a bit outdated today, but what insight and intellectual courage!Aware of many unresolved problems, Renan prophesized that the correct interpretation of the bible would come from a layman using a critical approach and is devoid of any desire to destroy the dogma or to protect it. If we follow his recommendations, we have to look for someone who wants to discover the real meaning (I'm sure that the Jesus of the Gospels is just as alien to Church readings as to scholarly revisions) of these ancient texts and who is neither a Christian apologist nor an already convinced atheist. Who will square the circle?"},{"Title":"The life of Jesus","review":"I believe this book should be on every intellectual's shelf.

He attempted to write a life of Christ based not on the perspective that he was God but rather a man. This consists of trying to put what happened in the context of Jewish and Roman Society at the begining of the Christian era.He portrays Jesus as a spiritual leader who rejected orthodox judiasm and was killed by conservative believers who felt the order of their religion was threatened. He explains some of the miracles by coming up with mundane explanations. Thus Lazarus might have been simply sick rather than dead.Historically the book was of importance in developing a secular understanding of the Gospels. However it is now out of date as many more questions have been raised about the content and consistency of the gospels and what appears to be historical and mythical in the life of Jesus. The book is reasonably easy to read but is written in a archaic style that does not read easily today and it also is reflective of descriptions of Jewish people that would now be seen as racist."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus","review":"This book is recommended by conservative Christian teacher, the late Dr. J. Vernon McGee, in his 5-year program called \\"Through the Bible.\\" This free online and radio program is a verse-by-verse journey through the entire Bible in 5 years. From humble beginnings, the program is now broadcast in over 100 languages and dialects, all over the world. The program is beginning again as I write this review and Renan is recognized as a brilliant author. Here is a quote from Dr. McGee:\\"Renan, the French skeptic, made an attack on the Word of God, as you know; yet he wrote a \\"Life of Christ.\\" His book is divided into two sections, one is the historical section, the other is the interpretation of the life of Christ. As far as the first part is concerned, there probably has never been a more brilliant life of Christ written by any man. But his interpretation of it is positively absurd. It could have been done better by a twelve-year-old Sunday school boy. What is the explanation of that? Well, the Spirit of God does not teach you history or give you facts that you can dig out for yourself; a very clever mind can dig out those. But the interpretation is altogether different. The Spirit of God has to do the interpreting, and He alone must be the Teacher to lead us and guide us into all truth.

There is such wisdom here but one must be discerning too. All mans works are not Scripture so walk carefully here. I think that Judaism is a religion of works from my own personal study but Abraham was accepted by God for his faith. Orthodox Jews see Christ as a bastard son of Joseph and have totally missed it. If they were to read and understand the New Testament as the final and finished Word, they would know Jesus as their Messiah and not the former. He is their Messiah and would to God that they would come to believe that soon so that their lives would not be so filled with sorrow due to unbelief.

Most of the items included in the book are very brief, they often consist of only a few words (e.g. menus items that were translated in a humorous fashion) or a single phrase. Very few of the selections are as lengthy as a complete paragraph. Thus, the book can be sampled and skimmed in bite size morsels, and it is a wonderful item to be placed in locations where people pick it up, get a good laugh by reading a few selections and then return to it at their convenience (e.g waiting rooms in offices, subway briefcases, coffee tables, and magazine buckets in bathrooms).The author has segmented the items into twelve categories; the majority involve inappropriate translations in some context, such as the suggestion at a Bangkok dry cleaner to \\"Drop your trousers here for best results\\" or the Swedish ad that \\"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux\\". However, there are also some sections that involve American misuse of our own native language, such as the sign in a hospital maternity ward that advised \\"no children allowed\\", or the warning in a Pennsylvania cemetery that \\"persons are prohibited from picking flowers from any but their own graves\\". One of my favorites was the Ohio shop that proudly advertised \\"We buy junk and sell antiques\\".Of course, the quality of the entries are uneven, as is inevitable in a collection of this type, Some are clever and will make you laugh out loud, some are quite cute and will occasion a smile, some involve words that are inappropriate and quite embarrassing in the context in which they are used, and a few seem to not deserve being included. But probably each reader's judgment will differ with regard to the level of humor of the individual items included in this collection. This is also a great book for sharing with others. I was reading one section while watching TV with my wife, and found myself frequently reading the more enjoyable items out loud to her. And when I was reading it alone, I'd on occasion feel compelled to note the items that I wanted to share with others in the future. While the pieces are too long to include in this review, my favorite section is definitely \\"Ads with Impact\\", written to appeal English speaking customers by people who often have just enough knowledge of our language to mangle the impression that they are trying to create.So while this is not a great piece of literature, nor a work of wonderful insights, and certainly not filled with action, adventure and romance, Jane O'Boyle has managed to assemble an enjoyable collection of fractured English signs, movie marquees, advertisements, product names and other miscellaneous items that certainly approaches a four star level of enjoyment.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Free Drinks for Ladies with Nuts","review":"This is a cute, stocking-stuffer sort of book that will make anyone who reads it giggle uncontrollably.

He shows how these firms supply themselves with capital, how the men who comprise them are motivated, how organized intelligence has replaced ownership as the source of power in the modern enterprise. He shows how the market has declined as a guiding influence in economic life, to be replaced in substantial measure by planned decision as to what will be produced, at what prices and for whom.Government in the industrial state, Mr. Galbraith makes clear can be understood only in light of the needs and goals of modern large-scale organization. And this profoundly shapes the prospect for trade unions, political parties, education and the larger culture itself. Only as we see the goals of the industrial system in a clear light will we avoid the danger of subordinating too much of life to their service. Only then will we exploit the opportunities inherent in well-being....The publisher's description goes on to herald The New Industrial State as Galbraith's \\"most important book.\\" The implicit comparison is with his earlier and immensely popular work, The Affluent Society. But the two books are quite closely related, as Galbraith mentions in the foreword: \\"I must again remind the reader that this book had its origins alongside The Affluent Society. It stands in relation to that book as a house to a window. This is the structure; the earlier book allowed the first glimpse inside.\\"And indeed, that is largely the truth. This book provides a framework for understanding Corporate America; its real and public purposes, its organization, history, strengths, and weaknesses. Surprisingly little of the book seems aged (of course the book exludes all mention of the last forty years, and the Soviet references seem a bit antiquated), and much of it, with minimal substitution (e.g. \\"War on Terror\\" for \\"Cold War\\" as the bogeyman for justifying the massive military outlays which feed the industrial system) is eerily applicable to the early 21st century.All of that said, this book is not for everyone. It is quite dense (especially the first third), and most of us will need a dictionary close at hand. This is a book which requires hard thinking and more than one reading. But if your purpose is to understand the type of economy we really live in, your efforts will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith didn't respect the literary conventions of economics. He didn't express himself in math, he made sweeping generalizations about society (not always backed by strong evidence), and he freely drew on the insights of history, sociology, and politics, paying little heed to interdisciplinary boundaries. For that reason, many economists looked down their noses at him. And for that reason, his books are still in print and enjoyed by readers decades after they first appeared. Galbraith was more than an economist. He was a great social critic, a great debunker of cant, and a superb prose stylist. He was the Veblen of post-World War II America.He was at the top of his powers when he wrote \\"The New Industrial State\\" in the 1960s. The book came as close as anything did to summarizing the Galbraithian \\"system.\\" Parts of it are outdated, such as the assertion that financial markets have little influence on big corporations, or the strained argument that the American and Soviet economic systems were \\"converging.\\" Other parts, however, are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago, such as the critique of advertising and consumerism, or the analysis of how our gigantic defense industry shapes policy and influences the Pentagon. In a time when the Federal Reserve is bailing out banks and scrambling to protect the economy from the miscalculations of the financial sector, it's good to be reminded that the private sector looks to government to keep the economy on a even keel, no matter what the official ideology of the private sector may be.Most of all, \\"The New Industrial State\\" displayed Galbraith's genius for stepping back and asking big questions. These continue to haunt economics, even though textbook writers bury them in footnotes. Why DO we treat GDP is an adequate measure of social welfare? Why DO we choose to consume higher productivity in the form of goods rather than leisure? Why DOES our pedagogy emphasize \\"perfect competition\\" when the economy is dominated by big firms? Why DO we assume that workers and managers are motivated solely by pecuniary considerations? And on and on.\\"The New Industrial State\\" is a trove of intellectual riches, expressed in masterful and witty prose. Every undergraduate economics student should read it. So should every educated citizen. It's a 20th century classic."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"This is a superb book. It is a book, however, that has become dated. Its datedness should not dissuade potential readers. The datedness of \\"The New Industrial State\\" has only changed the books relevance and importance. When the book was first published in 1967, it accurately described how the then modern corporation functioned, its power structure, and the motivations of individuals who guided the decision making and development of the corporation.This book should be understood to be part of a publication trilogy, starting with Galbraith's \\"Affluent Society,\\" \\"The Industrial State,\\" and \\"Economics and the Public Purpose.\\" In my opinion \\"The Industrial State\\" is the apex of the series. It is however, the most technical of the three books. The \\"Affluent Society\\" being the most accessible.For economic academia the book was revolutionary, because it radically challenged microeconomic and macroeconomic textbook accounts of markets and market adjustments. Microeconomics was challenged on several fronts. The most important being the motivation of the \`power brokers' of the (then) modern corporation, what Galbraith called the \\"technostructure.\\" The technostructure is a complex and imperfectly defined \\"collective\\" of (especially) \\"technical\\" and \\"specialized\\" staff members at the midrange management level. It was the decision making of the technical and specialized staff members who really determined the development direction of the (then) modern corporation. This is revolutionary because the motivation of these staffers, or technostructure, was not one of profit, but instead \\"identity\\" with the group/staff and corporation and (marginal) \\"adaptation\\" of the company's goal toward their own.At a macroeconomic level Galbraith argues that it was not his beloved Keynesian interventionism which stabilized the post-WWII economy, but the massive capital contracts the U.S. government had with industrial capital (e.g. steel, rubber, chemical, etc.), mainly though the Pentagon and NASA. These contracts allowed for industrial companies to build inventories without worrying about sales or the business cycle.Galbraith argued, the (then) modern corporation is mainly concerned with its own stability and longevity. Stability and longevity required the corporation to become as enormous as possible. The enormity of the corporation's size required \\"planning\\" become its primary development activity. The planning goes on (1) between technical and specialized staffers and midrange and upper-management, e.g. human resource planning for internal consistency; (2) for research and development and technological growth; (3) for price stability, marketing, and reliability in demand, establishing external stability and consumer relevance; (4) for balance within the corporation, via collective bargaining with worker unions and predictability of payroll costs; and (5) for contracts with the State.Small business and entrepreneurial corporations far outnumbered the several 100 enormous corporations. The actual economic and business activity was dominated by the minority big/enormous corporations. This meant the American system was dual in institutional structure. One sector where big business predominated and the dynamics of \\"planning\\" ran supreme. The other where small business and the dynamics of the profit motivate ran supreme. This was a situation that businessmen well understand, but that policy economists and politicians failed to appreciate the full relevance and policy implications.In its fortieth anniversary publication, the institutional structure of the American economy has radically transformed. The technostructure is still necessary, but its power has been greatly, perhaps absolutely, diminished.Technological shifts and socioeconomic policy shifts have moved history and the world beyond Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State.\\" However, the book's importance has not been diminished, but merely shifted. The book's importance is no longer in describing the institutional structure of American capitalism, but understanding from were the now current system evolved.To draw a Darwinian metaphor, \\"The New Industrial State\\" is the missing link between the \\"just-in-time\\" production corporation and the entrepreneurial capitalists of Adam Smith (1776) thru Karl Marx (1867). \\"Just-in-time\\" production corporations contract significant portions (if not all) of their production from subcontractors. The prevailing role of the \\"planning\\" of The New Industrial State has been demoted. The corporation does not have to plan because a subcontractor can almost always be found, the subcontractors planning is only as long as the contract with a Wal-mart, or some other mega-corporation. This institutional shift toward \\"just-in-time\\" production does not make the technostructure obsolete, but it does diminish their power role within the corporation.It will be Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State\\" which will allow us to fully understand the \\"Post-Industrial State.\\"The \\"New Industrial State\\" should receive a wide and new generation of readers. It is an important book to understand a previous era, and a specific relationship between citizens, workers, business, and the public sector, a type of symbiotic embeddedness between each group. It is also an important book to understand how that specific relationship has be reconfigured, generating a type of disembeddedness between citizens/workers and business/public sector. \\"The New Industrial State\\" helps us understand why big moneyed lobbyists have come to dominate Washington, and how it could be, and was, different."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State\\" is a hallmark in economic thought. His work is both an extension and reformulation of his previous work \\"The Affluent Society\\". Galbraith spots fundamental contradictions throughout the modern field of economics. As always Galbraith is willing to attack all economists, liberals and conservatives alike, in search of the truthIn \\"The New Industrial State\\" Galbraith begins by looking at the modern composition of production. With small exception the mature corporation has become the central producer in the industrialized world. The mature corporation no longer seeks to maximize profits. It seeks, first, survival and, second, absolute growth. This means that corporations are held to maintain a minimum set of profits in order to prevent external influence on future decisions. Maximizing profits, and therefore increasing risk, is discouraged because with greater risk comes a greater chance of failing to maintain a minimum level of profit. After a minimum level of profit has been achieved it is the goal of the mature corporation to grow. By growing it gains greater influence over the economy and society at large.The reason for the rise of the mature corporation is because of technology. As production processes become more complex a greater need for planning becomes necessary. Without control of supply and demand it is extremely difficult to plan for a long production schedule (ex: 5 years). If, say, disposable income or consumer desires were to change then the mature corporation would fall into risk of bankruptcy or, at the very least, external finance (which threatens autonomy).In order to minimize risk the mature corporation must try to control supply and demand. The control of supply is done through a large degree of bargaining power with suppliers of material and through the use of unions. (Ironically, unions have become docile to the demands of the mature corporation and further its will.) In order to control demand the mature corporation relies on the government to stabilize aggregate demand. On the micro level the mature corporation manufactures artificial wants through marketing and public perception. While the mature corporation does not exhibit complete and total control over supply or demand they control both to a large extent.The reason why the mature corporation can exhibit such behavior is because of the division between management and ownership. The stockholders in a mature corporation have no input on management's decisions. The board of directors, indirectly chosen by management, choose the mature corporation's management. The traditional hierarchy of management is blatantly false due to the needs of teamwork and division of labor. Instead what is created is a \\"technostructure\\". It is the (headless) technostructure that inadvertently controls the economy. Very little of the United State's economy can be considered market based. The vast majority of the United States is a planned economy.According to Galbraith, \\"Increasing it will be recognized that the mature corporation, as it develops, becomes part of the larger administrative complex associated with the state. In time the line between the two will disappear... Though this recognition will not be universally welcomed, it will be healthy.. the autonomy of the technostructure is, to repeat yet again, a functional necessity of the industrial system.\\" (CHXXXV p.393)"},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"Not an excellent economist. Galbraith's style and ease of readability is almost second to none but there is little substance in this book. I would recommend Mises, Rothbard, or Hayek to any interested in economics. I will say this however, you can't know what you disagree with, nor why you do, if you don't read their work.With that said though the rating I gave was low I do think it is a necessary purchase and read so that one can make themselves familiar with many of the flawed arguments they will come into contact with.A biased or selective reader is a limited in knowledge."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"The order was placed at the same time as another book which arrived 2 weeks quicker despite being shipped at the same time.

It stands in relation to that book as a house to a window. This is the structure; the earlier book allowed the first glimpse inside.\\"In the first chapter on \\"The Imperatives of Power,\\" he states that \\"Technology... leads to planning,\\" and ultimately \\"will require the firm to seek the help and protection of the state.\\" This is because the state can absorb the major risks, and guarantee a market for the product. (Pg. 20) Thus, in the areas of the most exacting and advanced technology, \\"the market is most completely replaced,\\" and \\"The fully planned economy ... is warmly regarded by those who know it best.\\" (Pg. 31)He invents the term \\"Technostructure\\" for the loose organization of those who bring specilialized knowledge, talent or experience to group decision-making. (Pg. 71) Mature corporations are run by this technostructure. He then opines that decentralization in Soviet-style economies does not involve a return to markets, \\"but a shift of some planning functions from the state to the firm.\\" Rather than both Soviets and U.S. returning to the market (which they have \\"outgrown\\"), \\"There is measureable convergence to the same form of planning.\\" (Pg. 108) (Obviously, this was written before 1989-1991.)He asserts that \\"Much of what is believed to be socially important is, in fact, the adaptation of social attitudes to the goal system of the technostructure.\\" (Pg. 163) The technostructure favors prevention of losses, over profit maximization (which \\"invites risk of loss\\"). (Pg. 168-169) He further argues that \\"Firms spend money to take business away from each other; all cannot succeed so the result is a standoff. The only consequence is that prices are higher and profits are lower than if by some act of government or industrial statesmanship the struggle were curbed.\\" (Pg. 203-204)He argues passionately that where there is a conflict between industrial and aesthetic priorities---e.g., defending the landscape against lumbermen---only the state can rule that \\"some patterns of consumption...are inconsistent with aesthetic goals.\\" He concludes ironically, \\"That one must pause to affirm that beauty is worth the sacrifice of some increase in the Gross National Product shows how effectively our beliefs have been accommodated to the needs of the industrial system.\\" (Pg. 350)There is much more in the book, of course; though more than 50 years old, Galbraith's arguments remain challenging and thought-provoking, and will be of considerable interest to modern progressives."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"Whether you agree with his political views or not, John K.

Keith Devlin is such a person and the editors of the British paper, The Manchester Guardian, were intelligent enough to understand that. The result is a mathematically simple-minded yet enjoyable collection of 143 brief vignettes covering mathematics and computer science.Generally, only one and one-half pages in length, most articles earn the accolade, \\"touche.\\" As many writers point out, the short piece is often the hardest to write, as every word must count. Devlin succeeds in the most difficult of arenas, in that enough background must be given so that the nave reader can understand the topic and the point is resolved with sufficient clarity. And all this is done with a minimum of formulas. While sophisticated mathematicians and computer scientists will find the material limp, this work is capable of standing on its own as a piece of entertainment.An existence proof that mathematics and computer science can be made understandable to an intelligent public that is interested, this book should be an element of every public library.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Betty Doll","review":"Prepare to shed a few tears and be uplifted by this touching story of family love. Patricia Polacco bases her reminiscence on a letter her mother, Mary Ellen, wrote shortly before her death and a cloth hand sewn doll, Betty Doll.When Mary Ellen was a child of six, her farmhouse home was destroyed by fire. The blaze also took her five dolls. Seeing how forlorn the little girl was, her mother suggested they make a new doll, which they did. Mary Ellen stitched the doll together, and embroidered its face.Soon, Mary Ellen and Betty Doll were inseparable. They snuggled in bed together during Michigan thunderstorms, attended school, and had imaginative tea parties. The pair even visited relatives in Chicago, where both were clothed in pale blue crepe de chine.As time went on Betty Doll watched Marry Ellen become an adult, eventually marry, and have children of her own. Daughter Trisha (Patricia Polacco) played with the doll herself. As Mary Ellen's grandchildren arrived, Betty Doll &quot;kissed away tears, soothed hurt knees, and was a guest at hundreds of tea parties and slumber nights.&quot;Illustrated in muted grays with Betty Doll the only bright spot on a page, this story is a reminder of the enduring bonds woven of memories and love."},{"Title":"Betty Doll","review":"Patricia Polacco has, once again, gone to her family for a story around which to hang her usual marvelous illustrations. \\"Betty Doll\\" doesn't disappoint. Polacco opens the book by telling the reader about her mother dying and about packing up her belongings and then finally going through them a year later. In some of the boxes Polacco packed up, she finds her mother's old, handmade cloth doll. Wrapped around it is the letter her mother wrote while dying of cancer.Now before you decide that this is NOT a book for children, you should know that the book overall has a joyous, shimmering quality. The story concentrates on Betty Doll's travels and adventures, with Polacco deftly portraying Betty Doll in color while all else is in handsome but quiet black-and-white tones. This brings Betty's story to the fore visually, but as far as the story itself goes, she serves as a backdrop for different generations of Polacco's family.The story is true, and it rings true. A little girl's love of her doll and the happiness she finds while playing with the doll come to the fore, as does the stability of Betty Doll throughout the changes of the little girl's life as she grows up, marries, and so on. This is a fine way to gently ease into discussing the cancer of a family member with any young child, but it is also an absorbing tale in its own right and stands ably on its own, aided by Polacco's usual impeccable illustrations."},{"Title":"Betty Doll","review":"As with many of Patricia's books, her stories touch the hearts of adults as well as children. I believe that this book, along with Pink and Say and others, is more of an intermediate to adult level book but is often marketed for young children because it is a picture book. Children could certainly grow up hearing this story and having it develop new meaning as they have their own life experiences. Betty Doll would make a wonderful gift to celebrate the love between mothers and daughters. I gave this book to my nine year old and she understood and enjoyed it very much.

Yet, I believe that it fails in appealing to its target audience of 4-8 year olds. In reading this book to my 4 1/2 year old daughter, she almost immediately tuned out.

The editing is really sloppy.Most of the yeast recipes are way off. The standard conversion for fresh yeast to active dry yeast is 2:1 -- 1 oz. of fresh equals 1/2 oz. of active dry, 2 oz. of fresh equal 1 oz. of active dry, and so on. But look at cinnamon apple bumpy bread; for 3 cups of flour, it shows the substitute for 1-1/2 oz. of fresh yeast to be 3 oz. of active dry yeast -- that's 12 packets, or 9 tablespoons. The lemon custard-filled sugar brioche shows the conversion for 1 oz. of fresh yeast to be 2 oz. of active dry -- 8 packets, or 6 tablespoons. Most of the recipes call for four times as much active dry yeast as they should. But not all of them. The conversion for the sugar-crusted Breton butter cake is correct. The hot cross buns don't use fresh yeast, but match 2 oz. of active dry -- again, 8 packets -- with 3-1/2 cups of flour. Scary.I've been baking with yeast for over 40 years, so these major errors popped right off the page for me, but a beginning baker would be left in tears.There are also errors in the keying of photographs to recipes. I looked in vain for a photo of Brooklyn blackout cake on page 142 -- which is where the recipe says it will be -- but found Gale's famous truffles instead. The blackout cake was on page 149. This is a minor problem -- no one would mistake one for the other, but it makes me wonder where the errors are in the other recipes. Are they major or minor? Are there lots of them or just a few? Did I simply defy the odds and find errors in the first few recipes I happened to look at? Understand, I wasn't looking for errors. It's almost as if they were looking for me.I feel as if I have to give each recipe a sanity check now, something I shouldn't have to do with a good cookbook.Buy it, but buy it with your eyes open."},{"Title":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible Desserts","review":"This book fails to live up to its promise.I know that people don't like negative reviews, but I want to post this to warn other readers/cooks.I always like it when cookbook reviewers spell out specific recipes tried (what worked, what didn't, favorites), because it shows that they have actually used the book for cooking and not just as eye candy. So here goes:I made the Black and Whites (classic New York cookies), but they didn't have the soft texture of what I think of as real Black and Whites. They were glorified, rather hard-textured sugar cookies. Fine, but not exciting. Epicurious.com's Black and Whites recipes is tastier and some might say, more authentic.Yesterday, I made the Marzipan Torte, and while the taste was okay, the texture was too dense and there were moist streaks where the structure of the cake had collapsed.I made no ingredient substitutions in either recipe.I'm giving this book 2 stars where I wanted to give it 1 star, because I have only tried 2 recipes, and in the case of the torte, it may have been my error. If I were to go at it again, I would use superfine sugar in the torte, and I'd make sure that the marzipan/sugar combination was in even finer crumbs before beating it in, and use a larger pan than was specified. However, I fault the recipe for not being more clear about the texture, minutes of beating time, and the ingredients (does it make a difference if one uses canned marzipan or tube marzipan? Superfine or regular granulated sugar?). A more precise recipe would spell this out.Another tangential issue: the cake component of the Blackout Cake recipe in this book is identical, measure for measure, ingredient for ingredient, with the cake component of the Blackout Cake in Lynn Stallworth's _The Brooklyn Cookbook_. However, neither the original recipe developer (Ceri E. Hadda) nor Stallworth is credited by Gand or Tramonto in the text of the recipe. I don't know if this was some kind of omission, but it seems odd to me. People borrow from other recipes all the time, but surely it better to give credit within the recipe's description, if not the recipe title? For example, in his _New York City Food_ book, Arthur Schwartz has yet another Blackout Cake recipe (an excellent one, by the way), in which he combines a cake base by Karen Barker and the pudding from Lynn Stallworth's book, and he credits both of his colleagues.On the good side, this is an unusual and wide-ranging collection of dessert recipes, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. For each recipe, Gand and Tramonto write a little about the recipe's history and what makes it special. The book is well designed (good font and layout).Perhaps if I began with different recipes, I would have a better review to write. I may try another few recipes before I totally give up. If the next few somethings I make from this book are wonderful, then I will revise this review."},{"Title":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible Desserts","review":"What a great book to actually read first, then cook.

I can't wait to try the cover recipe - Pavlova - looks delectable!"},{"Title":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible Desserts","review":"I consider myself an adequate but certainly not an expert baker. I loved this book. I have made almost every item in it. It is quite basic in parts but I have to admit I learned a few things. Some of the recipes are a little complicated but it is easy to work yourself &quot;up to them&quot;. I was thrilled with the chocolate cake, rich and dark. Especially helpful were the pastry and pie recipes. I have to admit, anything with a rollout crust has been a problem for me. I found the advice to be just the thing I needed to gain confidence. Nice book, excellent gift."},{"Title":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible Desserts","review":"For anyone who loves a NY Bakery Black-and-White (aka Half-Moon) Cookie - GET this book. The recipie is the Real Thing! I almost cried when I ate the first one it reminded me so much of home. This cookbook is fabulous - even my husband thumbed threw it and said that I had to make the Brooklyn Blackout Cake.For those that do not bake a lot, the book includes information on the purpose of each ingredient, helping make sense of how the recipie is put together. This is a must have for any dessert baker, novice and expert alike."},{"Title":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible Desserts","review":"I've actually only baked a few recipes from this book, but there are quite a few I'd like to try, including the Brooklyn Blackout Cake. I found the recipes fairly easy to follow, although you may need to add your own experience to achieve the best results. For instance, I believe that the Coffee Cake needs more butter, and I've found that it bakes much more evenly in a tube pan, than the square pan called for in the book.The author has a background of somewhat mixed ethnicity, which shows up in the wide range of recipes. Everyone will find something they like, whether it's German, Jewish, Italian, French, Scandinavian, or just good old American favorites. The use of unique combinations of ingredients is also nice, with combinations like grapefruit-cream cheese, lemon-strawberry, and ginger-orange.Some of these recipes may be a bit advanced for beginning bakers, but that's not really a problem. Follow these directions, and I'll bet that the worst of your flops will still be good to eat."},{"Title":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible Desserts","review":"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs: Whimsical Irresistible DessertsA book filled with yesterday's recipes makes my mouth water and my fingers tingle to make each one. Gale Grand and Rich Tramonto of Chicago's Brasserie T and Tru restaurants fell in love with the common ingredients of baking. They wrote their book on essential flavors: butter, sugar, flour, eggs, and spices. I've followed some of the recipes which I recap here. It's butter's richness in shortbread and pound cake that causes singing in the library. The Sharrow Bay Sticky Toffee Cake (a sticky, butterscotch brownie-type pudding cake served with whipped cream and tea.) is a favorite with espresso, giving my sweet tooth a decided lift. Flour provides the substance for the Quick Pecan Sour Cream Coffee Cake (a fine-grained cake with a brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecan topping). Eggs bring together the Apricot Rice Pudding (a balm for an ailing neighbor and a group of professional women and moms remembering the Good-OLE-Days). The rich Chocolate Fudge Pie drive my blues into hiding, especially when served with double espresso, a slice of lemon and a sigh.I make the Not-Your-Usual Lemon Meringue Pie has a Phyllo crust filled with rich and tart lemon curd and meringue whipped with brown sugar to impress our English friends. The Walnut Carrot Cake with Pineapple has pineapple chunks, coconut shreds, golden raisins, and bits of carrot. The authors discuss the chemistry; I and mine just eat it with Darjeeling tea.

Not only are the desserts all delicious thus far, but the directions are easy to follow. My only complaint is that there are photos of a select number of desserts in the middle. There is not a picture for each recipe.This book is a staple for any cookbook collection.

There are many more outstanding recipes in here! For starters, the cover recipe: Pavlova with the Down Under Fruits is easy and sensational to set before guests in the warmer months. The Pumpkin Creme Brulee, Warm Taffy Apples with Cinnamon Pastry Twists, Montrachet Cheesecake with Winter Fruit Compote, Sugared Walnut Sundaes in Chocolate Cups, Three Color Poached Pears,Lana's Chocolate Chip Mandlebrot, and the Brown Sugar Shortbread are but examples of the scrumptuous, imaginative gems in this collection.Drink suggestions are usually provided with each and the sidebar excursions to the source or background to the recipe is very fascinating.

Full of innovative recipes from inspired ingredients and adorable stories from Gale, this book has a place of honor next to my spice rack.To Datura: The Lemon Buttercups are time and labor intensive, but well worth the effort. I'm not a huge lemon tart fan, but my mom raved about it and the cookie crust for months. The only problem I had was the lemon curd took 30 minutes to set instead of 10, and I was freaking out thinking It'd gone wrong.

It is also a lesson in the &quot;chemistry&quot; of baking. Understanding why you use certain ingredients and how they work in the recipes makes it easier to get the dessert to come out just right.

His book is easy and enjoyable to read, but more importantly, he takes nothing for granted in terms of his readers' knowledge. Experienced artists and beginniners alike will find the reading fluid and helpful. Perhaps most valuble are the careful distinctions Mr. Hsu makes in areas such as kungfu/wushu, teachers/masters, etc. His experience acts much as the polished sword in separating fact from myth. Some may find Mr. Hsu's stance on more controversial issues inflamatory, but when researching such a varied subject, further reference should be a given."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"Along with Bok Nam Park's books, Mr. Hsu has written the one of the best source guide on Chinese martial arts that I have ever read. A collection of columns written for a magazine, Mr. Hsu writes with clarity, precision, history, and passion. Mr. Adam Hsu is a world-renowned teacher of Chinese martial arts systems. He is best known for publicly disseminating the Bajiquan and Piguazhang systems to the public, as well as his high level of attainment in the Yin-Fu lineage of Baguazhang. In this slender volume, Mr. Hsu (since I am not his student, I may not refer to him as &quot;Sifu&quot;) brings forth the philosophies and theory surrounding the most popular but least-understood family of martial arts in the West. There are no forms in this text; rather, it is a well-thought-out compilation of articles that will benefit all levels of Chinese martial artists. In fact, it has a thing or two to teach non-Chinese martial arts practitioners, as well. For anyone who cares to put a little thought into things, this is the book."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"Mr. Hsu takes a lot of time describing false Kung Fu, but as mentioned in other reviews here, he only sometimes tells us what true Kung Fu is. Is it what he does and only what he does? How does he know what he does isn't fake? He tackles issues about mixing styles and such (that it is not for the serious practioner), but does he realize that's what people have done for centuries? No! Praying Mantis blends monkey and mantis moves, White Crane mixes birds with the ape,etc. I've looked a long time for a good non-instructional Kung Fu book(with in- depth history and philosophy), and this proves to be a disappointment. Kung fu is way too diverse to generalize into a certain &quot;way&quot; like other martial arts. Mr. Hsu attempts to do way too much in so few pages. A noble attempt, yes, but the many flavors of Kung Fu are best left exposed by the many practioners of it."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"In your quest to find good and traditional kung fu begin with this book.

I've been to different schools and practiced on my own, never thinking quite as deeply as I needed to about Kung Fu. Mind you, I thought pretty deeply about it, but after reading Polishing the Sword, I think maybe I need to spend MORE time training and less time &quot;playing&quot; Kung Fu.His articles are dead-on, he politely skewers myths, delusions, phoney Kung Fu and detrimental Kung Fu practices. Not many books on Kung Fu take the time to analyze what the Kung Fu student must BECOME in order to achieve Kung Fu.Not many books focus on finding the right school, choosing the right style and developing the proper attitude and respect for the art.This should be required reading for any Kung Fu student. It teaches no forms, tells no fairy tales, it is for the modern, Western Kung Fu student to study and re-study in his/her quest for authentic Kung Fu.Also, it approaches the MUCH needed subject of Martial Arts vs. Fighting Ability. That alone was worth the price of the book.Are you Wu Shu or are you a Poseur?Graydon Webster Northern Shaolin Student"},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"Hsu's book dispells many myths, including the story of the Shaolin Temple being the ancient home of Chinese martial arts. He discusses many topics including teacher student relationships, the difference between \\"Northern\\" and \\"Southern\\" style kung fu, forms, two man fighting sets, and more. The great pity is that there are not more serious books of this caliber on Chinese (or other!) martial arts.This is NOT a how-to book, there are no sequences of techniques or instructions on forms. It is however, an invaluable aid to those seeking helpful factual information on Chinese martial arts, written in a straightforward and non-self-promoting way. I have bought copies of this to send to friends who are studying kung-fu in remote areas, away from the constant supervision of a teacher. It serves as a good textbook for beginning and advanced alike, doing away with superstitious information and offering a well thought, gracious and full view of the depth of Chinese martial arts. I hope Adam Hsu offers his other Chinese-language books up for translation in the near future, he is truely someone worth listening to."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"except for the lack of an index,I could find little to fault in this book. some may find Mr. Hsu's attitude toward martial art students and instructors a little negative at times,but he's been at it much longer than I have, and is prob. correct. This was the book that began my search for an internal style, that ultimately led to my current study of Chen tai-chi."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"I understood when I bought the book that it was a compilation of Sifu Hsu's articles but I thought that the breadth of his articles would be more substantial. Like the other reviewer said, it stated a lot about what isn't Kung Fu, and not so much on what is. I wish he went deeper into principles instead of alluding to them. There were a few choice chapters, but it was funny that everything he refereced was to Chen Style Taiji/Tai Chi. I would have thought he'd reference some of his other styles he knew such as Mantis, Baji or even piqua. Some times he touched on Changquan or Long fist but that was it. I thought it would have been more beneficial if he referenced his other styles or just stuck to body mechanics."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"GREAT overview of Kung Fu principles.

And no I'm not affiliated with the publishing company or Sifu Hsu's school(Kenpo, Shotokan, Tae Kwon Do for 14years). Just my humble opinion of a overrall great read."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"Master Adam Hsu has proven himself to be a master not only of the Chinese martial arts but of clearly projecting their essence through his writings. Sifu Hsu's unique prospective of these high-level arts is long over due. He seems to get right to the heart of the matter, to the very core /foundation of these high-level disciplines. But his prospective reflects his command of his subject. My meaning is &quot; just because the art is complexed doesn't mean it has to be presented in a mystical fashion&quot;. If understanding is key to truth, education, and awareness, then sifu Hsu has made a contribution that we will only appreciate, fully in years to come."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"Let me clarify several things from this book.A) The book is absolutely fantastic. Definitely in my top 5 favorite martial arts books (Along with Zen in the Martial arts, Meditations on Violence, & others).Adam Hsu is a longtime practitioner of traditional martial arts, is skilled, and knows his stuff.Now that that's clarified..B) Adam Hsu is VERY Gung ho about what is \\"real\\" kung fu. He is most certainly a purist, and seems to be disgusted by all these other false forms of Kung fu. That's alright, but it seems to echo throughout the book very strongly.This book NEEDS to be added to any martial artist's library, especially if you study kungfu."},{"Title":"The Sword Polisher's Record: The Way of Kung-Fu (Tuttle Martial Arts)","review":"I enjoyed reading this collection of short essays on various aspects of kung-fu teaching, practice and history. I think students of any level would also find it interesting and worthwhile. However, I often had the feeling that after all the pretty images presented, I was left empty.

This story is set in very early Victorian England from 1839 to 1841 against a backdrop of railroad building and and the economic upheavals this revolutionary form of transportation caused in it's youngest phase. Nora Telling, a brilliant but impoverished young woman of socially deplorable origins hitches her wagon to the star of John Stevenson, a navvy posessed of highly unusual talents whose own past is mysterious, stimulating to one's curiosity, and never clearly revealed, but not before meeting up in a manner later discomfiting to them both, with John's friend Walter Thornton, engineer and gentleman, who is looking forward to his upcoming marriage to Arabella Paine, Victorian ultra-lady. Each man soon discovers what a gem he (and the other) has taken to wife. The Stevensons start an ascent from poverty by their wits and any other means they can muster, above board or otherwise, while the Thorntons embark on a genteel connubial life. Or so it seems. Macdonald demonstrates a great gift for reconstructing the period of which he writes and fascinating us with it. Here he illuminates for us the great railroad boom and infant trade unions while relating the personal triumphs and tragedies of canny John Stevenson, and his commecially insightful Nora, hedonistic Walter Thornton and his vexatiously virtuous Arabella. Watch for the author's sly tribute to one of the classics of Victorian erotica."},{"Title":"The World from Rough Stones","review":"House from Rough Stones is exceptionally strong historical fiction. It speaks strongly of time and place, without anachronisms, showing 2 families as representative of Victorian England. One family is earthy and self-made, full of energy and power. The other family is repressed and tortured by middle class morality, what we describe now as \\"Victorian\\" mind-set.The earthy heroine, a strong female lead, has preternatural skill with mathematics. Her husband is a leader of men and an engineer-- we learn about \\"navvies,\\" or navigators, the working men who dug and blasted inch by inch to lay the railroad track. Like John Henry, but in England.The middle class couple surrender their essential humanity to Victorian standards, which idealized the purity of women and the sanctity of the home.

The two biggest issues I had with the book are the use of the dialect, I understand what the author was trying to do, but it made the reading very difficult in parts of the book. I had to actually read aloud in some sections to be able to understand the the characters were saying, & I'm not sure if they would have really been as readily accepted accross class lines as they were. Not like he entirely ignored that divide, but I do feel like he minimized it. But he did touch upon lots of other issues of the industrial revolution that are usually either entirely ignored, or detialed to the point of being so depressing as to make you wonder why people actually reproduced during that time period & anyone below the class of nobility didn't just slit their wrists & get it overwith. He managed to touch on poverty, venerial disease, restictive/urealistic expectations of sex/women in marriage, poor wages, poor medical care, children's issues, class issues, etc. without bringing the novel to a grinding depressing halt. The attitude that comes across is more \\"this is the hand I'm dealt, so lets get on with it & make the most of it\\" It kept the novel out of grim, while showing the less savory side of lower class & rising middle class victorian England during the early industrial revolution. Not an easy task, but made for an interesting read overall, but not exactly light beach fluff"},{"Title":"The World from Rough Stones","review":"I enjoyed this voyage into English history and engineering drama..who ever would believe that building a railroad section would be so full of excitement.The two primary protagonists, John and Nora Stevenson, who married 24 hours after meeting and embarked on a project to build a portion of early railway history become real to the reader as the story progresses.Their adventures, friendships, love for one another and the drama of every day life lived at poverty level is told with sincertiy and honesty.I got this as one of the Kindle free downloads and will be buying the next book tonight."},{"Title":"The World from Rough Stones","review":"So, I can typically put away a book of this size in less than two days.

And Arabella thinking that ALL children were conceived through Devine intervention? NO woman was that dumb back then, and it makes it almost not worth reading at all. I bought all three books in this series because I love this time period and I love series, but it's almost too much as this point. I'm honestly considering selling them to make room for books that are easier to understand and that don't try so hard to write off the beaten path (formula romance novels for instance) that they stray off in so many other directions that the reader is lost time and again, yet keep the same stupid romance novel story line; stupid, stubborn virgin girl (arabella) and broodish mountain of a man (john)."},{"Title":"The World from Rough Stones","review":"Three times the charm.

The main narrative is the growth of the new industrial aristocracy following the Napoleonic War years. The Characters are both unforgetable, believable, and gritty. Nora, the central character begins at the very bottom of the social heap, a part time whore. John is a Navvy Ganger. Together they work, cheat, commit fraud and whatever is needed to rise to the pinnacle of Victorian Society. Better than Delderfield, reminiscent of &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34;, and with the added bonus of a look at the way the early &#34;Public Schools&#34; worked to create a ruling class out of over bred aristocrats and the sons and daughters of newly wealthy tradesmen."},{"Title":"The World from Rough Stones","review":"I really enjoyed this ebook, enough to read it again.

I've been gifted since I was very young and I've never fit in with any of the other kids. I've always been much more mature and on a much higher level than the rest of the kids my age.

Every child, gifted, or not gifted should read this book!!"},{"Title":"The Gifted Kids Survival Guide: A Teen Handbook","review":"I am a coordinator for gifted programs and often need a resource for gifted students. I like this one because it is written for the students to read themselves and deals with problems they face on their own level. I keep several copies and loan them out to students as needed."},{"Title":"The Gifted Kids Survival Guide: A Teen Handbook","review":"I'm fourteen and my mother got me this book for Christmas. I'm only about a seventy-five pages in and I can see myself and my problems accurately described over and over again. There are reasonable and useable solutions for the problems I do have and I plan to use a few. The only problem I'm having with the book is how it is constantly telling me how gifted I am. Maybe that's one of my problems (I hate people telling me I'm smart, especially 'gifted'), but it feels like overkill and makes the entire book feel a bit awkward."},{"Title":"The Gifted Kids Survival Guide: A Teen Handbook","review":"i picked this up because it's the sort of thing that wasn't available to me when i needed it years ago and i was curious. i'm impressed with the career advice given, although far too many pages are devoted to getting into college. every gifted kid (possibly every kid) is going to be inundated with grades/college stuff without this book. i particularly like that the authors address subjects which can be touchy or entirely skipped over in some environments, such as drinking, drugs, sex, depression and teen suicide.however, while the book spends a bit of time on special issues for gifted girls, gifted boys, and gifted minority students, and even includes a list of suggestions of 'ways to fight racism in your school', it makes no mention whatsoever of sexual orientation. gay, lesbian, and bisexual teens are at special risk for depression and suicide due to actual social rejection and/or feeling like it's not okay to openly be themselves. they are also well represented in the gifted population. to deal with both issues simultaneously is something that deserves a special word or two, just as minority students' concerns were so thoughtfully addressed.if this book is updated, i hope the authors will include this issue in the section on dealing with prejudice. its omission tends to send the wrong message. i was thinking of buying copies of this for some young teenagers i know, but if i have to write notes in the margins before giving them out... well, let's just say i'm still deliberating."},{"Title":"Willow and Twig","review":"Willow and Twig will live in my heart right beside Anne Shirley, Mary Lennox and Leslie Burke. It is an outstanding achievement. I am using this novel to entice my teenage students to read with a passion. Little's characters are so real and heartwarming that they simply jump off the page and into the imaginations of these reluctant readers. Canadians do not realize that Jean Little is one of our greatest literary treasures. As far as Children's Literature is concerned, her novels rank with the world's best writers, like Katherine Paterson. I hope sincerely that she will continue the story of these two unforgetable characters in another novel."},{"Title":"Willow and Twig","review":"I have recently been searching for books that treat modern topics more gently, so that I can recommend them for young students. Too often I find the harsh world of drug abuse or physical abuse or whatever is treated in such a stark manner that it hurts just to read about it. Jean Little manages to tell a story that includes many frightening elements, but which also maintains a hopeful and, in the end, affirming view of the world. And she does this without losing the vivid imagery or the details that give insight into each character's world. You can feel Willow gradually begin to relax and to believe that she and her brother might actually be safe and loved.It was a pleasure to get to know these characters and their lives."},{"Title":"Willow and Twig","review":"Willow and Twig are nobody's children.

Excellent reading i couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Daphne (The Fourth Volume of The Six Sisters)","review":"I've bought the six sisters' series in the wrong order with Daphne being the last one in the series that I got. The book is good and typical Marion Chesney. Daphne, who knows she is a beauty, finds another beauty in the handsome Cyril Archer, but in typical Marion Chesney style, there is more to meet the eye. The Vicar is indebeted to a Mr. Simon Garfield, who is able to read Daphne like a book. He knows she knows she's a beauty and putting up a front because it's easier that way. The way Marion Chesney gets these two finally together is delightful.This is not the best of the six sisters' series, that's why I gave only four stars. I was somewhat handicapped since I had the read all the other in the series before I read Daphne. I would recommend you read the series in the correct order, but even if you don't, this book is still wonderful to read."},{"Title":"Daphne (The Fourth Volume of The Six Sisters)","review":"It seems that 18-year-old Daphne, the fourth daughter of the Reverend Charles Armitage, is the most beautiful of \\"The Six Sisters\\" that Marion Chesney has been writing about in these romance novels of Regency England, so of course that means trouble. No one is more aware of Daphne's dazzling beauty than Daphne herself, who is also painfully aware of her father's track record when it comes to finding wealthy noblemen to marry his daughters. As we all know, the vicar likes to hunt, and he requires the financial support of his three sons-in-law to do so. But Daphne has other ideas, namely to marry Cyril Archer. At face value (and I do mean at face value), they are a perfect match, because he is as vain and empty-headed as Daphne herself. Once married, she can continue to present the pretty picture of herself to the world without having to reveal there is an empty shell of a woman behind the beautiful face.However, while Daphne is in London with Lady Godolphin the malaprop-prone cousin whose home all of the Armitage girls seem to end up with when they visit London town, Reverend Armitage's affairs suffer a catastrophic misfortune. You see, a jealous bishop is after the vicar's hunting pack, and when Mr. Simon Garfield comes to the rescue, and proves himself to be as rich as he is noble, Reverend Armitage offers up Daphne as a bride. This means daughter number four is going to have to drop the facade and demand the right to find her own husband (like that is going to happen). Meanwhile, Annabelle, the second oldest sister, is having troubles with her own marriage because the new baby in the house tends to scream all of the time. Annabelle might be more maternal if the boy was actually her own, but that, of course, is part of the problem.\\"Daphne\\" would not be a Chesney romance if the title character was not put into a compromising position, and we have one of those as well in this book. But by now Chesney's readers fully understand and appreciate her formula as one forced marriage after another leads to true love and romance. There are plenty of period touches for those who pay attention to such details, and while the characters are all familiar types from such tales, Chesney clearly takes great pleasure in putting them through their paces. Besides, all of the twists and turns in the plot add to the general sense of merriment, as does her sense of humor. But in the end love will prevail, Mr. Archer will be forced to flee the field, and the vicar will get to keep his hunt. Next up is \\"Diana the Huntress,\\" which should give you plenty of indications as to what sort of handful she will prove to be and if you have gotten two-thirds of the way through the series there is no reason to stop now."},{"Title":"Daphne (The Fourth Volume of The Six Sisters)","review":"I read the other 3 books and this the 4th and am now reading the fifth-Diana. I like the style of writing that it takes place in England in the late 1800s. I like it is not a gooey romance more of a small adventure and mystery. Love how MC Beaton makes the characters come alive. I'm dreading the end of the last book which I will read next because that series will be done. I can hide in these books and become lost in England."},{"Title":"Daphne (The Fourth Volume of The Six Sisters)","review":"After reading the other volumes, I couldn't wait to find out how Daphne was going to handle the partys and dinners. She was awesome and the way the book portrayed her coming around to the ultimate prize was wonderful. Just about the time you think you know what is going to happen, the story turns in a different direction to keep you hooked. Couldn't wait for the next daughter to come of age!"},{"Title":"Wanderlust","review":"This is a charming photobook.

A lovely survey of travel experience and world wonders evolves for the armchair wanna-be."},{"Title":"Wanderlust","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like this little book. Pictures are truly sometimes worth a thousand words, but I found the book too full of pictures and too thin on text. The only real time we hear from the author in non-photography form is the inside front cover and inside back cover, which has some great first-person journal observations. But even still, a lot of Litten's observations are about superficial things like colors and people with clashing hair and fabric color, and I thought it unusual that for a man he uses color descriptions like \\"ochre\\" and \\"magenta\\" and \\"sky-blue\\" and \\"mint green\\", but then I saw that he's in San Francisco and it became clear. Nonetheless there is some good writing on the inside cover and inside back cover, I just wish there were more of it to accompany the interesting and sometimes funny photos.

Her understanding of the original Greek, which underpins this commentary on Mark, is unquestionable. As I read through this commentary, I found that there was a tidbit on nearly every page that was valuable and that challenged the depth of my understanding.For all of that I am thankful.However, Hooker's redactionistic approach to the text is an approach that carried too much in the way of preconceptions. Her treatment of anything miraculous or even quasi-supernatural was one of dismissal or hedging. This commentary hinges upon understanding the intent of the original author of Mark, applying that intent to each and every word written, and, in the end, coming away with nothing more the dim-witted scawlings of a partisan bent on advancing the cause of the Kingdom of God at the expense of integrity. Her repetitive use of the word \\"clearly\\" is employed in order to escape the necessity of evidence. As such, Hooker's assertions regarding the reasons Mark was written and the source material for the book of Mark demand far more proof and far less opinion.In the end, the negatives of this commentary far outweigh the positives and, thus, the valuable and challenging tidbits herein are lost in a deluge of material that must be forgotten as quickly as it is read.Steer clear of this commentary, this TYPE (redaction) of commentary, and this author. Instead, check out Gundry's commentary on Mark, \\"A Commentary on His Apology for the Cross.\\""},{"Title":"The Gospel According to St. Mark (Black's New Testament Commentary)","review":"I have used Hooker's commentary alongside R.T. France's \\"Mark\\" and Tim Keller's \\"King's Cross\\" as I have prepared sermons through Mark's Gospel. It is an invaluable source for me. She deals with textual critical issues that others don't. She has a vastly different perspective than others that gives proper balance to preparation. She also has a writing style that is very readable, offering excellent insight into the text."},{"Title":"The Gospel According to St. Mark (Black's New Testament Commentary)","review":"The process of ordering the book, of getting the book on time, and the book being in great condition is awesome. I personally did not have any problems."},{"Title":"The Artificial Language Movement","review":"Andrew Large has written an entire book about a rather obscure, yet highly entertaining subject: artificial languages. For centuries, enthusiasts have tried to create a new, universal language in the hope of facilitating international communication. The attempts have ranged from the serious to the frivolous, with most artificial languages being parked somewhere in-between. Most of the artificial languages have been quietly forgotten (who today remembers Novial, Neo, Basic English or Volap&uuml;k?), but a few have managed to recruit followers, and one have become a world movement: Esperanto.Some of the language projects mentioned by Large are so eccentric that they will strain your credulity to the breaking point. Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars, a certain Frenchman invented a language called Solresol. The language could be both written, spoken, sung, whistled, played on piano, or expressed with the help of seven signal flags in different colors! Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult to learn, since all words were based on the diatonic scale (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti). Thus, doredo meant \\"time\\", doremi \\"day\\" and doresi \\"century\\". Incidentally, domisol meant \\"God\\" and solmido \\"the Devil\\". Naturally, such a crazy language became quite popular, at least in France, and had followers still during World War One, about a century after it was first invented!Most of Large's book is devoted to Esperanto, created by the Polish Jew Ludwig Zamenhof in 1887. As already mentioned, Esperanto is the only artificial language with a degree of international success. (My maternal grandfather was an Esperantist, BTW). The most interesting chapter of the book deals with the political and religious connections of the early Esperantist movement. Zamenhof wanted to create a new religion, a kind of Reform Judaism, and use Esperanto to promote it. Meanwhile, many socialists and Communists joined the Esperantist movement, leading to splits between radicals and moderates in the movement. Unsurprisingly, Stalin prohibited Esperanto (so did Hitler), but it was revived in the Eastern bloc after his death, being used by the Communist regimes in their peace propaganda. A rather humorous chapter of the book is devoted to the British Esperantists, who turn out to be rather excentric. As Large sums up: \\"A fairly typical Esperantist, therefore might be a rather well-educated, unmarried, middle-aged, female teacher who votes Labour, does not believe in God, and never eats meat\\".The book also contains a chapter on Esperanto grammar, and one dealing with the modern challengers to Esperanto, including Interlingua, a language actually used for resumes in scientific journals. Finally, Large asks what the prospects for an artificial, international language might be, and answers that they probably are quite bleak. In the real world, the \\"real\\" languages always dominate, and they are spread by powerful social forces: empire-building, science, even travel and commerce. The artificial languages, by contrast, lack power and will remain small, sectarian movements for the foreseeable future. Still, new attempts at creating the perfect universal language are being made every year, Glosa and Eurolengo being two examples mentioned by Large. (I happen to know of one not even mentioned in the book, a simplified form of Latin self-ironically christened SPL, the Latin abbreviation for \\"Without Legal Issue\\"!)Finally, a word of warning. The first part of the book, dealing with pre-19th century philosophical languages, are quite boring, so a good tip is to read the introduction, and then go straight for Part II, the really interesting and entertaining part."},{"Title":"Grounded Theory in Management Research (SAGE series in Management Research)","review":"Karen Locke manages, in a little over 100 pages, to simultaneously explain grounded theory, document its roots, show the conditions under which it can be used, and still maintain a critical stance toward it! She includes an extensive discussion of Barry Turner's work on disaster; an account of Glaser &amp; Straus's procedure called 'coding,' unpacks the various varieties of grounded theory (there's not just one!), and shows great familiarity with the French influences on American social science in the past several decades.Although she doesn't say it, her discussion implies that grounded theory is best learned from a mentor, when a novice is in an apprentice's role. My impression from some purported 'grounded theory' papers I've read in the past few years is that some junior scholars invoke it as a way of avoiding the hard work of doing what Glaser &amp; Straus (&amp; their followers) showed is really required to achieve a scholarly product. Some young scholars I've spoken with see it as a short cut, rather than as a serious &amp; rigorous method in its own right. Locke does a great job of indicating how time consuming serious grounded theory work can be.This is a great book for people just starting to think about doing grounded theory building."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice, A Longman Cultural Edition","review":"This is THE edition of Pride and Prejudice.I teach English, and I asked my school to order this edition for my students, and the Penguin Classics edition showed up instead. I nearly swore at the person involved. Of course I restrained myself. Somewhat.The materials in this book to aid students surpass the Penguin Classics by a mile--everything from the background material (the essay by Johnson is a must) to pictures of period fashions and architecture. Most high school students need all the help they can get, and there is no more help available in a single volume than here.As far as I know, Norton Critical has never published P&P;, but I know they'd do a good enough job to rival this. But for now, this is the edition you want, if you want to understand the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice, A Longman Cultural Edition","review":"I've always loved Pride and Prejudice, but this edition is so much more.

And in a world that includes the likes of Art Spiegelman, Alan Moore, the Hernandez Brothers, Frank Miller and Grant Morrison, that's no small praise.Hence, who better to comment upon this form of communication/literature/entertainment than Gaiman himself. Contained in GODS AND TULIPS are three speeches (in the form of essays)the Gaiman delivers on the world of comic books. The topics range from the horrible practice of buying comic-books as \\"investments\\" (as opposed to buying them to be read and enjoyed) to how to properly set up a signing engagement for a comic-book creator. Each of the essays contained in this collection is enhanced by some expressive (not to mention sometimes hilarious) illustrations by various guest artists.While perhaps a bit dated since the time that these essays/speeches were first penned/delivered, their essence remains true. At the very least, these works of prose are entertaining and enjoyable (no surprise, considering that they come from Neil Gaiman's pen)...and, very often, Neil Gaiman's comments, observations and insights are keenly astute and hit the bulls-eye! This is essential reading for anyone interested in the world of comic-books!"},{"Title":"Gods & tulips","review":"This is an excellent addition to the fanatic Gaiman fan's library. It is a collection of speeches Gaiman has made, mostly concerning the comics market and ethics in writing and responsibilites to fans. He does his usual wonderful weaving in of astounding esoteric, obscure things from history you would never have heard of or believed in the grace of storytelling that his admirers know and can't get enough of. For aspiring writers or people looking to work in the comics business or any other creative business, it is an inspiring little book, the size of a comic really. HOWEVER, PLEASE PURCHASE THIS WORK FROM THE COMIC BOOK LEGAL DEFENSE FUND. That is who Gaiman published this for in the first place, to raise desperately needed money. That anyone would be making this much money off of it is unethical, unless they were going to make the profit a direct deposit to the CBLDF. Gaiman has put tireless hours into this organization trying to raise money to legally defend people who can't afford to defend themselves when the government or others tries to take away their Constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression, simply because their art form is comics, an art form which is still discriminated against due to misinformed ideas they hold to be facts. Some of these trials are truly Kafka-esque in nature. You my find yourself in such a situation some day, and wish a fund of compassionately donated money was there to help you. Google Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, and purchase a copy from them. Read on and Dream on."},{"Title":"Chinese Intellectuals and the Gospel (Horizon)","review":"My first impression when I came across the title of this book was that the editors/authors are dealing with issues that the Chinese intellectuals in general are concerned. It also attempts to build the bridges that could bring Chinese intellectuals to the gospel of Christ. However, I have realized that the editors are mainly dealing or focusing on issues concerning the mainland Chinese intellectuals, the American-born Chinese and the Overseas-born Chinese intellectuals in the North America. The editors begin with exploring the historical and cultural background of the Chinese intellectuals in mainland China as well as those American-born and Overseas-born Chinese in North America, with emphases placed on the modern China especially from the 19th and 20th centuries. The second part of this book deals with discussions about the strategies and models for evangelism and discipleship for the Chineseintellectuals. True friendship is one of the most important factors in reaching out to the Chinese intellectuals. The kindness, friendliness and willingness of Christian to go beyond surface level relationship will be the first thing that attracts people to Christianity. Long-term friendship also keep us from feeling pressured to cover all the gospel in one sitting, since we know we will have another opportunity to have another opportunity to converse with them. The effectiveness of evangelism and discipleship of these intellectuals are largely depended on the pre-evangelistic friendship cultivated. Chinese intellectuals are the most influential class of people among the Chinese community. To win them over to Christ is to pave the way for the whole Chinese community to accept Christ. We as Chinese Christian should take up this challenge to further extend the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus among the Chinese people."},{"Title":"Langenscheidt Turkish Pocket Dictionary (Langenscheidt's Pocket Dictionaries)","review":"Pretty good for a beginner like me.

It is amzing that books written during the second world war should be so secure in their tone about a vanishing England and its history. Cary uses his three entirely diffeent voices - tricky sensuous woman, nervy religious dirty old man, obsessed manipulative artist- better than anyone else i know uses the limitations of the first person to show what we do and don't know about each other. His descriptions of places and things are delicious. Also I shd like to say what beautiful books the New York Review paperbacks are to handle and read. Most people know The Horse's Mouth, and many know Herself Surprised . I'm not sure To Be A Pilgrim isn't the best and most surprising of the three- which is saying something."},{"Title":"Herself Surprised","review":"My take on Sara Monday is very different from what I'm reading here. I believe that she loved life and indulged herself in its pleasures. At the same time she was a nurturing soul. Read it for yourself to decide about her character. Gulley Jimson is also a great character. The descriptions in this book are wonderful. She describes the sea as being like oven glass one day and the edges of knives another. It is so good that I didn't want it to end, and now I'm going to read the other two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Herself Surprised","review":"I am giving this book 4 stars because it does not rank among the best books I have ever read, which would deserve a 5 star, but certainly better than a mediocre book which would merit only a 3 star. Amazon.com only gives us 5 stars, so I hand them out sparingly.I enjoyed this old-fashioned read. I laughed at times, felt sympathy and frustration for Sara, and looked forward to where the story was taking her along with the reader. The story line reminds me of the book \\"Alias Grace\\" by Margaret Atwood. I am not about to run out and order the other two books in the Joyce Cary trilogy just yet; but some day when I am book dry I know they are there and I can go back to them."},{"Title":"Herself Surprised","review":"Cary's Sara Monday has often been compared--quite rightly--to Moll Flanders, another irresistible, irrepressible woman of highly suspect morals. Sara's odd adventures in marriage and love make for a highly entertaining read, but you should also pay close attention to her observations of her society; for a woman of little apparent reflection, there's very little that seems to escape her notice. All three books in the Gulley Jimson triptych are remarkable, but this one has a special poignancy."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Hypnotic, sad, and occasionally graphic, this first-rate picto-history of Africa's glory days manages to convey something of the magic that inspired artists and hunters alike to flock to the expansive, untamed land known as The Dark Continent. Excellently annotated with stunning, eye-poppingly original photos never before seen. First rate. Spending an hour with Beard's book is to embark on an adventure. You will not be able to forget many of these photos, some of which were supplied to the author by Karen Blixen, the woman who penned &quot;Out of Africa.&quot; The orginal 1965 edition of &quot;End of the Game&quot; is so prized the School of the Art Institute of Chicago keeps a copy under close guard in the Special Collections room. To spend an hour with this book is to lose yourself under the volcanic glare of an African sun, to feel the blackflies nipping at your shins, and see, if only through a final, panicked photo, all the beauty and horror of Africa rushing toward you through the tall grass of an abandoned savannah.Sound exciting? Take my advice: skip &quot;Out of Africa&quot;; &quot;End of the Game&quot; is out of this world."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"This is not a coffee table book despite its professional and exquiste photographs. The End of the Game is a heartrending and informative picture of poaching and the plight of the African elephant. For those with connections to Kenya it breathes nostalgia of days gone by, and an era both sad and beautiful."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"It's a very real look at Old Africa. It shows the truth of man's bad luck, bad descisions, greed, and life filled with hard times. It shows nature in it's true self, not some Disney version of happy animals dancing around. This is an excellent book and should serve as a wake up call for the multitudes of Americans who believe the garbage that is spoon fed to them on their televisions. It may be well more than most readers can handle, because the truth is not sugar coated here."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Images have great power over the imagination and spirit, and Beard's b&amp;w photographs of elephant carcasses are both elegant and tragic, showing that elephants are the first to be affected by any inbalances in their environment, whether induced naturally or from mankind's insensitivity. What ever flaws Beard may have as a wildlife conservationists, he is great artist with a crying heart for these noble and wonderful animals. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"I, like many of you, read these reviews before purchasing this book. I have little to add to these reviews-- for the most part they are accurate: the book is full of captivating photos and text. And like one reviewer stated, full of pictures of dead animals. One reviewer used the words &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;reactionary&quot; to describe this book. I use the idiom &quot;chip on the shoulder&quot; to describe his comments."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Hypnotic, sad, and occasionally graphic, this first-rate picto-history of Africa's glory days manages to convey something of the magic that inspired artists and hunters alike to flock to the expansive, untamed land known as The Dark Continent. Excellently annotated with stunning, eye-poppingly original photos never before seen. First rate. Spending an hour with Beard's book is to embark on an adventure. You will not be able to forget many of these photos, some of which were supplied to the author by Karen Blixen, the woman who penned &quot;Out of Africa.&quot; The orginal 1965 edition of &quot;End of the Game&quot; is so prized the School of the Art Institute of Chicago keeps a copy under close guard in the Special Collections room. To spend an hour with this book is to lose yourself under the volcanic glare of an African sun, to feel the blackflies nipping at your shins, and see, if only through a final, panicked photo, all the beauty and horror of Africa rushing toward you through the tall grass of an abandoned savannah.Sound exciting? Forget &quot;Out of Africa&quot;; &quot;End of the Game&quot; is out of this world."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Moleskine Pocket Journal - Plain PagesI love this book! I lived in North Africa, briefly, but had friends that lived in Kenya and places where safaris actually happen. So, I have heard many first hand accounts of life in modern day Africa, (Malaria!) but thanks to the gorgeous photographs, torn bits of history, diary entries, drawings and Beard's interesting explanations, I could experience a different Africa. Aside from actually undergoing a painful series of shots, venturing into the grasslands, climbing Kilamanjaro, or just trying to figure out the settings on my camera, I think reading or just gazing at this book makes the perfect African holiday. Romantic, tragic and inspiring...I still fear mossies the most!"},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Having been introduced to his work at a gallery exhibit in New York, I bought this book which contains pretty much the same sad pictures. Really an amazing point of view of wildlife in Africa, might shock some with graphic pictures of carcasses, particularly one of a zebra with its hide stripped off. What I cannot figure out ultimately is where Peter Beard stands on the issue - although the big message appears to me that he opposes the killings, which is why he films the hideousness of it all, he seems to have personally participated in the hunts that he photographs, killing the same animals. He is very elusive about his personal viewpoint, seems kind of snobbish to me."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Published in 1965, the book is the most famous book of Peter Beard. The book is shoking as most photos are pictures of dead animals, it is definitely not a book to look at before your safari. Black and white pictures are excellent. Sadly, the last pages are only photos of elephant's carcasses (too much?). The Beard's touch is a book full of old illustration, tiny pics, small and odd drawings and detailed texts - most of them taken from the British Museum. The book is about the Old Africa and text about Mt Kenya, the Man-eaters of Tsavo, Nairobi and Karen Blixen are not easy and you must have a knowledge of Kenyan history to understand them fully. This book is essential for any African collection as it has shocked and marked history."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"This is photo essay of what was to come in the future of the animals.

Perhaps the book should have been seperately wrapped in plain paper, before being enclosed in the envelope.Thank you for your understanding."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"I first happened upon this book while engaged in my day-to-day duties in the shelves of the Augsburg College Library in Minneapolis where I worked as a student library assistant in the mid-70's. As I began paging through it, I began to realize that I had never seen a \\"nature\\" book like this before. The book and the characters in it were at once bold, daring, mesmerizing and weird. You just have to read it."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"An excellent book for those that can handle the truth. It shows what will happen when nature is left to manage itself and what happens when men don't control themselves. It's about hard times and history-a way of life long forgotten. If you are a product of the spoonfed Disney age, then you'll find this book shocking. It may well be your first taste of truth about wild animals,wild places, and the true spirit of man. This book is about Old Africa and should not be judged with today's politically correct eye. It is an account of things happened in a forgotten time, and a lost way of life."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"Peter Beard is a descendent of Jim Hill, who among other things built the Great Northern Railroad. Beard graduated from one of the top universities with all the money any of us would ever need and decided that instead of launching a career, he'd help out in some way.He chose to help the elephants of Africa by taking pictures of them, and this book is the result. Photographically, it's engaging but no great shakes. However, the setting along with the quirkiness of the photographer make it fantastically interesting. Also intriguing is the fact that Beard got interested in Africa - at least in part - through a multi-year relationship he developed with Karen Blixen, who as Isaak Denison wrote \\"Out of Africa.\\"Even more interesting than this book is Beard's life in general. It's been said that his journey through the world has been marked by wildlife (I think that can be applied both litterally and figuratively) and beautiful women. Think of it: this is the guy who stole Cheryl Tiegs from her then-husband...quite a feat even if he (her then-husband) was a jerk.And Cheryl (she and Beard have been divorced for years) is indeed just one of the gorgeous women who have graced Peter Beard's life, a life that most of us would be only too glad to live. And at the end of the page, that's probably what makes this book so engaging...not just the subject matter or the rather blurred message, but the character of the character who wrote it. Like Hemingway, it's almost more fun to read about the author than to read his work."},{"Title":"End of the Game","review":"I thought this book would be a collection of pictures of endangered animals, but no.

What Mary Hannah does find in Indian Knob is a place that knows about survival and loyalty, acceptance and love.The author writes with a deep sense of understanding for the mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and celebrates all that is unique about this place and its peoples."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"In this book Schaberg skillfully and insightfully sifts through the layers of legends that have accrued to the figure of Mary Magdalene in order to \\"resurrect\\" this important figure in Christian history. In contrast to other books which simply recount the many legends associated with the Magdalene, Schaberg undertakes a critical analysis of these legends, demonstrating ways in which the legends have been used to both empower and depower the Magdalene. In successive chapters, Schaberg examines archaeological remains, depictions of the Magdalene in film and literature, the transformation of the Magdalene from \\"apostolic witness\\" to \\"whore\\", and gnostic/apocryphal traditions associated with the Magdalene. In concluding chapters Schaberg points to Mary Magdalene and the discovery of the empty tomb as the source of resurrection faith, and makes a bold and persuasive argument for Mary Magdalene as the prophetic successor of Jesus, similar to the way in which Elisha succeeded Elijah. Schaberg's proposition for \\"Magdalene Christianity\\" invites serious reconsideration of previous reconstructions of Christian origins. This is a book that will be of interest to students of the Bible and early Christianity, as well as those engaged in women's studies. It is a challenging and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"This is a unique, powerful and provocative work. Something I've come to expect from this wonderful scholar and writer."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"Interesting possibilities emerge in a reader's mind as one sees Mary Magdalene's interaction with Jesus and the apostles. This book examines all sides of the biblical stories and raises provoking thought of her role in the life of Jesus. The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene is done with careful research and it encourages thought and discussion.I consider the controversies here a challenge to the curious reader and ones to fire the imagination of the poorly informed. I give the book five stars."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"I have the utmost respect for Jane Schaberg as a scholar, and have enjoyed her previous books. But the current book is so bogged down with feminist allusions, that the story of Mary Magdalene gets lost in the process. Which is not to say that the feminist point of view isn't welcome in a subject that has been \\"man handled\\" for centuries and which shows the awkward footprints of patriarchic society. Yet too often Schaberg is so caught up in the argument that we move further away from the picture of Mary which we were hoping to explore.Then, of course, there are the obvious things. Schaberg gives us a good summary of the archeological evidence with regard to Migdal, yet she seems determined to keep the idea going that Mary Magdalene is Mary of Magdala when she herself shows that Magdala never existed. Hence it is Mary Midgal or Mary \\"the tower\\" as Margaret Starbird has shown, not Mary of Magdala.And something seems to keep her from making the obvious conclusion that Jesus and Mary were married. She presents the evidence, then when it's all there on the table, she refuses to accept the obvious conclusion. After all, Jesus was a 30 year old rabbi, all 30 year old rabbis at that time were married, Jesus loved her more..., kissed her often on the..., etc. I'm baffled by how she can present the evidence and then fail to draw the conclusion. I suspect, and this is only a suspicion, that by concluding that Mary was Jesus' wife, somehow the feminist orientation is weakened. Mary should be a strong person. A leader. Independent of her status to Jesus. If she is a leader because she is Jesus' wife, then it somehow degrades her. Personally I don't accept that. It is because she is a strong person that Jesus loves her in the first place, and it is because she is a strong person and Jesus' wife that the writers of the canonical gospels choose to edit her out almost entirely.This is certainly an interesting book with lots of details (perhaps too many) and good scholarly footnotes that provide a wealth of information. But I wouldn't recommend it to a beginning student."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"As one might expect, the scholarship of Jane Schaberg is of a very high standard. However, she takes far too much mileage from the supposition that the word \\"Magdalene\\" means from the modern Israeli town of Migdal. There is absolutely no evidence that Migdal, like Nazareth, existed during the early first century. Magdalene and Nazarene are no doubt important titles, but what they might actually mean is apparently of no concern to Schaberg. So she imposes onto the ancient Jews a westernized set of norms that don't threaten her presuppositions. The upshot is that the reader is no closer to understanding Mary Magdalene."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"I can only write this review from a non-theological point of view. I am a systems-programmer, not a scholar. Having been brought up Roman Catholic, then fallen far, far away into what might be called &quot;unorthodox deism&quot;, I am astonished by the difference between the canonical New Testament texts I was taught, and the views Jane Schaberg expresses. So, the canonical Matthew, Mark, Luke and John aren't &quot;history&quot;? This is refreshing, because taken as history they don't make allthat much sense. The additional frequent allusions to the documents from Nag Hammadi and other apocrypha point the way to &quot;the way things might have been different&quot; from the canonical teachings, and help to look at the historical Jesus as a real person, not a simpering victim of Augustinian prudery.This last helps support Schaberg's postulation that Mary Magdalene, among other women, may have been not distant followers of Jesus but intimate companions and the true proclaimers of his message to the apostles and to the world."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"Schaberg's book is a challenging read, but should be accessable to one who reads feminist/womanist authors, Biblical scholars or both. She has meticulously reviewed and analysed the literature and film on or related to Mary Magdalene. She has summarized the limited archaeological work done at Migdal.Perhaps I have been afraid of Virginia Woolf. Now I will read her work, and try to compare it with the work of Mary Ann Evans. I have been interested in what Evans says about religion.I find Schaberg's discovery of allusion to 2 Kings 2 in John 20 to be breathtaking... I will be spending a lot of time with this book."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"This is a masterful book. The scholarship is impressive, but it is the combination of solid learning with the personal that is unusual and engaging. Schaberg is fearlessly feminist, but this is not a polemic. She is persuasive and at times even poetic. For those interested in Mary Magdalene or Virginia Woolf this book is a must-read, but everyone interested in the origins of Christianity and the impact of patriarchy on human institutions will find a great deal of interest here."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"Highest recommendation.Join Dr. Schaberg as she guides us through centuries of passion, faith, sexism, intrigue and sabotage, as she untangles the story/stories of Magdalen with voluminous knowledge, a feminist's questioning eye, wit and, thank god, a wonderful sense of humor and irony. It truly is a epic of \\"biblical plus\\" proportions.For those of us who are not scripture scholars, Ms. Schaberg has compiled an enormous amount of research into a readable and entertaining book. I couldn't put it down once I began reading. Dr. Schaberg style is conversational and friendly; she introduces us to and credits many scholars and writers upon whose works she builds, with whom she disagrees, and she leaves us with a treasure trove bibliography should we wish to continue our own research. Virginia Woolf joins us as mentor, as companion and co-guide in this unusual exploration. Her presence makes the journey an absolute joy, despite the fences and barriers we encounter in our climbing and excavating.This is a book for readers who ask questions, engage in religious reflection, and like to peel away layers of cultural paint in search of women's ancestors."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"This is a wonderful book if, like me, you want to explore the various modern interpretations of Mary Magdalene. The author begins by showing why the portrayal that has come down to us through the centuries of a \\"repentant prostitute,\\" is not substantiated by either Biblical or historical scholarship. She then goes on to explain the various theories and possibilities to help as construct a more accurate picture of Magdalene. She does this in a scholarly way--but her writing avoids the jargon and unnecessarily long words of some other scholarly books on religion. In other words, you're not likely to fall asleep reading it. In fact, it's an eye-opener. Schaberg brings together and explains a number of different theories about Magdalene and about the events surrounding the Crucifixion. I personally didn't feel the quotes from Virginia Woolf were necessary, but I appreciate her attempt to make the material even more meaningful by using them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to unravel the Magdalene mystery."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"A blend of fierce scholarship and visionary passion.

It is not a quick or easy read. Although I found the work interesting (I am not an academician), I was put off by three elements of the book. First, the author compared the patriarchal hostility to Mary Magdalen to Virginia Woolf. At times, the author quoted so extensively from Woolf that I wondered whether her focus has shifted from theology to feminist fiction. This was way too much of a good thing. Second, I did not particularly appreciate the \\"shots\\" she took at Raymond Brown and John Dominic Crossan for perceived personal slights. I did not purchase this book to learn of the author's personal disappointments. Third, the writing is \\"dense.\\" It is often difficult to understand, stylistically opaque and contains much repetition. Had the author (and her editor) worked harder at simplifying and clarifying her focus, instead of an academic treatise, she could have done for Mary Magdalen what Elaine Pagels did for Gnosticism and Sandra Schneiders did for the Gospel of John. Alas, that was not to be."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"Although I do not often read books of this type, I found it to be a fascinating and in depth presentation -- particularly the references to and contrasts with Virginia Wolfe-I have and will recommend it to friends- who have an interest in women's issues and the genisis of many modern attitiudes-One does not have to be a scholar to appreciate this work-"},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament","review":"Jane Schaberg's The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene is an adventure...at times delightful, at times profoundly sad.

That said, this is otherwise an interesting book on Orthodoxy in Europe. The cover reflects the author's rather negative tone: it features an illustration Blessed Pasius Velikovsky laying helplessly on a bed. Her title, \\"Why Angels Fall,\\" refers to what she claims is Orthodoxy's greatest evil--affiliating itself with ethnic nationalism, anti-Westernism and in some cases anti-Semitism. It was considered the heresy of \\"Philytism.\\" Clark considers this \\"base\\" because it tends to resist the global hegemony of liberalism and feminism. Her smug, condescending worldview makes itself readily apparent when she starts her narrative by slamming Mt. Athos for its thousand year rule of totally banning women from entering. Clark describes a handful of bishops, monks, nuns and various other prelates but mostly highlights the negative impressions they made upon her, usually their zenophobic, misogynist, anti-Western, anti-Semitic statements. The Orthodox clergy are portrayed largely as ignorant, racist, sexist barbarians. She is also rather wary of Eastern Europe's monastic revival as giving ethnic tensions a renewed vigor, although she praises the spirituality of the Hesychasts who practice Orthodoxy's tradition of interior prayer. This book is one of the few sources of information I've run across about the political involvement of Orthodox prelates in the post-communist era. The Orthodox world has been shrinking between Western and Islamic expansion on both sides but it holds onto a considerable amount of turf today and Clark divides her book according to her travels in Orthodoxy's bastions: Mt. Athos, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece, Romania, Russia, Cyprus and Istanbul. Orthodoxy has nothing to fear from critical books like this. Its ultimate victory will be moral and eschatological (On Angels' Wings!), even if it is doomed to fall as a political authority like the Christian emperors of Rome, Constantinople and Moscow.Also recommended: _The Black Hundred_ by Walter Laqueur about the post-communist political right in Russia, and _The Orthodox Church_ by Timothy Ware for a decent outline of Church history from a genuine Orthodox (Ware's a British convert) perspective."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"The authoress had her title in hand before even commencing her research and writing, clearly indicating her bias from the beginning. The \\"Fallen Angels\\" obviously are clergy and Orthodox faithful..a view that the papacy has had for the past one thousand years. Having a title before writing is extremely rare in my writing experience, and is a major key to the purpose of her work: to degrade the Orthodox Christian Faith. After reading her description of the Desert Fathers as \\"filthy and famished\\" - pejoratives which even ordinary scholars would never use- along with \\"dirty Romanian villages\\" and cigarette-lighting priests, her purpose becomes clear. One is forced to suppose that this was indeed a \\"hit piece\\" by a journalist perhaps coopted by publishers to prepare the western minds for our war against the Serbs in Kosovo. There was true slander in her writing, with serious moral innuendos about the Orthodox \\"fathers\\" or \\"elders\\" held in esteem by all Orthodox as having the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The authoress inevitably noted that there were \\"handsome young priest-monk\\" who attended the elder. No puzzle about the implication here. Her work is unfortunately a continuation of Charlemagne's historians who rewrote history to render papal claims valid.

Not even a mention of Roxolana, the Orhtodox Queen of the Turks, let alone Berehinia the nature god."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"Why Angels Fall fills an important gap in the Western literature about Orthodoxy-- the unvarnished examination of the current status of the Orthodox world. Much like the West's view of Islam, we are rarely presented with such a portrait. We see the \\"best foot\\" put forward by these other civilizations and in our self-destructive impulse, the worst about ourselves.This is reflected not only in our media but in our history and church history texts. The view of Orthodoxy presented there is often shallow and rosy, filling in no color of the broad worldview differences which make our civilizations different--not just an historical creedal disagreement. Here we learn, for example, about the Serbian perspective of the Balkan wars, which is quite different than the one we are accustomed to.Understanding, then, the information presented here, explains a lot more about Russian, Serbian, and other Orthodox policy orientations than we might really have the courage to face and is a nice complement to those who acknowledge the \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" posited by Harvard Political Scientist, Samuel P. Huntington. Only by understanding these other Civilizations from within, as Clark attempts to help us do, can we really objectively see it and our role in it from the West.About the book itself then, Clark has chapters on the major flashpoints of the Orthodox world including the Balkans, Greece, Russia, etc. Each chapter gives a light historical treatment in the context of relevant contemporary interviews and encounters. It's difficult to overstate how helpful this is--if only all history were given in context of contemporary worldview significance, maybe we'd understand it.Clark's perspective is definitely that of a secularist. Many other reviews identify this as purely negative, but for me, this was actually helpful because she was more of an outside observer with a stated bias, as opposed to an Eastern or Western church historian with political constraints."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"I am Orthodox, and this Englishwoman is a good writer.

Theyre complaining that a book about roses doesnt talk about sunflowers. They say she doesnt write a scholarly academic book, She Doesnt Claim To! They say her book isnt a good introduction to the Orthodox Christian Faith, She never said it WAS!!She is a journalist and a rather average mind reflecting a rather average secular west euro point of view, all of which she tells you up front and honestly.

In the decade since the end of the cold war, the Orthodox Church has reemerged in Eastern Europe as a strong cultural and political force. It is becoming increasingly clear that in order for Westerners to understand the region well, a thorough understanding of Orthodoxy is also needed -- and there are remarkably few works that address the contemporary situation of Orthodoxy in these countries. So far so good.Where Clarke's book misfires, however, is in its approach to Orthodoxy. Rather than trying to understand Orthodoxy as a spiritual system, as a religion, and attempt to understand its force in that way, Clarke instead focuses on the worldly aspects of the Orthodox Church, leaving the reader with a good understanding of how worldly some Orthodox prelates can be, but with almost *no* understanding of what really drives the rank and file of Orthodoxy in their beliefs. In other words, Clarke fails to delve deeply enough into Orthodoxy to really explain it well to anyone, and this is a very serious shortcoming in a work that is an attempt to explain Orthodox Europe to Westerners. Because Clarke never really excapes her Western/Secular viewpoint (which must be thoroughly entrenched to have survived her tremendous exposure to Orthodoxy), neither does the reader -- and the result is that the reader is given a Western/Secular understanding of Orthodoxy. This is the equivalent of &quot;Orientalism&quot; done this time not for the Near East, but for Eastern Europe.Clarke poses the question &quot;Why do Angels fall&quot; as the issue of her book, and answers it, for Orthodoxy, in one word: phyletism (religious nationalism). That is a fine perspective to have, but it really does not explain Orthodoxy at all other than as an expression of nationalism. Clarke spends almost no time explaining Orthodoxy as a spiritual system, exploring the meaning of Orthodox liturgy and worship, the forms and meaning of Orthodox piety, the differences between East and West. In other words, Clarke fails to address some of the central issues that must be understood well, in order for a Westerner to understand the tenaciousness of Orthodoxy in Eastern Europe, why it is experiencing a revival there currently, and why it remains so apparently stubbornly recalcitrant in its relations with the West. Religious nationalism is a part of the picture -- but focusing on that aspect to the exclusion of a broader, spiritual perspective provides a woefully incomplete, and therefore unsatisfactory, picture.In the end, the most complete picture the reader gains from &quot;Why Angels Fall&quot; is that of the typical Western/Secular view of the Orthodox Church. Clarke provides this in flying colors, and to her credit she does not hide her own views. Clarke is clearly upset at the political incorrectness of Orthodoxy (her choice to begin the work with a lament of her inability to visit Mount Athos due to her gender sets the tone for the book), upset at its doctrinal exactitude (exemplified in a heated chat Clarke has with an Orthodox Bishop, where she is clearly disturbed by his stubborn insistence on Trinitarianism), discomfited at the level of its faith, time and time again. Perhaps it is this discomfort with the &quot;religious&quot; aspects of Orthodoxy that led Clarke to focus on the more &quot;worldly&quot; aspects of the Church -- but, in any case, it was not lost on those with whom she spoke (one perceptive Serb Bishop noted that Clarke seemed awfully interested in politics for someone writing a book about Orthodoxy).Ultimately, because there are so few works on Orthodox Europe, Clarke's book deserves a read. But, to be honest, the most enlightening thing the reader will take away is an accurate portrait of how the Secular West views Orthodoxy -- not &quot;what makes Orthodoxy tick&quot;."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"Victoria Clark has written an interesting and perceptive travelogue of her journies to Mount Athos, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece, Romania, Russia, Cyprus and Istanbul and her interviews and encounters with Orthodox ecclesiastical officials, monastics, and believers.These journies were motivated by her desire to understand and make known the costs and ongoing liabilities in present-day Europe to both the Christian east and west of the Catholic-Orthodox schism of 1054 and its corresponding mutual mistrust. Her primary thesis is that this schism cost the west its heart and the Orthodox east its mind and that the two are unbalanced without one another. Sort of a journalistic &quot;two lung&quot; theoryClark makes these journies under the influence of her years as a journalist in the Balkans and Samuel Huntington's provocative thesis that present day history is a function of the clash of distinct civilizations including, western europe and Orthodoxy. Clark is not a Christian, but claims to be a theist. Most evident though, is her secular humanism.Clark frames these journies in terms of two forces in Orthodoxy, phyletism and hesychasm. Clark posits these as the basest and highest expressions of Orthodoxy and she journies about in order to see how these interact in contemporary Orthodox Europe.The great strength of this book is Clark's writing of her encounters with Orthodox who are expressive of either or sometimes both of these traits. She brilliantly evokes some of these personalities and makes their presence palpable to the reader.The great liability of this book is that Clark's theses don't take the Orthodox on their own terms but through the lens of Clark's secular humanism. As a result, one senses the frustration of Clark that the Orthodox &quot;don't get it&quot;, and the frustration in some of the people she encounters that Clark &quot;doesn't get it&quot;. To Clark's credit, she doesn't hide this. The most illuminating instance of this dynamic is Clark's interview with and subsequent reading of some answers that the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomeos provided for her at the end of her book. In it he posits the goal of Orthodoxy as being &quot;theanthropic&quot;, i.e. the communion of the human person with God. Clark seems a bit befuddled by this. Clark's secular humanism seems to want to reduce Orthodoxy to &quot;religion&quot; which is in service to European or &quot;World&quot; harmony or peace. But this entirely misses the point for the Orthodox.The missing presence in this book is Jesus, communion with whom is the reason for Orthodoxy, but who is not mentioned at all in the book. This fundamental disconnection makes for interesting, well-written but ultimately frustrating encounters as Clark insists on her secular humanist viewpoint which necessarily distorts the people she is trying to understand and explain. Fr. Ugolnik is correct in his observation that the book is very interesting for how Orthodox are viewed by secular humanists."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"Victoria Clark is a reporter, not a specialist, let loose in an area she is not always competent to analyze. Yet that's precisely what most westerners are when they plunge into the countries nurtured by the Christian East. People in the west (including the US State Department) often assume that religion is of marginal importance in these places. Clark proves them wrong, in lively and readable prose. Her reactions are predictable, even naive at times to those with experience in East Europe. The justification for western attitudes seems self evident to her. Yet even for an Orthodox Slav like myself, she is an excellent indicator of the hidden gaps in communication between east and west. This book is a must for anyone interested in the Balkans or Russia. I hope those who make policy read it, and then decide to go further in understanding the phenomena and places she discusses. (It's also a great book for Orthodox Christians who want to know how they're seen by others--and who want some insight into where their own darkest weaknesses lie.)"},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"I'm sure Victoria Clark's heart is the right place, and I certainly think Western Europe could do more to understand the Orthodox tradition (and vice versa), but there's so much in her book that seems to me to be point blank wrong, or selectively interpreted... Just a couple of examples...Her Byzantine history is essentially re-cast to selectively support her intepretation of the modern influence of Hesychasm on Orthodoxy today. She essentially states that Constantinople would probably not have fallen to the Turks without the 'defeatist' attitude of Hesychasm. Yet the final decline of the late Byzantine Empire has far more to do with A) the incompetence of Andronicus II; B) the civil war between Andronicus II and Andronicus III; C) the civil war between the Cantacuzenes (John VI) and Paleologi (John V); D) the arrival of the plague in the immediate wake of John VI's victory in the wake of that civil war; E) the hostility of virtually every neighbouring state (Orthodox, Catholic or Muslim) to the late Byzantine state. The controversy over Hesychasm hardly helped the stability of the late Byzantine state, but putting the blame for the events of 1453 on Hesychasm strikes me as nothing more than a distortion of existing historiography in order to suit a modern argument.Another worrying example of Clark's distorting way with words... In her matter of fact statement that 'In the eyes of Russian Churchmen today Boris Yeltsin had committed a far more heinous sin the Soviets ever had...' (pg. 273-4), she's stating that _all_ Russian churchmen believe that the decentralisation of the state and the advent of western consumerism are far worse sins that the advent of the Bolshevik state's official atheism. There are no doubt Russian clerics who believe that, just as there are undoubtedly Russian clerics who are fairly nasty anti-Semites (another favourite Clark theme), but to casually tar all Russian clergy with that sweeping generalisation? That strikes me as factually unsupportable - a recent interview with Metropolitan Kyrill of Kaliningrad and Smolensk (available in English on the Moscow Patriarchate's web page, though I concede the latter is hardly an impartial source) amply demonstrates that there are senior clerics who are deeply disturbed by the use of religion to justify extremist nationalist positions.Finally, Clark's implication that Orthodox history makes Eastern Europe uniquely prone to extreme nationalism simply doesn't work for me. There are many nasty nationalist movements in the Catholic/Protestant west, many of them deeply associated with their religious roots - Catholic nationalists in Croatia and the whole Northern Ireland dispute immediately spring to mind. And if we go back 30-40 years, we also have Franco in Spain... I think there's an argument to be made for how nationalist ideology has replaced communist ideology in much of Eastern Europe and central Asia, but I would strongly dispute Clarke's argument that the modern strength of this nationalism is somehow tied into a uniquely Orthodox mindset.All of which makes it all the more frustrating that 'Why Angels Fall' is otherwise a well-written, entertaining book, which does have some genuine insights into what makes Orthodox Europe different from Catholic/Protestant Europe. And her plea for a deeper understanding of those differences is certainly timely. It's just that, for all her years living in Eastern Europe, there's too much wrong with her supporting arguments and interpretations for her themes to be convincing.[mea culpa: I'm not Orthodox myself, but my wife is - and is the granddaughter of a Russian Orthodox priest at that. This may well influence my perspective on Clarke's book]"},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"There is a saying in Greece that translates roughly into \\"a priest should be a priest and a mule-owner a mule-owner\\". What it means in plain English is that a priest should be and act like one and a laic (non-priest) likewise. Ms Clark is a journalist who has ventured into an eminently difficult academic field without the background, discipline and method of an academic. If she had stuck to the \\"travelogue\\" part, her book would have been [with another title] an interesting read. She writes well and most people would be interested in how another person felt when travelling through such culturaly rich and aestheticaly pleasing lands.The \\"academic\\" part is another matter. The Patriach was kind enough to answer her questions, but when meeting him Ms. Clark felt as a pupil whose topic was interesting but \\"not altogether academically sound\\". Ironically one could not describe this book in better terms.Ms. Clark tries to understate the hellenic (greek) character of Byzantium. The word \\"Romaioi\\" on which she mostly bases this is the ancient Greek, scripture Greek and modern Greek word for \\"Romans\\". What she may not know is that Greeks have been calling themselves \\"Romioi\\" for centuries. She also overstates the \\"religious nationalism\\" or Phyletism (this translates into \\"tribalism\\" in Greek) aspect. Nationalism that goes beyond healthy national pride does exist but it is quite limited to few uneducated individuals in Greece. Outside Greece this was nothing but a reflex reaction to violent change.Overall such amateurish attempts to introduce Orthodoxy to the layman are quite damaging as the average non-Orthodox (or non academically knowledgable)reader would get a very misguided idea of our faith. Ms. Clark reminded me of an incompetent professor I know who is very good at lecturing but who does not realy understand what he is saying."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"As a Christian who is not Orthodox, but studies and is sympathetic to Orthodox beliefs and practices, I struggled with this book. It's frustrating when non-believers critique Christian topics because their very non-belief renders them unable to understand Christian life and culture. But since believers often can't or won't provide useful critiques of faults in Christian organizations and practices, who else but non-believers like Victoria Clark will do the job?Yes, Clark drags up embarrassing or even repulsive incidents in Orthodox history and paints an unflattering portrait of many of the priests, monks and nuns she encounters on her 18-month \\"pilgrimage\\" through several Orthodox countries. But by the end of the book Clark seems more sympathetic to the plight of a 2,000 year old body of believers who have suffered centuries of Islamic and, to a lesser extent, Western European dominance and persecution. Clark positively describes the growing vitality and energy associated with monastic communities in countries she visits. And she describes, although a little grudgingly, warm encounters with Orthodox clergy and lay people.A theme Clark explores which also troubles me is the tendency of contemporary Orthodox churches to emphasize nationalistic and even militaristic, as opposed to Christian, agendas. The seeming lack of Orthodox interest in missionary endeavors and converts is also disappointing, but seems consistent with the xenophobia Clark exposes among some Orthodox. It seems many Orthodox are more interested in maintaining their separateness, keeping their wounds unhealed and playing the martyr than building on and attracting converts to their community. If Orthodoxy offers the prospect of a superior lifestyle and superior way to worship and know God, which I believe it may, then why don't Orthodox more enthusiastically display this side of their faith to \\"outsiders\\" - or in some cases even their own nominal adherents? Then perhaps Orthodox, particularly in Russia, could stop whining about Catholics and Protestants \\"stealing\\" from their flock. The Apostles certainly were not afraid to competitively demonstrate the superiority of their faith in the religious hodgepodge of the Roman Empire.Clark's non-belief is humorous is some ways. Several times she marvels how some \\"coincidence\\" allows her to meet just the right person or make just the right connection to propel her research to a new insight. A Christian wouldn't be so surprised by such \\"coincidences\\". Near the end, reflecting on some of the admirable Orthodox she encountered, Clark writes, \\"They made me wish I could believe as they did.\\" Poor Victoria Clark... another soul unable to move beyond her dead end belief in postmodern, secular humanism.I do not recommend this book as your only source for information about Orthodox history and current affairs, much less theology and beliefs. But Orthodox and would-be-Orthodox should read it and ponder Clark's points as should anyone wanting to better understand the political situation in Orthodox nations."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"There's always something amusing about the outrage (usually masked as concerned sadness) experienced by non-Orthodox journalists who seek to make sense of a church that forbids, in its canons, the offering of the Eucharist to mimes. When a non-Christian, Western journalist gives it a try, the result is a book filled with wonderful inadvertent humor, but faint illumination.No faith tradition on earth is as politically incorrect as Orthodoxy, and few writers on earth are as politically correct as this one. Put those two things together and you have a pretty predictable book, one that could have been written without leaving home, about a church filled with funny hats and mystifying theology in a war-torn corner of Europe.I fear I have to disagree with Fr Anthony; we already know how secularists view the Orthodox Church. What would be helpful is to have someone with a more competent (not necessarily sympathetic) view of both the region and its religious traditions make the effort Ms. Clark has made.For those who wish to have a more serious, more interesting and more helpful view of what has been happening in the Balkans for the last few hundred years, consult Timothy Ware's The Orthodox Church and Sir Steven Runciman's histories and travel memoirs."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"I brought this book during my geneology project. I wanted to know more about the countries that some of my ancestors called home and their traditions (especially religious) Unfortunately, although this book was easy to read, the author seemed to bash Eastern Europe. For me, it was saddening. I wanted to know more about my history and didnt find anything too pretty in this book. Maybe the truth just hurts, but I am moving on to some other books about Eastern Europe and Orthodoxy to get another opinion. This was disappointing as the first book I read on Eastern Europe. The author did work hard though, and I did learn at least one side of the story, so I have to give some credit."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"This book begins with the author feeling oppressed that she cannot get on to Mt. Athos. Athos like most monastic environments is segregated by gender. (I can't enter the clositer-enclosure of a convent of Carmelite nuns either). This diatribe aginst the Holy Mountain and its 1000 year old traditions signals the author's extreme bias against Orthodoxy Orthodoxy is seen as the source of all the evils and problems in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe. If you are looking to understand Orthodoxy avoid this book and read something by Seraphim Rose or Timothy Ware."},{"Title":"Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe From Byzantium to Kosovo","review":"This book is an interesting but fatally flawed look at Orthodoxy in today's world. As other reviewers have noted, Clark does not try to understand Orthodoxy on its own terms, but rather collects evidence in order to support a thesis taken in part from Samuel Huntington's Manichean world view. Clark describes her book better than I can, as one \\"that seeks to manufacture crudely clashing antitheses at the expense of a deeper understanding of any subject.\\" (p. 411)I myself am not Orthodox, but I am a Russian historian, and I was frankly dismayed at her section on Russia, which has many factual errors. For example, she says that in 1917 the Russian tsar was overthrown despite being seen as a sanctified monarch. It is just a basic fact, found in any textbook, that the massacre of Bloody Sunday in 1905, meant that the people began to question and often outright reject this idea of the tsar as sanctified.Many times when she was interviewing Orthodox people, I wondered why she was writing about a phenomenon about which she refused to change her ideas. I've given it two stars because the travelogue aspect of the work is interesting and she does provide a sense of place. However, the ideas and the people don't receive anywhere near as good a treatment."},{"Title":"Nathan Coulter: A Novel","review":"This, Berry's first novel and the first to introduce his fictional Kentucky community Port William, displays the skill Berry shows as a poet. Not a word is wasted here; every one of them counts toward the whole. As with good poetry,as much is implied as stated outright here.This is a story of initiation, of a young boy's coming to grips with his family and community and his own place in them.

Berry's books aren't shoot-em-ups; if you are looking for fast paced action, sex scenes and supermen heros, then read something else. (This is true of each of his books I have read).

Her ability to get inside the head of her characters and describe their feelings and surroundings is one of her strengths. However, in her novel on the life of Paul (Saul of Tarsus), I can't help but feel Caldwell's profuse prose detracts from the forward progress of this book. Simply put, the book is too long. The story of Paul is an interesting one, but far too long to hold my interest throughout the course of this lengthy book. So many pages are dedicated to developing Saul's early life, to set the stage for what is to come. There were too many times early on in the book that I questioned whether I wanted to continue. I actually skipped many pages of diaglogue to move along the story narrative. I kept thinking that I wished this book could be condensed down perhaps 50%, and then accidentally, I found this very book in the Reader's Digest Condensed Version, and found it much more readable. If you are interested in Caldwell's story on the life of Paul, and you have limited time, then I suggest you seek the condensed version found here: Reader's Digest Condensed Books: Kim A Gift from Vietnam; Bless the Beasts and Children; Great Lion of God; I Chose Prison; Fiona.

Covering the period 1820-1950, this is a canon of extraordinary, varied richness in all culture, never mind French poetry, from the Romantic movement (Lamartine, Huge) to 'Negritude' (Cesaire), and encompassing Surrealism, Symbolism, Lyricism, Cubism, Metropolitanism and Modernity, the Parnassian movement etc. All the giants are well-represented - Baudelaire, Mallarme, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Cendrars, Michaux etc - but the collection's real joy is its recuperating journey of poetry's byways, finding forgotten figures, curiosities, one-offs, such as Tristan Corbiere, Anna de Nouilles, or Charles Cros. Dip in at any page, and you will be treated to poetry of unmatched beauty, strangeness and invention.After a brief introduction explaining his selection process, and an invaluable technical note on the 'alexandrine', the dominant metre of French poetry, editor/translator William Rees divides his material into historically discrete sections, prefacing each movement and poet. These essays are an accessible mine of invaluable historical, biographical and cultural information. His prose translations, although 'poetic' in themselves, are much preferable in their more literal accuracy, to those translators who abandon faithfulness for some vague notion of 'spirit' which usually only leads ot silliness.

For years now, I've discovered many exciting variations of poetry through the writings of the more widely known French poets such as Lamartine, Hugo, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Laforgue, Cendrars, and Apollinaire. In this collection of some 56 poets writing between 1820 and 1950, William Rees brings together many other influential and somewhat less widely known poets such as Corbiere, Nouveau, Jammes, Heredia, and Supervielle, together into a developmental chronology of modern poetry. This anthology is perfect for readers unfamiliar with the variety of French poets writing in this 130 year period, and who are open to new possibilities. There are brief biograhpical essays on each poet represented, as well as on the &quot;movements&quot; they are associated with, if at all. The introduction simply describes Rees's pragmatic intentions in translating often untranslatable verse into prose, and also includes a brief historical explanation of the alexandrine.I've found the anthology to be quite useful when read from beginning to end without dwelling on each poem or poet. In this manner, a reader will gain a general sense of poetry's parallel development with each passing decade or era. Another reason I like this anthology is that it allows one a taste of the bountiful personalities and styles of poetry being read and re-read all the time, and thus, integrated into contemporary poetry whether it be English, American, or African - wherever there are good students. On the whole, and intended or not, it is an instructive and insightful compendium displaying the purpose and essentiality of poetry to civilization. Despite the inherent problems with translating foreign poetry into another language, the content of the poems shine through in their English prose translations; and anyone with a smidgen of French can compare the author's originals to their translations. An exciting time-period in which one writer after another affects the next, and in many places, influence one another side-by-side. Read it straight through, or thumb through it like a phone-book to dial into a brand new personality and take on life. Any which way you decide, there are broadly influential contacts here anxiously awaiting fresh readers with whom to converse, debate, or share timeless thoughts and ideas with."},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of French Poetry: 1820-1950; With Prose Translations (Penguin Classics)","review":"You'll have a hard time trying to find a better introduction to French poetry than William Rees' book. The poems are presented in its original French version and they are translated into prose. Reese doesn't bother with a cumbersome, most often inaccurate verse translation, which I find perfectly fine to respect the authenticity of the poets' intention. Here you will find the best poems of the best poets from the Romanticism onwards.

There is plenty of cultural, historical, and literary context for each movement, as well as introductions to each author and suggestions for further study. Each poem has a page by page translation to help with vocabulary building, but no other critique offered on the poem itself.I like the book because it is well balanced but allows the reader to explore at his or her own pace.

The explanations of the movements were not often very informative and very hard to understand due to the references they make but never explain. I learned very little from reading this book.

The book was instead a situational paranormal mystery.Jazz, the lead character, reminds me an awful lot of Anita Blake, without the zombie raising ability. She's strong, pithy, and loyal. She has dangerous enemies and strong friends.Supporting characters - like Lucia, Jazz's new detective partner, Ben, her jailed former partner, Manny, Pansy... are quirky but believable and likable. The love interest isn't as well formed as he should be for a romance - and the relationship takes second place to the paranormal sitch.The thing that disappointed me most, though, was the cliffhanger ending. I hate nothing more than a book which insists I buy a bunch of other books.This one, though, was a good read.(*)>"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"After devouring all three of Caine's Weather Warden series (if you haven't read them yet, go buy Ill Wind right now! Now!) I had high expectations for this book that weren't quite fulfilled. I'm not sure why--it was an interesting plot, interesting characters, etc. I just never really sympathized with any of them, except for one secondary character who happened to be in jail as a serial killer. Hmm. While this is definitely worth a read, and I'll check out the sequel, I can only give it three stars, because it just doesn't have the verve and hook that her other books do."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I know, the phrase *I couldn't put this book down* is a clich&eacute;, but I really had a huge problem putting Devil's Bargain down. I'm a fan of Ms Caine's Weather Warden series, so I thought I'd try this one, hoping it would be just as good. To my surprise, Devil's Bargain is even better.I've been reluctant to read the Bombshell line, for fear it would be shoddy writing under the Harlequin/Silhouette label, I am happy to say that this is not so. The imprint seems to be hiring the best. This is not what I'd consider a chic-lit book and has a reasonably good mystery attached, that even male readers might enjoy.Devil's Due, the second in the series, is out in January."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"let me preface my review by stating:-I own hundreds of books, so if a book doesn't grab me, out it goes. That being said-I quit Devil's Bargain about half way through.The writing was enjoyable the first 50 pages or so, but I personally didn't like how the main character, who was all kick butt at first, turned internally whiney and full of self doubt as soon as the other female character entered the picture. I was dissappointed that such a seemingly self assured heroine turned wimpy as soon as Lucia-who the author really plays up as extremely beautiful-meets her.The character Lucia turned me off as well, as she was written very coldly. The hero, or romantic lead is bland, and seems to have his own agenda, leading the heroine blindly into some dangerous situations, but evasively telling her to \\"watch out\\"-blech!!All that aside, I just found the story inplausible-this \\"dream\\" offer of a private eye firm quickly turning into a life or death situation-both heroines almost killed, and no idea or hint as to why.It may get better, I'll never know.3 stars for a pretty good start."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Lightning strikes again for the talented Rachel Caine (author of the best-selling Weather Warden series) in this fresh, tense thrill-ride. Devil's Bargain is an honest to goodness face-hugger of a read, the kind I can never find enough of and am oh-so-grateful when one does come down the pike. My hat is off to the publishers for bringing in skilled writers of this caliber who can deliver edgy, believable characters and a clich&eacute;-free page-turning story. Make sure you set aside enough time to read it in one sitting. I'm not kidding here, it made me late for work!This book is more than strong enough to stand on its own in the mystery/thriller genres, written in a clear, crisp style that made the read seem like I was watching a movie in my head. I've enjoyed the other Bombshell books, but this one has significantly raised the bar. Caine's secret? Really cool characters, true to themselves to the point of risking everything to do what's right. Good choices, bad choices, they deal with the consquences, however crazy it gets.Jazz, the heroine, is by no imaginative stretch a shrinking violet. How many dames do you know who take on drunken bikers on their own turf---and win? To be fair, she had the upper hand since she'd not yet had her coffee. The hero, James, is a match for her, balancing her raw power and passion with stubborn courage, a clever wit, and a sexy glint in his eye. (Not to mention that killer wardrobe.) There were times I wanted to toss a net over Jazz and jump his bones myself, he's so hot. It's clear to everyone he's fallen for her at first sight, but Jazz is the last to figure it out. (Hey, she's BUSY taking out bad guys, okay?) In lesser hands this wouldn't fly, but Caine's deft word-craft not only has her getting breezily away with it, makes you love it, and leaves you hungry for more, more, more.I hope there will be more to come from this awesome writer!Now please excuse me, I'm going to re-read this one again."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"No need to get into a detailed plot synopsis here as other reviewers have already done that quite skillfully. Suffice it to say that Devil's Bargain is yet another action-packed thrill ride of a read from author Rachel Caine. Fans and newcomers alike will be delighted with her skill at combining powerful, emotional and deeply-grounded characterizations with sensitive, penetrating and up to the minute dialogue. The main players fairly leap off the page, and their stories unfold against a backdrop so vivid, you almost feel as if you're right there watching them.The plot does take a bit of time to get going, and is heavily laced with a mystical or maybe even futuristic bent. Kind of like a fusion of \\"X-Files\\" meets the current TV hit \\"Numb3rs.\\" It may take a bit of work to follow, but it's intriguing enough to hang in there for some big payoffs in the end. There's exposition here. A lot of it. But I understand this is the first in a new series from Caine, and if her Weather Warden novels are anything to go by, I know that each new installment is likely to build on the strengths of the last. With Devil's Bargain, we've got Jazz Callender, Lucia Garza, James Borden and their world. Now it's time to bring on the stories. I can't wait to see where we're going next, and for me, that's good enough for five stars."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Devil's Bargain is a book written by Rachel Caine of Morganville Vampires fame. I didn't really have any high expectations going into Devil's Bargain and yet I was still disappointed. I was looking for a fun, and light paranormal mystery that I would enjoy but Devil's Bargain just didn't fit those requirements. Devil's Bargain takes the cake for being my least favorite book of 2013 (so far).Jazz's partner in crime been committed of murder and she is pretty much a wreck. Soon she makes a deal and starts to receive red envelopes with weird investigation cases.I didn't like Jazz or any of the characters much at all. All of the characters in the Devil's Bargain were bland, undeveloped, and just uninteresting. I couldn't make a connection with any of the characters because they were just so uninteresting. It was extremely stupid how Jazz decides to check out of the hosptial against the doctor's orders. Why does Jazz call James counselor every five seconds? Jazz is just your typical investigator and Lucia is just your typical partner in crime. How do Lucia and Jazz become best friends in literally 30 seconds? Right after meeting each on a plane , they become best friends and start doing everything together. Jazz and Lucia's friendship was beyond ridiculous and it really infuriated me.I am not sure how Devil's Bargain is considered a romance or mystery. There is zero romantic chemistry between any of the characters and James Borden was one of the worst love interests I have read about. The mystery in Devil's Bargain is lacking and so is any suspense. The fact that Jazz is an investigator, doesn't automatically make this book a mystery. I felt like the entire book was Jazz just going on random cases without a true purpose. We never really learn much about James Borden at all and there was no true devil in this book. How can you have a book called the Devil's Bargain and lack a devil? It would be fine if there was a metaphorical devil but there is no metaphorical devil either.Devil's Bargain was one of the worst paranormal books I have ever read to date. This book lacked any plot, tension, or anything memorable about it. The characters were one dimensional flat characters that lacked any depth, emotion, and personality. I felt like my ARC of the Devil's Bargain was missing a huge chunk of the book because there was no mystery or romance. There was little conclusion and I felt like nothing was actually resolved in the end. I would not recommend this book to anyone and now I am questioning whether I should read Glass Houses."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I decided to read Devil's Bargain because it was written by the author of one of my favorite series, the Weather Warden series. I am sad to say I was very disappointed in this book. The plot of the story was pretty original and interesting enough. The biggest problem I had with this book is the main character, Jazz.Jazz is very unlikable. She is mean, rash, angry, bullheaded, short-tempered, and stubborn. I have no idea why James Borden would hold any iota of liking for her. At one point she slams him into a wall and twists his arm behind his back because she didn't like what he had to say. Than she is feeling all hot and bothered as she does so. Furthermore, Jazz is always insulting and belittling poor James even when she knows it hurts and upsets him. I love books where strong woman are the main characters, but not when they are angry and mean to the people who are supposedly on their side.The other problem I had with this book is the lack of romance. I like all types of genres so a lack of romance is no problem. The problem I had is the fact that I am buying a romance book so expect romance. Jazz spent very little time with Borden so any romance that was actually prevalent caused it to feel forced and fall flat.Lastly, the ending wasn't well written. It seemed rushed and sloppy and left me feeling like there should have been at least another 50 pages, if not more.I am glad that Rachel Caine was able to improve her writing style and more importantly her characters for her Weather Warden series. I will probably still read the 2nd book to this series since I have already purchased it, but don't think I will be reading it anytime in the near future."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I am a fan of Rachel Caine's Weather Warden series and decided to check out this new series she has in the works by Harlequin/Bombshell. I found this first book to the series really enjoyable and could not put it down.First off, Caine has written some really interesting characters- Jazz, Lucia, Borden, Manny- all are different yet believable and work well in the context of the greater story.The plot setting was interesting as well, and I was intrigued by the Cross Society, the idea of Leads and Actors. The questions and suspense kept coming and by the end of the book you are left scratching your head over the mystery and where it is leading.All in all, a great story. This book is different from her Weather Warden series but just as well written and interesting. At best I would call this a paranormal mystery series in the works. So if you are a fan of Caine's, check this new series out and for the price it is a really good bargain!Great job, Ms. Caine!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Oh man. Each book I read by Rachel Caine reminds me just why I love this author so very much. The dialogue flows naturally with just the right amount of wit and freshness, the plot and action doesn&#8217;t let up, and the mystery and tension just keeps on coming.For our main lead, we get Jazz-don&#8217;t-call-me-Jasmine, who&#8217;s hit rock bottom, but is still digging &#8211; her world was rocked when Ben, her partner, was convicted of murder. One part denial, two parts wishful thinking, she&#8217;s desperate to find proof of his innocence, unable to come to terms with the fact that she might have been so terribly wrong about him.

He offers her a chance to make her dream of owning her own detective agency come true, fully financed by his employers, if she agrees to conditions, among them, taking on Lucia Garza as her partner. Jazz is leery, as is Lucia, and at first, the two women do not get along, but they agree. Every so often, a red envelope arrives, notifying them that their mysterious benefactors have a job for them. When they finally get some answers to the why of the whole operation, neither of them likes it. The Cross Society has enlisted them because in the game of life, they are Actors, not Chorus, and their pet psychic has said they are also Leads. The Society uses their Leads to work against their enemy, but neither Jazz nor Lucia wants to be used. However, this is not a game one simply walks out of.**** There's a harder edge to this book than to Ms. Caine's Warden or Morganville novels. That does not make it less of a story, it simply demonstrates her versatility. The plot builds slowly, hooking you on the intrigue and drawing you in until you find, like Jazz does, that there's no going back. You have to see how it ends. When it does, once again, Ms. Caine proves she's a master of the cliffhanger. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"There is not much I can add to what has already been said about Devil's Bargain, but I haven't enjoy a book like this in a long time!

The only stipulation is that she partners with Lucia Garza, a former USAF Security Police Officer Law Enforcement Supervisor who she has never met. Though she does not like knowing more about these enigmatic benefactors, she agrees to their terms.After a less than amiable first call between the two tough females, they agree to meet though they are across the country from one another as neither trusts their unknown benefactor. However, the 100K check they already received is good so the duo agree to the terms. As the two sleuths conduct an investigation for their new employers, the case turns dangerous. James tries to help the women, but neither Jazz nor Lucia wants a civilian in the way. Someone wants the inquiries stopped or else; but these two tough females are too obstinate to back down over a threat even if it is to them.Though the investigation is convoluted and starts relatively late, readers who appreciate strong female action heroines will want to read DEVIL'S BARGAIN.

She needs the money. And they know it. What's she gotta do? Just follow the directions that are given to her via a red envelope. Jazz isn't alone though, she's been given a partner, whether she likes it or not, Lucia who is the opposite of Jazz in every way. But one thing they have in common? They're both being offered something they both really want. All they have to do is sign on the dotted line. And they minus well be signing in blood.Devil's Bargain is the first book in the Red Letter Days series. It starts off with a bang. Jazz gets down and kicks some ass. All while being buzzed. Pretty badass, right? Rachel Caine slowly drags you into this mysterious world, where people are chess pieces and that opponents playing are masterminds, so to speak. Psychic more like it. Moving ponds and knights where they see fit all to gain the upper hand in this deadly game. While this book starts off with a bang, Caine leads you in slowly. But there is no lack of entertainment. Caine has a firm grasp on you, slowly baby feeding you tidbits of information so that you're not lost.When you start the book you kind of get the feel and you think you know who the bad guy is, but as the story moves along, the game changes. Ponds are taken off the game board. Knights are defending the queen and king. Rooks are moving stealthily...and then BAM the story changes with it. More information is revealed and you're stuck with a \\"wtf just happened\\" kinda face. There is romance in this book. Like the story itself, it's slow in building, but it is building. It's not a big part of the story, but I do get happy when these little scenes come up in the book (My ever beating heart dying for romance lol). When the book ends you're left at a cliffhanger. The final red envelope of this book has you at the edge of your seat wanting more.I would definitely recommend this book. While browsing NetGalley I saw this beaut and just HAD to request it! And I was approved *happy dancing* I'm no stranger to Rachel Caine, I love her Young Adult works (Morganville Vampires) as well as her Adult works (Weather Wardens). Rachel Caine has no problem working her magic with words and delivering a story with a world so different, you kinda actually wish you lived in it.

Thank You!34-year-old Jazz is sitting in a bar when a man approaches her and hands her a red envelope. In the envelope is a check for a 100 thousand dollars and a letter saying she should partner with an unknown agency to open the private investigator's office that she has been wanting to open. Jazz and her new partner Lucia are very suspicious of the job offer. Jazz is attracted to the Lawyer Borden but she is pretty sure he is keeping something from her. There is a strange explanation regarding Actors, Choruses and Leads. Some people are important and cause ripples. Then it is explained that the world will end and Jazz is one of two people who can prevent this catastrophic apocalyptic event. This book ends on a cliff hanger so now I'm mad and have to find the next book. I wasn't really liking the story so much, the flow seemed off to me. It seemed to me that the story would work much better as a t.v. series then a book. It reminded me a lot of some t.v. shows that I have seen before."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Disclaimer: I received this book as a galley courtesy of the publisher in exchange for an honest review.First let me point out, this is an adult read. It's not YA like her other well known Morganville Vampire series. Even though I liked the first book in that series, I really enjoyed this book much better. I read Devil's Bargain in two sittings, it would have been one if I hadn't had other things to do.I'm not sure how to categorize this book and that actually bothers me! It's definitely not your traditional urban fantasy story. No vamps or werewolves. No witches or magic. But there are one or two supernatural-ish themes going on, so it does live in the paranormal realm. It's not \\"hot\\" enough for paranormal romance, so that's out. Mystery is an option, but there isn't one central case being worked on, so I'm not sure about that....Yet, the cover art screams paranormal. This book is a doozy to place in a genre. With that said, Urban Fantasy it is! :-)This book starts off at a fast pace with Ex-cop Jazz and former FBI agent Lucia's being offered a nice amount of money to partner up with each other and open a PI firm. The story is told from Jazz's POV, so we learn more about her world and recent past along with seeing her take on their new firm and investors. I love Jazz and Lucia working together. They are very similar with the way that they think while working, yet very different personalities and styles. I don't think I've ever read a book with with two female leads. Let alone to hard core, kick ass ladies, which was very fun to read. I could tell immediately that they would make good partners and friends. It's clear that when Jazz and Lucia take the deal, they aren't entirely comfortable with the arrangement nor the Cross Society. Yet, they take the money anyway, then later find that their benefactor is basically a man who's been convicted of murder and has some crazy ideas on how the world works.The roots of story includes psychics and people termed as Actors and Chorus, which are basically used classifying people as active or passive. Either what you do make a huge impact on the world or it doesn't and your just a singer in the chorus line. According to their theory, everyone is an Actor once in their life, some have a longer turn than others. Clearly, Jazz and Lucia are Actors. They receive red envelops which contain various jobs and/or tasks which they have been instructed to do. By accepting these red letters from their benefactor, the Cross Society via a law firm, they change the course of events in the world on some level or another.I also enjoyed he secondary characters. Their assistant Pansy, her ex partner Ben, the sexy and mysterious lawyer James, Jazz's contact Manny who is a bit loopy and reminds me of the character Huck from Scandal, except the major difference is that Manny's scared of violence and criminal cases. You know the type, socially awkward, sensitive, a loyal friend, but sort of messed up in the head.My only complaint is that it ended a little too abruptly. I've already started the next book, Devil's Due, which reads from Lucia's side of things and picks up exactly where this ends. I've looked in to this series hoping to read more adventures with these two ladies, but sadly, I looks like the series ends with book two!If you like a bit of mystery and want to read a different take on the urban fantasy genre, this book is for you.

How ever this book left me wondering what was going on. 1st thing that through me off a little bit was the level of ... for a lack of a better word right now... macho-ism was completely switch. I found Borden, sexy, but very Sissy, and Jazz tougher then nails. But opposites do attract, right? He kinda grows on you after awhile. Anyways The Plot and pace was another place I had some problem getting into it. there was a lot of setting up of the investigating business, and not too much action going on. There was a hint of romance. I was hoping it would go on a little more, but it ended. So my conclusion is maybe this is just a book to set up the series. The writing style was excellent. I have the 2nd book. Both provided for an honest review, so Stay tuned to see what the next book has in store. - Were Vamps Romance"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I liked Devil's Bargain but I agree with other reviewers who say it's a difficult book to categorize. There's very little paranormal (especially in this book; there's a bit more in book #2, Devil's Due), there's very little romance, and there's very little detecting. It was also originally published in 2005 so it's a bit tame by today's standards. However, I still enjoyed it. I like the writing style and the story kept my interest. Unfortunately, book #2 wasn't quite as good but that's a review for another time and place.Disclaimer: I received the Kindle book in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I enjoyed this. I really like mysteries and Private Detectives. We get the perspective of Jazz Callender, a former cop who's partner was was convicted of a crime he didn't commit (supposedly). The plot was actually really cool. We start of with action and through out the novel we experience a lot of gun fights and hand to hand fighting. The book starts off in a bar that Jazz is drinking at and she is interrupted by James , a lawyer, who wants her to open up a private detective's agency with Lucia (who was picked by the firm that he works for). Throughout the novel, the firm gives them little \\"missions\\" like watching someone or taking pictures. They find this extremely weird, but they accept it because without the firm they wouldn't be able to have established their agency as well as meet each other.Anyways, the story was action packed and a great page turner. The plot was interesting and the characters were complex and almost complete opposites of each other. Jazz is like your girl-next-door tomboy while Lucia is this glamorous spy and they work really well together because they are each others complements and opposites.Lucia and Jazz were awesome but my favorite character had to be Manny. He is the FBI's most respected forensic analyst but now because of his past he works privately and VERY securely and SAFE. He is what I would consider that safety base. Lucia and Jazz go to him when they need help with forensics as well as when they need a safe place to be, because they became targets thanks to their very friendly and mysterious lawyers!The book was packed with action and the plot flowed very well from one scene to the next. And the cover looks awesome, doesn't it?Overall: 4.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"It a while ago, october last year again that Rachel Caine released her new book Devil's Bargain. I somewhere read it was already published in 2007. But don't know where. (will get back to that later). Devil's Bargain is the first installment of this fantastic new Urban Fantasy series, Red Letter Days. Although I was looking forward reading it and was planned to do so a lot sooner, I only now had time to actually read this first book of this daring series.Rachel Caine\`s main character Jasmine Callender, also called Jazz is on the in not in the best financial shape. As former homicide detective, she's lost it all: her former partner's been convicted of murder, she's been cashiered out, and she's drinking away what little self-respect she's got left in lousy bars.Just when this new bar she is hanging out is starting to grow on her, a strange man walks in looking for her with a fateful red envelope in his hand, and offers her a deal. A deal she can't say no to.The \\"Red Envelop\\" deal requires her to enter into a partnership with a for her strange FBI agent and investigate cases that arrive in special red envelopes from a mysterious firm..where this strange sexy man is working and later Jazz and her new partner realize they are working for someone with supernatural abilities and the assignment that come with the mysterious envelop, are even more strange and supernatural than that they initially thoughtIt's all about the Red envelopes with the thick paper note in it that really more feels like an expensive invitation, but it's not! And when those letters are commissioned by a convicted serial killer with a paranormal touch, Jazz finds out she is possible to stop people from dying depending upon what the future reveals about their actions.Rachel Caine created an exciting read with a lot of tension and missing info about the main characters backgrounds, enough to keep you hanging and looking forward to some background stories in the future books of The Red Letter Days Series.This story have the right ingredients for a thrilling Urban Fantasy. The paranormal aspects and some good plotting. Although Jazz is a regular Human, I am not sure how she kept herself standing during her up and downs in this thrilling ride. There is also a little romance. Jazz meets James Borden, he is a lawyer with Gabriel, Pike (a.k.a. the firm). He mentioned he had a girlfriend but that didn't stop Jazz obviously. Don't get your hopes up on a big romance thread. There is mentioned a kiss and a sentence, it was great yesterday, sore on all the right spots, more you will not get. But that is why it an urban not a romance But don't worry. Rachel Caine will keep you entertained all the way, you won't miss a thing.The CoverThe cover is just as the story goes. A large red envelope containing the new missions the girls are send out to solve. There is also a other cover running around with a girl face on it. Maybe this cover was to much fairytale/story telling'isch?? This cover does not represent the fast passed scenes and action Devil's Bargain delivers. But I like it!I recommend this to all Urban Fantasy readers.Paranormal Cravings REVIEW RATING: 4 Stars"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Devil's BargainRed Letter Days Book OneBy Rachel CaineAll Jazz wants to do is drown her sorrows, her partner is in prison for a crime he didn't commit, she has been shunned by most of the cops in the city, and she has just enough money left to get really drunk. While she is minding her own business a man comes up to her in his brand new leather outfit making him stick out like a sore thumb in the biker bar, but what is truly weird is the man knows her name and has an envelope for her. She has never been to this particular bar before and only just decided right before arriving.I have to say it, I loved Jazz, she is a smart mouth who can back it up but there is so much more to her than just that she is kind and caring even if she pulls her gun first and asks questions later. I wasn't sure what the story would be about as the synopsis I had read was fairly vague but it turned out to be a unique and fun read. I know Rachel Caine has also written the Morganville Vampire series, even though I have only read two of those I have to say that Rachel Caine is a truly surprising author. She has come up with two of the most original series that I have ever come across but not only that none of her books that I have read even come close to anyone else's. This book in particular you have great characters an amazing storyline all surrounding the good versus evil premise. This is certainly a must read and I look forward to what Rachel Caine has in store next.I was sent a free copy of this book for an honest review."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Devil's Bargain started out as a calm mystery and turned into an enthralling read. There is romance, a touch of paranormal, plot twists, and heart pounding action.Jazz used to be a decorated homicide detective until her partner was found guilty of murder. No longer on the force and unable to exonerate her partner, she has reached a low point. While schlepping at a dive bar trying to drown out some of the depression, she is approached by James Borden. He's handsome and completely out of place, but he comes bearing an offer. Take money to start a private investigation service, and be fully backed. The two requirements are that she partners with Lucia Garza, unknown to her, and give priority to cases given by Gabriel, Pike, and Laskins law firm. Jazz feels like there must be some catch and is reluctant to take their offer. So is Lucia, who has received the same offer. Lucia has an impressive resume working in law enforcement in some shape or form.They partner and the assignments they receive are a bit baffling and seem to be without purpose. They have instructions to observe and photograph people, when nothing seems to happen. Then things change and one of the surveillance jobs Jazz is assigned to ends up murdered. Can these assignments be the product of some type of foreknowledge? Is it possible they're being sent to prevent crimes? Larger forces are at work and Jazz and Lucia need to figure out what the heck is going on. What exactly did they sign up for?Like I said, this was a calm mystery to begin with. The first third of the book was relatively uneventful and even though it held my interest, I wasn't sure what was going on. By the time I got the second half of the book the action kicked in and I was anxiously turning the pages, anxious about what was going to happen next. Both Jazz and Lucia were likable characters, but this book focused more on Jazz. She was one tough cookie, able to kick some major behind, with her precision fighter skills. It's funny that she seemed tougher than her love interest, James, for most of the book. Yet, he wasn't threatened, and didn't take this as a bruise to his ego. I love a confident man, especially one in a well-fitted suit! Even though romance wasn't the main focus of this story, James manages to get Jazz's blood pumping whenever he's around.He stood up and loomed over her, and for some reason, that felt good. Safe. She let her gaze slide down him and had an instant appreciation for the way the black knit shirt hugged him. She had a sense-memory of soft skin, hard abdominal muscles fluttering under her touch as she'd checked him for broken ribs.Their relationship starts out slightly antagonistic, with Jazz being difficult and snarky, but there's no fighting their attraction!I enjoyed the easy friendship Lucia and Jazz fall into. It's so nice when female characters actually like each other and has each other's backs. There are some notable secondary characters, as well: Pansy, the office assistant and Manny the genius independent crime tech. He's paranoid from a truly horrifying experience, and majorly quirky in an adorable way.Devil's Bargain wasn't a particularly deep read, but it was a lot of fun and a quick read, at just under 200 pages. The next story focuses on Lucia, and I have to say I'm excited to find out what happens next. This was labeled as Urban Fantasy, but I would call it light UF. Not that I'm an expert on UF, mind you, but hey I'm coming along!A copy was provided by Harlequin UK through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I was provided with this book from the publisher for free via Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.Devil's Bargain is a dark and fast paced story that you won't be able to put down. Jasmine (Jazz) Callender is a tough as nails ex-cop at the end of her rope. She is approached by the James Borden, a lawyer with a unique deal for her. Jazz must team up with a stranger, Lucia, to accept missions delivered in a red envelope. Lured by the promise of money and dangerous odds, Jazz and Lucia accept and are plunged into a deadly world of deception and mystery. There is also a growing attraction between Borden and Jazz which develops gradually between each time they meet.The dialogue between Jazz and Borden is one of the best aspects of this story.\\"Okay,\\" she said at last, \\"let's say I let you guys pay for the medical stuff. This time\\"\\"There's going to be a next time?\\" Borden said, as he replaced the pitcher.\\"Could be.\\" She smiled wolfishly. \\"I tend to get into trouble, in case you haven't noticed.\\"\\"Hasn't escaped me,\\" he agreed. \\"Jazz...\\" He leaned forward, and clearly didn't know what to do with his heads. He ended up dangling them between his knees, looking lost. \\"You baffle me. You're all edges and angles and whup-ass, but...\\"\\"But?\\"\\"I don't know,\\" he said. \\"I hate seeing you like this. I feel like I got you into it, and I don't like it.\\"Oh Borden, how I love you. He's a genuine guy and I was cheering him on from the first moment he and Jazz met. They have such a witty banter together and the attraction builds between them at the perfect pace! Borden is not your typical male protagonist. Despite the fact Borden falls in the Beta Male category, he is able to hold is own against Jazz. Jazz knows that she can push Borden only so far before he walks away. The other aspect that I adore about Jazz and Borden's attraction is that they work well as a team. Like most heroines that I love, she has major flaws and actively works to get past them. Jazz learns to trust her partner Lucia and Borden making them an excellent team.This novel has a very subtle paranormal aspect to it. I don't want to say too much because it gives away major spoilers for the novel but, it's done in a very refreshing way!Lucia is another amazing character! She practically steals the show when she is featured. I'm hoping that we'll see a standalone novel with Lucia is a main character in the future!"},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"I became a fan of Rachel Caine I suppose the way that most of my fellow bloggers did and that would be through the Morganville Vampire series. That being said, the Red Letter Days is nothing like the previously mentioned series. That, my adult readers, is not a bad thing.If you first stumbled upon this review via my GoodReads page, you may notice the lengthy time frame that it took me to actually read this book. That time frame (Sept. 20 - Nov. 5) is no indication of how much I enjoyed this book. It has more to do with the way I had to read it, which was on my computer. *sigh* I know that it took me a while to read it, but even with the awkwardness of reading Devil's Bargain on my computer instead of my Kindle, I was still determined to finish. It was simply too good to abandon.I really liked Jazz as a female lead. She had spunk and her loyalty to her ex-partner was admirable. James and Lucia were interesting characters too. They all fit well together and the combination of personalities worked along with the rest of the supporting characters that were featured.Even with the great characters and story line, Devil's Bargain honestly did start slow for me. I can't tell you exactly when it picked up, but when it did, there was no stopping it. I reached a point where I just had to know what happened next. That combined with the ease of Rachel Caine's writing and the wit that she infuses her characters with made this a very entertaining read. Don't expect sexy vamps or teenage angst because this series isn't paranormal (not exactly anyway) or YA. However, it is an entertaining read with a touch of romance and plenty of action, danger and mystery thrown into the mix."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"The book...When I finished reading Devil's Bargain, I didn't know what to make of it. I liked it, but throughout the whole book I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.After thinking about it, I reached the conclusion that it was probably the lack of a strong fantasy/paranormal element, which was more present in the later chapters of the book. Before that, the story mostly centered around the mystery of the offer and the red envelopes. I remember thinking, \\"Ok, where are the superpowers, the visions, and the elements that don't make this book just a crime and mystery story?\\" But when I finally got to read about the psychics, it wasn't as thrilling as I thought it would be, but I still liked the book.I liked how the author applies terms we frequently use and gives them a meaning outside of what they are commonly used for. The author also pays a lot of attention to descriptions and that was sometimes great and other times I felt it made the book drag a little. But just as it was starting to get a bit slow, an action scene would come and save the moment. I like action and badass heroines, so it kept me interested.The characters...All the characters had their reason to be. Although, I'm not too sure about James. He was sort of bland and the damsel in distress. *sigh*I liked Jazz. She was sure of herself, yet when facing Lucia she was a little bit self conscious in the looks department. But she didn't let that slight \\"insecurity\\" consume her every second and did what she had to do without being petty or throwing tantrums of childish jealousy. Having said that, I did feel the need to shake her a few times. I also wanted to tell her \\"Think things through before you act!\\". She was very impulsive.Lucia, I also liked her. She was also badass in a different way than Jazz. She was a bit more controlled and thought about things better. Also, I'm wondering whether Lucia was from Hispanic or Portuguese descent because of the way some words were spelled, like \\"Hol&aacute;\\". I think in Portuguese it's \\"Ol&aacute;\\", but in Spanish it's \\"Hola\\". I don't remember it being mentioned in the book, or maybe I missed it. So, I'm a little confused about that.All in all, the book was an entertaining read and there was some humor which made me laugh out loud. I will be reading the second and last book in the series since this one ended in a cliffhanger.*I received an ebook copy from the publisher through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Jazz Callendar is an ex-cop with nothing really going for her until James Borden, lawyer, offers her a deal of a lifetime. James offers her a ton of money to start her own PI firm with woman she doesn't know. Jazz is skeptical, of course, because the only catch in the offer is she must go on investigations for obscure, elite society that come is red envelopes.I was not impressed by this book. I think there is great potential for this series but this first book is lacking. I think it could have been a much better story if some things were fleshed out better. The relationships and who or what the Cross Society is could have had more detail.I would like to read the next book in the series to see if the development gets any better but it will not be at the top of my reading list."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Cross posted from personal blog rabidgummibear.wordpress.comIf you were told that somebody would give you $100,000 start your own business as a PI after losing your job as a cop would you take it? Would you ask tons of questions or just move along with the deal? That is something heavily discussed in Devil's Bargain by Rachel Caine.We meet Jazz and James Borden almost immediately in this book. It starts off an interesting spiral into this crazy world where red envelopes deliver assignments. Jazz meets Lucia who she is supposed to partner up with to start the PI business. It's very hard to give much plot summary for this book though without spoiling it so I'm leaving it there. This book has almost two halves the first part is them making a decision the second half is the results of their decision.My biggest complaint is this book is literally like a prequel to the next book it feels like. A whole lot of setup that actually doesn't fully payoff in this book. Instead it feels like I will be reading the next book to find out more. They dangle the twinkie in front of your face about the Cross Society that leaves you curious. Just a frustrating to be left with a book that felt like a huge leadup to the next.I really liked the romance in this book though it was well placed and broke up the investigating cases nicely. The book has some great concepts including the Cross Society's setup which is extremely unique and different. I loved that part of this book. I just was clamoring for more by the time I finished the first one.Overall I'm definitely going to knock off some points for the fact this book was a massive lead up but it's still 3 out of 5 stars for me. I may pick up the second book at some point, but I'm in no rush. I recommend this book if you love the PI romance novel style books like Anita Blake but without the paranormal parts. It's a fun read and worth the cash."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"Reviewed by Guest Reviewer/Jessica & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogRetired Kansas City homicide detective, Jazz Callender is on her last straw. Her ex partner is serving time for a crime he didn't commit and she can't seem to find any proof of his innocence. To top it off, some of the officers involved in the case seem to still have it out for her. So what does any girl do when life throws her in the gutter? Drink of course. And that is what she intended to do until her plans got disrupted.When Jazz is given a mysterious red envelope with a promising arrangement by a sexy lawyer in disguise her world seems to go from zero to sixty in no time. Gone are the days where drinking away her sorrows was the only thing on her mind. Now she finds herself sent out on P.I. missions by the mysterious red letters and even has a new partner, ex FBI agent Lucia Garza. But as time goes on Jazz and Lucia realize that this little arrangement seems too good to be true and they want more information from their mysterious red letter sender. But the truth isn't what it's all cut out to be and the more they learn, the more danger Jazz finds herself in.Now, here are two Bad Ass chicks to put on the roster my friends! Jazz Callender and Lucia Garza! Jazz has a rough edge and she takes no bullsh*t. Period. Her mouth has no filter and her fist can knock you into next Tuesday. Lucia, well she is what I like to call a sleeper. You will never think that a polished looking woman can shoot you dead in two seconds flat. Not to mention her resume is impressive. With Jazz's sass, Lucia's class and the refreshing way they get along, it's not hard to see that these two are a powerhouse partnership that will go far!Devil's Bargain is filled with murder, mystery, bad ass chicks and a good ole kick in the head twist that will make you feel totally off kilter!

She is an ex-cop wanting to open her own private investigating practice to look into her ex partners case. Her reputation has been run through the mud thanks to her ex-partner getting convicted for murder. She still believes whole heartily of his innocence and has promised to solve his case.

This novel definitely doesn't disappoint. I quickly liked Jazz; she was witty and pretty kick-ass. I love Rachel Caine's heroines. I was trying to decide who I liked more so far Joanne (Weather Warden Series), Cassiel (Outcast Series), or Jazz (Red Letter Days Series). I want to lean towards Joanne, but really at the end of the day I can't decide. I love her leading ladies. John Borden as the love interest is pretty perfect. He is smart, hot, and definitely on top of things. They are definitely a steamy couple with sparks flying everywhere. One scene I was like who knew a hand holding scene could be so hot! I laughed out loud during so many parts of this book. My only problem was how big a jerk McCarthy turned out being; he didn't even seem grateful to Jazz. This was a pretty quick, fast paced read. I really do recommend it to people who like Rachel Caine books already and people who are new to her as an author as well. She really is one of my favorites. Add it to your Goodreads!Quotes:\\"Lucia's mock surprise was really too funny. \\"An honest lawyer? Now you really are making me suspicious, Mr. Borden.\\"\\"\\"He looked from one of them to the other, brown eyes bright. \\"You two really were separated at birth did you know that?\\"\\"\\"Just before the doors close, she said, \\"By the way?

The story was ok, but it doesn't really fit into any category because nothing was fleshed out. It's not really Urban Fantasy, because nothing fantastical happens. There is only one supernatural element, and it's a anticlimactic revelation of a third tier character. It's not a Paranormal Romance, or really even a Romance because there is some light flirting, then at the end of the book sex. It's not really a detective story because there aren't working a big case, just a few little one's they don't really tie together, there was no mystery for the character's to solve. It's odd, because things happen, but nothing really happens. The character's are likable and I am interested to see what happen's to them in the future. I like Jazz and Lucia, they are kick ass women. This books saving grace is that it's short. It felt like a really long synopsis sent to an editor, or a second draft of a book. Great idea, and hopefully for future installments the author can figure out exactly what she wants this series to be."},{"Title":"Devil's Bargain (Silhouette Bombshell)","review":"2.5 starsJasmine \\"Jazz\\" Callender life is in a downward spiral. Her former partner, Ben McCarthy, convicted and sent to prison for murder taints Jazz's stellar service as a homicide detective. Now she's unemployed, nearly broke, drinking yet remains determined to prove Ben's innocence using her dwindling resources. Her fate changes with a red letter offering her one hundred thousand dollars in seed money for an investigation agency with two stipulations: form a partnership with a stranger and investigate cases from a mysterious group called the Cross Society. Strange events indicate supernatural forces are at hand.With a juicy carrot dangling before Jazz's eyes, she does the smart thing, investigate. Jazz's credibility as a decorated detective shines through and slows the story's pacing to a crawl. Under the impression Devil's Bargain was a paranormal romance, I waited for the paranormal. Then I waited for the romance. It was a long wait!The relationship receiving the most development was Jazz building a relationship with her new partner Lucia. Both women demonstrated skill, quick thinking, and courage under fire. Then their plotline faded and moved in several directions - Jazz investigates Ben's case, the Cross Society, and the mysterious red letters & cases. It's rich in mystery. Ultimately, little is revealed by the story's end and my sense of this series' direction remained very vague as to its purpose.The Devil's Bargain settled comfortably into mystery fiction in an urban setting. The paranormal is tucked in the dialogue and alluded to in peculiar investigative cases. The romance made impractical appearances, especially with the lack of development between Jazz and her love interest. (I had to check the blurb to verify the hero.) The romance had unexplored possibilities - her dominance, their roles in the grand plan, his fateful choices - and short cuts were taken. Overall, book one of Rachel Caine's Red Letter Days showed it had an interesting seed at its core; unfortunately, there were a few too many underdeveloped possibilities.

Viewing this exhibit, which was held for a sadly short period of time in two different installments and was not widely publicized (because the owners who lent these delicate works did not want to expose them to any unnecessary risk of excessive light or excessive crowds creating an unacceptable level of humidity), was one of the most moving and unforgettable encounters with great art I have experienced. Jakuchi could apparently do anything--scrolls in the zen style which appeared to have been created with a single stroke of the brush, lavishly colored natural history renderings of plant and animal life, folding screens of incredible complexity created from joining innumerable tiny squares, wonderful representations of common objects such as vegetables rendered in ink with the greatest economy--it was an astonishing display of virtuosity and comprehension of life. Had an artist of Jakuchu's ability and talents worked in 18th century Europe, his name would surely be a household word as common as Rembrandt's. I purchased a hard-cover copy of this book from Amazon because the copy of the catalogue I acquired at the exhibit was absolutely worn out from repeated viewings and showings to others. I was surprised that copies could still be obtained. I believe this is one of two significant monographs on Jakuchu in English. The other one can be had for several hundred dollars."},{"Title":"Paintings of Jakuchu","review":"Jakuchu was a great artist and has been over shadowed by more well known Japanese painters/printmakers.

I bought this book for my son when he was three. I wanted it to teach him what anger is, some examples of situations which make you feel angry, and appropriate ways of dealing with anger. This book did just that.The book is written in the form of the song \\"Happy and You Know It\\" only it's Angry, obviously, and that is how the text goes. Each verse of the song is depicted with a child in a difficult situation. As I read each page to my son (or sang it) I would ask him, \\"Who is angry in this picture? Why is he angry?\\" and then the next page would show the resolution, what the child did to deal with their anger.Two examples from the book which I thought were great:One boy is being teased by a friend. His solution is to walk away. The teasing friend looks sad as the boy leaves.Another boy is having trouble building with blocks. His solution is to tell a friend. The friend then helps him build.This book really seemed to help my son understand that anger and frustration are a normal part of life that we need to learn to deal with. We have seen him deal with frustrating situations by actually quoting a line from the book."},{"Title":"School Reader Level 2: If You're Angry And You Know It","review":"This book is great for teaching in the classroom !

Scholastic usually doesn't let me down but it did in this case. The book discusses several ways of dealing with anger that are acceptable in some situations. However, most teachers and parents would agree that the coping strategies suggested aren't the best. I would have hoped that suggestions like, stomp your feet, would have been left out. Furthermore, one idea is to walk away (from a friend) and then on the next page is states to talk to a friend. Which is it? I feel that if young children read the book without discussing the story with an adult that they may come away with inappropriate strategies for dealing with anger."},{"Title":"Counter Sniper Guide","review":"This book is a must for retired military Veterans!

Here, scholastic philosophy thickens into stultifying langour what fleetingly reminds me of tamer moments of Pauline Reage's \\"The Story of O\\" with more than a hint of the artistic studies of awkward erotic acrobatics that both Klossowski and his brother, \\"Balthus,\\" delighted in.Since the tales do involve sex, I admit that parts intrigue me. Yet the naughty bits are few and far between. Little remains in the mind after reading many pages at a time. The pace slows, the plot staggers. There is a story buried in the second novella about the fall of Rome in 1944 that hints at a mixture of Kafka and \\"Open City,\\" Sartre and \\"The Night Porter\\" through an atmosphere charged with tension, but even this energy lessens under thousands of words of unrelieved speculation and intellectual discussion. This is not fiction so much as sketches. Suitably, if not altogether satisfactorily, Octave and Roberte keep journals-- hers notably closer to \\"O\\" and his nearer Sade crossed with Bataille (his mentor). Klossowski appears to tell us an elaborate setup, only to dupe us whenever we think we're getting nearer a punchline or a money shot. This delayed and postponed climax provides the form of the novellas and their content, but the sexual struggles under the philosophical. So, aesthetically this fiction can be explained, but it's not Anais Nin or even Violette Leduc. It's far more erudite, less erotic.Less engaging in realization than conception proves the endless neo-Thomist softcore in the first tale, expressing Octave's wish for his wife Roberte to open herself to any guest's lubricious \\"male gaze\\" and fawning caresses. This is an intriguing idea, a spin on what this fiction combined with others was issued as \\"The Laws of Hospitality\\" and which is partially translated here. But, this will titillate few readers with its vocabulary of \\"sedcontra\\" and \\"quidest,\\" amidst much learned banter of austerity, essence, accident, substance, and actuality.As an ex-Dominican seminarian turned scholar of Sade & Nietzsche, the formidably learned author may be writing more for his own delight in such rarified discourse than his reader. We truly are \\"incurable heirs of Augustinian Manicheism\\" (99) in our difficulty in rendering to the body what the flesh craves while serving the power of the spirit, and I understand Klossowski's mission as expressed by seductive Roberte \\"the Censor\\" and her erstwhile keeper Octave as stand-ins for Klossowski and his real-life wife! But, these paired novellas from 1953 & 1959 remain often too inert, too rarified. Like Sade, they jolt between high-end rationalization and low-end (if more willing here from Roberte's p-o-v) expropriation. But, unlike say Beckett at his best or Sartre in his fiction, the narrative often stalls and fails to ignite. What could have been exciting in its exploration of where the carnal swirls into the divine appears too haphazardly constructed and tediously conveyed.This book may pay re-reading. But my interest failed rapidly after pages of theological language obscured the potency of the body and the potential of the soul to break through the confines of the erotic. Klossowski's on to brilliant material, but at least in English, the prose is too clotted and the arguments too enamored of their own cleverness. He forgets the reader needs to be enticed by images rather than bludgeoned by ideas. The potential or actual (!) subset of those able to enjoy scholasticism and endlessly delayed, teasingly meticulous voyeurism I estimate as rather limited."},{"Title":"Roberte ce soir: And The revocation of the edict of Nantes","review":"A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaROBERTE CE SOIR and THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES: two religious-erotic/erotic-religious novels from one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, Pierre Klossowski.ROBERTE CE SOIR: Who is Roberte? To her nephew, Antoine, she is an austere and sexually prepossessing older sister. To her husband, Octave, she is an infuriatingly beguiling hostess. To any guest who traverses the threshold of their home, she is an open receptable for virility---strangely inaccessible and accessible at once. But Roberte is nothing, strictly speaking, in herself: she is a ceaselessly multiplying play of masks. Her self-multiplications enlarge infinitely. Purely mutative, purely transformative---who is she, really, in herself? To every man she encounters, she is the replica of his desires.Her sin, according to Octave (and the narrative!), is to have separated the spirit from the body. She is (according to Octave) both atheist (exclusive of the spirit) and a censor (exclusive of physicality). Quite appropriately, the prose is, at times, erotically informed (emblematical of the body); at others, theologically informed (emblematical of the spirit).THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES: In this second novel, Roberte speaks in her own language. We see her free from the one-sided interpretations that men have imposed upon her. No, she never separates the word from the flesh. She is word and flesh at once; like Klossowski's God, she is eminently communicable, absolutely self-transformative, the hypostatical union of three-in-one. And she never denied God, only the idol that men have made of God (God as an immutatable and incommunicable substance).THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES revokes every hypothesis that may be imposed on Roberte, Klossowski's muse and God. Like a tableau vivant (a living painting, a human sculpture), she dangles silently in space.The latter fiction folds upon the former. Together, they form a cartouche or an envelope.In these absolutely remarkable books, theological digressions (the spirit) and eroticism (the body) dovetail into a seamless flow of language. Together, they form a metaphysics of the flesh.Klossowski, my neighbor.Dr. Joseph Suglia"},{"Title":"The Greatest Good: Rethinking the role of relationships in the moral fiber of our companies and our communities","review":"The Greatest Good is a roadmap for improving the creative process regardless of the event or the environment. A quick read book, it provides a framework oriented to improve the end product deliverable. The book examines the 'creative interchange' concept as formulated by Dr. Henry Wieman to assist with achieving openness in communicating ideas, relationships and in everyday human encounters, including business, community and personal transactions.The authors through a unique format, present and revitalize Dr. Wieman's philosophical yet practical approach, and discuss many of the attitude obstacles and cooperation barriers experienced in the creative process. The book, through hypothetical conversation with Dr. Wieman, suggests every human has the same craving for respect and understanding, but learned, acquired and institutional training to the contrary have often blocked the delivery of the &quot;greatest good&quot; in the results or an end product. The book and its 'creative interchange' message combines common sense courtesy and the spirit of the golden rule and leads the reader to understand how to apply the combination to a goal-oriented challenge. For the individual or a task leader, implementing the authors' roadmap for Dr. Wieman's vision by having everyone rid themselves of their evasiveness defenses may be difficult and a challenge. From a personal perspective, it was easy to recognize how I had both knowingly and unknowingly employed evasive actions and attitudes opposite in spirit of the The Greatest Good message.The potential for improved results and a variety of fulfillment rewards from Dr. Wieman's work and the authors' guidance are within reach. The results and fulfillment rewards may be more easily claimed through increased awareness of or a willingness to try the 'creative exchange' process. In either case, the authors' provide a framework model for use in either a self-growth mode for the individual or for an entire organization.At various times during a lifetime, individuals and organizations are placed in leader and participant roles. Dr. Wieman and the authors illustrate how openness in the creative process can achieve the &quot;greatest good&quot; in either the leader or participant role. Employing the 'creative interchange' process appears to be a logical pathway for positive results by business leaders, family members, nations, communities and every talent pool facing a challenge.Clearly everyone wants more successes and fewer detours. If there is a desire for increasing the odds for success on the roads you drive ... read The Greatest Good, snap in your seatbelt and begin the 'creative interchange' experience."},{"Title":"The Greatest Good: Rethinking the role of relationships in the moral fiber of our companies and our communities","review":"Palmgren and Petrarca have written a book about the philosophy of Henry Nelson Wieman (1884-1975). Wieman's concept of creative interchange focuses on bringing authenticity to human dialogue and on appreciating and learning from what makes each of us unique individuals. Given current corporate scandals, the message is certainly important for members of corporations, and as the world gets smaller and globalization takes hold, our ability to appreciate and understand people who are very different from ourselves takes on increasing importance.The book relates a series of hypothetical informal interview between the authors and Dr. Wieman. The interviews are followed by narrative that summarizes and explicits Wieman's messages. The format is very readable and entertaining.Although not a thorough introduction to Wieman's thinking, this book is a good place to start. If everyone followed the central tenets of this book, our families, our companies, and our governments would be vastly improved."},{"Title":"Brave Men's Blood: The Epic of the Zulu War, 1879","review":"The Anglo-Zulu War is a subject often obscured from history and put under the broader picture of colonialism.

More than 15 years later, her photographs have been published as yet another of the many, many books commemorating the Academy's bicentennial.Ms Lippman is a good photographer, and the photos in this book (all black and white) include some interesting explorations with light and shadow, the mass nature of life in uniform, and the like. The cover image, as well as several others, is almost Hitchcockian. The minimal text strives for a kind of High Art ethos that often seemed out of place with what was actually being shown (kind of like those NFL Films efforts to turn football games into modern Iliads).Maybe I didn't take enough art appreciation courses in school, because as I looked at many of the images, my first response was to ask, 'What's going on?' There are a few pages of captions in the back of the book, but they're not always helpful (example: 31. Formation, Central Area). West Point graduates will probably be best able to understand what they're seeing, and maybe the images will be particularly evocative for them. But personally, I didn't feel compelled either to set this out on my coffee table, or to return to it again and again to absorb the masterful artwork. And apart from cashing in on the bicentennial, was there any particular reason to publish these images now, as opposed to fifteen years ago, or fifteen years in the future?"},{"Title":"Ducky","review":"If you were a man like David Wisniewski and you had just created the emotionally and physically exhausting Caldecott winning \\"Golem\\", (a book which deals with religious persecution and the very essence of what it means to be alive), it would be more than understandable if you wanted to follow that book up with one about a small yellow bathtub toy. Which is, of course, precisely what he did. While \\"Golem\\" was a vast creative epic that utilized his particularly original cut-paper technique to its best advantage, \\"Ducky\\" is a small clever story written by fellow Caldecott winner Eve Bunting and set through the eyes of a plastic toy on the high seas. It has emotional impact, beautiful illustrations, and a true story behind its tale. Altogether it makes for a delicious picture book.On the title page we see large wooden create being lowered onto what can only be the deck of an ocean liner. Turn the page and the ship is silhouetted against a sky, followed closely by an impending storm. Our story begins. As the duck himself says right off the bat, \\"I am a yellow plastic duck and I am in great danger\\". With the horrible storm, the crate containing Ducky and his hundred some fellow toys is released into the violent sea. The crate breaks apart and suddenly the water is filled with yellow ducks, blue turtles, green frogs, and what looks to be red beavers. The duck experiences great fear, particularly when a passing shark (rendered in its pupil-less-many-toothed glory) attempts to devour a load of toys. The duck notes that the shark does not seem too much care for getting plastic caught in its teeth, \\"though we are guaranteed non-toxic\\". Days pass and all the toys separate in the waves. Our lone hero bobs alone, night and day, past icebergs, fish, and pelicans, until washing safely ashore. A boy locates the duck with glee (it seems many residents of this Alaskan town along the coast have been finding and recording the lost bathtub paraphernalia). At long last the duck returns with the boy to his home and is placed in a bubbly frothy bath, thereby, \\"fulfilling my destiny\\".An author's note at the end records the 29,000 plastic toy animals that were washed off a ship in 1992 and how their arrival on the shores of North America aided scientists who wished to learn more about currents, winds and tides. But even if this were some inspired flight of fancy on the part of the writer, it would still make for a fabulous tale. Ducky has an odd wry way of speaking. He notes his predicament with great emotion and intensity. Feelings that kids reading this book will readily appreciate and understand. From the scary notion of being lost to the final arrival in a safe place, there's a lot to identify with in this book. Wisniewski really brings this story fully to life, though. His shark is a nasty frighteningly realistic critter o' the sea. But I was really taken with the beautiful shots in the book. There's an aerial point of view of Ducky from above red, yellow, beige clouds in what can only be the early stages of twilight. His sea is a beautiful pulsating series of blue and white images. Some artists work with cut-paper and make you wonder how they managed to create their elegant scenes. Others take this one step farther and let you forget that what you're looking at wasn't created by a computer or drawn by hand. Wisniewski does both.You're going to find quite a few rubber-ducks-lost-at-sea books out there (Eric Carle's, \\"10 Little Rubber Ducks\\" comes to mind) but this is the best of the lot. A fine collaboration between two Caldecott winning heavyweights it has everything a good children's picture book should have. Danger, excitement, and a happy ending advocating cleanliness (amongst other things). This rubber ducky is truly the one."},{"Title":"Ducky","review":"I really love this book.

Hundreds of toys have since been found in coastlands around the world, shedding light on our understanding of how currents, winds and tides interact. This book traces the story of one bathtub toy from the time its crate boards the ship until it is found by a boy in Alaska. The story draws young readers in by personifying the toy as if it is experiencing its journey as a sentient creature. Caldecott Medal Winner David Wisniewski illustrates the story in cut-paper collage, skillfully rendering the dramatic power of the ocean without being too frightening. This is an unusual story that may not appeal to every reader, but for those who prefer \\"real\\" stories or who are interested in science, it's a sure winner.

In addition, See is hilarious, generous, and writes as if it is easy, which we authors know is not so.I don't think anyone here wouldn't simply LOVE this book. Go, Carolyn See, may you have great success with this masterpiece filled with love, prophecy, sadness and most of all, somehow you managed to be hilarious all the way thru.You are my ideal writer. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"Smart, sophisticated and true-to-life in its treatment of characters' inner voices, See's narrative is a model of brevity and concision. There is a mood of wistfulness evident, for life in general and for these lives in particular. The opening's nostalgic mood reminds of Chris Isherwood's great A Single Man, while the story line of an epidemic that never quite arrives can't help but bring back a few flashes of DeLillo's White Noise.But the tour-de-force is the linking together of the very sensitive scenes with kids, grandkids, couples both young and not so young, of characters of all ages in fruitless struggle and showing hopeless strength against the slow but inevitable pace of existence. What is past has really passed, See is saying. The foreboding sense of a passing plague, the sense of a passing end to things, these characters' angst embodying their sensitivities as each one must decide what to save of his/her life, what to try and take as each passes through the present.As a father, I couldn't help but make my hero Edith's son Phil. That choice for me made Carolyn See's There Will Never Be Another You the perfect story of a father's responsibility--a \\"guy\\" book even. No matter age or gender, this book is a gift."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"This was an unexpectedly good book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down.

None of the characters seems able to engage with the world or with anyone in it in any meaningful way, they just drift off into thier own lonely, selfish, self imposed exiles. I found it sad and depressing."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"Centering on a group of characters all connected to the UCLA Medical Center, in Westwood, There Will Never Be Another You is a lingering and admonitory tale about people living on the edge, unhappy in their relationships and marriages, lonely for connection, yet also having to live with a post 9/11 mentality, the threat of further terrorist attacks - biological, chemical and even nuclear - never very far away.Told in alternative voices, the novel begins on 9/11 with a confessional by the sixty-four-year-old Edith, who is lamenting the loss of her second husband Charlie after an extended illness. Edith volunteers at the Medical Center where her only son Phil works as a seasoned dermatologist. Phil is unhappy in his marriage to the stunningly self-absorbed Felicia, and whilst the couple is outwardly united in their care for their two children, Eloise and Vern, petty squabbling and bickering ultimately define their marriage.Anxious to escape, but unable to figure out how, Phil finds solace in his vintage wine collection and drinking with his best buddy Jack, whilst the world around him steadily falls apart. A deadly virus or bacteria is breaking out in Los Angeles, purported to have started with monkeys, at first it only affected cats, and their carcasses have started appearing all over Phil's Westwood neighborhood.Later, certain people are affected and in the eventuality of a catastrophic calamitous breakout, Phil being a trained dermatologist, is ordered to participate in bio-terrorism experiments and tests designed to evaluate and improve this city's response to medical emergencies from radical threats.Meanwhile, Andrea, a sophomore at UCLA meets and falls in love with Danny, an Asian American, who is at the hospital to visit his father. A type of cross-cultural anxiety tempers their bourgeoning relationship, complicated by the fact that she lives at home whilst her father is dying of liver disease. As the world situation spirals out of out of control, with shadowy threats of chemical and biological attacks, author Carolyn See spins an eloquent tale of ordinary people adjusting, coping, and continuing on with the cycle of life because they have no choice in the matter.The narrative spans almost ten years, from 2007 to 2016 and one might expect silence, the isolation and sadness to shut down all of these people. But during this time, the characters, although faced with the daily threat of annihilation, have gone on with their lives, having children and raising families. Phil realizes that the wayward and truculent Vern is the only person he really loves, and faced with the threat of his own life \\"being sucked away,\\" he in desperation makes a decision that will irrevocably change his family.Trying to live a life of normalcy in the face of seemingly inconceivable terrorist threats is the theme of the novel; and Phil and Edith's quest to understand and come to terms with the disquiet in their lives both personal and collective is at the heart of the story. Phil's efforts to free himself from the restraints of his job and his marriage end up turning him into a much better man, and although Edith eventually lets go of Charlie's memory, her old age is tinged with a feeling of regret that she could have done more for her grandson.Eloquently written, There Will Never Be Another You speaks to the disquiet and uneasiness of our age and it's powerfulness and subtly lies in the fact that terror threats can appear just when you least expect them. World political unrest, the way global catastrophes reverberate throughout our lives, and the subsequent difficulties of daily survival in a post 9/11 world is obviously the canvas upon which the author delineates her characters.See gives us a restrained and reserved reminder of the unstable world we are currently living in, nevertheless she also intersperses her story with a reflective message of hope and optimism, a type of cautionary testament to the resiliency of the human spirit. Mike Leonard August 06."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"Through the eyes of a savvy widow and her physician son, Carolyn See spins a compelling tale from the trenches of post 9-11 Los Angeles. As her characters deal with the eternal angst of troubled relationships, messed-up kids and the penalties of aging, threats of bioterrorism add a chilling element to the mix. Never flinching as she confronts our worst fears, Ms. See transcends the anxiety of today's world with wicked humor and page-turning narrative. And in the end she shows us that even in appalling times, we still have choices. We can laugh, love, and sometimes even dance.This is a book you'll want to read more than once and share with good friends."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"A beautiful book and a heartfelt message to us from one of the most generous of writers. I gulped it down and I will go back and read it over again. You know, a lot of younger writers are full of surprises and twists. Their novels just scream, \\"I am fantastic!\\" But the novels of mature writers tend to settle down a little bit, they are more subtle, don't shout so much. But then they somehow change you on a submolecular level.Read everything Carolyn See has ever written, she is amazing."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"I've read many of Carolyn's books and \\"There will never be another you\\" is right up there with the best of them. Carolyn observes Los Angelinos as no other writer can. Every moment, though pulsing with the anticipation of impending doom, is still infused with a love of life and being in the moment fully. When I put the book down, after reading it in two days, I realized that, though newspaper headlines blare about impending doom, books like this can help me live with hope, humor, and attitude. Can't wait to read her next book!"},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"Carolyn See's \\"The Handyman\\" is one of my favorite novels. As one Amazon reviewer put it, if you're an artist and/or seeking an authentic life you'll like it.Maybe my expectations of See after that novel kept me from appreciating \\"There Will Never Be Another You.\\" But I don't think that's the case.I read through to about page 70 and just gave up. The characters all whine and complain. I didn't like a single one of them. They didn't need to be nice or perfect, just not whiny.The clincher for me was the scene at the dinner table with one child swearing and another child slamming his hand on the table and both parents going on as if this is all normal. That scene alone made me hate those two characters (the adults, not the kids who are just reflecting the parents) for being so clueless.I didn't even make into the major plot - if there is one. I just don't want to waste my time with these annoying characters.Carolyn See has been unfairly treated by many reviewers over the years. Not sure what that's all about. Her other work is truly great. So it's with reluctance that I slam this novel. But it's unfortunately true. \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\" is not a good read."},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"This is not a great book and it's barely a good book. The first chapter is captivating: a widow re-emerging from the shock and just trying to live day to day. Then it degenerates into a Desperate Older Housewives using terrorism as a convenient sideplot. If she'd stuck with the first chapter and gone from there, it would have been decent. Don't waste your time on this one. I want to smack everyone but the old lady upside the head. And then even she goes idiotic. UGH!"},{"Title":"There Will Never Be Another You: A Novel","review":"When Edith's husband Charlie dies in 2001, she has been deep in caretaker mode. Now, she awakes to the world in a jolt when her son commands her to turn the television on the morning after Charlie has died, September 11th. She sees buildings aflame, and falling.In 2007, 64-year-old Edith is a volunteer at the hospital waiting room desk at UCLA, where her son, dermatologist Phil Fuchs, works. Edith despises the job, yet she feels an essential truth might be found there.Phil notices three dead cats in a few hours. It seems ominous, but not nearly as much as the man in the HAZ-MAT suit and plastic mask who picks up the bodies with a machine --- and then drops them onto a pile of dead cats. Phil hears rumors that Animal Control trucks have been parked outside the ER. What is going on? His research scientist friend, Fred, tells him something dire has slipped out from the monkeys in the bio lab to infect the cats.At home, Phil's wife Felicia suggests they get in the car and flee. Phil dismisses the idea yet obsessively searches for media mention of the problem. Fred calls to tell him he's seen the monkey lab --- once bustling, but now deserted. Fred himself never comes back to work, pleading a family emergency.Phil's daughter is high-achieving but cruel. His son is not quite right. Felicia, his worthless, pampered wife, pleads for more babies, sinking Phil deeper into the despair that is his life. Phil uses his mistress as a drug in order to forget the rest of his existence, but when she leaves him he feels mostly relief.In a top-secret meeting, the military requests that Phil join a medical team focused on bioterrorism; they are to respond in the event of chemical or biological attack. Phil reluctantly agrees. Members of the team are issued security suits to be kept under lock and key.Andrea, a beautiful blonde college student, regularly spends time in the UCLA waiting room while her father undergoes dialysis. On one occasion, she meets Danny, a tough Chinese guy who was in one of her classes. The two leave the hospital to make love in the bushes of a nearby botanical garden. As Andrea and Danny fall in love, they struggle to fit into each other's lives.As the three sets of ordinary people live their lives, terror squeezes them from all sides. There is sure to be a terrorist attack soon, or a plague. The fear twists their attitudes and blackens their futures. Felicia pressures Phil to join a country club while simultaneously stockpiling canned food and bottled water for the inevitable disaster. Phil witnesses the beginning of catastrophe while fearing for his son's education.The atmosphere of amorphous foreboding and security obsession is both nightmarish and familiar, knotting the reader's gut with fear at our vulnerability. As in real life, the characters wonder what terror is real and what is imagined. A scenario of disaster is plausible; it might be happening covertly at this very moment. Should we be terrified --- or should we be more frightened at living our lives warped by being terrified? In the midst of despair, Carolyn See envisions hope. She manages to leave us uplifted: No matter how precarious life is, not only can we go on, we also can find joy.

But in a stunning, disarming preface, White alerts us to the real subtext: his partner's slow death from AIDS. It's this subtext that transforms the book from a pleasant travelogue to a devastating account of loss.Lurking beneath the book's shimmering surfaces, and within its numerous lacunae, is the emotional life of a couple threatened by the fast-approaching specter of death. An attentive reading of White's text and Hubert Sorin's illustrations reveals the mauvaise foi, the daily negotiations, the implicit contract of domestic denial that enables an endangered couple to keep death at bay for just a little longer._Our Paris_ looks slight, as if it were merely a pleasant evening's worth of travel anecdotes and gossip. But if you take yourself into this book's confidence, it will reveal unexpected secrets."},{"Title":"Our Paris: Sketches from Memory","review":"I picked up this little book for a return flight from Paris to LA. It looked like perfect plane reading -- short, gossipy, topical. And although it lived up to each of those expectations, the devastation implicit in the book (and explicit at the end) hit hard. The book is not easily forgettable -- and probably no less memorable for the passengers and crew of American Airlines flight 45 who watched me become a sniffling, tear-stained disaster.It's very intimate, shockingly un-French. White and Sorin invite you into their lives. You feel as if you're at a dinner party listening to them recount(even bicker a little about) their recent mundane adventures. But this intimacy also means that you feel very close to the heartbreaking loss that is the real subject of the book.It's a beautiful, touching book.

Most of all: about Edmund White and his lover Hubert Sorin. Economical yet enjoyably gossipy, kind-hearted, opinionated, informative. Achingly sad, though, because Hubert is dying of AIDS, and in fact does die at the book's end. Definitely worth reading -- especially for fans of Edmund White. Engagingly illustrated by Sorin, who was trained in architecture and took up drawing when he became ill."},{"Title":"Our Paris: Sketches from Memory","review":"A delightful book about White and Sorin's life in Paris, with an inevitable undercurrent of sadness, because Sorin is dying.

A best selling novel when it was first released in 1933, the reader should keep in mind that much of what is in the book would today be perceived as racist. The book is reflective of a paternalistic view of African-Americans that was prevalent at the time in which this book was written. It is certainly a view that is jarring in these more enlightened times, as the books reflects the nature of the racism that was then inherent in our society. This is not a book that would be written today, as modern society, though still racist in many ways, would view it as being totally politically incorrect.That being said, the book focuses on two female characters, Bea Pullman, a white teenage widow living in Atlantic City, New Jersey with her elderly father and a baby daughter named Jessie, and Delilah Johnston, a young black widow with a light-skinned baby daughter named Peola. Both women are struggling to survive in pre-World War I society, where the lot of widows in a man's world could be a difficult one. When they join forces, an alliance born of necessity is forged. Delilah becomes Bea's housekeeper and caregiver, taking on the traditional woman's role, while Bea struggles to be the breadwinner in a world not yet hospitable to the idea of a business woman.When Delilah's culinary talents merge with Bea's innate business acumen, they are both on their way to fame and fortune. Before you know it, Bea is making a mint with Delilah's recipes, running a successful chain of B. Pullman waffle emporiums, which are presided over by a mammy figure imitative of Delilah, as well as a successful line of candy called Delilah's hearts, bearing Delilah's beaming image on the box. Delilah, thus, becomes a beloved icon, a sort of revered mammy, but a mammy, nonetheless. Bea, on the other hand, remains somewhat of a behind-the-scene enigma, eventually branching out into real estate development and becoming a phenomenon for a woman of that time.Meanwhile, Delilah continues to remain with Bea, living with her and waiting on her, always the perennial mammy. While Bea always treats Delilah with affection and care, there is not a level playing field between the two. Delilah treats Bea with worshipping servitude, while Bea treats Delilah as if she were a beloved family retainer. There is something reminiscent of the old master/slave dichotomy in their relationship. Moreover, while Bea is cognizant of Delilah's contribution to her financial success, they are not contractual business partners, as Bea pays Delilah a salary, though a lesser one than Bea would like, as Delilah refuses raises. Moreover, although there is great affection between the two, the issue of color is always there, both overtly and covertly.Meanwhile, the years have passed, and Delilah's light-skinned daughter, Peola, clearly knows the score. She certainly has no intention of being anyone's mammy and wants to pass for white, as she does not wish to be relegated to second class citizenry. She does not try to do this because she wants to be white, but rather, she wants the advantages associated with being white in that time. She simply wants what Jessie has. Hers is not a decision based upon race self-hate, but one that is based upon a realistic assessment of how she could be all she could be. Peola's philosophy is that there is nothing wrong in passing, but rather, the wrong is inherent in a world that would make such necessary. Still, Peola breaks Delilah's heart by doing this, and Delilah is sustained only by her stalwart faith in God. When Delilah dies, a waffle queen icon to millions, the person dearest to her heart, her own flesh and blood, is missing from her funeral cortege.Bea is not without her share of heartbreak, as well. She spends years struggling to make that almighty buck and ensure that everyone within the sphere of her hearth is taken take of financially. She rises to great heights in the business world, leaving little time for that man lovin' that Delilah is always talking about. Bea struggles to give her daughter Jessie all the advantages she never had. When Bea finally falls in love with Flake, a man several years younger than her and a trusted business confidant, she finds that her daughter has already laid claim to his heart. Without that man lovin' and with her beloved Delilah having gone to meet her Maker, Bea is left to face her imitation of life.This is really a wonderful soaper of a book. From it would flow two successful, though controversial, film adaptations. Both the 1934 version with Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers, as well as the 1959 one starring Lana Turner and Juanita Moore, are terrific and well worth seeing.

You can see this in the 1934 movie by the fact that Delilah is answering a newspaper ad for a colored maid and in the 1959 movie by the fact that they are put up in the room behind the kitchen (Sarah-Jane whines about \\"why do we always have to sleep behind the kitchen\\")...servants quarters in smaller houses and apartments were always a small room behind the kitchen, often w/a back entrance (in the 1934 mansion it is a downstairs entrance) near the kitchen so as to be close to where the maid spent most of her time cooking and so as to be out of the way of white guests.

A best selling novel when it was first released in 1933, the reader should keep in mind that much of what is in the book would today be perceived as racist. The book is reflective of a paternalistic view of African-Americans that was prevalent at the time in which this book was written. It is certainly a view that is jarring in these more enlightened times, as the books reflects the nature of the racism that was then inherent in our society. This is not a book that would be written today, as modern society, though still racist in many ways, would view it as being totally politically incorrect.That being said, the book focuses on two female characters, Bea Pullman, a white teenage widow living in Atlantic City, New Jersey with her elderly father and a baby daughter named Jessie, and Delilah Johnston, a young black widow with a light-skinned baby daughter named Peola. Both women are struggling to survive in pre-World War I society, where the lot of widows in a man's world could be a difficult one. When they join forces, an alliance born of necessity is forged. Delilah becomes Bea's housekeeper and caregiver, taking on the traditional woman's role, while Bea struggles to be the breadwinner in a world not yet hospitable to the idea of a business woman.When Delilah's culinary talents merge with Bea's innate business acumen, they are both on their way to fame and fortune. Before you know it, Bea is making a mint with Delilah's recipes, running a successful chain of B. Pullman waffle emporiums, which are presided over by a mammy figure imitative of Delilah, as well as a successful line of candy called Delilah's hearts, bearing Delilah's beaming image on the box. Delilah, thus, becomes a beloved icon, a sort of revered mammy, but a mammy, nonetheless. Bea, on the other hand, remains somewhat of a behind-the-scene enigma, eventually branching out into real estate development and becoming a phenomenon for a woman of that time.Meanwhile, Delilah continues to remain with Bea, living with her and waiting on her, always the perennial mammy. While Bea always treats Delilah with affection and care, there is not a level playing field between the two. Delilah treats Bea with worshipping servitude, while Bea treats Delilah as if she were a beloved family retainer. There is something reminiscent of the old master/slave dichotomy in their relationship. Moreover, while Bea is cognizant of Delilah's contribution to her financial success, they are not contractual business partners, as Bea pays Delilah a salary, though a lesser one than Bea would like, as Delilah refuses raises. Moreover, although there is great affection between the two, the issue of color is always there, both overtly and covertly.Meanwhile, the years have passed, and Delilah's light-skinned daughter, Peola, clearly knows the score. She certainly has no intention of being anyone's mammy and wants to pass for white, as she does not wish to be relegated to second class citizenry. She does not try to do this because she wants to be white, but rather, she wants the advantages associated with being white in that time. She simply wants what Jessie has. Hers is not a decision based upon race self-hate, but one that is based upon a realistic assessment of how she could be all she could be. Peola's philosophy is that there is nothing wrong in passing, but rather, the wrong is inherent in a world that would make such necessary. Still, Peola breaks Delilah's heart by doing this, and Delilah is sustained only by her stalwart faith in God. When Delilah dies, a waffle queen icon to millions, the person dearest to her heart, her own flesh and blood, is missing from her funeral cortege.Bea is not without her share of heartbreak, as well. She spends years struggling to make that almighty buck and ensure that everyone within the sphere of her hearth is taken take of financially. She rises to great heights in the business world, leaving little time for that man lovin' that Delilah is always talking about. Bea struggles to give her daughter Jessie all the advantages she never had. When Bea finally falls in love with Flake, a man several years younger than her and a trusted business confidant, she finds that her daughter has already laid claim to his heart. Without that man lovin' and with her beloved Delilah having gone to meet her Maker, Bea is left to face her imitation of life.This is really a wonderful soaper of a book. From it would flow two successful, though controversial, film adaptations. Both the 1934 version with Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers, as well as the 1959 one starring Lana Turner and Juanita Moore, are terrific and well worth seeing. Though both are loose adaptations, it is the 1934 version that is probably the one truest to the book. In the context of today's society, however, each film will shock the viewer's sensibilities with its political incorrectness, as will the book."},{"Title":"Imitation of Life","review":"This was written about 1934. I really enjoyed this book and the author's rhetoric, and the story line. I saw both versions of the movie and they are nothing like this book.If you want to read a VERY good book- get this older version."},{"Title":"Imitation of Life","review":"I bought this movie for my mum, every once in a while when it comes on tv she would just sit there and watch it. and then bit by bit we would watch it with her. it is a good movie, its black and white but you dont always need colour. there is a lot of colour issues in the movie so just enjoy it plain and simple"},{"Title":"Imitation of Life","review":"Fannie Hurst's 1933 novel IMITATION OF LIFE concerns a recently widowed young mother, Bea Pullman, who by chance teams up with Delilah, a homeless black woman who is in the same situation. The women move in together and become business partners. Delilah's daughter Peola is so light-skinned that strangers are surprised that the two are related. Thanks to Delilah's culinary talents and Bea's business sense, the women manage to build a chain of successful restaurants and become wealthy. But success has a price. Peola abandons her mother to \\"pass\\" in white society. Delilah ultimately dies of a broken heart. Bea devotes herself to her business so much that she misses out on the passionate love of a man. When she finally meets a man she really likes, he falls for her daughter. She ends up bitter, thinking that she has only had an \\"imitation of life.\\" Who would have thought that such a downbeat story could be successful? But successful it was, becoming not only a best seller of 1933, but also inspiring two hit films (in 1934 with Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers and in 1959 with Lana Turner and Juanita Moore).I have to admit that I found it very compelling reading on many levels. I had seen both film versions before reading the book. The most striking thing about the novel is the subtle racism that permeates the entire book. I believe the book's racism is unconscious and probably is an accurate reflection of prevalent social attitudes of 1932. There is no hatred directed toward the blacks in the book. Delilah is depicted as a good-hearted soul whose only failing would perhaps be an over-eagerness to please. But there is a subtle condescension that is discomforting for modern readers. For example, Delilah is at least once addressed by a restaurant customer as \\"Mammy.\\" Another time a woman says of Delilah to Bea, \\"What a charming mammy!\\"But what really shocked me about the book was its coded lesbianism. I have heard it suggested several times that only a physical attraction between the two women makes plausible their so quickly moving in together. I didn't really get that so much. Bea has a lesbian relationship with a business tycoon named Virginia Eden. It is not obvious. The giveaway is when Virginia Eden sends Bea violets. In the lesbian underground, when one woman sends another woman violets, she is indicating to her that she wants to have a physical relationship. (Marlene Dietrich supposedly rang Greta Garbo's doorbell and shoved a bouquet of violets toward her.) Only those \\"in the know\\" would recognize this as a lesbian proposition. Someone should examine Fannie Hurst's work for other examples of coded lesbianism.I found this book a very curious relic from a bygone era. What was really enjoyable about the book for me was its depiction of New York at the time and contemporary social attitudes. One thing that must have been shocking at the time is the book's ultimate condemnation of motherhood. Both the women sacrifice for their daughters and do not live happily ever after. That gave me a lot to think about.Every once in a while it is rumored that there will be a new updated film or TV version of the story with current stars, but I don't think that will ever happen. America has changed too much for that. There would be no need to \\"pass for white\\" today. I did enjoy the book, although perhaps not in the way that the author intended."},{"Title":"Deathlands # 5 - Homeward Bound","review":"Axler is one of the most creative sci fi writers that I have read in a long time. The Deathlands series is highly innovative and always action packed, albeit extremely violent.Simply written in a simple style, the author creates a whole new post-holocaust world. His primary characters exhibit a basic moral code, more mindful of the Old Testament than the New.Highly detail oriented, the writer is obsessive in his descriptions of weaponry. His fight and battle scenes are not for the squeamish.Homeward Bound was the first of the series that I read and without a doubt, the best. Homeward Bound is typical of the series but has the added themes of sibling rivalry, patricide, incest and the resulting psycho-social damage.In Homeward Bound, Ryan Cawdor returns to his home and confronts the painful past."},{"Title":"Deathlands # 5 - Homeward Bound","review":"Ever since he was run out of his home of Front Royale Ryan Cawdor has been haunted by the events that led to his exile. Now thorough the random chance of the transmat Ryan and his companions find themselves coming back where it all started. Ryan will get to reunite with his insane brother and backstabbing sister and law for a reunion that one would expect in the Deathlands. This book is a great installment in the series and fleshes out Ryan's back story. We also get a glimpse of what is left of New York (not much) and there are several events that show the moral ambiguity of the main characters. It seems that in the Deathlands no one is entirely good. An interesting and entertaining story in the series that makes me look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"The New Grove Haydn","review":"This is a concise, lucid, well written account of Haydn's life and career with a balanced assessment of his works and of his character.

Those wanting to learn more about Haydn's life and works will look elsewhere but will want this book for its listing of his works and its bibliography."},{"Title":"The New Grove Haydn","review":"This is a useful and solid book for people who want accurate facts about Haydn's life and music. The lists at the end are extremely thorough and detailed. Those who are reading for pleasure will get more enjoyment out of Rosemary Hughes's book &quot;Haydn&quot; (out of print, but often available used), which shows a warmer sympathy for the composer and a better choice of revealing detail."},{"Title":"The New Grove Haydn","review":"For the past several years, I have been enjoying listening to Haydn's symphonies, quartets, and oratorios and sharing my thoughts with readers here on Amazon. More recently, I have had the pleasure of hearing Jeno Jando's cycle of the Haydn piano sonatas and writing about the sonatas on this site in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death. I received valuable guidance in learning about a composer I love and about his piano sonatas from this short study, \\"The New Grove Haydn\\" by Jens Peter Larsen.The book is one of a series of short biographies of the great composers taken from the 1980 edition of \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.\\" As is pointed out in a short Preface, the book is shaped by its initial format as part of a dictionary. It is based upon the most current, for the time, and reliable scholarship about Haydn while aiming to avoid controversy or overly technical analysis. The book is short, well-organized, clearly written, and does not require formal musical training to understand. It includes a detailed bibliography, arranged by particular subjects (such as Haydn's life, his operas, his symphonies, piano sonatas, historical reputation, what have you) together with an extensive list (90 pages) of Haydn's compositions arranged by categories.The text itself runs about 122 pages divided into seven chapters. The first five chapters are biographical and discuss what is known about Haydn's life from his early years, through his long association with the Esterhazys, to his two trips to London late in his career, and ending with his final years in Vienna. There is a short chapter on Haydn's personality, and a lengthy concluding chapter on Haydn's artistic development and accomplishment.The format allowed for good discussions of Haydn's music. The biographical sections of the book offer information of the characteristics of Haydn's music during each period of his life, while the section on the composer's artistic development tries to capture the thread of the genres in which Haydn worked over the course of his life. The book helped me see how and why Haydn changed as a composer over the course of a 40 year career.There are two broad themes that are emphasized in the book. First is Haydn's relative isolation during his many years at Esterhazy from the broader musical culture of Vienna. In a famous quotation, (p. 28) Haydn himself emphasized the importance of this isolation on his development as a composer.\\"I was set apart from the world, there was nobody in my vicinity to confuse and annoy me in my course, and so I had to become original.\\"The second theme emphasized in the book is the character of Haydn's music \\"fur Kenner und Liebhaber\\"-- for both connoisseurs and amateurs (pp 85 - 86). Haydn wrote music of extraordinary depth and sophistication, but he also wrote music readily accessible to a broad audience with little musical expertise. Some of his works show both characteristics. But even the popular pieces show an ability to delight within the restrictions Haydn was given. As Larsen states: \\"it is part of his greatness that he was able to display his extraordinary musicianship and inventiveness not only in outstanding masterworks but also in more domestic pieces like the baryton trios.\\" (p 86). I was helped in my understanding of Haydn's piano music in particular by thinking of it in terms of \\"fur Kenner und Liebhaber.\\"This is an excellent book for listeners with a basic familiarity with Haydn who want to learn more about the composer and his music.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"That's How Much I Love You","review":"This is such an exquisite book. What a pure and beautiful outpouring of love between two people that started out as a simple, long distance game. I envision the creation of this book almost like two jazz musicians that are riffing on a melody (in this case love), where one creates a theme and then passes it off to the other who takes the theme and molds it into their own expression. Only here Mr. Mernit is playing the keys on a typewriter and Ms. Nizza, the brushes on a canvas. And wow... what music. The words are like small dreams with a rhythm that leads you into the art, and the art in this book is stunning. The wildness, beauty and humor of Ms. Nizza's imagination, and the incredible range of styles in which she is able to work, make these far more than just illustrations. I think what's particularly interesting about the book is how one is not merely an observer, looking in at two OTHER people in romantic love. I think the book really has to do with the force of love, and just as easily as I will read this with my wife, I can see giving it to my young niece, or reading it to a child at bedtime.

Yes, it does include patterns for every project, along with photos of the steps involved. Those sections are after the very complete general directions on mosaic. There's something for all skill levels. It is very thorough.I was impressed with the chapters on supplies and tools. Lots of photos and a good discussion of the pros & cons of each material and their uses. The plan layout instructions show how to create or copy a design and how to transfer your design to an item, even a 3-D object.The small pieces used in mosaic are called tesserae and can be many types of materials. The illustrated cutting techniques explore irregular shapes, common shapes and leaves. The section on making your own gold leaf glass was very interesting. I also liked their discussion of grouts and adhesives. One great ideas was to use an adhesive other than grout - just sprinkle beads or glitter between the tessearae. The general instructions finish with a helpful trouble-shooting section.The projects are divided by technique and increase in complexity through the book. In the direct method, the mosaic is applied to the object. Probably the easiest way to begin. Learning the next technique, the indirect method, expands the items that you can cover with mosaic. Profuse photos illustrate how to make your mosaic design on another material and transfer it to the final object.Another chapter discusses the very popular method of picasiatte, the technical name for using broken china or found objects as your mosaic pieces. Broken china is how many of us rediscovered mosaics, and it's a lot of fun. One of my favorite chapters is on garden projects. They cover specific techniques for outdoor mosaics. Great projects.The final and most complex chapter covers armatures & constructed bases. One example of this technique is a gorgeous reflecting bird bath with mosaic perches extending over the water.The projects range from simple to complex. They include a clock, mirrors, frames, a lovely flamingo design, a stained glass lampshade, picture under glass mosaic, dog portrait, cake stand, house number, mosaic accent brick, looking glass garden stake, strawberry planter with attached teacups and creamers, and a lot more.If you are interested in learning mosaics or want to take your mosaic projects to the next level, this book is great."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"This novel is far and away the best of the entire trilogy. It is so good that it even rates on my &quot;Top Books of All Time&quot; list. Once you get past all the re-telling of backstory, the events which have occured in previous novels, this is a superb book. Newscomers who start with this one will not find themselves lost, because Mina recaps everything that has gone before quite ably. If you have read the previous two, the retelling could get a bit tedious, i suppose, but you can always just ignore it.It's an excellent novel, full of wonderful, fully formed and likeable characters who just jump off the pages. Mina's descriptions of Glasgow are absolutely superb, and her way with words and turn of phrase is sometimes stunning. The plot is great, the double plot strand intertwine brilliantly. This is a story about less-than average people trying to get through life relatively unscathed and not always making a good job of it.As i say, the plot is excellent, and the writing is brilliant and assured. It's an incredibly compelling novel which you cannot put down. I ploughed through this one in a single day, i enjoyed it so much.

Mina tells a gritty story that was as fascinating as it was disturbing.Mina ties together all of the unresolved items from the previous two books (hence RESOLUTION) very nicely. I was totally satisfied with how things played out.Mina is the writer that other authors such as Karin Slaughter wish they could be and I would hope in the future that Mina brings Maureen back, perhaps 10 or 15 years older. She is an interesting, intriguing character and it seems there is a lot more to her story that can be explored."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"All the demons come home to roost in the third novel of Mina's brilliant trilogy (Garnethill, Exile, Resolution), intrepid protagonist Maureen O'Donnell finally confronted with the resolution of her past sexual abuse and subsequent breakdown, broken relationships, a chronic inability to commit and a pattern of diversion that has taken her to dangerous places to protect the innocent who cannot protect themselves. Finally, Angus Farrell is facing trial for two murders, Maureen's married boyfriend and another man unfortunate enough to have harbored incriminating information against Angus. Although Farrell's more disturbing crimes are his heinous sexual attacks against helpless young women under his care at the mental hospital where Maureen was taken after her breakdown, she is happy to see the monster held accountable, hopefully protecting the only eye witness to the abuse, Siobhan, from having to testify.Filled with eccentric characters and vivid descriptions of life in Glasgow, this final novel brings Maureen to the end of her journey, increasingly self-destructive behavior no longer tolerable, nor is the crippling fear of her abuser, Maureen's father, Michael. Thanks to the efforts of Marie, Maureen's oldest sibling, Michael has returned to Glasgow, joyfully embraced by Una, the sister who gives birth to a girl, further ratcheting up Maureen's need to deal with Michael for the sake of the new baby. The trial, an abrasive press and the subtle threats sent by Angus to intimidate Maureen are exacerbated by the shadow of her father's presence, Maureen driven to one more detour in favor of the helpless as she prepares to reclaim her future: wee Ella McGee, in the process of taking her son to small claims court, is brutally beaten and hospitalized. Before Maureen can get to the bottom of Ella's attack, Ella is dead, her son by her side at the end.One of the charms of this trilogy is Mina's ability to draw the reader into Maureen's intimate daily dilemmas, at the same time adding the predicaments that seduce Maureen into rescuing those who have fallen through the cracks in an indifferent society: in Garnethill, it is the mental patients who fall prey to Farrell's abuse and Douglas's murder; in Exile, the disappearance and murder of a woman caught in the nightmare world of the drug trade; and in Resolution, the inexplicable death of a feisty old woman and the fate of innocent females exploited by powerful men. Mina brings immediacy to each of these issues, the sordid details of each situation compelling and deeply relevant; meanwhile, we witness Maureen's helpless descent into alcoholism to cope with her rage and a desperate need to regain control of her life. The characters are oddly familiar, dysfunctional siblings, an alcoholic mother who denies Maureen's abuse, a loyal brother-cum-former-drug-dealer, a best friend through every dangerous escapade and the protagonist's reluctant embrace of a more hopeful future, albeit at a terrible cost.Mina strikes another blow for the common man, her main characters acting out the small dramas and tragedies of life on the edge: \\"Labels matter most on the margins\\". Filled with pithy observations and a real appreciation for the struggles of ordinary people with dreams and aspirations, this is a world filled with desperation, sorrow, hope and forgiveness, human drama writ bold. Luan Gaines/2007."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"\\"Resolution,\\" (2002) is third and last in what has come to be known as \\"The Garnethill Trilogy,\\" a series of British mysteries by increasingly well-known Scottish-born author Denise Mina, now a leading practitioner, in company with Ian Rankin and Val McDermid, of the Scottish crime writing school that has come to be known as \\"tartan noir,\\" for its high level of violence, sheer bloody-mindedness, and grisly, witty humor. Mina burst on the scene with her debut novel,Garnethillthat won the John Creasey Memorial Award; she was born in the vicinity of Glasgow, where all her novels have so far been set. As a child, her father's work took her all over the world: she has, since her return to that city, worked in the field of health care, studied law at the University of Glasgow, and taught criminal law and criminology.The book at hand picks up, and resolves, the untidy story of hard-drinking Maureen O'Donnell, who has known some good, and some bad, luck in her time. She is currently finding her life difficult: as a result of a generous gift from her former, murdered, married, therapist boyfriend, Douglas Brady, she owes more money in back taxes than she now makes on her job selling bootleg cigarettes in Paddy's Market. Her abusive father Michael has again shown up in town, destabilizing her hard-won sanity; Angus Farrell the psychologist who brutally murdered Doug - in Maureen's apartment-- is soon to go on trial for that murder, and another, with Maureen as star witness. And she has chosen to get herself involved in the untidy life of another unhappy family, that of Ella McGee, former prostitute, now an elderly stallholder at the same market as Maureen: the older woman has taken her son to small claims court over unpaid wages; she turns up beaten in Albert Hospital.The tales, grim and dark, somehow resolve themselves happily for Maureen. They present us with exciting courtroom drama; illegally imported Polish sex slaves, yet again; a Scottish wedding in a fancy hotel on Loch Lomond, apparently a body of water not nearly so benign as the famous old song would have us think; and an explicit, vivid incestuous rape scene that may be a bit much for some readers. Fortunately for all concerned, the darkness is plentifully leavened with Mina's exhilarating love for and knowledge of her city, and dry wit. For example, listen to her set her scene: \\"Usually Glasgow's weather vacillates between freezing rain and not-so-freezing rain but sometimes, on a five-to-ten-year cycle, the weather turns and the city doesn't know itself. This was such a time. Unconditional sunshine had arrived one week ago. Virulent, fecund plant life had sprung up everywhere: trees and bushes were heavy with deep green leaves, growth appeared on buildings, between cracks in the pavement, on bins. The city burst into life and everyone began to farm their skin. Water-white cheeks and necks withered and puckered with relentless exposure. Casualty departments heaved under the strain of sunburn and heat stroke. Everyone in the unaccustomed city was dressing as if they'd woken up naked in a bush and had to borrow clothes to get home: old women wore young women's summer dresses, vest tops were stretched over belly rolls, short sleeves showed off straps from industrial bras. Every night felt like Friday night and parties went on too long. Fantastic blood-alcohol levels were attained by conscientious individuals. Everyone was dangerously out of character.\\" Mind you, this book surely isn't everyone's cup of tea, nor thimbleful of whiskey, for that matter: only you know what you look for in a book."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Denise Mina concludes her extraordinary trilogy with a superb book. Resolution matches Garnethill and brings to full circle the saga of Maureen O'Donnell, the most interesting character, male or female, to emerge in crime fiction in recent years. Resolution stands on its own, although it is best read in sequence."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"This third volume featuring Maureen O'Donnell would, in anyone else's hands, have been serious overkill. However, it is a testament to Mina's writing talent that she manages to keep the reader's interest in the self-destructive heroine. In large measure, it's the secondary characters who help to achieve this. Maureen's friends Kilty and Leslie, her brother Liam, and sundry others supply enough contrast to keep one from becoming exhausted by Maureen's drinking, dark thoughts, and generally alcoholic behavior. There are moments of wonderful humor and, as in the two previous books, a fine evocation of Glasgow. That said, much of the action is fairly predictable and there are no great surprises. But the novel has such good momentum that it carries the reader through to a rather tepid conclusion. Definitely worth reading. And it'll be of interest to see what Mina does next."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"I friend lent me the first book in this Denise Mina Trilogy, and I approached it as a chore - since she LOVES English/Scottish authors, I was prepared for one of her usual that put me to sleep while waiting for some action ... well ... I was hooked after a few pages. I was not prepared for sucn a touching book, for such a well written novel, a story well-delivered , a story that attacks reality ... when she casually asks if her friend was \\"Mental\\" , it could have addressed anyone of us. Not only does the story grips the reader, but we also fall into their lives and recognize those around us. I lent this book to my friend, and part-way through, she called and said the Mother is SIMONE ( fake name ) - she turns all of life back to her ... If you haven't read Mina before, and I had not, statrt with the first book ... get all three, you'll want to have the next one in the wings..."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Resolution is the final book in Denise Mina's Garnethill trilogy and, although it makes for a powerful and disturbing standalone novel, it has an even greater impact if the three books are read in the order in which they were released. Sadly, as Resolution opens, not much has changed for Maureen O'Donnell and her friends. Everyday life in Glasgow can be tough enough, but Maureen, still recovering from the murder of Douglas Brady, her former lover, seems to be having way more bad days than good ones.Never comfortable with the idea that Douglas left her a substantial amount of money when he died, Maureen blew through all of it before she realized that she would be taxed on her windfall. Now she owes more in back taxes than she makes in a year selling bootleg cigarettes in her little stall at Paddy's Market. The trial of her lover's killer is fast approaching, and Maureen feels certain that the man is somehow behind the mysterious packages that have started to appear at her door. And, just when she thinks things cannot possibly get worse, Maureen learns that the man who abused her when she was a child, her own father, is back in Glasgow - living with her sister and newborn niece. Maureen's drinking is worse than ever, so bad that her friends are worrying about her blackouts and the mysterious bruises on her face that come and go (the source of those bruises is finally revealed at the very end of the book).To say the least, Maureen needs a distraction if she is to save herself. She finds one in the person of an old woman she knows from Paddy's Market. Sensing that the old woman is being physically and mentally abused by her gangster son, Maureen and her two friends decide to help the woman. After the older woman ends up in the hospital with broken bones, the trio of wannabe do-gooders stumble onto a complicated scheme involving forced prostitution and political collusion that they are determined to expose. Maureen, already feeling threatened by the potential release of Douglas's killer, has now doubled the number of men who wish her dead.Denise Mena's downtown Glasgow is not a pretty place because Mena pulls no punches in portraying life there for those at the bottom of Glasgow's economic and social ladders. It is a bleak setting filled with people the reader would not willingly choose to associate with in the real world. Even Maureen is someone most would avoid if they encountered her on a downtown street. Aggressive, down-and-out alcoholics with chips on their shoulders are simply best avoided. Mina's talent is to make her readers care about people like Maureen, care enough about them to want to understand and accept them for what they are.Denise Mina is a gem."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"This is another excellent book by Denise Mina ... part of a fabulous series."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Mina writes a great detective novel, Scottish heroines abound. Very real people and great plot, every time. My new fave crime novelist. Sometimes a bit gritty, tho!"},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Too often when you come to the solution of a mystery, you roll your eyes and say, \\"Oh, yeah. Right. Sure.\\" Few writers can wrap it all up without taking a few hairpin turns that leave you gasping for credulity. Denise Mina occasionally engages in these twists and turns, but she writes so well, it's hard to fault her. The Garnethill Trilogy is especially good. I knew nothing about Glasgow and loved learning about the people who struggle on Garnethill. I'll forgive a great many plot glitches if the writing sings and her writing sings."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"This is the final book of the Garnethill trilogy (Garnethill, Exile, Resolution) with tortured heroine Maureen O'Donnell. Mina tackles very dark topics (incest, domestic abuse, alcoholism among others) and manages to squeeze humor as well empathy for the characters and a love of Glasgow out of her novels. Mina does for Glasgow what Ian Rankin and John Rebus have done for Edinburgh. If you are looking for a gritty unexpected crime solver with charming Scottish dialogue, this is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Denise Mina wraps up her Garnethill Trilogy with a slamdunk. I'm sorry to say goodbye to Maureen and her friends, but readers can appreciate Mina's decision to keep the series short and say all she had to say in 3 volumes instead of 20. The action is fresh. And there are flashes of humor that come just at the right time."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Maureen O'Donnell has been abused, betrayed and is just trying to make some money.

McDonell does a wonderful job in exploring what it means to be a friend and to love someone. David is constantly struggling with the choices that Miranda makes in her relationships with others. I wouldn't say that he is jealous of Miranda's lovers in a sexual sense, but he is so awestruck by her charisma and beauty that he doesn't want to see her get hurt. He has to come to terms with his feelings for her - Is she the one who is going to change everything about his way of life? Does he love her? It seems as though J.M. McDonell did a marvelous job in developing David, Miranda, and few other characters, but there were other characters that didn't seem to be important to the plot (like the veterarian, and Ben). I think that she could have made each of the characters more developed and meaningful to the story. She could have made a stronger connection between some of the characters. I felt as though there were many wasted pages in her novel on which she would introduce these meaningless characters, never intending to incorporate them into the plot. Despite the underdeveloped characters, I enjoyed reading Half Crazy.

The chapters are Echoes; Why It Happened; How It Happened; What It Ended; What It Started; and Where It Stands. The last chapter is a welcome and very interesting review of the celebration of the bicentennial of the Revolution in 1989, and a summary of the schools of interpretation which have held sway in the last fifty years (the Classic interpretation, Revisionism, and Post-revisionism). The index is serviceable; there is a nice timeline; a little end section on the Calendar which the Revolution produced (lots of details there); and, best of all, a wonderful section of suggestions for further reading, with several dozen books fit into six categories. Some of the books are classic works fifty and more years old, but probably most of them have appeared in the period 1960-2000, and offer a selection of the top volumes written in that period.

I just knew that it happened and it was important. I just want to thank Mr Doyle for opening my eyes to what went on in those times. I don't need to know every last detail, just a synopsis of what went on in the 1780's and 1790's in France and how a complete transformation of it occurred. I've read this book twice now and feel satisfied that I have an understanding of the period. Thank you Mr. Doyle, I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to know what happened and why. It's short and easy to read."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"The French Revolution is one of the most significant events in world history. So much has been written about it that it can be difficult to find a good place to start exploring the subject. Well, look no more. William Doyle has written a terrific introduction to the topic that is wonderful in its scope and yet concise. In this book he is more concerned with why the French Revolution mattered and has continued to matter, that with a retelling of what happened.Rather than a strict chronological approach, the six chapters of this book give the reader six different perspectives on the same event. Each adds depth to our understanding of the event and its place in history.Chapter one is called \\"Echoes\\" and it relates how this great upheaval was perceived by the rest of the world not only in the newspapers of the day but in fiction and drama. The Importance of Being Earnest, A Tale of Two Cities, and The Scarlet Pimpernel are discussed. The complete text of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens is included in this chapter as well.\\"Why It Happened\\" is the second chapter. Here the author discusses the causes of the Revolution. This is mainly a description of the Ancien Regime's government and society during the reign of Louis XVI.The third chapter is called \\"How It Happened.\\" In this chapter Doyle discusses the Revolution as a series of events that stretched over a number of years. He does an excellent job of showing how each event led to the next. The violent excesses of the guillotine are much more understandable in context.\\"What It Ended\\" is the name of the fourth chapter and my personal favorite. It is here that we see the impact that the Revolution had, not only in France, but throughout the world. Before the Revolution there is a world of Divine Right, religious authority, slavery, peasants, and aristocracy. While this doesn't change overnight, the fact that the people can revolt and change the social order becomes established beyond a doubt. Once changed, society seems unwilling to go back and is changed forever.The next to the last chapter is called \\"What It Started,\\" and it deals with the effects the Revolution has had on the world. It also discusses the reaction to the Revolution and the dynamic tension of radical and conservative forces in modern history.\\"Where It Stands\\" is the last chapter. This is devoted to the schools of academic thought on the Revolution. The \\"classic\\" interpretation of the Revolution and its critics are outlined with a brief history. The chapter ends with an outline of contemporary thinking about the Revolution.The book ends with a Timeline, The Revolutionary Calendar, a list of Further Readings, and an Index. The Calendar of twelve 30-day months and five complimentary days that began on September 22, 1793 is especially interesting.This is a great introduction into the events and meaning of the French Revolution. It will satisfy the reader who wants just one book on the topic as well as the beginning scholar who is looking for a place to start his or her research."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Many relatively recent books on the French Revolution, such as Simon Schama's excellent CITIZENS, seem to presuppose a basic knowledge of the highlights and terms of the Revolution itself (the Tennis Court Oath, the Jacobins, Thermidor, etc.) but also of its aftermath (Louis XVIII and Charles X, Napoleon;s Egypt campaign, etc.). Doyle's book presupposes almost nothing, and lays out for the common reader not only a very clear and concise of the Revolution itself but also the ancien regime that preceded, and the restorations, republics, and empires that succeeded it. Best of all, it makes interesting claims in its introduction and conclusion as to why the Revolution mattered to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as an intellectual and political event, and even (for good measure) a coherent account of the battles raging among the Annales schools of historians in France up to the present day. Fine work, and a great introduction."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This book is very helpful for a quick review of the facts. I used it to brush up on dates and figures before a midterm and a final on this topic. Its well organized for a quick read."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"In contrast to the last VSI volume I read (the atrocious \\"Spanish Civil War\\" by Helen Graham\\") this title succeeds magnificently. Broken down into six chapters, only one of which is a straightforward chronology, this volume elucidates the social and material causes of the French Revolution, as well as its immediate consequences, in a truly original fashion. The two chapters entitled \\"What It Ended\\" and \\"What it Started,\\" are particularly illustrative of Doyle's unique approach. Perhaps most important is the final chapter, where Doyle summarizes the different ways that the revolution has been approached historiographically, connecting its legacy to the now tarnished reputations of similar regimes which have claimed to be its heirs, such as the Soviet Union. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I'm quite surprised at the uniformly favorable reviews of this book. If a history is even mildly engaging, it keeps my interest. But here the author assumes too much and gets side-tracked in banalities and superfluous detail instead of succinctly telling the big story in a \\"very short introduction.\\" I didn't finish it or pass it on, which is rare for this lay historian.Another example of the futility of trying to find a short-cut to an understanding of historical events. Your better off reading fiction (Tale of Two Cities) than this muddle."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Doyle provides a very compact and dense summary of the French Revolution. He summarizes the causes which started the revolution, the events which happened during the revolution, and the effects it caused, some of which have reverberated down to the modern day. The short chapters make the book easy to read in a few sittings, and the chapter titles give the reader the direction for the chapter (Why it happened, how it happened, what it ended, what it started). Doyle mentions all the key players, political parties, and the international incidents the revolution impacted.Also included is a very detailed timeline, a note on the Revolutionary calendar, and a nice selection of suggestions for further reading. As always the Very Short Introductions pack a heavy punch in spite of their small size (this one is just 100 pages). This book was loaded with good content and included a scattering of images throughout the book."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"The author is a pedant, I'll tell you that right now. And unless you share his pedantic outlook, you're part of the unwashed herd.Look: this was supposed to be a \\"Very Short Introduction\\" to the French Revolution, right? So nobody needs a earful on the intricacies of various historiographical debates on the subject. Nevertheless, that's what interests the author, so that's what's supposed to interest you. A more accurate title for this book would have been \\"A Primer on Divers Ponderous, Hair-Splitting Debates and Arcana Related to the French Revolution.\\"At one point, the author takes Simon Schama to task over his thoroughly enjoyableCitizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolutionfor \\"merely telling a story\\" without weighing one down with the more abstruse matters that historians of Doyle's brilliance are presumably consumed with. Actually, isn't that what your book, Doyle, was supposed to be doing: just telling the basic story? You couldn't do that without getting doctrinaire and pompous? Seems like you're simply jealous of Schama, whose book I found about twenty times more readable than your own.I came to this book because I enjoyed others in this series and was in need of a brief recounting of what happened shortly before and after 1789. Didn't get that. Instead I felt like I had just spent the evening with a tendentious grad student with several bones to pick."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Sorry: the book is solid in many respects, but I wasn't as impressed with it as most reviewers were. The treatment is at a very high level, i.e. the subjects of many sentences are reifications like \\"the Church\\" and \\"French imperial ambitions,\\" like in those world history textbooks that were such a snore in high school. The French revolution is full of factions with colorful names and famous individual actors, yet often the author starts throwing around terms like sansculottes, Jacobins, and Girodins many pages before he tells us what they stood for, and he tells us almost nothing about who Robespierre, Marat and Danton were (spending more time on Dickens's fictional Mme. Lafarge). A glossary/dramatis personae would have been helpful. The last chapter, \\"Where it Stands,\\" focuses on the attitude toward the revolution among late 20th-Century academics; personally I found it rather interesting, but I'm a wonk and this focus struck even me as perhaps a bit narrow. Even with the excellent timeline (to which I had to refer often) and bibliography, the book doesn't max out the length of VSIs; some more social color and biographical detail would be welcome in a second edition."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I wanted to learn about the French Revolution in a few days and this little gem was just the tool to do it. It's a very small book, but it provides an excellent summary of the who was involved, the causes, what happened to whom, and the outcome. Highly recommended for those who are looking for a brief overview of the subject."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Fans of this series of books will know that most are very good, a few are duds, and a fair number are amazingly good. Professor Doyle's review of one of the major events in European history is firmly in that last category.It is both an account of the events themselves and an overview of how they have been interpreted. The subject is complex and has aroused strong opinions across the ideological spectrum. Doyle gives all sides a fair hearing, but with the occasional wry comment that hints at where his own sympathies lie. The emphasis throughout is on the broader historic context rather than being an attempt to cram details into a short introduction. Both readers new to the subject and those looking for a review of where studies in the area now stand will be well served by this book.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"The book gives in what is truly a very short version of the French Revolution a succinct and witty account of the events.

William Doyle did an excellent job- so much so that I am interested in reading some of his other offerings. :)"},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"...and I'm thinking it's a little late to trim down the French Revolution. But in all seriousness, this is indeed to very brief overview of the French Revolution, its roots dating back to the reign of Louis XIV, and its repercussions through the 19th century and right up to the decline of Communism in Russia. That's a lot to pack into roughly 100 pages, yet Doyle does a good job of weaving together a readable narrative of people and events. Which is exactly what I wanted.My sole criticism is that, in an effort to keep the account \\"very short,\\" Doyle introduces people, places, groups and events in passing with only the briefest description or context. I expected that an introduction would explain the basics, but in some sense instead we end up with the \\"very short\\" aspect being helped by an assumption that the reader already knows some of these characters. If I did, why would I need this introduction?It left me with as many questions as answers. Who were the \\"sansculottes\\"? The Jacobins? The Girondists? What is the Vendee? What role did the Catholic church have before the revolution? And so on. Another 20 pages devoted to some background and explanation would have helped without overburdening the reader.That said, if you're looking for a low-effort way to get the gist of the French Revolution *and* you're willing to Google the missing bits as required by your curiosity, then this is a good choice.I am reading biographies of the founding fathers and wanted some additional background on the French Revolution, which was a major, influential event during the founding of the United States. It was particularly influential for Jefferson, Madison and other early \\"republicans\\" and represented an important point of difference between them and the \\"federalists.\\" This book explained much of the context I was missing without sending me down a rabbit hole and distracting from my on-topic reading. However, Doyle does provide an excellent, annotated suggested reading section should you want to read further on the French Revolution in general or various details or analyses.Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"When I started to read A Place of Greater Safety I felt it had been along time since I reviewed the basic events of the French revolution and the historical debates regarding the revolution's significance and interpretation.

This book is so short that I will keep my review brief as well. Just add that it's not only good for people just approaching the subject, but also great to get a higher lever overview if you already know the story."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"For those interested in a brilliant overview of the French revolution, written concisely, combining narrative and competent analysis, including a comprehensive time line and a noteworthy bibliography, Doyle's A Very Short Introduction, is well worth your investment and time.One of the more difficult writing tasks is to summarize an important and complicated historical event such as the French revolution, with any competence or erudition. Doyle's essay touches upon all aspects of the revolution's origins of development, including major personages, ideologies and significant events that contributed to its beginnings, processes and the revolution's present legacy in terms of its significant influence on society to present time.In the first chapter, Echoes, Doyle proposes that one cannot look at France or visit the country without seeing some aspect of the revolution. The Eiffel Tower, for instance, was the centrepiece of the great exhibition that marked the first centenary in 1889. He continues,\\"Nobody who lived in France, or visited it, could avoid these echoes, or echoes of Napoleon, who had marched under the tricolour, had tamed and harnessed the energies unleashed by the revolution, and whose nephew Napoleon III had ruled for 22 years before the Third Republic was established. (P.2)Doyle tackles this project in six comprehensive chapters. \\"Echoes\\" - the influence of the revolution that can be seen in all aspects of society, socially and politically; \\"Why it Happened\\" - the wide and varied reasons as to why the revolution occurred; \\"How it Happened\\" - events such as the Reign of Terror, and the establishment of a National Sovereignty, the many reforms, civil war and the wars abroad, ending with the rise and influence of Napoleon the First; \\"What it Ended\\" - the Monarchy, the fall of the Nobility and the Church; \\"What it Started\\" - a democratic system, an assertion of National Sovereignty....\\"not kings, not hereditary elites, not churches were the supreme source of authority in human affairs.\\" (P.81) And lastly, \\"Where it Stands\\" - how we view the revolution in present time, i.e., the classic interpretation, the revisionist and post revisionist interpretations, and its significance today.If one were starting a comprehensive study of the French revolution, this comprehensive essay, a little over one hundred pages, would be an advisable place to begin. The literature on this subject is enormous, thus Doyle gives us a list of further reading from General Surveys, Origins, Interpretations to People and Legacies.This little book is highly recommended for the student, amateur historian or the simply curious."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I majored in history in college, and already had learned a fair amount about the French Revolution, if mainly from it being mentioned peripherally in almost every course I took dealing with the period that came after the Revolution. So a lot of the names of the principal actors and the various groups like the sans-culottes and girondistes were already known to me beforehand.Well, as some other reviewers have noted, the book gives the barest possible narrative outline of the Revolution itself, so if you're looking for a blow-by-blow account of what happened from, say 1789-1795, then go for Jeremy Popkin's book on the same topic.Instead, this book offers an excellent overview of what the Revolutions more long-term effects were, and how the Revolution has been seen and imitated in the two centuries that have followed it. In the first chapter, it also discusses in brief the old regime that was replaced by the Revolution, detailing the weaknesses that led to its violent fall. Without this key introduction, the discussion following it would be acontextual and I found myself continually leafing back to it, particularly since I knew so little about the period before reading the book.The bibliography provides a great guide to further readings.In sum: the book is just what it says it is and couldn't be more concise or informative. Anyone who's heard the French Revolution being discussed, knows a little about European history already, and wants to know more about both is well-advised to try this book."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I easily concur with the previous reviews: this is an outstanding introductory text on the French Revolution. Of particular interest beyond the mere historical facts surrounding the revolution is Doyle's presentation on how the event has been interpreted over the past two centuries. The study of this book can easily result in derivative studies of Furet, Schama, and others. Not only a bargain pricewise, but a great presentation of a critical historic event in an exceptionally interesting and accessible structure. I have to say that I immensely enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Lets face it: many people cite the French Revolution as the source of innumerable subsequent political ideological movements, but when pressed, still have difficulty describing the essential elements and personages involved in the event. One likely cause for this phenomena is the tempting urge to \\"ape\\" the attributions and thoughts of others without a personal understanding of the subject matter -- the French Revolution has long since passed into a popular and iconographic status -- but another is surely the bewildering array of people surrounding the event, the requirement for a precursory understanding of the \\"Ancient R&eacute;gime\\" to set the stage for the Revolution's appearance, and the sheer number of divergent events occuring once the event got started.In this sense, Doyle's book well serves the introductory reader well by helping develop a foundational understanding of the French Revolution through its clear verbiage, introduction to personages, and its narrative timeline approach. The book, too, sets the stage for additional derivative studies (perhaps by using the popular works by Furet, Schama, and others) while still being able to stand on its own as a primer to the subject. Of particular note is Doyle's presentation on how the event has been divergently interpreted by historians over the past two centuries. One can certainly read this book in an evening or two if all that is wished is a highlight of the topic, but taking a bit longer to carefully examine and think about its content can yield great educational benefits.In summary, not only is the text a bargain, but it provides a great \\"very short introduction\\" to a critical historic event in an exceptionally interesting and accessible structure. I have to say that I immensely enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This is a brief and insightful book on the French Revolution. It gives a good broad overview of the Revolution and its wider repercussions since then. The author did a commendable job of producing an excellent brief account which should suffice for those who need the basics and not interested in the details of the grisly executions, bloodletting and campaigns by French armies against the coalitions pitied against it.For the veteran historians and others that are familiar with the French Revolution, the book is too brief. However, if the veteran is rusty and needs a good basic revision and reminder, then this book will do.This is a recommended basic insight into the French Revolution which is well worth reading as this Revolution has had far reaching implications which are being felt up to this day."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I highly recommend this volume to anyone who wants to know about the French revolution but doesn't have a lot of time to spend on it. I read it while waiting between flights. Doyle is an excellent writer and the volume is very engrossing (good enough that I have subsequently checked out his full treatment of the revolution). He does a good job of covering all of the basics of the French revolution and warning readers where the shortfalls are in the book because it is a brief treatment. But what I really liked about the volume is his discussion where he looks at the French revolution as it is treated today and the 200th anniversary that occured just under a decade ago.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Doyle's condensed version of the French Revolution is an excellent source for revisiting this period in history. Having majored in French Language 20 years ago, I am embarassed to admit both of how much I had forgotten and did not know of this event. Doyle's book is a wonderful work outlining the chronolgy, revealing the hows and whys, and most importantly discussing its value today. Its 135 pages are worth their weight in gold."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This is an excellent short introduction of the subject. Mr. Doyle has written several longer books about the French Revolution, but this VSI is not a condensed version of his other books. Instead, his approach to trace the origin, process, results, and impact of the event provides both a very clear flow of what has happened and why they are important. This is probably required reading if you want to get a basic understanding of the subject, and provide a framework for more details on its different aspects."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I was somewhat disappointed, when I began reading this book, because it seemed to be taking the author much too long to get around to his subject: the French Revolution. But as I got deeper into it I began to see what the author was striving to do and had to agree that much of the story of the French Revolution, and the most important and intriguing part, took place before and continues to take place after the actual event. I also have to agree that, as the author said in the beginning, the story of the French Revolution and its impacts on society are so complex and take place over such an extended period of time that it is extremely difficult to adequately cover them in such a small tome as this (108 pages). That brevity forced this author to pick and choose his points of discussion and skip the more sordid details of the revolution. This makes his book somewhat difficult for a lay reader to grasp in its entirety, but it is well worth the effort.Prior to reading the book: my first thought upon hearing the word \`revolution' had always been of the American Revolution; the revolution which founded the United States of America. The French Revolution, besides being an almost complete mystery to me, had always seemed to be of lesser importance. Little did I know that the exact opposite is more likely the case. The American Revolution may have created a new nation, and that nation may have gone on to become the most powerful nation in the world; but, if I read this book correctly --- and I think I do --- the French Revolution had more of an impact --- changing the world and still changing it today.To illustrate, consider this: France's support for the American Revolution and its principles led many Frenchmen to wonder why those same principles didn't also apply to them. The subsequent revolution, by encouraging equality and freedom in France, then caused the greatest slave revolt in history, in Saint-Domingue, ultimately leading to the creation of the Nation of Haiti. The French Revolution also demonstrated to the people of other European nations that the old orders could be abolished and that sovereignty could rest with the people; rather than with sovereign kings, hereditary elites, or churches. Furthermore, by locating sovereign power in the \`Nation,' a king could be made the servant of the people rather than their master. This encouraged the overthrow of other monarchies throughout Europe. It also led to the retreat of the Holy Roman Empire from its association with sovereign secular states; coinciding with the promulgation of the doctrine of papal infallibility by the Vatican Council.Those who brought about the French Revolution, the enlightened, also thought that the established Church was the root of most of the evils in society. As a result, France became the first nation in Europe to attempt to eliminate Christian practice in all its forms, thereby becoming the first secular state in Europe. This ultimately prompted the first attempt at a communist revolution in history. Furthermore, based on the events of the French Revolution, Marxists/Socialists, such as Vladimir Lenin came to believe that there could be no true revolution without terror since, in the absence of legitimate authority, ruthless power must be used. They also believed that the clergy must be crushed and religion suppressed.Based on these considerations, any thoughtful reader can easily discern how the French Revolution has changed the face of Europe and impacted the world's social order, and any intelligent American reader can see how the beliefs stemming from that revolution are now drawing a bead on America's way of life. Quite revealing, to say the least."},{"Title":"The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I found this Very Short Introduction to be accurate, informative, and written in an interesting and readable style....This book fulfills admirably the series goal of providing solid, lucid introductions to topics without being simplistic...I think readers already familiar with the history and events of the French Revolution will enjoy the author's style and modern day perspective on this historic event..."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript Bible","review":"Flash MX action script Bible has it all. If you are a fully fledged programmer or a newbie this book is for you. it explains everything you need to know and more. It contains a thorough description of the action script language and a complete reference. I never thought I could go beyong creating buttons and making simple menus but this book took me step by step and was easy to get me where I wanted. I'm still learning a great deal from it and I'll probably keep on learning new stuff from the same book in the future. I bought this book for one purpose, making interactive and complex websites where I can customise everything and add interisting graphical elements. The book teaches you how to access the advanced features in XML, sound control, using LINGO to control flash, making games... The list is very long.At first I was worried about the size of the book but soon to discover that it's organized in a way that optimizes the learning process. The authors put a lot of effort in explaining thoroughly what every line of code is doing and why it's written and they even thought of including the possible errors you might get if you use the code in a different setting.I can go on and on talking about all the neat stuff I learned but to cut it short; this books makes flash scripting as easy as riding a bike and takes it a lot farther than you can imagine. I highly recommend it to everyone, even the advanced users."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript Bible","review":"Flash is a very powerful development tool that enables me to do some really cool things. But the painful reality is it takes a serious level of commitment and a great deal of time to get to be proficient at all it can do.Using Flash I have produced many eLearning courses, interactions, banners, content pieces, and you get the idea. The Flash Bible series has made it possible for me to crank out all this work and to stay [reasonably] employed during the past two years. If you're wondering how you can keep up with all that's new in MX and still remain productive then you have to get this book.For example, for a long time I was happy making movies without components. I wasn?t even sure what they were. Then I picked up a customer whose application would have been a major pain without them. Chapters 26, 27, and 28 brought me up to speed in just a couple of hours.Flash development is a lot like that. Few of us can know it all. Who has the time to go out and find work, to complete projects on time [and on budget], and to learn all that's new? The Flash MX ActionScript Bible enables me to compete for work I would otherwise not be able to get.Reinhardt and Lott do a very good job bringing all the new features of MX down to earth. Using the table of contents and index it's a simple thing to narrow down and find specific information on what you're looking for. Their explanations are easy to read, understand, and apply.The Flash MX ActionScript Bible is very good to have around. Thanks guys!"},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript Bible","review":"The Flash MX Actionscript Bible is another tome of over 1000 pages in the Flash Bible series. It follows the successful formula established in earlier editions with its comprehensive coverage, detailed index, and bonus CD-ROM which includes numerous worked examplesThe Actionscript Bible obviously concentrates on a detailed study of the Actionscript programming language and the preface states that the book \\"picks up where the Flash MX Bible left off\\". Consequently, a familiarity with Flash MX is a prerequisite and since this is a programming book, a novice reader must be prepared to tackle programming concepts. However, the authors help the novice programmer with a series of introductory chapters supplemented by worked examples.Later chapters show how Actionscript can be used to enhance various aspects of Flash authoring. The coverage is comprehensive and the sample scripts can be adapted by the reader to achieve useful results while learning the language. Experienced Flash designers will find the book to be an essential reference manual, like earlier books in this series."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript Bible","review":"This is the second book I have purchased with Joey Lott and I have to say it is much better then the Remoting book but not by much. This book also has some examples that DO NOT WORK. Its rediculous to put examples in that are of no use. Besides that I really don't like his teaching style. He can get really confusing as he uses far to many terms to describe one word. Not only that but he switches as he pleases making you spend a lot of time back tracking trying to figure out what he is referring to. He also takes the long way around and I found myself taking a lot of notes to weed through and separate the learning from the babbling. It was really frustrating and I wasted so much time where I could have been learning. I have found better from instructors who are clearer, detailed and to the point. This book would probably be a few hundred pages less if he would do that. We would learn just as much.This (like others have stated) is definitely not a good reference book nor is it a good book for beginners but if you are an intermediate and you have already gone through some tutorials or other books written by Joey (that way you know how to decipher his teachings/blabbering) then I say give it a try.I got a lot of good notes deciphering his stuff into people terms which I have learned a lot."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript Bible","review":"I own both Flash MX Bible and this Flash MX ActionScript Bible, and to my opinion, neither of both have a comprehensive starting point.

In the pre-done file, they named the instance &quot;man&quot;, which is where this code came from, but they instructed you to name it &quot;mcMan&quot;, which would make the code not work.

The book &quot;MacroMedia Flash MX 2004 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh&quot; was more of a pleasure to read. But that book doesn't reach the comprehensiveness and doesn't go as in-depth explaining things.As always, computer books become dated before you know it -- I just noticed that the 2004 edition is coming out.

Growing up in suburban Pittsburgh, Height, now 91 and still busily at work, saw discrimination and never flinched, determined to meet adversity with an agile brain, a strong body, and an indomitable will.As a high school girl she won an impromptu speech competition at the county level, then was forced to confront the ugly tentacles of segregation when she sought to find a place to stay as she competed in the finals in the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg. She learned that she was the only African-American in the competition. When she sought a drink of water prior to her speech, it was the only other person of color in the building, an African-American janitor, who escorted her to the drinking fountain. Height won the competition by tying her speech theme, the Kellogg-Briand Peace Treaty, to efforts of the black race to overcome adversity. She explained to an enthralled audience that, just as peace can only be accomplished through purposeful unity, such is also the case with respect to the races. Height won that competition.After achieving straight A's at New York University, Height went to work for the YWCA in Manhattan. This was the beginning of a stellar career that took her to the pinnacle of African-American leadership in the women's movement, and ultimately led to a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Citizenship Award conferred on her by President Ronald Reagan in 1989. Height refers to two strong women of principle and achievement who served as role model beacons for the bright and enterprising young woman. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was someone she would admire and come to know well. Her other major influence was the daughter of slaves, the remarkable Mary McCleod Bethune, who would overcome a painful asthma condition to become a leading achiever for women of all races, and who founded a college, Bethune-Cookman in Daytona Beach, Florida.As a professor at Moorehouse College in Atlanta in 1945, Height met and taught a remarkable 14-year-old as part of the school's gifted student program. She saw the promise in young Martin Luther King and was by his side at the 1963 March on Washington organized by prominent labor leader A. Philip Randolph, the president of the sleeping car porters' union,with whose vision for racial progress she synchronized.In terms of the present, Height sees the Democratic Party as taking African-Americans for granted and Republicans of being neglectful of their needs and aspirations except when it serves their purposes to be attentive. All the same, rather than lament conditions, she remains the eternal pragmatist. She realizes that the road to progress can be best realized in the way that the great A. Philip Randolph outlined, by uniting and working diligently to achieve purposeful goals, by lighting candles rather than cursing darkness."},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"Open Wide The Freedom Gates: A MemoirThis is certainly the most exciting book that I use with my university students!Without fail Ms. Dorothy Irene Height's life story energizes them to become social activists on the campus.Her courage, determination, and positive attitude in the face racism and discrimination of many types emboldens my students to confront and uproot the same on the campus.My students consider Ms. Height a \\"TRUE AMERICAN HERO.\\" She is a role model, mentor, and \\"friend\\" to them.I highly and unreservedly recommend this book to every person living and breathing.

This is a history that was unknown to me prior to reading this fascinating book. Height takes us from her upbringing in the church in her hometown in suburban Pittsburgh to her working of the power structure in Washington DC. She worked with the White House from the 1950s until her death in 2010. She was on the ground during Freedom Summer in Mississippi and was at Martin Luther King Jr. side during the March on Washington.The only problem I had with this book was that Ms Height never discussed those times when she faced failure. Whenever failure loomed, she seemed to overcome it and rise to the occasion. This made me wonder just how accurate her account is. Most people who I have encountered have experienced failure in some parts of their lives.Overall though, this is a good book in that it introduces the reader to a side of history that is too often overlooked."},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"Dorothy Height's accounts in this book are nothing short of massive inspiration and how to peacefully create social change and equality during the Civil Rights movement.Her focus on creating new ways to reach people, pull together and band with others who also want to see equal rights in the most positive manner spans decades of tireless service.I grew up and personally witnessed the \\"race riots\\" happening in public schools in the 1960's and vividly remember the unfair treatment of men and women of color, as well as how difficult it was during this era for people to move forward in the face of massive racial, sexual and gender stereotype.We owe a debt of gratitude to Ms. Height's service. This book would make for excellent reading in schools to serve as an inspiration of what can be done, even when it seems impossible.Deserves 10 stars as a memoir for leadership, inspiration, determination and the courage to make a lasting difference in America.Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"This book was fascinating, full of events that occurred in a time I lived through but never was aware of. It is like Dorothy Height was there behind the scenes connecting the dots of events and interweaving the people who were in the headlines. She has the gift of knowing the importance of bringing people of all kinds together and the skill to accomplish it. She never gave up when she was told not to do something because that is not how things have always been done or it is too risky.I learned the term \\"Cotton Curtain\\"and about the bravery of a group of black and white women who conceived of and carried out the Wednesdays in Mississippi Project in 1964. \\"The specific goals of the project were to establish lines of communication among women of goodwill across regional and racial lines, to observe the COFO student projects and discuss them with local Mississippi women, and to lend a \\"ministry of presence\\" as witnesses to encourage compassion and reconciliation.\\"In talking with Fannie Lou Hamer, and knowing of the Heifer Project, Dorothy Height thought of the idea of setting up a pig bank in Mississippi. That idea was turned into a program with the advice of an Iowa farmer and the assistance of the Prentiss Institute. The National Council of Negro Women purchased 45 pigs. \\"Participating families were trained to care for pigs, to establish cooperatives, and to work together to improve the community's nutrition and health. Each participating family signed a \\"pig agreement\\", promising not to sell the pigs and to bring back two piglets from each litter to deposit in the bank.\\"Dorothy Height has never stopped working on the problem of racism. \\"Our young people ask why we have to keep trying to solve the problem of racism. Other people move on to other problems, but if you're black, you don't have that option. Your options are clear and limited:you either give up and go into drugs, or you work on racism for the rest of your life. In our society every setp African Americans take is seen in political terms....\\"The recounting of the huge effort to buy the present home of The National Centers for African American Women at 633 Pennsylvania Avenue is inspiring and again speaks to Dorothy Height's tenacity. I am looking forward to visiting that building and the Bethune Museum and Archives to pay respect and honor for a life so well lived."},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"Dr. Height was a very great woman, I like many others had a chance to meet and work with her.

Ms. Height took me down history lane in this book about her involvement in various organizations. Some of the organizations she mentioned in the book I am ashamed to say I never even heard of. The writing style of the book kept me reading past midnight. After reading this book, I can truly say I know more about Ms. Height as a woman and the various organizations she was involved in."},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"I received my order and the quality was what I expected.

I love this book."},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"This book is great for American history buffs interested in reading an account of the civil rights struggle. Instead of being a memoir elaborating on her personal experience, Miss Height instead delivers an account of her witness of history. A public experience. I am sorry Miss Height merely \\"sratches the surface\\" and fails to elaborate when she tells the reader about her relationship with Martin Luther King, Jr. and other prominent leaders during the civil rights struggle. This book is void of any mention of intimate relationships with family or friends. In the last few pages of the book, Miss Height unsuccessfully attempts to compensate for this lack of forthcoming throughtout book by briefly telling the reader that she was close to her family and she had some friends throughout her life she loved like family."},{"Title":"Classical Music Encyclopedia","review":"Overall, an excellent book if you are really into learning about the history of the African American struggle in the US for equality. I must admit, I got bogged down in some of the information. And one thing that kept me wondering -- why did Miss Height never get married? I don't mean to be inquisitive, but it is a question I kept wondering about.Overall -- excellently written, and very detailed. Miss Height obviously has an outstanding memory and eye for detail."},{"Title":"Resistance, rebellion, and death","review":"For nearly 30 years I have carried this book with me virtually everywhere. No, it's not &quot;an easy read&quot; - but it is worth buying (owning)and treasuring - if only for the FOURTH LETTER (to a German Friend)- it is the most moving argument/declaration for humanity and choosing it that I have ever seen anywhere.Some (like Sartre?) might call it a &quot;rationalization&quot;. But even those who have resigned themselves to the religions of cynicism and despair - could find a remnant of fight and even &quot;goodness&quot; (yikes!) inside themselves. Camus' words remind us that resignation and the inevitable indifference and inhumanity that follow are the ultimate betrayals of life.While there is nothing &quot;cheerful&quot; or even optimistic about these writings - you'd have to be cold-blooded, heartless and completely beyond repair or redemption not to be inspired by the wistful aspirations that Camus exudes from his admittedly battered heart and soul.I disagree with the reviewer (who did praise this precious book) Sartre is smart - but so is Camus - and Camus exudes the humanity that Sartre can't even see or imagine.Sartre would tell us that we always have the freedom to at least rattle our chains (at least theoretically) - but Camus has the power to inspire us to want to."},{"Title":"Resistance, rebellion, and death","review":"This collection of essays is the most brilliant one of Camus' diverse smaller non-fiction writings. The bulk of this book concerns his journalistic writings on the Algerian Revolution, Soviet Union etc. Through these essays, you understand the pain of Camus. Camus' ethics doesn't agree to mindless violence for the sake of power. He makes an impassioned plea for tolerance and humanitarian solutions to the problems of war and peace.Camus is not necessarily logical or politically correct. His stand on the issue of independence of Algeria is a compromised position between French imperialism and Algerian aspirations for freedom during that period. However, in his passion for diagnozing the problems of his time and addressing them, he hits upon a lot of interesting insights and arguments.Particularly brilliant for both its analysis and its conclusion is Camus' landmark long essay 'Reflections on the Guillotine' which occupies a fair part of the book. In this essay, Camus systematically demolishes all legal or quasi-moral justifications for capital punishment and answers the third aspect of the question - Whether human life is worth taking?In his 'The Myth of Sisyphus', he had argued against self-murder. In 'The Rebel', he argued against murder and genocide. In this essay, he argues against legalized murder. But unlike his earlier works where he offered weak arguments after a brilliant analysis, here he hits the mark by demolishing the justifications for capital punishment, totally. This particular essay deserves to be considered a classic in the philosophy of law and justice."},{"Title":"Resistance, rebellion, and death","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It has provided me with the strongest, most clear-headed confidence in the face of unrelenting hypocrisy and struggle. Camus was on the side of the angels for all of the conflicts of his time, a time that saw the darkest face of humanity. His arguments for compassion and justice are utterly transfixing and revelatory, and written with a clarity and insight that are simply breath-taking.I challenge anyone that supports the death penalty to read \\"Reflections on the Guillotine\\" and walk away with their arguments intact. In this piece Camus utterly demolishes every argument for state-sanctioned murder while defending the right to live with dignity, a right that can easily encompass the self-defense by combat necessitated by circumstance.Camus was a moral, intellectual, and physical hero, and reading these essays one is almost overcome by his sense of humilty, justice, and compassion. His writing is so crystalline, it's almost jolting. This is a powerful tonic for all those that despair of creating a place for the best qualities of the human race in times of utter darkness. A must-read."},{"Title":"Resistance, rebellion, and death","review":"Camus' essays are obviously more difficult to read than hisstories, and quite possibly more difficult to read than his philosophical investigations as well. Should they be read? Of course. In them, he speaks of similar topics (i.e. what to do in the face of absurditiy, human moral dilemmas, etc.) as he does in the other books, though in a more precise, more direct fashion. His views on the death penalty shaped my own almost completely.What you get in this book are coherent arguments by a coherent, nuainced thinker. Is Sartre smarter than Camus? Camus knew enough to fear most -isms and -ologies where Sartre did not... (not that I recommend ignoring Sartre either! )"},{"Title":"Resistance, rebellion, and death","review":"&quot;I step onto the podium only when forced to by the pressure of circumstances and by my conception of my function as a writer.&quot; (p. 132) From the circumstances of Fascist Spain and Nazi occupied France, to the circumstances of the Hungarian and Algerian struggles for freedom, Camus' essays demand involvement, require action in the face of hopelessness. He never offers a moment's peace for couch-potato complacency. &quot;Freedom is not made up principally of privileges; it is made up especially of duties.&quot; (p. 96)To read these essays is to step into the world of a man who said to Christians &quot;I share with you the same revulsion from evil. But I do not share your hope, and I continue to struggle against this universe in which children suffer and die.&quot; (p. 71) And &quot;Perhaps we cannot prevent this world from being a world in which children are tortured. But we can reduce the number of tortured children.&quot; (p. 73)Camus is recalled to the podium, in a day when children are tortured and die in Chiapas while most turn a blind eye and complain that sitcoms just aren't what they used to be. These essays, possibly his most accessible work, demand an active response from the modern reader. Our struggle today, although not against Nazi minions, still must echo his &quot;There are means that cannot be excused. I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice.&quot; (p. 5) [See Jamal's Live from Death Row and Peltier's Prison Writings, elsewhere on Amazon.]Camus is outspoken about capital punishment, too. &quot;It is obviously no less repulsive than the crime, and this new murder, far from making amends for the harm done to the social body, adds a new blot to the first one.&quot; (p. 176) His &quot;Reflections on the Guillotine&quot; is the longest essay in book. He views capital punishment, even in &quot;free&quot; societies, as an act of totalitarianism.Camus proclaims the call to justice and the struggle for freedom found in the Old Testament, especially in the minor prophets. But he does so in a modern context, where God is silent and man is the maker of his own destiny. Although he sees no messianic age, he proclims the hope that by continuous effort evil can be diminished and freedom and justice may become more prevalent.Five stars for courage, five stars for clarity, five stars for consistency. After the abortion of democracy on December 9, 2000, every freedom and justice seeking American needs to read this book.(If you would like to respond to this review, click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; send me email.

The four letters to a German friend are like a life line, and full of great things you can say to any foxnews types that pollute your world with their intellectual violence and simplified justifications for all types and degrees of aggression. Things like:\\"We had much to overcome-- and, first of all, the constant temptation to emulate you. For there is always something in us that yields to instinct, to contempt for intelligence, to the cult of efficiency. Our great virtues eventually become tiresome to us. We become ashamed of our intelligence, and sometimes we imagine a barbarous state where truth would be effortless. But the cure for this is easy; you are there to show us what such imagining would lead to and we mend our ways.\\"Classic!Also, the \\"Reflections on a Guillotine\\" contains all that you need to absolutely destroy any pro capital punishment arguments that are out there."},{"Title":"Resistance, rebellion, and death","review":"'Resistance, Rebellion, and Death', well the title certainly delivers, each word that Camus writes is empowered by a conviction of the seeming highest moral character confronted with a truly trying time in human history (but what times aren't filled with hardships?).The only issue I have with these particular collection of writings is the predictability in Camus' thought process, many of which occur in the middle half of the book. I do Wager that the 'Letters to a German Friend' and the last section 'The Artist and His Time' are truly excellent pieces of work. If not for the philosophical aspects of the book, the historical can quench the philosophical hungers. Perhaps I am just not a fan of journalism...Perhaps the translator is to blame for some of the dry predictable structuring of words?It's interesting because I have a copy of 'the Rebel' translated by Anthony Bower, whom the ability of poetic fervor is not lacking. But then again I've read 'The Fall' of which Justin O'Brien translated quite well.But I shouldn't complain I vaguely understand French.

But remember, as they say on the Simpsons: Camus can do but Sartre is smarter!"},{"Title":"The Border","review":"I'm going to say the nice things first, because the rest of this review *isn't*. This book is trying to do something new -- specifically, it's not another installment of a 7 book saga of yet another author ripping off J.R.R. Tolkien. It looks at a culture that isn't well-known or well-explored by the modern fantasy world. There are no dragons, no swords, no princesses, and no dire prophecies. Magic is here, yes, but it's just as inexplicable to the wielder as to those around her. Hopefully she will continue to explore cultures such as these as she continues to develop her talents.But otherwise, I have to disagree with the glowing review of this book. The writing was nice enough, but the twists and turns of the story that Ms. Fitch's plot depends on are just too unbelievable, if not simply absurd. Good writing requires that the reader be coaxed into a suspension of belief -- the writer creates a world that is so vivid, we never question the events that unfold as anything but valid, true, and *real*. You must seduce the reader into trusting this new place the author has created; you can't sullenly say, &quot;It works like this because I'm the author, that's why.&quot; Fitch has a good idea here, and plenty of potentially interesting elements, but she never once takes the time to develop them into anything more than annoying inconsitencies that frankly, mar the entire work.The life of Rosa and her mother are saved by her guardian spirit, yet when the guardian is screaming at the top of her lungs, &quot;NO! GO BACK! THIS WAY LIES DANGER!&quot; Rosa just plods obstinately along and right into the Major Plot Device. No real reason is given for why, considering this experience, Rosa would so flatly ignore her guardian. Yet ignore she does. Luz's urgency, distress, and abject fear are very well-portrayed; however, this only serves to make Rosa's single-mindedness look moronic by comparison. A simple sentence saying something to the effect of &quot;Despite everything Luz had done over the years, Rosa could not erase the dread and fear of that night she last saw her father. She could not, could not put her trust in Luz tonight.&quot; would have gone a long, long way here. Or, &quot;Rosa was so tired of the way Luz saw danger in every shadow, like a half-hysterical old grandmother. Tonight, she would be her own woman who makes and stands by her own choices.&quot; the refusal to explain Rosa's inexorable headlong dive into mortal danger is irritating because it so easily could have been written better.This is hardly the only time Fitch's laziness damages her admittedly original story. After spending half the book watching Mary anguish over her childlessness, are we *really* expected to believe that it's caused by medicinal herbs given to her in her morning tea by a well-meaning old man to *intentionally* cause her sterility? For one thing, who is this person that he has this knowledge? Are we supposed to believe that every Anglo-Saxon retiree has a bottle of these herbs that &quot;the Shoshone women used&quot; in their medicine cabinets? I don't think it's too much to ask that when characters act on strange and little known information, we be told something of how they aquired such obscure knowledge; I refuse to believe everyone finds these things out by watching The Discovery Channel. But then, we're expected to swallow well-meaning-old-man's excuse that it just *slipped his mind* that 18-year-old Mary might someday might want to have children. &quot;(It) Never occurred to me that you might want kids...&quot; he explains. This has all the credibility of a badly-written episode of &quot;All My Children&quot;. Why should we believe this? Who in the world would buy that kind of line? Unfortunately, I did -- paid $5.99 for this silliness and much more just like it.I admit that this review is very sarcastic, but it's because that the sorts of blunders (that occur all throughout the book) could have been so easily corrected with just a little more explanation, a little more exposition, a little more revelation. And who knows, maybe this book got butchered by the editors; all the omissions that drove me to distraction might have ended up on the proverbial cutting-room floor. I certainly hope so. Even so, I'm going to get my copy of &quot;Seventh Heart&quot;, her first novel, from the library. Until she can produce better work, I refuse to pay for another Marina Fitch novel."},{"Title":"The Border","review":"I loved this book. It introduced me to people and places that gave me fresh, often subtle insight into the human condition. Any journey involves sacrifice and change. The decision to move, to give up one life in the hope of a better one, is never easy. It requires courage, determination, and a willingness to take risks -- to go forward despite the reservations of friends, family, and trusted advisors. The danger can be physical, emotional, or both, and as potentially damaging as it is liberating.Rosa's journey from Mexico into the U. S. is both physical and metaphysical. The boundary formed by the U.S.-Mexico border mirrors the psychological, familial, and spiritual divisions she must bridge to provide a safe home for her unborn child, reunite with her family after years of separation, and make her life whole -- despite the racial, economic, and political obstacles erected in her path. I found the cultural, social, and geographic realism of this book absolutely convincing. The characters were believable, their motivations complex, understandable, and human. They were all well-rounded, with weaknesses as well as strengths. We all do things -- good/bad, smart/stupid, admirable/ignoble -- which we cannot always explain, not just to others but to ourselves. The Border explores the consequences of these acts, postive and negative, without heavy-handed moarlizing or judgment.What I particularly liked about the magic in the book is that it grew out of the character. Instead of Rosa being shaped by the magic she possesses, the magic is shaped by her. The power to change the world, and by extension herself, is manifested internally rather than externally. What a wonderful metaphor for the empowerment of the human spirit, which is constantly struggling to be felt in the world. Unlike the magic in so many traditional epic fantasies, Rosa doesn't have the ability to conjure lightening bolts, make herself invisible, or cause the earth to open up. What she does have is the ability to shape her life, and through her, the lives of others -- which can be one of the most hopeful messages and inspiring miracles of all."},{"Title":"The Border","review":"This premise was so cool, I really wanted this book to rock. As a Latina myself I was very excited about reading a fantasy based on my culture, not yet another medieval-esqu euro-fantasy. But I agree - it so did not deliver. She had good moments, but far too many dumb plot mistakes. It doesn't have to be Shakespeare, but it does need to be well-written, not with the kinds of holes a five-year-old can see through. You can almost see the book this could have been, and I am frustrated at how good it almost was and yet is so *very* not. Take another writing course, lady, you almost had it... but this embarassing book is not it"},{"Title":"The Border","review":"I loved this book - it's rich with the kind of fantasy and magical realism that we see in our favorite (and well aclaimed) books from South American authors but that is so often missing in American fantasy. And, as other reviews have helpfully pointed out, no dragons, swordfights, blood and gore (OK, just a little), no magic wands. A refreshing change and a new view.Marina Fitch is a very talented writer and I'm only sorry to see that there aren't more of her books available... I truly hope that this doesn't mean that she has stopped writing."},{"Title":"The Border","review":"This was a good book, something i really hadn't got to read about too much. And it was really good, but some things just can't be ignored. Like, why Papa didn't send for mama, or the terrible rushed ending. But it is a good read if you are willing to overlook some things and make up your own ending. It really does have good intentions."},{"Title":"The Border","review":"While I agree with a lot of what the sarcastic reviewer below me wrote, I also think you can't expect Shakespeare from escapist fiction. Who cares about the minor unbelievability? It's a FANTASY novel. I liked the idea of the story, it kept my attention and I liked the fresh turn of it.(maybe I'm easily amused....so be it) There aren't many contemporary fantasies out. Sure, it had obvious holes that were filled rather lamely. So what. I doubt Ms. Fitch is going for the Nobel Prize in Literature. As the reviewer pointed out, a good writer leads the reader down the path of unbelievability. But so too does a good reader willingly follow that path. I gave this book 3 stars because it's not the best fantasy I've read, but it certainly isn't the worst. It's not a bad read."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"Patrick S. Halley's book On the Road with Hillary is a terrific, rollicking, fun read. For Hillary fans, political junkies, or just folks who want to know what really goes on behind the scenes, this is a great book.I'm not a political junkie but I learned a lot from this book and enjoyed it...Halley is a great story teller, and he tells a story as if you were in his favorite pub in Boston, with him regaling you with tales of a trip just completed, laughing over a glass of his favorite potion, Guinness stout.Halley is one of the pople that set up appearances for political figures. He prepares successful appearances for Hillary all over the country, from isolated rural college campuses to big city parades and fund raisers. He visits umpteen countries, suffering the hardships of dining in Paris and visiting the poorest places in the world, including Mother Teresa's orphanage in Calcutta. Through it all he never loses the pinch me sense of wonder of a working class kid who makes it good on his native talents but still can't believe his good fortune.One of the best parts of the book is getting to look at Mrs. Clinton as a real human being. Halley is an unabashed Hillary lover, and he is right up front about that. The thing I liked though is the book does show her as a real flesh and blood human being, and not the one dimensional figure we get through the media at times.Halley has a real talent for finding trouble and then getting out of it, usually in a daring and funny way. Some of his best stories are about how he wound up buck naked in the lobby of Tokyo's finest hotel, in a losing test of wills with an enraged yak, and in a shoving match with President Clinton while an aghast Mrs. Clinton looked on. But everyone will have a different favorite from this book.So Hillary bashers, down a quart of maalox and loosen up a bit! But for Hillary lovers, Hillary neutrals, people who like politics, or just people who like fun, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"This book is fun to read, and presents Hillary Rodham Clinton as a real human being rather than a power-hungry monster. Patrick Halley saw Hillary Clinton at the high points and low points of the Clinton administration, and by the end of the book still finds much to admire in the former first lady.The behind-the-scenes stories from trips all over the United States and the world are humorous. Mr. Halley and Mrs. Clinton seemed to hit it off right from the start, and he presents an interesting insight into her personality and commitment to her political beliefs and various causes."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"Just finished this book. I found it to be a very honest account of Mrs. Clinton. A must read. I've always found it amusing that all the Clinton &quot;haters&quot; out there buy the books and read them!Interesting."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"Written by Patrick S. Halley, On the Road with Hillary is a must-read for political junkies, especially ones from Massachusetts, where partisan campaigns are played with the enthusiasm of contact sports. Halley cut his teeth working for local political figures like Chet Atkins, Ted Kennedy, Scott Harshbarger, Mike Dukakis, and Paul Tsongas.However, this behind-the-scenes look at Hillary Rodham Clinton's journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate transcends the inside baseball of Bay State politics as the author reluctantly agrees to become Hillary's advance man in September 1992. A modern day Huck Finn, Halley spends then next 10 years setting up trips in 25 states and 36 countries for one of the most admired and hated women in the world.On his journey with the Arkansas-Governor's-wife-turned-first-lady-turned-senator, Halley learns two things. First, he discovers to his surprise that Hillary isn't a prima donna, a militant feminist, or a political opportunist. \\"She's one of us.\\" Second, after agreeing to go to New York for just a couple of days to do only one trip with Hillary, he learns something about himself. \\"That one short trip proved to be enough to get me to quit my job, sell my house, and run away to join the circus.\\"This circus includes everything from keeping Hillary from bumping into Fidel Castro when both are booked into the same hotel in Switzerland, to getting into a shoving match with then President Bill Clinton during the New York State Democratic Convention in 2000. Along the way Halley sees a sunrise on the Sahara and winds up nude in a Japanese hotel lobby.In the spirit of total disclosure, I've known Pat for more than 20 years. I was editor of The Concord Journal and the political columnist for a chain of weekly newspapers back in 1978 when he became the executive director of the state Democratic Party - at the age of 24. He is an unforgettable character, but I never thought of him as a writer. However, after reading his first book, I've discovered that he is a gifted storyteller who has 29 remarkable stories to tell....But, don't blame me if this one short sample proves to be enough to get you to break a date, skip a meal, and pony up &lt;the money> to read the next 28 chapters of this \\"ten-year roller-coaster ride through the American political landscape.\\""},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"I saw an interview with Patrick Halley on the Fox News O'Reilly Factor and Halley convinced me to read this book -- just by being needled by O'Reilly.He's an undistinguished seeming man -- could be a Secret Service Agent and blend into the crowd.His voice has an even timbre, and his eyes are steady and true. He wasn't nervous - showed every sign of being an experienced public speaker.I believed every word he said - and it wasn't really much more than you've read in the cover blurb or the amazon reviews above. It wasn't just that he said he first signed on to be Hillary's front man because she's (quoting here from his own words in that interview - which I scribbled down as he spoke) \\"really different.\\" It was the way he said it. Matter of fact. Not really trying to convince you that she's \\"different\\" -- but explaining why he ditched his whole life to go on the road with a political figure knowing full well what he was getting into. He wouldn't have done that for most any other political figure. But Hillary wasn't like the others -and after one small taste of what it would be like working for Hillary, he wanted to work for her.Now, personally, I have little use for Hillary. As a writer, both fiction (put my name into the amazon search slot to see a list)and nonfiction (Biblical Tarot and Star Trek Lives! also available here), I have listened to her speeches and watched her delivery. She presents herself as I would present a character of mine that I didn't want anyone to believe.So I watched this interview with Halley very, very closely. I have never seen anyone else say such positive things about Hillary in such a convincing way. Living in New York, I did see a lot of Hillary - and a lot of coverage on her. What Halley was seeing was very different from what I had seen.You could read the book a dozen times and still not be convinced the impression Halley says he had gotten of her is true -- after all, anyone can type words onto paper, craft and hone them until they seem sincere. Halley could just be looking for another job -- or he might have been paid to say nice things about Hillary because nobody else wants to. But I was convinced he meant it.He might be wrong, but I think he believed every word.When probed about Hillary's response to the eruption of scandal, Halley said, \\"She's a very strong person (...) she realized it was important to carry on with the Clinton Agenda.\\"He saw her as committed to Bill and Bill to her.It didn't sound like a coverup to me.Asked about how he could guarantee the crowds the press wanted to see at Hillary's appearances, -- did he pay people to show up and hold signs? Halley said that he never paid people to show up and hold signs, but he did pay for the buses.He went out of his way to make the point that the bussed in crowd was there mostly for the convenience of the press -- so they'd be sure they could get their shot and make their deadlines.He said that the Press is the prism through which people are viewed, and he seemed to consider that it was his job to give them a clear view of Hillary to pass on to the Nation.When asked at the end of the interview if she will run for the Presidency, he answered with perfect politician's aplomb that he hopes she will run.That was the only point where I felt there was some more to be said that he wasn't saying.Read this book -- if she plans to run as we all expect she does, this book will be the first advance campaign gambit.People should also read this book if they don't yet know the difference between what a candidate says from the podium and what is really happening. If you don't understand politics as show-business (something I learned about while traveling to collect material for Star Trek Lives!) you really need to read this book.If you already understand what politics really is, and politicians never fool you, then you don't have to read this book, but you should remember that Halley - who worked with Hillary under the most trying circumstances, thinks she is a steady and strong person.What would she have done if she were sitting in the Oval Office when the Twin Towers came down?I think that's the question this book is giving you the material to answer for yourself.Live Long and Prosper,Jacqueline Lichtenberg"},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"I had so much fun reading On the Road with Hillary. It's the best backstage look at politics I have ever read, filled with hilarious stories, and fascinating portraits of world leaders. Hillary comes across as a human being in a way she never has to me before. I was also very moved by the story about the Clintons and Nelson Mandela at the prison where he spent so many years. Halley sounds like a great guy, someone you'd like to have a beer with. This book is full of life and full of laughs!"},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"This is a sympathetic, almost fawning chronicling of Hilary Clinton's campaigning and globetrotting during her husband's run for the Presidency and her run for the Senator of New York. And while the book has its better moments -- for instance her run for Senator of New York did indeed revealed her in a novel and unguarded light. Overall, however, it did not quite manage to hold my interest.For my taste, the description of the events covered were a bit too \\"frilly\\" and \\"fluffy\\" - I hesitate to say even somewhat fawning, with too much emphasis on cosmetics and PR and too little on the substance of Mrs. Clinton's views.Although it succeeds at its goal of giving the reader an intimate backroom view of \\"Hillary on the road,\\" that does not seem to have been sufficient to make the book robust or interesting: After so many whistle stops, the whole project became a bit repetitious, circular and boringly predictable -- often requiring the author to spin his wheels trying to set up the scenes by \\"padding\\" them with \\"pumped up enthusiasm\\" in an effort to make them minimally interesting. That Mrs. Clinton's campaign tours and travels were mostly mundane surely was not the author's fault, as he tried his best to make the best of some very uninteresting \\"run-of-the-mill\\" situations. For that my hat is off to him.Three stars for making the lemonade tasty."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"I purchased this book so that I could learn what being on the &quot;Advance Staff&quot; was all about. Also I wanted to read something from the perspective of a relatively unknown staffer, one that wasn't being either touted or persecuted by the mainstream media. (Prior to this book I'd never heard of the author, though he apparently was on O'Reillys show.) In general, the book was interesting, though at times I thought it a quite partisan, and often came away with the feeling that the author had more than an employee/employer interest in Mrs. Clinton. (Maybe a bit of a crush on FLOTUS there Mr. Halley??) For that reason, I tended to take some of the book with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"Alright, I'll be the first to admit that as a die-hard political news junkie, I had a hard time passing On the Road with Hillary one up. When I'm looking to get the latest bit of political gossip (all the better to meticulously pick apart with a fine toothed comb and later blanch about in a heated blog post) I want it to be a clear cut, unimpassioned view of the issues. I apologize to editors everywhere but; opinions - especially political ones - are just far too messy. And, no, I don't miss the irony in that statement regarding the type of essay I'm currently writing. But as we all know, books are stuffy subjects and, upon picking this book up, I felt a bit of inflammatory rhetoric couldn't hurt, right?Immediately, I could tell this one would be a doozy; and it wasn't the bright pink and neon yellow color scheme. No, a book on either of the Clintons was bound to be a wholly impassioned one. There was the chance of either a right-wing rail against the very fundamentals of the Clinton machine or a reproachful decry of the news media's special hate for theex-presidential family and undying loyal support that Clinton activists are famous for. Despite the cover sporting a look best described as \\"embarrassing\\", this book falls in the latter camp.For many, this reading would be a bit of an outdated one. Published before recent political events, this book misses the time line entirely of Hillary: presidential nominee to instead trace the path of Hillary: presidential wife. This is apparent in the books subtitle: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate. Told by one of Hillary's best advance men Patrick S. Halley, it becomes readily apparent that this would be for the most part a feel-good novel. And I'm not ashamed to confess that, putting aside all personal political stances, I felt good reading this.Quick, with writing balanced by a rather well-paced, good-sized read, On the Road knows how to tell and entertaining story. And that is no small feat. Despite the rather frantic, heady life of those in the political arena - the work itself can be boring, monotonous and - well - make for a less than exciting tale. That however is not the issue here. Far less likely than this, you'll probably noticed instead the almost single-minded liberal slant that Hillary adopts. There is an attempt to make this seem like a natural outgrowth of years dedicated to the former first lady. Of course, one must realize that it would be hard to be around such company and not be caught in the excitement of their cause; but we are only ever given a sneering commentary of the right that edges on domineering.The humor in On the Road with Hillary is dished out a mile a minute. At its best he reaches nuanced conclusions hitting on the ironies of the distressed political world. At its worst, well, you be the judge of such quaint jabs such as one chapter entitled \\"Cookie Monster\\" in regards to, of course, a certain line said by Hillary that certainly offended a large demography of stay at home moms. Its hard to come off hating the man though; he is just as quick to make a self deprecating joke after faulting on the opposing party's line. It doesn't hurt that his tone stays consistently affable and unabashedly his own throughout. He is quick to remind and the reader (should) know; the book is nothing more than an extended anecdote (along with a surprisingly enjoyable process analysis of the work involved in advancing) that takes on an unrelenting unashamed view exclusively from the left side of the camp.His devotion with the stance, the Clinton campaign, and Hillary herself never falters and borders on more than one occasion with outright adoration. It is to be suspected that working personally with Hillary in a highly emotional, stressed environment would lead to more than just a professionally based connection. As he constantly shows: there will be sweat, blood, and tears. There is a certain level of discomfort placed upon the reader, however, as we are left to speculate upon just how closely he feels with the former first lady. Yes, he's worked with the woman for a good number of years and most likely receded his hair line back a few goo inches with the amount of stress involved; but we are given no mention of his wife back home after such sentimental remunerations of Hillary or even if he has a wife back home to mention. Off-putting as this may be, we are only subjected to endure this a few times throughout the entire course of the text and doesn't prove to be too bothersome.Upon finishing On the Road, one is most likely to be left with a feeling of new appreciation (if not unguarded hate if you're the type of person that Halley likes to poke so much fun at) for the type of work involved, gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the political life, breathe a sigh of relief along with Halley after a particularly stressful advance job, or feel the heady rush of achievement upon success in the political campaign; for as in all campaigns, sweet victory is a battle won but it remains only a battle in the more far-reaching war.On the Road with Hillary is not only a celebration of the Clinton family, a look into what really goes on behind the scenes, and a poke - however lighthearted and fun - at the right, but is, at times, an insightful piece too. There is a constant pervading sense that Patrick S. Halley is always on the cusp of some deeper realization. That is, when he puts aside the left or right-wing rhetoric and makes larger extrapolations on politics itself, his ideas are made substantial. However these moments are too far and few between and become obscured just as quickly as they appear by a self-deprecating jab; almost as if he feels uncomfortable when departing from tired ground to make his own view.An interesting read but certainly not a running candidate amongst the echelons of great political writings, On the Road with Hillary should not be entirely dismissed. It is nhot for everyone to be sure, relying almost exclusively on opinion as its fueling force. But perhaps it is up to the reader to put aside their own opinions, here, and look at a side they may not have seen with a measured nuanced view where he does not. Perhaps there is no greater task asked of the reader than to share along with Halley in his sunny eyed recounts of politics in a celebration of its best, worst, and funniest moments."},{"Title":"On the Road with Hillary: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Journey from Arkansas to the U.S. Senate","review":"Mr Halley is simply a stooge for the Clintons; he is their response to Drudge they hate so much for having first revealed the Lewinsky story; needless to say, Drudge is as a disgusting a character as anyone trying to balance out his role in the media at the behest of the Clintons who know no limits so far as manipulating public response to their doings is concerned;nice try, Mr Halley--put on a cap instead of Drudge's stupid hat and make a few bucks along the way...There is always a possibility that your stalwart support of Senator Clinton (D-New York)will yield a second-tier position in the future Clinton II administration."},{"Title":"Second Latin,","review":"This second year Latin course supposes the previous study of &quot;Latin Grammar,&quot; by the same authors.It is intended for students who can devote only two years to the study of Latin and who must by prepared to read intelligently Latin textbooks of philosophy, theology, and canon law.

They live across the river from each other. The girls are trying to get even with the boys for the tricks they've played on them since they moved in. The girls first plan to steal the boys clothes while they were sleeping in a tent. But the girls get caught and run back home. Most of the story talks about what the Malloy's and the Hartford's are going to be for Halloween and how they are trying to ruin each others costumes. My favorite character is Caroline because she is the oldest and is bossy. I relate to Beth Malloy because she is the youngest, she's smart and she comes up with a lot of the ideas. I have been in parades like the kids.At first the book seemes boring but it got more interesting as I continued reading. My favorite part is where they made the youngest, Peter eat the pie Mrs. Malloy sent to Mrs. Hartford. They thought the girls had done something to it. The boys replaced the pie with one from the bakery. I think it would make it interesting if the girls and boys were in the same family. Then they would play tricks on each other all the time.I would recommend this book. It is funny and fun to read.

On the other hand, if you use your right thumb, you are rewarded with clear and concise one-page descriptions of loon lore, as well as eye-catching \\"Loonphabet\\" illustrations for the opening letters at the top of each page.This is a stunning book all ages will enjoy. Author Donna Love and illustrator Joyce Turley have created an intimate \\"come-on-in\\" atmosphere surrounding the intriguing world of loons. Donna uses direct down-to-earth prose that give you a basic understanding of their fascinating world. For instance, you learn that a loon has four calls: the tremulo, the wail, the hoot, and the yodel. Each is briefly and clearly described. You learn of the \\"looney\\", Canada's unique one dollar coin with the a loon imprinted on it. You also learn of loons' sensitivity to human activity. They have already disappeared from Colorado and Oregon.Illustrator Turley has picked up on the key features of the text and illustrates them on the facing pages. She goes beyond mere photographic detail and adds compelling artistic touches that visually authenticate the scenes. The accuracy of the inset pictures of loon's eyes and feathers hint of her precise engineering background. Overall the effect of her paintings is exhilarating and inspiring. They make you want to know more about loons and you are literally drawn to read the words on the opposite page.OK, I'll admit it. Joyce is my daughter. So don't take my word for it. Just pick up this book and give it the \\"thumb test\\". I suspect that you will be tempted to buy it based solely on its artistic merit, its well-worded information, and its reasonable price."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"The book that I am reading is called Heaven Eyes.

The other Quote I liked from this book was \\"Her eyes beseeched me\\". I liked this Quote because it showed that Heaven Eyes was looking at Erin to see if she was trustable. It was also a big part of this story.My favorite part of this book is when Erin, January, and mouse meet Heaven Eyes.

David Almond did a fantastic job on writing this novel about orphan children who are mad at the world and think that nothing is right. It all starts when Erin Law, January, and Mouse take off from the orphanage on a raft that January made. Maureen, the social worker at Whitegates always told them that they were damaged children without hope of surviving in the world.

David Almond just gets better and better. In the last half of the book I used an entire large box of tissues- and it wasn't even sad. I wept because there was so much emotion, so much meaning. Deep in a perfect reality is where it takes place, where time is slow and each little thing means so much. This is a book that cannot be easily put into neat little plot categories, and it is all the better for that. The relationships between the characters are perfection. There is a deep emotional, psychological, and, it seems, nearly sexual connection between the characters. By sexual I mean a deep bond, love beyond friendship kept in innocence. None of the characters touch each other, however, or say or do things that would lead you to believe they were physically in love. This is because the love needs to transcend gender and the act of sex, which would seem shallow and out of place. Don't just read this book flatly, let the book take you in. Spend time in each moment and reverie. And remember your box of tissues."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"Heaven Eyes was a good book but it was hard to understand. I would recommend this book for people who like realistic fiction."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"Sometimes you read a book and it feels completely cinematic. This is one of those books. Like The City of Lost Children or Pan's Labyrinth, this story about three orphans who run away from an orphanage and are rescued by a strange child with webbed hands and feet is a bit dark but more magical than ominous. A great book that's slightly creepy, slightly surreal and completely engaging from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"The story of Heaven Eyes focuses on Erin Law, January Carr, and Mouse Gullane, three children who run away from their orphanage, Whitegates. They set afloat on a raft and nearly drown, but are rescued by Heaven Eyes, a strange, innocent child with webbed hands and feet. Heaven Eyes should have drowned at sea, but was rescued from the mud, and only Grampa knows the secret to her history. He isn't telling. They find themselves investigating the mysteries surrounding the old printing press and storage building where Heaven Eyes lives. During the time they spend with Heaven Eyes and Grampa, they begin to see the outside world as a land of \\"ghosts\\". The children have to choose to stay in that eccentric, mysterious and possibly sinister world or to flee back to safety in the mundane world and perhaps lose the hopes of spiritual healing they discovered in Heaven Eye's world.One word: Wow.This book's setting struck a perfect balance between fantasy and reality, all within a quaint and eccentric (but mysterious and somewhat unsettling) world. This mysterious, quirky reality was one of my favorite things about Heaven Eyes; the familiarity yet oddness of the world Erin and her friends were inhabiting.Another thing I loved about this book was the relationship between Erin and January. I felt like their personalities complemented each other well. Erin is the strong but silent type, the responsible one, the one who -- although she would rather not admit it sometimes -- cares greatly for other people. January, with his quick-temper, free spirit, and lack of impulse control, is never afraid to speak his mind. The two are so different, and yet they are best friends - and their friendship was believable at that. The trust and love between Erin and Jan seemed genuine throughout the book.And without giving too much away, the mystery of the mysterious girl Heaven Eyes will leave you breathless once you figure it out!Now, those were the things I loved about the book. However, I do have a few complaints.Firstly, Mouse Gullane -- I didn't really understand his purpose in the story. Mouse was never really supposed to come with Erin and January, anyway -- he tagged on at the last minute, and from there popped into the story occasionally. I wish I was able to hear more from him, to see his interactions and relationships with Erin, January and Heaven Eyes (we get a little of this, but not enough for me to put together any clear pictures in my head). In short, he felt very mono-dimension.Also, the writing style -- it was nothing special. I suppose it wasn't the narrative voice that bothered me, but the descriptions. While it got across a clear enough picture, at some parts of the book I felt myself starving for description! I wish here had been a teeny bit more.And lastly, proofreading. This book needed some! A couple times I found that end quotations were missing and things like that, and it rather detracted from my reading experience. (Just for the record, I have a copy of the original 2000 publication. I don't know if any typos have been corrected in other editions of the book.)Overall, Heaven Eyes is a beautiful, whimsical read. I have read and re-read this book and rarely get tired of it. I would recommend this book to kids ages 11-14, but people outside of that age range can certainly read it and enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"David Almond writes books that are some of the most profound young adult literature I have ever read. Apart from their short length, they would rate up there with any of the great works of contemporary fiction - and for young adult readers moving into a more mature theme, these works are ideal.Okay when I said \\"more mature\\" that sounded patronising! But I cannot think of a better word. These books are deeper than most adult novels I read. But that does not mean you have to be mature to get something from them. They are written primarily for young adults, but loved by adults too. If you know a better word for that - let me know!In this story we are intrduced to Erin Law, orphaned and living in care with other such children. They are encouraged to share their feelings about what has happened in \\"circle times\\", although Erin refuses too. They are labelled as \\"damaged\\" and encouraged to believe that they are victims of circumstance that will leave them unloved by the world.But from time to time they run away, and on one such adventure, Erin and two friends cross a river on a raft and end up at a wharf in the muddy Black Middens area, where they meet an old man and another orphan - heaven eyes.David Almonds works are laced with mystery, and some of that mystery remains unresolved. Who is Heaven Eyes? Ultimately the answer to that is less important than what she teaches the children about love and family and their own place in the world.There is sadness in this book. The author, who lost a parent and a sister at an early age speaks from experience on that score, and the voices of these children are realistic and almost heart breaking at times. But the ultimate story is one of hope.Not everyone will like this book. David Almond's books are light in enthralling plot, and heavy in characterisation. Some people will give up on the book asking \\"well what was it about\\"? Each to their own - and if you like books that are all plot and adventure, then maybe this is not for you. Then again, it is a short work and maybe it is worth a try anyway! If you like deep mystical books with a hint of magic and a large dose of realism, then this one is recommended."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"This is the second book by Almond that I have read; the first wasSkellig (Printz Honor). I liked this book a lot but didn't think it was as good as Skellig.Erin Law, January Carr and Mouse Gullane live in an orphanage and one night they decide to flee the orphanage on a raft. They end up stuck in the muddy slime of the Black Middens and are found by a odd and scrawny girl named Heaven Eyes. Heaven Eyes introduces them to a bleak and grimy world; an abandoned island full of empty warehouses and boxes of chocolates. Heaven's only companion is Grampa, and old man who is either a saint or a devil.This was a very interesting book. As with Skellig, Almond makes this dankest of atmospheres seem somehow magical. He has a penchant for finding magic in the bleakest of places. The characters are engaging and believable and the surroundings described in such a way that you can picture every horrible smell and creeping shadow.I enjoyed how Erin and her friends found a place that was apart from humanity in such nearness to their home. It was actually somewhat inspiring how they found a sort of magic in the ugliest of places. It makes you think about every abandoned building you pass and wonder what could be happening inside of it.The questions around whether or not Grampa was Heaven Eye's savior or the murderer of her family really drove the plot forward and made the book incredibly hard to put done. This was a book that was dark in its nature, but surprisingly filled with hope and magic. It was a very complete story but a big ambiguous at times.I thought Skellig was set in a more realistic setting and, as such, I enjoyed that book a bit more. The time in history this story is set in is fairly ambiguous and, as such, gives the whole story a somewhat fairy tale feel.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Almond's descriptive writing style and the way he finds beauty in the grimiest of settings. I would recommend this book for all ages. It is beautifully written and at points really makes you think about humanity and how we treat the undesirables in our lives. I will definitely be checking out more of Almond's works in the future."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"This was an amazing book. It touched my heart so deeply and i would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"Heaven Eyes is written by David Almond. He was grown in northeastern England. He used to be a postman, a brush salesman, an editor, and even a teacher but his writing started after he graduated college. The first novel for children he wrote was Skelling, and this book won a lot of honors, and a lot of best book of the year lists. His second novel, Kit's Wilderness, also won a lot of honors and best book lists for excellence of writing for young adults. He lives in England with his families.Escaped from their orphanage, Whitegates, on a raft, Erin, January, and Mouse float down into another world of abandoned warehouses and factories, meeting a strange old man and an even stranger girl with webbed fingers and little memory of her past. In this book, Heaven Eyes, the hidden secrets and the surprising past of the strange girl, Heaven Eyes, are hidden in the deep darkness of here, Black Middens.The reason that I chose this book to read for this assignment is because the title, Heaven Eyes, just attracted my eyes. I am not Catholic and don't believe much about Jesus, so I don't have many relationships with heaven. But I am very interested in reading some mysterious book, and the word, Heaven Eyes, looked like very mysterious to me. I am very bad reader, so I tried to look for the book that I would enjoy to read, and finally I found out that I like to read mysteries. That's why I am interested in mystery books.The setting of the book was already cool. This book is about orphans, and the way that they live differently from our lives. This book makes reader interested, because readers can have a time to imagine what their lives would look like if they live with their family, or parents. Also this book flows very unexpectedly and mysteriously, it's also fun to read and predict what will be coming out after each chapter. This book might be very interesting and great to people who are looking for a book to read before they sleep.The best part of this book, in my little thought, is when Erin, January, and Mouse were saved by Grampa, and Heaven Eyes from the mud of the Black Middens. This part got two new characters joined in this story. Meeting with Grampa and Heaven Eyes foreshadows that Erin, January, and Mouse will have conflicts, and happenings between Grampa and Heaven Eyes. The story is going to be about Grampa and Heaven Eyes' hidden pasts and secrets, so their appearance is very important part.I think that this book would excite readers' brains and thoughts, so for the ones who want to read with thinking a lot, this book would be cool."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"I was expecting a different story, but I was pleasantly surprised.

A little girl hears their cries for help and she comes running from the woods where supposedly no one has lived for a long time.I liked this book because it showed well how children without parents or family deal with their feelings and relate to other children and adults. I also just liked how the whole book was laid out and everything flowed really well together. There was one thing I didn't like about this book and that was the ending. It was just like the book was flowing along really well and then all of sudden it ends and it left me with a lot of questions.You would like this book if you like adventure.

His books are so good and not like anything I have read before. The Story is a mostly realistic enviroment but one element is added that is not real. (that being Heaven Eyes)It is about 2 kids that run away from where they lived, a center for 'damaged' children.

Some may have found the language of Heaven Eyes'character irritatating, but I found it enchanting and it enhanced the fairy tale quality of this interesting book. Her voice is what the makes the story a great read aloud. The Black Middens, the warehouses, the debris, all of the settings, gave me a futuristic feeling, while at the same time, the characters felt of an older world....making the story timeless. Almond has a unquie way of taking the dark and mysterious, and turning it warm, emotional and familiar. Erin Law is a great female character...gutsy, and sensitive all wrapped up in one.

The reader is skilfully drawn into dark, dream-like places before finally being lead out into the light. As in his two previous works, \\"Skellig\\" and \\"Kit's Wilderness\\", the plot is magical, a mix of fantasy and reality that won't fail to enchant. Whereas the previous two books are set in the air and underground respectively, Heaven Eyes revolves around and in water. The story flows in a way that reflects the river it is set around and the lack of realism in regards to the story and characters only adds to the mystical air of the book. Although I prefer his other two works, Heaven Eyes is a unique, unusual and special book.The only problem I have with this book is the lack of realism in the portrayal of the characters, in regards to their speech, actions and behaviour, which is not in keeping with their age. A minor point is that the way Heaven Eyes talks can become irritating, but these things can be overlooked in favour of the books positive points.If you enjoyed \\"Heaven Eyes\\", I would recommend Skellig and Kit's Wilderness, both by the same author, and the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman."},{"Title":"Heaven Eyes","review":"I just finished this book today!

This book was a real milestone when itappeared. In a very factual, unbiassed but totally proficient andpersuasive way it demonstrated in great detail that the persona of thepoems is presented, through them..... Sonnet 20 is of course a crucial targetfor Pequigney, and he reads it superbly, but he is hardly less good ona great many other of Shakespeare's wonderful poems, and is by nomeans narrow or obsessive about his point of view: on the contrary, hehas an excellent notion of how his argument fits into a wider schemeof things. Those who read the poems in Katherine Jones's disappointingArden 3 edition will realise, if they examine Pequigney's work, thatthat editor's claims about the supposed novelty of her views on thebisexuality presented within the poems is greatly exaggerated, andthat Pequigney makes many of the important points both earlier andbetter. Anyone seriously interested in the Sonnets will want to readthis book, which I would rank as one of the most significant and bestworks concerned with those poems: more essential to read than, forexample, John Kerrigan's edition, competent though that is, and insome ways more to the point than Stephen Booth's excellenttome. Someone reading both Pequigney and Helen Vendler would perhapsbenefit more from those two books than any others, though I wouldrecommend using Ingram and Redpath's edition of the Sonnets alongsidethese critical works...."},{"Title":"Such is My Love: Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets","review":"There will always be those who deny something that is demonstrably true: an inconvenient truth, as it were. But, as George Orwell makes abundantly clear, denial succeeds only by manipulating language and oppressing the opposition. And so it has been with the inconvenient truth of the Shakespeare's gay/bisexual orientation. Generations of students have been taught that in Renaissance England the word \\"love\\" (applied in a male-male context) meant merely \\"friendship.\\" After all, great Shakespearean scholars said so. Besides, any male--straight or gay--who asserted otherwise would be made to suffer.Joseph Pequigney wrote \\"Such is My Love\\" in the mid-1980s. It is a critical analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets based upon the character of the Sonnets as most probably autobiographical and certainly homosexual poetry. Of course, in order to do such an analysis, Pequigney had to demonstrate (not assume) that when the Sonnets address love, they address it from a point of view that embraces homosexuality. Furthermore, in order to make the argument at all, he had to show the longstanding evasion of the Sonnets' homoerotic character and trace the origins and currency of the \\"love = friendship\\" myth.All this Pequigney does, which is why his close analysis of all 154 sonnets had to be substantially pared down for publication. It is also why the book cannot be dismissed (on any reasonable ground) as special pleading. Still, given shrill assertions of gay political/cultural conspiracy, it is still relevant that the book, in position and argument, is endorsed by the late Richard Levin, eminent Shakespearean scholar and strong advocate for methodological conservatism.Pequigney employs a carefully hedged Freudian model of homoerotic dynamics, which, given current academic trends, may pose a problem for a few readers. But, for the most part, he is concerned to show that Freud does not contradict the pattern shown in the Sonnets--in effect, that Shakespeare proves Freud, not vice versa.In the years since \\"Such is My Love\\" was published, much has changed culturally, and academic protests against gay/lesbian studies have mostly given way to the realization that accepting homosexual love as a distinct human quality can enhance literary understanding in fundamental ways. (We now find that accepting Sappho's poetry as homosexual love poetry and not as some disguised expression of heterosexual friendship entails re-translating the poetry and understanding it more accurately.) Pequigney's study, which comes early in this change in academe, is a more-than-worthy example of the usefulness of the gay/lesbian/bi perspective in advancing the traditional values of scholarship in the humanities, values that do not depend on the scholar's personal sexual orientation.What's past is prologue. Let me now paraphrase parts of my original 1988 review:1. Pequigney accepts the original order of the Sonnets, that of the 1609 Quarto, showing that subsequent rearrangements have no textual (but substantial cultural) grounds.2. It has long been recognized that the Sonnets divide into two sequences. Sonnets 1-126 are devoted to the poet and his male friend. Sonnets 127-154 are popularly called the \\"Dark Lady\\" sonnets. What Pequigney establishes is that the sequences are not separated in time, but \\"intersect,\\" with the action of Sonnets 133-144 being synchronous with the situation defined in Sonnets 40-42. Furthermore, the action of the Dark Lady sequence begins after and ends before the period defined in the first sequence.3. The substantial action of the first sequence is the poet's wooing, winning, and eventual tiring of his young male lover. The second sequence traces the cycle of desire, lustful pursuit, sexual fruition, and post-coital disgust that characterizes the poet's relationship with the Dark Lady. The sequences are connected by the poet's jealousy \\"at the thought of a sexual liaison between the friend . . . and the woman\\" (p. 144). This despite the poet being evidently bisexual and the friend exclusively homosexual: such are the vagaries of developing relationships and self-definitions.4. Any treatment of the Sonnets must address their great themes: friendship, love, beauty, time, mutability, mortality, and immortality. In this, Pequigney does not disappoint. But he does lead us to acknowledge that Shakespeare's attitude toward love is, without apology, heterodox: true love is exalted over lust, but true love is experienced in a sexual relationship with another male, while unadulterated lust is experienced with a woman who is manifestly inferior in beauty and character to the male lover.A final note: Professor Pequigney was my dissertation director and has long encouraged me in my own scholarship. Professor Levin was one of my professors, and I note with sadness his passing in December 2009."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have read several books on Real Estate Investing - this book is full of great information not full of fluff!

The authors use a very readable style, combining lots of good information with just enough \\"fluff\\" to make it flow along nicely.I am planning to get started in real estate investing within the next 12 months, and I am devouring just about every good book on the subject I can get my hands on. I have read more than a few diverse books on real estate investing, which have provided me with a solid fundamental background of the concepts involved. However, Conti & Finkel's books are the only ones I have come across which provide any significant level of detail into the advatages and mechanics of \\"purchase option investing.\\"The objective of this technique is to lease a property with the option to buy it from a motivated seller (one who has moved and is paying double rent or who is facing forclosure, etc.) and turn around and lease it (again with an option ot buy) to an eager tenant-buyer for an upfront option payment, a larger monthly lease, and greater option purchase price. The key is to structure the buy contract to be contingent upon finding an acceptable sell match, guaranteeing that the property will create a positive cash flow from the start, with little or no up-front money outlay.As I alluded to above, I have not personally tried this technique (yet), however, I found the concept to be interesting to say the least. Throughout the book, Conti & Finkel suggest consulting with quality advisors, such as a real estate attorney, who should be able to provide some good input concerning the viability of this strategy and help you draft the necessary legal documents for your area and strategy.Although they don't include the full text of the contracts they use, there is plenty of discussion of the necessary clauses, which should be sufficient to ensure the documents you draw up with the assistance of your attorney will be adequate. The book is chock full of examples and experiences that review both the good moves and mistakes that Conti, Finkel, and their students have made throught the years.Readers of Robert Kiyosaki's books on financial freedom (Rich Dad, Poor Dad, et. al.) will recognize a familiar tone in Conti & Finkel's work. This book compliments Kiyosaki's quite nicely, and fans of that series should appreciate it. (And those who detest Kiyosaki's works may likewise hate it!) In fact, I would recommend this book ahead of Kiyosaki's Rich Dad's Advisors series on real estate by Dolf DeRoos, as it contains quite a few more details on just how exactly to get started and put the strategy to work, and not just a lot of theory.About the only detractor are a few subtly-pitched advertisements for the authors' web site and seminars, but these are few and far between, and are actually quite sparse for most entrepreneurial books.Even if you never put these techniques into practice, reading this book will broaden your knowledge base and open your mind to another aspect of real estate investing."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"My friend recommended this GREAT book to me because it was nominated one of the Top 10 Real Estate Books of the Year by a real estate lawyer who writes a news paper column reveiwing real estate books.I read the book and really LOVED it.

It has tons of great content & information on how to invest in real estate, as opposed to some other books out there that I thought were full of fluff. It was very motivational too. I liked the easy to read, non-technical, plain language. It was easy to understand.I liked this book a lot, so I bought the authors' next book, on investing in foreclosures too, called \\"Making Big Money Investing In Foreclosures Without Cash or Credit.\\" So far that one is very good too!I would definately recommend these books to any person interested in investing in real estate."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Being the second licensed RE agent to rate the book, let me say the following:I could not finish this book. I am always looking for ideas that offer an experienced investor a &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment. Unfortunately, I did not get that here.My feeling is that this book is the result of an ego trip. After reading a portion of the book, I got the feeling that Conti/Finkel had written this book based on the mistaken belief that they could explain it better than those who had gone before.In my opinion, they failed.

The thing is, Peter Conti and Mr. Finkel are smart guys who did some real estate investing... then, he decided to become SMARTER and offer his \\"Secrets to Success\\" to everyone else for a fee! How intelligent is that??? Be realistic people. There are no (legal) shortcuts to fortune other than hard work, inheritance, or winning the lottery. There is money to be made in real estate, and SOME gains may be as easy as he makes them look but the bulk of them are not. Am I rich? No, but I'm comfortable enough NOT to be willing to make someone ELSE RICH by buying products that only sell dreams. Due TRUE research people. Go to CNN.COM and look under Money. They have GREAT savings tips.. great investment tips.. Go to Fidelity.com... Don't make people like THIS Rich *RICHER* in the process. Honestly... any of us can take his book.. reword a few things.. write our own book... and sell some Dreams. Its pathetic. All these GET RICH schemes are designed to get the WRITER rich, NOT YOU! When you're up late at night watching TV and see all these bogus infomercials, turn the channel... Watch Nick @ Nite, anything but the \\"Dream Sellers\\". Invest your time and money in things that you can be proud of. Do TRUE research, don't follow behind someone who's only interested in \\"how much money you're willing to invest in your future\\" AKA \\"are you willing to pay for the next seminar because this initial free one is replay of the infomercial you saw on tv.\\" It's designed to get you HYPED UP. And how do I know? Well, I've never been to one myself, but I asked my roommate to go to one on \\"Our\\" behalf... U know, just to check it out and bring back some Great Information! Well, \\"Yeah Right\\" is an understatement... No great info, just a repeat of the infomercial and a list of prices for the \\"Upcoming Events.\\" And myself, what I've done, is ordered information about an at-home business that supposedly required \\"No Selling\\" (How unrealistic right?) Well the whole thing was, you create a website and let the website sell the product for you... but how likely is that? I mean, of course you gotta put some effort into it and ultimately you're doing what - SELLING. So luckily I only wasted $50, but some people waste hundreds even thousands on this type of stuff... Don't but the HYPE people. Don't buy it. Just accept that everyone in life is not going to have a mercedes and a $500,00 home... but if you really want it, work hard for it. Put in the time, the effort, and the research... there are honest ways of making a good future but you have to be patient. And again, I say, do not follow the Dream Sellers like Carlton Sheets, Russ Whitney, Peter Conti, Mr. Finkel and all the others.. unless you have a strong desire to help Them get Richer while you look on in awe!"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This book is extremely informative and easy to follow. In addition to the excellent advice and true life experiences, Peter and David offer extensive assistance through the web sites mentioned throughout the book.

Before the event, I had heard of them from some friends of ours that lived in Nevada who had been though their Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program and which now have about 15 houses using the techniques they teach in this book.So when I saw their book released, I went out and bought it the first day. I'm so glad that I did because I had a house that I had just picked up and was getting everything together to do a lease/option on. So because of this I started with chapter 5 \\"Selling Your Properties for Top Dollar\\". From that chapter I pick up some new ideas that I used on my latest deal that allow me to get $2000.00 dollars more from my tenants and have someone in the house before I had to make my first payment.Bottomline the book helped me make $2000.00 dollars more than I would have and saved me a lot of time and money finding some new tenants.\\"If you think you can or if you think you can't, YOUR RIGHT\\""},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have been to a Finkel and Conti seminar and have read this book.

Why would I want to be a landlord if I can reap the benefits without being one and maintain long-term profits AND low down payments, etc....I've read about lease-option, but this books talks in plain English what I need to know to get started---you will probably need more materials to move forward, if you have little or no experience in real estate. (I also read their first book, \\"Buying Properties in Nice homes with nothing down\\" immediately after reading this one, another solid book) This book talks in plain English, how to utilize different lease-option strategies and really gives a good \`step-by-step' action plan to get you buying properties.

The job market was really slow at that time, and he couldn't find a decent job that would support us. We started gathering as many different books and resources on Real Estate Investing that we could find. When it comes down to it, there is A LOT of information out there, and it was too confusing trying to understand it all. We found a couple of books written by Peter Conti and David Finkel, and that finally helped to give us easy to understand information. I felt like we finally found the 'cliff notes' version of Real Estate investing I was looking for. Something that was easy to read, and made sense. We started with their first book, 'How to Create Multiple Streams of Income' and then we read 'Making big Money Investing in Real Estate' a couple months later. I recommend reading them in that order. I felt the info in the Making Big Money book was just a little more advanced, and I was glad we started with the other book first and then read the second book. We were also able to attend a couple of their Real Estate Seminars. If you ever get a chance, I would recommend them. I like these guys because they are honest and ethical, and you can tell by listening to them, reading their books, and observing their actions at these seminars."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have to give credit to Peter and David - they have come out with an amazing book.

Thanks Peter and David."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"As a beginner in real estate investing, I found this book to be invaluable in setting all the wheels that I need to in motion to move towards that first deal! Having only had this book for a week, I am not there yet, but I have no doubt that much of my future success will be attributable to the tactics taught in this book!No \\"guru\\" should be the end all and be all of your real estate investing knowledge - I have read many and take away gems from all of them. These authors seem to have pulled together a solid instruction on how to find motivated sellers, negotiate with them to close the deal, and then resell to your buyer - that is a good place to start for a beginner, or to fill in some new ideas for the experienced investor...\\"Save your money\\" (from another posted review)?? Is [price] too much to spend to figure out if their advice and experience could help you to be a success?? Not in my book! Of course, this is just my opinion, but those people who will doubt and discount something without trying it would probably not have been a success anyway...Happy investing, all! : )"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Many of the techniques are working on paper, but the reality is not so easy. It seems to me the easier way how to make money in real estate investing is writing book like this."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"In response to the reviewer from Florida (who did not list his name and take responsibility for his ignorant remarks):I have met the author of this book, attended his seminars, and read his previous book, as well as this current one. The techniques described in detail ARE viable and REAL INVESTORS are making a living with them, myself being one of them. You only have a real estate license, which has handicapped you to thinking creatively about real estate investing. Leave the real investing to people like myself who are intelligent, creative, and hard-working enough to implement the book's strategies. My advice to you is to stick to selling houses in the traditional manner. To all others, read this book. The information will help you become even more successful in your real estate investing endeavors."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"The authors are among the most skillful *marketers* I've seen - I'm unsure about their real estate competence. I've received emails hyping this book for several weeks through their mailing list, and I'm sure book sales reflect these tactics. Overall the book is well-written and easy to read. The success stories are highly motivational, but I don't believe the average investor should bet the farm on this method. The book is entertaining, but not a foundation to build a long-term investment plan upon."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I am not a real estate agent, but a beginning investor (no real experience yet, just getting educated and ready). This book leaves such a bad taste in the mouth: win-win situation looks like conning the seller out of property and money using their desperate need to sell. Of course, at all times there exist business people and mauroders, and they both become rich, but in a very different way. I don't believe in become-a-millionaire-in-1-year plans.

Someone recommended I download a free E-Book written by Peter Conti and David Finkel called 'Multiple Streams of Income', it was eye-opening. The techniques that Peter teaches make so much sense and can work anywhere.

I finished it within two days which is really a record for me!Anyway, the techniques and ideas are priceless, they will have you thinking faster and harder about taking control of your future and getting into this type of realestate investing. They share a lot of details on how this works and they tell it like a story from the beginning to the end. Don't get me wrong, you cant just read the book and run out there, you probably need to get legal advice, forms and learn how to fill them out but the book really gets you up to that point. I'm going to put these ideas into practice and I have no doubt about my success. Like they said \\"It's not that things are difficult that we don't dare do them, it's because we don't dare that they become difficult\\" or something like that!I loved their first book and I love this one!

On the Must read list of RE books.It was refreshing to learn that you could buy property with a high level of intergrity and help the sellers feel good about the transaction. I have signed up three properties in three weeks of practicing the techniques. The average locked in profit has been $ 43,000. There are real estate \\" guru's \\" that spend a lot of time selling books and seminars that are long on theory and short on great techniques. However, I found David and Peter's techniques and business practices to be very sound and ethical. Anyone can do this, be successful and feel great about the experience.If you read a bad reveiw on this book...check to see if it is written by a licensed real estate agent ? Bottom line.

This one and the others educated me a great deal on the real estate market and opportunities available. Not all the ideas are for me..but some are, and I've since purchased 3 different types of properties using what I've learned, and I'm still looking for more opportunities. It's working in several ways. You use the concepts--the ones that work for you. It's not a bible--its an education and you apply it to your own situation and reality. My own real estate agent was scepticle too, and didn't think the techniques were on the up and up, or that the authors were really successful RE salespeople. But the results speak for themselves, if you use the tips to your own advantage in your own comfort zone. Yes, it does take some work no matter which choices you decide to use, and ethics. The book by Finkel &amp; Conti is written very optimistically although it does tell about pitfalls. After reading it, you may decide to do nothing, but just be more aware, or take action in a different way for the real estate opportunities. But the financial rewards are there if you pick and choose how you want to apply them in your own situation."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"After reading numerous books on real estate investing during the past year, this book, and their first book, are the most detailed books I have ever read.

I will back that up with the actual paperwork of the deals I have done if you are interested... Real estate agents are not experts at investing. Many are not even experts at selling real estate! A real estate license is often a mind barrier to some of the creative techniques that make so many of me and my friends so much money investing each year. Talk to the investors in the field actually doing these deals...not those who \\"seem to think they are not real\\". The concepts work and will continue to work.

Many of the people you get, as \\"Tenant Buyers\\" may be married and will DIVORCE SOONER THAN YOU THINK. This could be a nightmare for you, right?Heck the person you are lease purchasing from may have worked this deal with you because he's going through a divorce. The list of problems goes on and on! Wow! In a couple of months you could be a desperate, extremely motivated seller. DON'T FORGET IN THIS DEAL THAT \\"YOU\\" ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS. CAN YOU?I'm sure some folks are making a bunch of money at this! ARE \\"YOU\\" GOING TO BE THAT LUCKY? Many will say that you make your own good LUCK! May be, but I bet less than five people out of a thousand can do this. How many people purchased these books and put them in the library and do nothing. You may be able to succeed at this if; \\"YOU CAN MAKE THE PAYMENTS!\\"JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE GURU'S BOOKS ARE MOTIVATIONAL TOOLS TO GET YOU TO SPEND TONS OF MONEY TO TAKE MORE COURSES, and or buy more CDs. PERIOD! They want hundreds of dollars for a 10-cent CD with forms on it that they advise you to go to your lawyer and pay him hundreds more to either say they are legal or redo them for your state. You can go to an office supply store in any town and get a bunch of legal forms for under $40.I've owned a 5 plex that I borrowed $15,000 on my VISA card for the down payment in the middle nineties. I also owned two duplexes in the late sixties. I sold them BECAUSE OF DIVORCE. I WAS AN EXTREMELY DESPERATE MOTIVATED SELLER THEN, and there was probably only a 20% divorce rate then. Now it is in excess of a 50% chance. You know this already!Many say I'm pessimistic. However other experienced people and myself will argue that I'm a realist. Stuff happens everyday, every hour. After reading my review you may decide, \\"hey I can do this\\" and maybe you can. BUT YOU'D BETTER BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE PAYMENTS!!Yes, I have several books right now about option purchase tactics. However I have a $125,000 house paid for that I can borrow against in case of problems. I forgot to mention that I bought an industrial lot in my town on highway 6&50 around the middle 80's when things were very bad around here. The bank was stuck with it and financed it for me for $10,000. It might be worth $100,000 today. I don't know. It's for sale!!!Remember I told you I borrowed $15,000 on my VISA for a down payment for the 5-plex deal in the middle 90's? Well, I bet on the 15 or 20 VISA cards in my drawer I might be able to come up with $50,000 to $100,000 if I get in a jam.My wife and I are very frugal people. I still find denims and dress pants for under $12. I can handle a few bounced checks, and a couple of late rent payers etc., and yet, I may not get involved in more real estate depending on any kind of renters.Think of a friend, someone you know, maybe a neighbor, do they screw the landlord? Do they write bad checks? Do they drink up the rent money? Do they miss work?

Not enough depth to be of true value to a seasoned investor, but just enough depth to get a beginner into BIG trouble."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Whether you are just starting out or have a history in real estate investing, this is a must read in providing you with new skills regarding structuring your deals, negotiating, finding and dealing with tenant buyers, and making real estate investing work for you.The helpful information provided by David Finkel and Peter Conti's own lessons learned will give you an upper edge in your real estate investing!!"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have read lot's of books and information throughout the years about real estate investing,most of what i read is just words filling up spaces on pages just so someone can make a buck off of you.my situation:last year i thought i was a real estate investor of something because i bought a brand new house to rent out with 100%financing,the market went down but my mortgage payments as you know stayed the same.i rented the house for $1,750 a month.a year later the house right next to mine rented for $1,400 a month,my renter moved out.my mortgage is $2,050 a month.WHAT A NEG!of cash out of my pocket and now i must lower my rent even more to be competitive?I THOUGHT I WAS STUCK.i found Peters book,read it and did it.now i get $2,075 a month rent with $5,000 in my pocket.all said and done,it was a $70,000 DOLLAR DEAL for me.i love to read how some say these things won't work \\"IN THE REAL WORLD\\"i'm on my third deal now.by the way if you need a house sold or leased even if you have no equity i'm sure i can help you so you can GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.email me kelly at:newideas@skopeocorporation.com"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"The title gives you all you need to know about this text if you have any intuitive sense and that is, keep looking. The book presents itself as a simple, EASY way to increase your wealth and it sounds too good to be true for good reason."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I really, liked this book and I've read dozens and dozens of real estate investing book. Conti and Finkel cover strategies, negotiating techniques, and selling for top dollar. I especially liked the fact that there are ample real-world examples of successful deals that were put together using the strategies and techniques being taught. I would rate this as one of the top-ten books on lease-option investing available.In the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that I am an attorney, real estate broker, investor, trainer, and author of another unique and highly readable book on the topic that can also be found here on Amazon --The WealthLoop Series Beginner's Guide to Building Wealth Buying Houses: The Foolproof Roadmap to Real Estate Riches Without the Risks and Hassles of Landlording. Unlike many real estate investing books, it is written to be a genuine \\"How To\\" book that \\"takes you by the hand\\" and walks you through a step-by-step process for getting started in real estate investing -- investors across the country are giving it rave reviews. The book also includes sample leases, forms, and checklists, so that you can actually go out and implement the investing strategy it teaches as soon as you're done reading. You might want to check out the companion CD too --The WealthLoop Series Beginner's Guide to Building Wealth Buying Houses (Combo Audio/Data CD): Author's Audio Commentary Plus Downloadable 32-page Marketing Manual, Checklists, Spreadsheets, and Forms.A related program that's well worth checking out is:The WealthLoop Series Beginner's Guide to Personal Wealth Creation (Combo Audio/Data CD): Audio Seminar With Downloadable 40-Page Action Manual and Active Link Library.I believe that Conti & Finkel have written an informative book that's worthy of your time.

But after I found this book I can understand the steps to get started."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I loved this book so much I read it twice. The different techniques and real life, real people examples, their fears and down falls and how they over came them is what I believe makes this book so worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I've read hundreds of real estate books and this is one of the best five I've read. David incorporates his neuro linguistic programming so that when you approach a house seller, you'll even know better what to say to assure you will get the answers you want. I've met both David Finkel and Peter Conti personally and they sure seem to me like honest entrepreneurs. They are contributors to the real estate world...Once you listen to him, you will understand what I mean when I say he contributes to the real estate world."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Know who you're dealing with here. There are all kinds of people in the real estate business, and then there are sharks....In terms of the book itself, some of the tactics here are simply unethical. Much of the book relies on owner-financed deals. In order to get the owners to accept below market interest rates, the authors suggest labeling the payments \\"thank you payments\\" instead of interest. \\"Just by labeling the payment this way you de-emphasize the need to get an interest rate\\" (p. 103). Lessons in how to deceive and swindle, sweet dreams.They also suggest you push for a same day decision on any property. By all means, don't let the owners sleep on it, they might come to their senses!These are nasty people, every book has some good ideas somewhere, but this one was too nauseating to wade through looking for them."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This book was one of about a dozen books I have read to research creative real estate investing, and it was definitely the most straightforward and practical. It provides a good overview as well as enough details to explain the processes without overloading you with information. It does focus on the purchase-option strategy, so if you are not interested in using that particular strategy in your investing, then this is probably not the right book for you. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone just getting started in creative real estate investing."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I found this book to be a great, very practical place to start any real estate career. It starts with how to find good deals and moves you through the whole process, all the way to what your exit strategy might be with each property you sign up. I liked how this book took an honest look at the possible worst case scenarios and offered advice on how to avoid those. The sample documents and the section on contract clauses to use for safeguards was especially helpful.I feel this book is packed with info for any beginning real estate investor. An excellent place to get a great overview of buying properties in many different ways."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This is easy to understand and organized. I have found some great strategies here that I am definitely going to put in use. Think of this book as an excellent stepping stone to get started doing great things, but it also has some nuggets seasoned pros would appreciate. It gives you a good outline on purchase options along with some examples on how to take action. I must admit though it did leave me wanting more information, but I don't really expect one book to give me everything. Since education is a continual process, I am comfortable with seeking out even more information, especially from Conti & Finkel. Through my reading and personal contact with them at one of their conferences, I have found both of them to have integrity & compassion as well as brilliant business minds. You really are missing a crucial piece of why they are great guys if you only read their books. You almost have to see them live. Seriously, something about their way of teaching moves and inspires me! Either way, get the book. In the scheme of things, it's a small investment toward expanding your knowledge."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This was an awesome book to get me started understanding what real estate investing was all about. I was confused and really didn't \\"get it\\". But this book was so easy to read, gave me all the basics that I needed to not only understand what investing was, but exactly what steps I needed to take to get started. Most books are a bunch of fluff.... this really broke it down into chewable bite size pieces!"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone that is serious about investing in real estate. The information is not the standard fare that most real estate investing books provide. Peter and David share strategies that anyone can use, regardless of their economic situation and provide great case studies that prove their methods work. This book shows a much more more profitable side to investing versus the standard landlord trap or the fixer upper nightmare. If you're looking for a manual that will provide you with good, solid information, the information that you need to know to make a PROFIT in real estate investing this book is a great place to start.

In my opinion I'd say save your money. I read the other reviewers and bought the book because it was reviewed so highly. if you buy it, remember amazon.com has a great return policy. Don't allow authors to write garbage and get paid for it, but that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I purchased this book while traveling and read it twice before I arrived back home.

Oh Well, more deals for me!!Thanks Peter and David!!GENE"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I am a RE Licensee in the state of Oklahoma. I like this book and others like it because I also choose to invest in Real Estate. Those who say that such techniques seem unrealistic haven't invested in real estate. What is unrealistic is trying to invest in real estate using the traditional financing model on every home you buy. Some in my industry fear these investments strategies because it forces them to become relevant in a progressive marketplace, or else face obsolescence."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This book is one of those \\"must reads\\" in Creative Real Estate Investing. Lately, I've read on so many investing strategies, techniques and a handful are &quot;fun and interesting&quot;, but this book really makes sense to me. Why would I want to be a landlord if I can reap the benefits without being one and maintain long-term profits AND low down payments, etc....I've read about lease-option, but this books talks in plain English what I need to know to get started---you will probably need more materials to move forward, if you have little or no experience in real estate. (I also read their first book, \\"Buying Properties in Nice homes with nothing down\\" immediately after reading this one, another solid book) This book talks in plain English, how to utilize different lease-option strategies and really gives a good \`step-by-step' action plan to get you buying properties. This is something you would have to put into action and try it out for yourself to see it work, opposed to just reading about it."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"From multiple emails that I have received and which have also been sent by the author to countless novice real estate investors, the author is shamelessly trying to pump this book to the top of Amazon.com's best seller list. Honestly, there is nothing new in the book and you have to ask yourself if there are so many millions of dollars in real estate, why is this guy taking time and working so hard on promotion to tell you how to do it? Save your money and check the Net for free advice."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have read several books on real estate investing and I truly believe this can be rated as one of the best..very thoughtfully written with many great ideas."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"The ideas presented in the book are creative and great ways for people to make money in real estate without following the &quot;traditional&quot; system. The real world examples and processes are what make this a great read and a beneficial book. The only negative review of the book that I've read comes from a Real Estate agent which makes sense considering the mental box that most, but not all, real estate agents are in. The book empowers people to make it on their own through knowledge."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have read this book cover to cover for two days and it so informative, everything that need to do and say and how to say it ,, to the seller and buyer of real estate home, it's Here.Folk ,i highly recommend this book and you will enjoy and learn the whole process of Lease Option in short time.Down to earth aproach....I learn a Lot....Thank David"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Peter and David have put together a clear, concise book that is a great read for investors of all levels.

David and Peter make investing seem fun, interesting and provide step by step instructions along the way. I love the analogies."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Finished reading this book quickly and am very interested in starting a RE investing career. The Authors paint a lovely picture of financial freedom. The purchase option lease in theory sounds very inticing.I have 3 problems:1) They never give you the language to use in with the seller in hammering out a contract. And knowing the bare minimum about investing in real Estate I am thinking you need some VERY specific legal language in any kind of deal like this. So now, i need to go about paying a real estate lawyer a big chunk of change to write the contract for me? And this can be done overnight? Before the owner changes his mind..?2) It could take literally months and months to find a tenant-buyer - and then what, $2,000 a month that I dont have is coming out of my pocket?3) The big red flag here: - I had come to the review section looking for some honest feedback - And then proceed to find about 30 of the 50 reviews all posted on or about July 16, 2002.And 90% all give 5 stars. Unfortunately Ive become more skeptical because of this.. And not many actual testimonials of people giving actual sucess stories.. Only things like \\"what a great book\\" and \\"the best real estate book money can buy\\" etc etc"},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This is a great motivational book to help you get started in real estate investing. This book inspired me to get started in real estate investing and in my first year I acquired 13 properties.However, there is still A LOT of risk. The authors make everything sound like it is very simple and I can tell you from first hand experience that it is not. The book will give you a good background of how a lease option works and how to get a homeowner to lease option their home to you.Where the book falls short is on the fine details and the risk. For instance, the book does not give you any sample contracts. The authors instead want you to buy their CD ROM of forms which they charge a small fortune for. I found the lease option contract form I use on the Internet for about $25 and saved myself a bundle.And now the risk. Problems you WILL face are:1. Tenants making late rent payments. Can you afford to cover a lease payment to the homeowner if your tenant is broke and 15+ days late paying his/her rent? For each home you put under a lease option, you face the risk of your tenants being late on their rent and you having to cover the lease payments you are legally entitled to pay the homeowner.2. Tenants who back out of their lease agreement and stop making their lease payments. It may take you 2-4 months to find a new qualified tenant, especially if it happens in winter and you live in a northern region (people don't like to move when it is cold and there is snow). Can you afford to make lease payments to the homeowner during this period?3. Bounced rent checks from your tenants. This is a fun one. You deposit your tenant's check and then pay your lease payment to the homeowner. Then, your tenant's check bounces. Hopefully you have enough money in the bank to cover your lease payment to the homeowner or your check will bounce too.If you want to get into real estate investment, this book is a great place to start. Just be aware that it is not nearly as easy as the authors want you to believe it is and there is a lot of risk involved. But then again, in any type of investing, there will be risk, and the rewards of real estate investing almost always outweigh the risk.I am thankful I read this book because it gave me the motivation and confidence I needed to get started investing in real estate. And, in my first year of investing in real estate, I have made over $50,000."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Yet another book written by authors with slim or no real world experience. Sure, they are master salesmen who say all the right words and assemble all the standard ideas we've all seen a hundred times before into one neat package, but they are ACTING the part of real estate investors. Sure, they've done a deal or two, but the money they've made in the real estate investment business pales in comparison to the money their books imply they've made. And don't get me started on the money they're making selling books, tapes, boot camps and mentoring services.Image is everything and believe you me, they know it. Real investors reading their books may be impressed at how well they are organized and how they include all the right forms and scripts and all that other jazz. I'll give them that much. Yes, they understand how to assemble pretty books that are highly readable. But, there are NO new ideas, certainly NO ORIGINAL IDEAS, and much of the information is recognizable as being lifted from other authors' books where those original ideas were first mentioned.The authors are excellent students of the teaching game. When they set out to write a new book, I'm betting they order every other book on the subject, take notes, make lists and outlines, and eventually assemble a book that \\"defines\\" the subject. If that's what you consider a good value, then this is a book for you. But don't you think they should be required to add something new to the mix? Heck no, just throw in a very general success story or two from students who did something similar to what they teach and voila, bestseller.Finkel and Conti have mastered the art of packaging. Do that well, include all the buzz words, pretty charts and forms, and then add a couple testimonials from past students and you will sell millions...to wannabee investors who just don't know better.Real real estate investors don't care about image or tons and tons of generalized, shop worn ideas that get dragged out every decade or so by the lastest and greatest guru on the real estate seminar circuit. Real investors want to make money in the real estate business and will gladly pay for new, cutting-edge ideas they can use to make money in their investment businesses. This book simply FAILS TO DELIVER ANYTHING NEW that will assist them in doing just that."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I bought this book and its predecessor in New York recently. Both books are easily readable and detail an excellent way to develop real estate investment without bank funding etc (but conditional on finding motivated sellers). Both books, however, are similar in content and are thinly slanted to get the reader to invest in the ongoing programmes available direct from the authors (an approximate $2,000 of additional investment).I've been involved in the UK property market for some years and would find it very difficult to lead a motivated seller to a believed sale and then pull out if I couldn't find a tenant buyer for the arrangement (on any purchase terms). In addition, the voicemail telephone sales script for incoming motivated seller calls would be vital to any marketing of this system but is not detailed in either of the books.The assumed financing (as detailed within a \\"subject to\\" trust arrangement) is very American and would have limited success in the UK; personal guarantees would be a must.Neither books clearly answer what the reader would need to do if the property market became depressed and a number of tenant buyers vacated their intended purchases leaving the reader/investor to meet the monthly payment responsibilities.All in all, both books provide a good basic grounding to start your creative thinking, if you want to progress in the world of property acquisition with minimal risk, and for this reason alone are worthy of the investment."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I read this book earlier this year and went out to try out the techniques. It was much more pain than I had ever imagined, and as an ex consultant I was prepared for the worst! The book is definitely nicely dressed, but now I have no faith in its value. I wasted 6 months of my time and the opportunity cost of such foolish ventures is too high for me."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"Peter and David's book gives you a broad overview of some of the creative financing techniques used in RE investing today. The techniques presented REQUIRE motivated sellers and the authors are generous enough to tell you how to go about finding them. Please note that motivated sellers are not a dime a dozen in most markets, but they do exist all over the country. As for the man who says the techniques don't work in the Midwest, my very first call was to a seller in Kansas who accepted an offer using these techniques. Getting deals done is methodical and requires perserverance and practice. Also note that one single book will not be all you need to become an investor in RE, continuous education and hands-on experience are a must. Combine what you learn here with information from others, meet with real investors, talk to real estate attorneys, and then decide for yourself. To the doubters, at the very least do yourself a favor and read about Peter and David's methods for rent-to-owning your current home when you decide to sell it, you WILL earn thousands in profit."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This book gives you good practical ideas on how to get started in investing in Real Estate. There are some key items left out that you cannot get unless you sign up for their mentor program. For a beginner in Real Estate investing using Lease option purchase agreements it is a lot to chew. An experienced Real Estate investor will be able to apply these concepts immediately. This book is not for the lazy or faint of heart. If your are a first time investor this book will only take you half way to your goal of getting started. The rest is left up to you."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"This book gives you a good outline on investing using lease options. I'm a real estate agent in NC and I can tell you that real estate is a very profitable business. After reading this book you can't go out and make a million, but with a little time and work you could make some very profitable investments. Real estate deals aren't born they are made. This book gives detailedexamples and good techniques to use when you start to Create a deal. Most books give you just enough information and then tell you to buy their $250 program to find out more. Mr. Conti took one real estate investing technique (lease option) and went into detail about it. The only thing they don't give you is the actual contract they use to invest for themselves, but they do give some great claues that will help you."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I've been a fan of these guys books since I read their first one two years ago. I've read a ton of other real estate books and think there stuff is quite good. I thought a few of the personal attacks posted were out of line and wanted to say to anyone who is reading a few of the , listen to what Robert Bruss said (I've been reading his syndicated real estate column for four years now.)He says, &quot;This book contains the best real estate negotiation strategies I've ever read. I wish I had known their techniques when I started investing in real estate... On my scale of one to 10, this outstanding book rates an off-the-chart 12.&quot;Then read the few negative reviews with a grain of salt. THe book is worth it if you're into real estate. That's all I wanted to say."},{"Title":"Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate: Without Tenants, Banks, or Rehab Projects","review":"I have read both of Peter Conti's books and received personal instruction from him at a seminar in Colorado.You will find no useful additional material in his new book. Their techniques only have a slim possibility of working in locations of the country where real estate prices are rising rapidly. The current economy makes this even more difficult to achieve.I live in a area of the Midwest where I didn't make a dime after a year of following Peter's strategy outlined in the book. Watch out for these guys, their techniques and false promises.The book can easily be summed up as follows: Lease options can trigger the \\"due on sale\\" clause of the mortgage which can lead to serious complications. You own personal finances including your home could be jeopardized.The reaction of Peter's company to critical book reviews in the past has been to E-Mail former students asking them to post positive responses to bury reviews like this further down in the list. They sent out an E-Mail to their students on July 16 ... notice how 'magically' 18 reviews were posted the same day?Buyer beware.

I will right back and let you know how it is going...On another note about all the reviews... It seems to me that all the students did 5 outta 5 stars and anyone who either hasn't read it or been able to buy any property gave the book a 1 star.

The authors of that discussion have subscribed to an outdated - and even then minority - view of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) propagated by a group of psychiatrists and psychologists; in this completely unsubstantiated and unscientific view it is compared to the 19th century concept of \\"neurasthenia\\", a supposedly neurotic condition. None of the thousands of research papers that have found significant physical pathology in CFS are mentioned, nor the fact that the United States Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recognize CFS as a physical disease (additionally, the American Psychiatric Association does not recognize CFS as a psychiatric disease of any kind); the WHO has for decades classified myalgic encephalomyelitis (aka CFS) under its section in neurological diseases. Abundant evidence has been found of dysfunction and damage in the central/ autonomic and peripheral nervous systems of CFS patients.It is astonishing that a Neurology textbook would ignore or be unaware of all of this; such misinformation about a serious and widespread physical illness that many medical professionals will encounter makes this book a liability, and definitely not something worth recommending to colleagues.As stated by Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Anthony Komaroff, \\"There are now over 4,000 published studies that show underlying biological abnormalities in patients with this illness. It's not an illness that people can simply imagine that they have and it's not a psychological illness...that debate..should now be over.\\""},{"Title":"Adams & Victor's Manual of Neurology","review":"The authors here confuse \\"chronic fatigue,\\" which is a symptom of many different diseases, including depression, with a serious physical illness called \\"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\\" (CFS/ME). This is a very serious illness which ruins the lives of millions of men, women and children. In Oct 2009, an article was published in the journal SCIENCE which found a retrovirus, XMRV, in most of their sample of CFS/ME sufferers. Hopefully, the results of this study and other research studies will show the error of this type of confusion among doctors and researchers so that the focus will be on finding a cure for this dangerous illness rather than trivializing the sufferers."},{"Title":"Adams & Victor's Manual of Neurology","review":"Very inaccurate on ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis aka CFS/CFIDS). ME is a common (1M+ in US) and extremely debilitating NeuroEndocrine Immune Disease. They conflate ME (CFS) and idiopathic chronic fatigue and say ME is just a euphamism for depression. Shameful."},{"Title":"Adams & Victor's Manual of Neurology","review":"This book is a useful brief review and compendium of diagnostic neurological information. The paperback version is small enough to carry around or put in a briefcase. The book packs a considerable amount of information into about 400 pages. There are a couple of dozen chapters, organized according to the usual neurological disease categories, and there are a number of nicely done charts and tables that make good, quick references. Keep in mind this book is not intended to be exhaustive and is meant as a quick review or reference. It is intended for practicing physicians, so familiarity with the technical and medical terminology is assumed, and most technical terms are not explained. The book benefits from recent research, and contains up-to-date information on such rapidly changing areas as Alzheimer's. The book has references into Adams and Ropper's larger neurological handbook for those who want more information. Overall a good, concise reference work in neurology."},{"Title":"Wings of Adventure (Paper Airplanes That Really Fly!)","review":"I happened across the first two books in the series at a bookstore and could not resist buying them. Since then, I've bought this book.To date, I have not made any planes in this book yet (though I have made planes from his other related books). I have looked through it extensively and am impatiently waiting for having spare time to work on the planes. There is a nice selection of planes from a WW1 Tiger Moth all the way up to Burt Rutan's Voyager that flew around the world on one tank of gas. I personally look forward to building and flying the Voyager and the GeeBee R-2. The planes are from a variety of countries, as well.In addition to the planes, there are nice historical backgrounds for each aircraft included. I'm an airplane nut, and there are some planes in here that I'd never heard of.I should mention that this is not a typical 'paper airplane' book. You do not simply take a sheet of paper and fold it in various ways then fly it. You have to cut out numerous pieces, form them to get the proper curves, glue them (carefully, so that the paper doesn't warp when it's drying), and THEN fly them. Even though that may sound challenging, the first few airplanes are enough to learn the skills necessary for the later (and more challenging) airplanes. And...THE PLANES FLY GREAT when built with patience and care. Mine have survived some great crashes into walls and radiators since I have a habit of launching them indoors (all the planes have a hook for launching via rubber bands)."},{"Title":"City of Heroes (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"Prima's relationship with game companies often allows them great access to the innards of game development during alpha and beta testing, which usually leads to some useful insights in their guides. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. While the combat section of this guide is fairly well detailed, the meat of the game is in character development where this book fails with poor research and outright errors.The good news is that there's good use to this book if you're wandering around Paragon City, the City of Heroes base. Creature factions are very well described, with useful tidbits on how to fight them. For instance, two melee fighters shouldn't simultaneously attack a Circle of Thorn (COT) mage as the mage will self destruct, likely killing both fighters. It's hard to tell this simply by playing the game. Geography and combat tricks are also well described.Unfortunately, the character development section has some problems. First, its readily apparent that many of Prima's testers gave only a cursory look at several skill sets. As an example, in only a couple hours of gameplay its readily apparently that the most powerful illusion controller attack is Deceive, which takes over the target for 30 seconds. In the guide, its mentioned only in passing. Second and more disturbingly, there are a number of errors in the skill guides. For instance, Siphon Speed under the Defender/Controller Kinetics power set claims to give you the ability to fly. It doesn't, and if you waste how many days to get to level 10 for it you will be very disappointed. Given that this skill never even had that during beta testing it's clear there was very poor editing involved. Finally, some of the technical details are also just outright wrong. Most notably, NCSoft has outright repudiated Prima's claim that you're limited to a certain number of enhance buffs per skill.Games change from alpha to beta to gold, and clearly there have been some changes in City of Heroes that are hard to capture in a published guide. Nevertheless, Prima didn't do its job on this one. Some of the blatant errors in here along with signs of very little play testing of other skills take two stars off of this. Still, for a beginner's background to combat this has a decent amount of value. Check the bulletin boards for character development issues though!"},{"Title":"City of Heroes (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"It's always hard for a publisher to create a guide for an ever-developing MMO like City of Heroes. However once again Prima has decided to make a quick buck by releasing a guide that was outdated a day after the game's launch.The majority of the information is from the beta days of CoH, and there are plenty of typos and misinformation strewn throughout. For newbies, the Zone maps are fine, as are the character generation guides.However none of the information is very &quot;deep&quot;. It provide basic stats for an enemy, which is usually incorrect in some fashion or another. The guide lists arch villians but doesn't give you any idea where or how to find them. It tells you how to start Task Forces or certain Quests but gives you no help on solving them.Most of the text for the mobs and areas is lifted straight from the game itself, with little commentary from the editors. There are no handy cross referenced charts for mobs. There isn't even an index.Character generation strategies are strictly for newbies. According to this guide, pretty much every character ability is fantastic and works great with every character. For those who play healer or ranged archetypes, it's obviously a poor idea to dump slots and skills into close combat abilities - yet this guide makes it sound like a good idea.There's some interesting information on how the Trial Zones work (which haven't even gone live yet and will most likely be changed from what's written here when they do go live). No mention is made of the Tailor stores or anything that happened in the game after the Beta. Fortunately the game world hasn't changed much 2 months after the guide's release.Overall this is yet another 2 star Prima Guide. Poorly edited, inaccurate, and outdated even at the time of the game's release. It's good for newbies, and the zone maps and most mob stats are accurate, but all the information contained can be easily found online, updated and for free."},{"Title":"City of Heroes (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"Poorly constructed guide. On the one hand, it has all the basics you might expect; character development details, zone details, and enemy details. They also include some useful tips and a whole chapter on why copying trademark characters is bad taste (hey its they're book, there allowed the occasional tangent).However it was way too obvious that each power, as well as some of the enemies, was researched by different authors. You may be reading about one power for an archetype that is described well, turn the page to the next power and find it poorly described. In addition they have obvious errors in the book. For example they mention a supergroup vault, which COH designers have told me directly doesn't exist.All in all, this is book was obviously slapped together much like a frat kids research paper. Shameful for a proffesional game guide company."},{"Title":"City of Heroes (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"This book is not entirely unhelpful, but I would not recommend buying it without looking at it first.There is some good information here, such as:- Guides (though incomplete) to the city's various zones- Expanded information about powers, archetypes, and origins- Some scant but helpful information on tactics and gameplayThe problem I have is that there was so much more that could have been included. For example:- Location of the various \\"stores\\"- More advice on character creation and power choice- Information about the villiains that would be, I dunno, maybe helpful? (tactics rather than tables of stats and origin info)I also believe that the readers would have been better served by delaying the guide a month or two so that the many modifications to the game after launch could have been included. Instead, the guide was rushed out and still includes some erroneous information about gameplay and even some incorrect terminology (many aspects of gameplay and the names of some powers changed at launch due to suggestions by beta players).In short, you might get some good information here, but you should try to get a look at the book to make sure it will be useful to you before you shell out the money. Here's hoping that Prima will put out a second edition of this guide."},{"Title":"City of Heroes (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"This was a good reference back when it was published but I doubt much of it applies to today's version of the game.

The ring-bound version is up-to-date through Issue #6 and it is in a totally different printed format than the paperback version. It is also designed differently and probably has much better information in it since it was created well after the game had been out for a long while.

Unless you are completely new to this type of game, there's little benefit to buying these things unless you're really hard up for bathroom reading.

As you play, most all of the info you need simply unfolds before you.While there's always testy people on the internet, this game has fostered a refreshingly friendly and helpful community of players for the most part.

The information on what to expect in different areas, villain types and their weaknesses, where to go to fight what you can handle so you level up faster, how to customize the interface and communicate with other players more easily - this has a lot of good advice, much more than I've mentioned. I haven't gone a day without consulting it, even after two weeks of gameplay.

Read it before you buy an OTC homeopathic remedy for the flu, or before you believe you are getting the best of all possible worlds when you visit an allopath or naturopath who claims expertise in homeopathy.This is advice from a person whose introduction to homeopathy was being harmed by a naturopath (I wish I could publish her name and address) practising the art of extracting dollars from the gullible.

Not to mention the classic of all classics, Scruples. Two great books which deserved all of their mega-successes.Well, dear readers, I guess the saying three's a crowd is true, for Krantz's third novel may have been another smash to many eyes, but not so much to yours truly. Don't get me wrong, all the melodrama is in there : the innocent yet bold heroine, the manipulative and abusive foe, the temperamental but loving hero, steamy steamy love scenes galore... well, you get my drift.Despite those pluses, somehow Krantz failed to capture the essence of her first two novels. The desire, the need to tell a great story behind the glitz and glamour is there yet missing. It's as if a wall has been built up between Krantz's talent and deadline, and her need to stay on automatic pilot was her safest bet.Indeed, in her third outing originality is out the door and replaced by a paint-by-the-numbers plot and tiresome descriptions of sceneries and cathedrals. Yes, Mistral is a painter and Krantz tries her best to be true to him, but the line between reality and fiction can only be saved by editing and, alas, in Mistral's Daughter, editing is in constant need.That said, the novel is still better than many new releases out there. Judith Krantz is best when she lets her imagination run wild, and there are parts in Mistral's that are pure Krantz. The bowl of fruit scene, for instance, where Maggie, dressed in nothing but painted fruits, strutt her stuff (in pre-second World War II) for all the world to see. Krantz can easily make the unbelievable believable. Plus any scenes involving the character of evil Kate is pure delight. The last one in which she discovers she will no longer be needed is so perfectly told I was enthralled by Krantz's talent as a writer. If only these sparks of ingenuity could have been constant, Mistral's Daughter would have been a sure fire hit in my eyes as well.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"Julien Mistral is a painter with great passion for his work. He also has passion for three generations of Lunel women, two of whom are his mistresses and one who is his daughter. With Mistral, nothing can come between him and his work and this obsession, coupled with fateful occurences in the lives of the Lunels is the foundation on which this book is written. Krantz has a way of creating characters which the reader cares about and putting them into situations where their flawed human nature causes many complications in their lives. This book takes the reader behind the scenes of the art and fashion worlds of France and New York, and tells an engrossing and interesting tale. It's a good read!"},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"I like very much the book, but I really like best the mini-series on TV I would like to know where can I buy the video of this movie, and the music of this picture, it was very beautiful I think the name was something like &quot;april in paris&quot; and I believe is french, where can I order it."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"This was the last Judith Krantz book I read, shortly after it came out, and it remains a personal favorite of mine even though my attention then wandered from Krantz' genre of fiction. Of Krantz' first three books, \\"Mistral's Daughter\\" definitely has the best plot, spanning three generations of Lunel women who all find themselves involved, in one way or another, with the same famous painter, Julien Mistral, a Picasso-esque ruthless genius living in France. As the story begins, Maggy Lunel arrives in Paris seeking work as an artist's model, and quickly goes from a shy country girl afraid to undress for a pose to a sexy artist's muse who allows her nude body to be painted as a bowl of fruit and paraded around at a wild party. She becomes Mistral's lover and inspires him to artistic brilliance, only to be shunted aside by the devious rich businesswoman Kate who wants control of both Mistral's body and his career. Fortunately, a rich American falls head over heels for the jilted Maggy and whisks her off to New York, where she becomes the powerful head of a famous modeling agency.Maggy's daughter Teddy in turn becomes a celebrated photographic model and runs into Mistral during a post-WWII fashion shoot. The two fall madly in love at first sight and Teddy gives birth to the \\"Mistral's daughter\\" of the title, Fauve, before tragically dying in a freak accident. The final part of the book deals with Fauve coming of age and showing signs of inheriting her father's artistic talent, but evil Kate threatens to throw a monkey wrench in the works by revealing information to Fauve about Mistral's activities during the war, thus tarnishing his image in Fauve's eyes. Of course, this being a Krantz romance, there will be a happy ending and you can see this one coming a mile away, but all's well that ends well.There's a bit of sex in this book but nowhere near the amount that populated \\"Scruples\\" and \\"Princess Daisy\\". On the one hand, it's good that Krantz ceased her practice of including too many minor characters for the purpose of exploring their bedrooms, and paid more attention to moving the plot along. On the other hand, the final portion of the book with teenage Fauve is pretty devoid of sex and seems like Krantz was trying to suddenly write a \\"serious\\" novel, with the result being that most of it is simply not that interesting except when vengeful Kate is on the scene. I also have to echo the sentiments of some of the other reviewers - Mistral must have been a heck of an artist, because he is really a jerk and it's hard to see why all these women would be so enthralled by him. It's also hard to see how a powerful character like Maggy would let her beloved and slightly dippy daughter get so involved with a man who not only was once Maggy's own lover, but whom Maggy knows is not a very nice fellow. If you don't get too caught up in asking these questions, and just take the story for granted, it's fun to read and chock-full of all kinds of interesting period detail about the fashion industry just after WWII and the French art scene the 20s and 30s. Because it's enjoyable despite a few flaws, I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"Judith Krantz is a Francophile. Many parts of this book read like an extended love letter to the country, the language and the lifestyle. Fortunately, Krantz has also populated her book with interesting, dynamic characters whose lives allow Krantz to depict at length Paris and the Provenal countryside. Beginning in Paris in the 1920's and continuing until 1975 with stops in 1950s New York, World War II era F&eacute;lice, and Rome in 1975, Krantz' generational saga is lush with descriptiveness, quirky secondary characters, almost sympathetic villains, and more information about art and modeling (both for painters and for fashion magazines) than anyone would care to know. The story is so beguiling, however, that one barely notices it goes on for more than 500 pages. There's nothing that could be cut to make a more concise novel without losing some of its charm. Though at the time this book was written, 1975 was almost the present day, because of the overt reference to the year instead of setting the book in the ambiguous \\"present\\", the story does not feel outdated."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"I love how it spaned time and generations, somethig that all could relate to.It is true that at points it was far fetched, but isn't that why we read? To have something that we have not yet experienced in the physical...."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"This is another book that I had read years ago. I liked it then, but didn't remember much about it. I still like it after reading it a second time."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"If you are looking for a great beach read or for something when you have a cold or are recovering from surgery, this is the perfect book for you! It's standard Judith Krantz with female characters running away from boring lives in order to have great adventures, breaking hearts with their staggering beauty, as they go. It's the story of three generations of women and the man who will impact all their lives. Great, great fun!"},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"This book is fairly predictable, but it's an enjoyable read. I've read it a couple times. I think I appreciate the glimpse into the world of high fashion, as well as Europe in a long glimpse of the 1900's."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"I'd never read Judith Krantz before I picked up \\"Mistral's Daughter.\\" It's not the kind of fiction I usually read. Unlike Krantz, I don't like to read about \\"beautiful, rich, sexy people.\\" I'm not interested in the glamorous lives of the preternaturally privileged. Long descriptions of what people look like (and, dear lord, what they're WEARING, brand names and all) bore me to tears. Flawlessly beautiful and infinitely alluring characters simply make me want to roll my eyes.\\"Mistral's Daughter\\" is guilty of a multitude of trashy-fiction sins. Most of the characters are shallow or inconsistent or both. If I'd had to read even one more description of how perfectly, entrancingly, enviably beautiful one of the Lunel women was, I believe I would have jerked my short, brown hair right out of my plump and spherical head. Krantz takes us into the minds and hearts of her characters at crucial moments of their lives, yet few of them ever move beyond one-dimensional caricatures. We have the Canny Innocent, the Worldly Friend, the Unpinnable Flirt, the Aloof Genius, the Conniving Bitch, the Selfish Snob, the Wonderful Guy. Krantz's attempts at giving her characters some depth often result merely in their coming across as inconsistent. There are moments of purple prose that will surely make more sensitive readers cringe, and two characters actually fall in love at first sight, at which point I had to restrain myself from heaving the book across the room. For the most part, this is a superficially deep book about some profoundly shallow people.But oh, what a book it is! What a vast, sprawling, generous, delectable saga! This is the story of three generations of women whose lives are inseparably bound up with that of tempestuous artistic genius Julien Mistral. Maggy Lunel comes to Paris as a teenage innocent, and her passionate affair with Mistral inspires him to produce some of his finest work, only to end when Mistral betrays her. Twenty-five years later, Mistral finds the love of his life in Maggy's daughter, Teddy. Mistral already has a daughter, Nadine, from his passionless marriage to the controlling Kate, but it is Fauve, the daughter Teddy bears him, who will grow up to discover a genuinely shameful secret about him and challenge him as no one ever has before. This is a book to get lost in, to give yourself over to and be swept away into another world. From the bohemian life in 1920s Paris to the energetic New York fashion world in the postwar years, Krantz has a firm grasp of the worlds in which her characters move, and brings them so vividly to life you'll feel as if you were there. Krantz's musings on the creative process will have artistic types nodding their heads in recognition, while the aforementioned passages of purple prose are tolerably interspersed among pages of solid, occasionally delightful, writing.As silly as it sounds, I picked up this novel because I was thoroughly enchanted with the name of one of the characters, \\"Fauve,\\" which is French for \\"wild beast\\" and yet possesses a certain feminine grace. Fauve is as fascinating a character as Mistral himself; she is intelligent, inquisitive, witty, artistic, versatile. The titular \\"Mistral's daughter,\\" Fauve is the central character of the first chapter, which is set out of chronological sequence and takes place near the end of the events of the story - then isn't seen again until about halfway through this 500-page novel. Ultimately, though, this is the story of Fauve and of Mistral. This is not to say that there's a single wasted incident; everything that happens is relevant. The conclusion delivers just the right amount of redemption, and there isn't a single major character in the novel who doesn't end up with just the precise amount and variety of happiness that he or she deserves.Nearly thirty years ago a reviewer described this novel as \\"quality trash,\\" and I can't argue with that. But sometimes quality trash is just what you need. \\"Mistral's Daughter\\" is the literary equivalent of going on vacation."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"I found it kind of creepy that all the women in this book have almost a compulsive urge to sleep with this man.To top it all of he's kind of a jerk all the way around.If this didn't have Krantz's name on it I'd assume it was written by a very juvenile male."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"Judith Krantz has written ten books, and out of those I've read six. This is one of those six, and while I enjoyed reading it, I still wish it was better.This is the story of a successful painter, Julien Mistral, and his relationships with three women in the span of about 50 years. Maggy Lunel is one of his first nude models, and they share a brief fling. Teddy Lunel is Maggy's daughter from another man, who becomes a big model, falls in love with Mistral and gives birth to his child. Fauve, Teddy and Julien Mistral's daughter, is an aspiring painter like her father, but eventually learns an upsetting fact about her father that forever changes their relationship. This novel, never like any Judith Krantz before or after it, rambles on forever about nothing in particular, and it is very hard to feel you know most of the characters, let alone really care what happens to them. Read it because it's Judith Krantz, but it is by no means her best work."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"I never received this book. I've read it before, and wanted to have it again, as it's a superb piece of work."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"I really enjoyed this book and in a way, I wish Krantz would do an update of what Fauve is up to today because she was such an vivid character. Loved the span of generations."},{"Title":"Mistral's Daughter","review":"This one is really melodramatic, and rather curiously familiar. (For instance the rich, cool American becoming the patron of an unknown artist part of the plot of An American in Paris.) Ms. Krantz is really better when she sticks to the relatively unsentimental 1970s to 1980s. The action in this one spans nearly 70 or 80 years, from the turn of the century to the late '70s/early '80s. The main problem is the central figure - in this case, a Picasso-esque artist called Julien Mistral (the Mistral of the title, which is not the infamous mistral wind of Provence, though I guess his character is supposed to be like that wind or something). Not only did I find this character unappealing, but I found his abrupt transformation near the end totally unbelievable.The heroines - Maggy (model and lover of Mistral), Teddy her daughter (another lover of Mistral years later...thankfully he is not her father), and finally Fauve, his daugther with Teddy. They fare a little bit better than the guy in the middle, but not much. Parts of the story are so melodramatic and hokey they will make you laugh out loud, though I don't think that was the author's intention. Still, it is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"The Yankee Encyclopedia (Limited Edition)","review":"The updates get better and better every year. And why not so does the team. Have a question about the Bronx Bombers? Well if it can be answered here it can't be answered anywhere. Highly recommended by BehindtheBombers.com The Official Website of the Yankees Fan."},{"Title":"Beowulf: With Grimmest Gripe","review":"I'm already a fan of the Beowulf legend, but for the unitiated, these comics are a great way to be introduced to the Indo-European epic tradition, and to the Beowulf legend in particular. There are no word balloons here, and few onomatopoeic words like &quot;crack&quot; and &quot;boom&quot; (though there are a few well-place exceptions). The comicbook uses text directly from the poem, using the Gummere translation, which is freely available on the Internet, but while the Gummere trans. serves its purpose, I would recommend that any curious reader try Seamus Heaney's new version). The art is beautiful and the comics themselves well-made; and the story stays quite faithful to the poem. In summation, I would say that this comicbook would make a great addition to any Beowulf collection."},{"Title":"Beowulf: With Grimmest Gripe","review":"Beowulf has served as the inspiration for many comic books and graphic novels, including the 1970s DC series (with Beowulf as a pagan warrior filled with rage) and the 1980s graphic novel by Jerry Bingham. This version, by Gareth Hinds, is a good example of how the Beowulf poem can be effectively translated into a visual medium. It is one of a three-part series, and each of the series of beautifully rendered. Hinds uses the Francis Gummere translation, in part because it is poetic and in part--I suspect--because it is part of public domain. But his use of Gummere's translation is not merely supplemented by the visuals because his illustrations are as important to the translation as anything else. The visuals are absolutely important to his version of Beowulf.Especially impressive is how Hinds lets his illustrations convey both the action and some of the underlying themes in Beowulf. For instance, the battle with Grendel is &quot;told&quot; by the illustration, without Gummere's translation. One of the most prevalent themes, wyrd (fate) of the Old English poem, is subtly presented throughout this comic book series by the use of constellations in the backgrounds. It is this kind of attention to detail--using both the poem and the artistic medium--that really makes Hinds' work stand out.This series is recommended to anyone interested in contemporary versions of Beowulf in popular culture (I would even go so far to call this a translation in a certain sense) or for those who enjoy graphic novels."},{"Title":"The Rifle in America","review":"The best early history of the American rifle ever written?That says it all!

This requires community non-profits to make themselves, their objectives, and accomplishments (including closely-related prior paid and volunteer experience) known to the public.Art Feinglass is the founder and president of Access Corporation. He has over 20 years of non-profit field experience, including with public relations. Feinglass made sure that his book was transferable to real world non-profit situations and it wasn't indulgence in abstract ideas.First, an objectives list needs to be produced: Who do we want to reach, and what message are we trying to communicate with them? Even though non-profits do have limited resources, the one-size-fits all advertising approach is going to be dangerously ineffective, wasting much more money in the process.Then you have to decide who in the organization will deliver the message and what media in the community will deliver the message too. If I am planning a left-wing event, it's probably not wise to deliver announcements to socially conservative media---unless I want to face pickets.Effective activists will also have to spend time on these materials. Whether planning an event or pr materials, nothing should be left to chance. This influences how people think of the organization. How the organization is thought of by the community in turn affects its ultimate ability to create change.Finally, evaluating the success of your current PR plan is essential. Don't assume that responsibilities end when the materials go out. Constantly keeping people informed and aware of what your organization is doing in the community translates into them continuing to regard it as a worthy cause. Larger organizations may also require formalized reports to be delivered to their board of directors for further analysis and approval during this time."},{"Title":"The Public Relations Handbook for Nonprofits: A Comprehensive and Practical Guide","review":"If you really know nothing about public relations, this book is fine.

Richard Wurmbrand and His Wife Sabina","review":"\\"Richard and Sabina\\" was a very interesting and at times truely chilling account of persecution and Christian Faith. One thing that makes the lives of both Wurmbrands so fascinating is the sheer amount of hardship they witnessed or experienced. The fact they found the strenght to forgive their fascist, racist (sometimes other Christians for that matter), and especially their atheistic Communist tormentors is inspiring. The fact that both of them admitted their human flaws makes them easier to relate to. The background for their struggle was the tragedy of an entire nation (Rumania).

This is one of the best books I've read!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"This wasn't the best book in the cycle. It disapointed me as a conclusion. I sort of think of the end of Arthur as a conclusion, because after that book, the series does not seem to be in chronological order. Arthur disappears at the end of the third book, and he's back in the forth and fifth. The plot is a bit flat and not as captivating, but the poetic language never fails you, and Lawhead seems to get a bit mroe religious in this book.I have read too many accounts of Arthurian fiction, and I very much liked the Pendragon cycle. Lawhead writes like a poet. His writing can get pretentious at times, and a bit thick and hard to read, but it is well worth it. It definitly enriched my mind and made me want to write epic poetry. It's not the kind of book that you can't put down, the narrative doesn't flow like a best-selling novel, but if you like the subject matter, it is not hard to get though.Many people critisize this series of books because it deviates from legend. This bothers me. The reason it is \\"legend\\" and not fact is because it is largely unknown. I love how lawhead makes everything seem authentically celtic, (\\"Bedwyr\\" instead of \\"Bedivere\\" and so on)and he puts his own version of the legend, which every author has the right to do. If you're anything like me, your sick of hearing about Lancelot and Guenivere and you want a new and refreshing version of the saga. Lawhead has done his research and knows what he is writing.Strongly recommended, only if you have read the first four."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I've read through all the books of the Pendragon Cycle and, until the beginning of &quot;Grail&quot;, I thought it almost had no flaws. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed by the fifth and last book, especially by all the contradictions with the &quot;real&quot; end, i.e. the Black Book of Gildas in Arthur.Honestly, I don't really understand why Stephen Lawhead decided to write this book. Pendragon was a necessary addition, in my opinion, because much elements were left out before the ending of the Arthur book. For example, the Vandali invasion was just brilliant. Of course, the Grail itself had to appear somewhere in the series, but I personally think that Arthur being healed after the battle with Amilcar was enough. I found the plot around the temple and the guardians of the Grail to make no sense at all. That brings me to another major flaw.Why is Morgian suddenly so powerful? She was already defeated by Merlin in the Lyonesse years before! All that stuff about Morgian preparing her revenge and raising Morgaws is just plain ridiculous. And what about all those magical creatures? When I first read Taliesin (about 5 years ago), I was disappointed by the lack of all those classical surnatural elements from fantastic novels. But after reading a little more, I realized that the series didn't need all this stuff since everything else was so perfect. While reading the Grail, I almost laughed when the big black beast rushed into the knights. When Gwalchavad fought the undeads, I just couldn't stand it. This series isn't about big monsters and ultra-powerful sorcerers! It's about the birth of Britain and the great battles and heroes that lead to its glory. There's already the Lord of the Rings for all the &quot;magical&quot; content.At the end of Grail, Llenlleawg is banished from the Cymbrogi, being a traitor. Then, why was he defeated in the battle with Medrault in the Black book?! This just makes no sense. Unfortunately, this is only one of the many contradictions that brings this book.To me, the Pendragon Cycle is really a trilogy, that is Taliesin, Merlin and Arthur. I would have integrated Pendragon in the Arthur book. To me, Grail is no part of the series. I gave it 2 stars only because of it allowed me to learn more about Gwalchavad. I will do my best to forget it because I want to remember the Pendragon Cycle as a magnificient series that gave me incredible reading sessions. If it is also your wish, here's my advice : do not read Grail."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Completed the Pendragon Cycle, was definitely a good read, really enjoyed the whole quintet. this is the third set of his,I am a fan."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I've enjoyed several of his books. Exciting, full of rich detail, well developed characters. Anyone who enjoys fantasy will find this a 'must read'."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Even though it has been slightly difficult to read this divergent version of the Arthurian legend, the Pendragon series has been an exciting, as well as, uplifting read.Grail is no exception to the premise set up by Lawhead: truth and justice is upheld, while evil is overcome; even though \\"Evil\\" is like the proverbial Hydra, sprouting two heads each time one was defeated.For those who enjoy a good story w/no bad language or gratuitous, explicit sex Grail is a very good book. I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Seven years of war with the Saecens are followed by an Vandali invasion while the country reels from drought and plague. Arthur's tired host defeats the Vandali but Arthur is seriously injured. The wounds are great and he is taken to Ynys Avallach to be tended by Charis, a queen of the fair folk, and a miracle occurs. Arthur survives when he drinks from the the Grail and the Pendragon is healed. Realizing that the Grail is a holy relic that could bring peace and health to Britain, Arthur designs and builds a great shrine to house it. And, as Arthur has predicted friends and enemy alike come to view and be healed by the Grail.Meanwhile, Morgian schemes to lure Arthur's champion, Llenlleawg, to become her spy and help bring about the fall of the Pendragon, his queen, Gwenhwyvar, and Myrddin, his bard and counselor. Her goal is to destroy all of Britain and kill the three. Her minions steal the Grail, murdering both guardians and pilgrims in the process. Falling into deep depression, Myrddin at last is able to bring Athur to his senses to pursue Morgians's followers in the hope of recovering the Grail.The final battle occurs in a place of Morgian's choosing, Llyonesse, where her powers are strongest. Arthur and his host have no recourse but to take up the challenge. Thus begins the major action of the tale as Arthur and his men travel through Llyonesse where Morgian uses her evil magic to raise dead warriors, create deadly beasts and make horrible illusions to defeat the host.For me, the first part of the book seemed to be drawn out and lack substance but when the Grail is stolen, the author seems to hit his stride and the story blossoms. From that point, I could not put the book aside until I finished. The narrator is Gwalchavad, Lord of Orcady, with parts prefaced by the words and thoughts of Morgian, the Queen of Air and Darkness. It's a good, good read"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"This book is faster paced then the others. It has also more action. It also has magic in it the other books lacked it. Lawhead's style has always been heavy on sword and light on sorcery. Which is quite refreshing. Also his heros always use sword (Merlin was a prophet and miracle-worker) and his villians sorcery. This book has his characters battling the undead (which alot of his books has). Only that it is three men against a legion of undead."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"The most exciting of the Pendragon cycle!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I have to say that one of the highlights of my year is the release of a new Stephen Lawhead book, and Grail was no exception. I was delighted to revisit my friends of early Britain. The story focuses primarily on the quest for the holy grail, which is stolen by Morgwas and Llenlewag (who just happens to be one of Arthur's faithful companions!) The story is told from Gwalchavad's point of view. As always, the writing is absolutely beautiful and descriptive. I really liked the the whole Llenlewag part of the book, because it shows how anyone can fall under a bad influence, and it is necessary for us not to judge that person, but look at all the circumstances."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"SRL always delivers a great read, but this book didn't reach the same level of excellence as the first three in this series. I'd have to compare this to the fourth book, Pendragon. Both are good stories, but seem to be dragging the story of Arthur out. In the third book he concludes the story. The fourth and fifth then go back and tell us more about the life of Arthur. If you've read the first three books you should read this one also, but I would not recommend starting here. Like always SRL does an excellent job of taking the legend (in this case the Holy Grail) and presenting it in a more realistic light then many other fantasy novelists who make up extremely unrealistic fantasies. Once I finally got involved in the series I enjoyed it. For a really good read I'd recommend Byzantium or the Song of Albion trilogy."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"There were PARTS of Grail that, while reading it, seemed very good. But on the whole, I think Lawhead was much less inspired by the myths that make up the Grail legend. Although I've not heard all of the myths, I have heard enough to realize taht he tried to gather as many as he could and work them all together in one final book. As a result, the characters suffer. More importantly, there's a lot of downtime because in order to work all the tales together, he needs so much more set-up. Literally half the book (250 pages) was set-up. This makes for a very long read. When the action happens, it goes quickly and with no real arch to the storyline. There's no grand finale, and each of the events, separate myths, that lead up to the ending seem disjointed.That said, I'm a big Lawhead fan, so I would have settled for nothing less than reading the whole book. In fact, I've just re-read all the Pendragon cycle in true chronological order. But in all, there's no real reason, other than being a huge fan of the previous stories, to read &quot;Grail.&quot;"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"This is a great story, wonderfully told. I especially enjoyed the section that exemplified the power of God over evil: speaking the word of God rather than relying on mere human strength or devices. It reminds me of the Bible scripture, &quot; Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord.&quot; It was very inspirational!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Stephen Lawhead is one of my favortie writers. His first three books in the Pendragon series left me with tears of joy and craving more. In Grail, his fifth book in the cycle, Lawhead again dips into the Arthurian world and explores the holy grail, the cornerstone of Arthur's &quot;Realm of Summer.&quot; The first third of the book catches you up to speed with the characters, the middle third explores the current conflict, and then the last third is all action. Yet the action and set-up feel extremely forced and contrived, leaving me thinking that this had to be some sort of contractual obligation with Avon. When the book finally starts moving, it unfortunately relies on cliches--the evil witch who kidnaps the queen and leads the rescue party into a huge, dark woodland where the characters get seperated and lost. Although the ending is unique to Lawhead, the first three-quarters of the book are listless, cliched, and previously explored in earlier books. Lawhead is one of my all-time favorite writers, and I'm very sorry to not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"The first 3 books in the Pendragon cycle are among my favorite books (I got the trilogy over 10 years ago and have read them countless times), and the 4th book &quot;Pendragon&quot; was OK...(although not particularly interesting). But &quot;Grail&quot; is absolutely horrible. This book is actually an alternate ending to &quot;Arthur&quot; (book 3). It ignores the last half of that book (and the PERFECT ending) and completely changes everything for the worse. &quot;Grail&quot; is uninteresting and boring, and for it to be called the 5th book in the Pendragon cycle is utterly ridiculous! Avoid this book at all costs!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I didnt finish the book yet, but some parts are very interesting. While i was first one hundread pages it was pretty excting, but I got bored after about a hundread pages after. Somepart are fun even after hundread pages but it wasn't that fun. It's OK book."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Taliesin / Merlin / Arthur. Excellent trilogy, with Atlantis thrown in as a bonus. Pendragon and Grail were written to expand the trilogy, but cover much of the same ground -- overlapping overkill -- with too much religion for my taste, very irritating in fact: much more 'Good News' than I can stomach. The author would have done better to go back and revise the original trilogy, which was self-contained, and shoehorned in the grail elements that are the theme of the sequels.But the political nastiness of kinglets, lords, and bishops is well handled, and the wicked ladies are fun. And Grail has some nice spooky witchcraft in a grim forest in Lyonesse -- in fact one of the eeriest scenes in Arthurian fiction."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Grail is the conclusion of the Pendragon Cycle (although its not the end of Lawhead's Arthurian tales). Grail casts a unique spin on the abduction Arthur's queen as well as the search for the Grail. At the end of Pendragon, Arthur had defeated the invaders of his kingdom but only after suffering a terrible wound. He is healed by the power of the Grail and now beginning in the appropriately named Grail, he wants to set up sacred house for the Grail. Yet his enemy Morgian is ever at work and as the project is completed the Grail is stolen as is Arthur's Queen. This is a dark tale but at the same time its totally unique to the Arthurian mythos. Lawhead could have ended his Arthur stories here and no one would have been upset."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"This books is Ok, but falls far below the original Pendragon Cycle books.For starters, the narration is completely different, written in the first-person. Sure, the characters and settings are the same, but the narration style makes it feel like it is disjointed from the rest of the series.I loved the first three books of the Pendragon Cycle, and being a purist, that is what I will consider to be the canon. These three books had me riveted.Pendragon, the fourth in the series, was a necessity, as it filled in a huge gap of the third book.Grail, well... I kept picking it up and reading, hoping that one day, I'll eventually finish it.Up till now, Lawhead has made every effort to present the Arther legends in historical settings. Disregarding the romantic versions, or popular culture, he built a realistic world, where one can easily imagine Arther walking the lands. With that realism came the needed disregard of the Grail quests.Until now. The book feels like it was \\"just written\\", rather than being an outgrowth of previous material. My impression is that the author was pressed to somehow or another fit the grail into his Arther retelling, and this is the half-hearted result.While the book is good as a standalone book, make sure you read it with that in mind: it's just a standalone book, which borrows elements from the series."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Stephan Lawhead all but ignores the Grail legend in his first three books of the Pendragon Cycle, and limits its pressence in Pendragon. It would seem that he set it aside for this faithful telling from the perspective of one of Arthur's Guardians of the Grail.Consistent with the other books, Lawhead finds new voices to tell this tale using Gwalchavad as the principle storyteller and Morgian as an occasional foil to him. Many fans of the first three books will not care for this one. It is steeped in religious context that the other books only aluded to. This is actually part of Lawhead's gift. If the reader takes the time to understand the perspective of the storyteller, he will understand Lawhead's need to cloak it in religious mysticism.This book is an excellent re-telling of Grail legend, and a wonderful use of the characters that Lawhead has given life to in his Pendragon cycle. It seems a shame that this saga should ever come to an end."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Lawhead's Done It Again!It is truly the mark of a good author when a relatively long book series retains all of it's brilliance and originality to the very end. Lawhead has accomplished this and more with his wondrous Pendragon Cycle.Grail is the 5th and final installment in the series (unless you include Avalon in the list). While I think that this is the weakest book of the series, it is still superb and certainly worth the read. The atmosphere of the book is very unique. Unlike the previous books in the series, the enemy is largely supernatural - a much more frightening enemy than the Picti, Angli, or Vandali. Morgian is definetely at her worst - and she even gets a few opportunities to narrate the story (a very peculiar twist.)!Really my only complaint about the book regards Lawhead's choice of characters. It seems that many of the major characters that were seen in Arthur and Pendragon have faded to the backdrop - replaced by relatively new characters. These characters are fine, but I would have rather seen more of characters like Bedwyr, Cai and Arthur."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"This is one of my favorite Pendragon books, perhaps because it was so different.First of all, it was all in the viewpoint of Gwalchavad, with little inserts from Morgian in between, believe it or not. I loved that. Lawhead did pure, humble Gwalchavad wonderfully; immediately the reader likes him. Hearing from Morgian was very revealing, both to her character and to her plot. It enabled some of her schemes to be discovered by the reader, but never by the Cymbrogi. I actually began to understand her and her motives. (The statement about Avallach's favoritism had me almost sympathetic. Quite moving.)Also, the atmosphere was very dreamlike to the point of being surreal. When the whole episode is finished, reality and sunshine break through once more. Morgian's vail of fear is tangible.Thirdly, the adventure is impeccable. It is suspenseful, scary, and satisfying. Llenlleawg's betrayal added a whole new aspect to the fear of Morgian. Nothing is safe from her. He was one of my favorites in past books, which made it worse. The power of evil is revealed through him.Fourthly, Merlin is back to his old self. He was beginning to get rather prudish in former books. I love the part where he slams his stick on the ground and yells at Arthur.One more thing I liked, and this might be just me. Arthur had his troops go to confession and Mass beforehand. That reminded me of Joan of Arc. Spiritual health added credibility to their almost miraculous escape.I suppose I can see why some readers would not like this book as much, but it has definate unique appeal. A nice change!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"&quot;Grail&quot; is the last volume of Lawhead's Pendragon series. It is narrated by Gwalchavad, and revolves around the mysterious and magical Grail which was the cause of Arthur's miraculous healing at the end of the previous volume. The Grail is the cup used by Christ in his last supper (p.45), and has healing powers. Arthur's kingdom is firmly established now that the Saecsons and Vandals have both been defeated. Now that the Kingdom of Summer is officially inaugurated, the Grail is seen as a symbol of this kingdom of light. So Arthur builds a shrine for this symbol of his kingdom, and the kingdom of summer is officially declared.Just when the kingdom of summer reaches its high point, tragedy strikes. At the height of the kingdom's glory, the subversive attacks of Morgian return. This Queen of the Powers of the Air and Darkness steals the sacred Grail, abducts Arthur's queen, and deceives his champion soldier. From this point on the action intensifies, as the newly established kingdom of peace fights warfare on a new front: spiritual warfare. Unlike the battle scenes of previous volumes, the battle scenes in this book describe a struggle against demons and the powers of darkness (Eph. 6).Lawhead's vision of the Grail did make me uncomfortable. Firstly, the cup used by Jesus was an ordinary object, and to have it turn into a sparkling grail with rows of rubies, emeralds, and pearls, with a &quot;broad band of impossibly ornate scrollwork&quot; seems to go against the very purpose of the last supper. Secondly, the purpose of the supper was to encourage believers in their spiritual worship and commemoration of Christ, not in a material worship of a sacred object. The words of Jesus - &quot;Remember and believe&quot; - seem all but forgotten, since healing through the Grail appears to occur independent of faith and believing. Rather than stress faith, the use of the Grail results in a magical form of healing that occurs through ritual rather than faith. One other concern is the ease at which the characters take God's name on their lips - at times it borders on blasphemy and unnecessary oath-making.But these weaknesses aside, Lawhead has created a convincing and exciting spiritual conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil. The spiritual warfare is a refreshing change from the blood and gore of earlier battlefields. It also functions as a compelling image of the universal conflict between God and Satan, a conflict involving both God and men. The power of evil is vividly portrayed. Here Lawhead successfully reminds us of the Biblical notion of angels of darkness disguising themselves as angels of light, and deceiving even believers. The weakness and vulnerability of men over against these powers is vividly described. But most importantly, when men are helpless over against the powers of evil, Lawhead presents the only path to victory: God. Conquest of evil cannot be accomplished by human effort, but by divine power. &quot;Only by God's good grace do any of us stand or fall.&quot; (p.377)&quot;Grail&quot; marks the end of the wonderful Pendragon cycle. It is true that while the ending of &quot;Grail&quot; resolves the conflict, it does not satisfactorily mark a clean ending to the series. This is not surprising because &quot;Grail&quot; (like the preceding volume &quot;Pendragon&quot;) actually precedes the events described at the end of book 3, &quot;Arthur&quot;, and consequently both &quot;Pendragon&quot; and &quot;Grail&quot; have a distinctively &quot;add on&quot; feeling. Next time I will read the series in chronological order, more or less as follows: Taliesin, Merlin, Pendragon Bk. 1, Arthur Bk. 1-2, Pendragon Bk. 2-4, Grail, Arthur Bk. 3. The chronological aberrations of the last two volumes are indeed a weakness, and it is unfortunate they function more like an afterthought, rather than being properly integrated into Arthur's life. Yet the very fact that this series is so re-readable is a testimony to its greatness. Great it truly is, and that is high praise indeed!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Classic Lawhead, this book explores a more personal conflict that many will relate to: that of truth, trust, and betrayal. Grail demonstrates Lawhead's personal spiritual position, which brings some to fear and disgust. Yet do not attempt to read beyond the &quot;Christian&quot; theme, for that is exactly what the author wishes us NOT to do. Gwalchalvad is you and me. He battles ultimately with the question of to whom he should submit. His passions and lust? His friends? His Pendragon? His God?The adventure is fast paced, do not doubt that. The new perspective of a new narrator is refreshing. Lawhead will break your heart, make you jump for joy, make you hate the villain, and love the victor. That's what fantasy should be about. We all can find ourselves in one of the characters of this book. The question we must ask is, which one am I?"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"Picking up exactly where \\"Pendragon\\" left off, \\"Grail\\" puts a new and interesting spin on the legend of the holy grail. Lawhead has done a masterful job in recreating the Arthurian legends, infusing them with his poetic writing and creating legends that are uniquely his own, while holding firm to the ones that have come before. Many readers might argue at the 'changes' Lawhead has made to the legends, but a legend by literary definition is a tale that is interpreted just a little differently by the teller each time it is passed along. Stephen Lawhead's version of events is just as sincere and justified as any of his worthy predecessors.At the conclusion of \\"Pendragon\\", King Arthur was gravely wounded at the end of his (book-long) battle with the Vandali warhost. He is taken to the Ynys Avallach where he is mysteriously healed by the grail. Meanwhile, his warhost are awaiting word of Arthur's death, travelling a land blighted by plague and drought, to deliver grim news to the kinsmen of those who betrayed Arthur. When Arthur returns, miraculously healed, he is adamant that the grail will inaugurate his 'kingdom of summer' and restore Britain to health. Stubborn to the core, and deaf to his advisors, Arthur has a shrine built to house the grail that others may bask in its glory and be healed. But evil lurks within the land, as the dreaded Morgian has nurtured her power and schemes to defeat Arthur once and for all.Told by Gwalchavad (Galahad), \\"Grail\\" is an epic novel, and a respite from the battle-drenched \\"Pendragon\\". While battles between good and evil persist, the narration is given over to the deception and treachery that tricks Llenlleawg (Lancelot) and makes him a pawn of Morgian, an interesting twist on the Lancelot-Guinivere-Arthur triangle. Lawhead's Arthurian tales are grounded in Celtic lore and centered around a spreading Christianity in the early birth of Britain. The Pendragon Cycle is a fresh spin on an oft-repeated legend that will stand its place in the world of Arthurian lore."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I am SO totally obsessed with Arthurian legend, and Lawhead is already one of my fav authors because of Hood and Scarlet and Tuck. When I heard Lawhead had written an book based on Authurian legend, I begged my parents to buy me the series. I was not disappointed (and my parents were happy I liked the book and didn't waste their money). I am addicted to books and know good books when i see them. Grail is definitely an awesome book and the best of the series (second best would be Merlin which I also recommend)!*SPOILER*When Morgaws tries to get Gwalchad give her the Grail using seduction, he remembers what the Grail lady/angel said: &#34;Lusting after honor, he was bewitched by one who honors only lust and lies. Thus are the mighty undone.&#34; So true!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"The rating applies to the entire series of the &quot;Pendragon Cycle.&quot;First - The entire series of Lawhead's &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; was outstanding. The first two books (&quot;Taliesin&quot; and &quot;Merlin&quot;) in the series were by far the best and I would say that they both deserve a rating of 4 1/2 stars. The third book, &quot;Arthur&quot; was a bit of a dissapointment and I would give it 2 1/2 stars for a rating. I would give Pendragon 4 stars.The last book, &quot;Grail&quot; was in my opinion worth 3 1/2 stars.The biggest problem that I have with the last three books in the &quot;cycle&quot; is the telling of the stories in the first person by various hero's and characters within the stories. This worked quite well with the first two books - but I really feel like Lawhead cut himself short in the telling of Arthur's legacy by writing it in the first person. A lot of the story's elements got left out and what could have been an awesome tale (on par with &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot;) was lost in the telling of the story this way.In &quot;Grail,&quot; Gwalchavad (Sir Galahad) tells the story (save for a few chapters that open with Morgain's side of the story - never more than a few paragraphs) of how the &quot;holy grail&quot; is stolen and Arthur is betrayed by one of his own, Llenlleawg (Lancelot). Because the story is told solely from Gwalchavad's point of view - the reader is never shown any internal struggle or the mental process of what Llenlleawg was going through when he betrayed Arthur. I felt that this should have been an essential part of the story given the fact that our betrayer was a hero in &quot;Arthur&quot; and &quot;Pendragon.&quot; A third person telling of the story could have easily captured that and not left the reader scratching his or her head. That is one example of how the story falls short due to the first person telling of it. Other problems with this lie when Gwalchavad gets seperated from Arthur. There is a big gap as to what happens to Arthur and co. during the seperation - as the story only follows Gwalchavad in the seperation.Although I did love the stories and highly recommend them - I am sorely dissapointed that the &quot;fullness of the tale&quot; got lost because we only hear from the perspective of the character telling it.Technically the writing is very good - and the research that must of gone into writing these books is definately evident and will give the reader a great appreciation of the author's effort.I wish Lawhead would not have made the grail an object of worship - but that is the &quot;Christian&quot; in me coming out. Sorry to say it doesn't work that way - I thought Lawhead knew that. Oh well - still a good story with a shade of truth to it non-the-less."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I enjoyed reading Grail as part of the Pendragon cycle. This was my second or third time to read it and I enjoy it more and more each time I re-read it. That is the sign of a good book I think. However, unlike all the other Pendragon books, Grail never aroused great emotions in me as I read it. It was hard for me to enter in to the fear and grief of the characters precisely because I knew the ending of the whole saga since I read it at the end of the book Arthur. I wish Lawhead had published Pendragon and Grail at the same time as Arthur so the story would read better. I did pick up a couple of subtle forshadowings to the book Avalon and that made Grail more enjoyable. I also thought the best new character in the book, was Morgian. We hear her voice for the first time and that helps illumine some of the earlier happenings in the Pendragon Cycle. She is an evil lady. In regards to the many people who felt bored while reading Grail, that did not happen to me. Even though this is not one of Lawhead's best books, it still fires my imagination and quickens my heart to read it. Lawhead makes me want to be a better person through his stories and characters. Grail is no exception."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"the entire pendragon cycle is amazing!!!!! i have never read anything like this series!!! i am a huge reader, i read like 3 500 page books a week and i love arthurian legends so you can imagine i have read a lot of them! but i have never in my life read anything as purely wonderful as stephen r. lawhead's pendragon cycle. these 5 books are definately the best 5 books in the world! they are almost completely different from any other arthurian legends ever written, and, although i will never grow tired of those versions, these books a refreshing and new way of telling the tales, instead of just the old guenevere and lancelot love and betrayal stories. i absolutely hate writing, but love reading of course, so i can especially appreciate all the work that must have gone into these books to make them so long (something like 449 pages each) and so completely enthralling. never have i read anything like these and i'm sure i never will again because these are so completely unique to any other versions i have heard. words cannot describe these 5 books so i will stop writing this review. but please, if you like arthurian legends, or just a good couple of books, try these: Taliesin, arthur, merlin, pendragon, and grail. they are magnificent!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"i liked it but it was kinda boring at times, you know. but i still reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"i liked it but it was kinda boring at times, you know. but i still reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I look back at the time I spent reading this book and ask myself why I wasted three weeks of my life attempting to read and contemplate the text within this fragment of harolded literary masterpieces.

He explored new facets of the legend and brought wonderful characters to life, making them move and breath, drawing us into their stories. They were grand, emotional and dramatic tapestries. And this book (along with its predecessor Pendragon) do not deserve to be named as part of the series. From the thinly disguised over the top and heavy handed Christian theme to the cliched Morgian and the absolute ripoff near the end: the knights getting lost in Morgian's dark forest. The contrived ending is enough to make us wretch. Unfortunately the once great Lawhead has lost it."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"i've read all the pendragon books. but when i think about them i can only remember the story up to the middle of the Aurther book, the rest is just a blur. WHEN I TRIED to read this book i found myself getting side-tracked,(for long periods of time i would just sit there and stare at the pages, or the wall), this book is really boring. After 2 years i'm on page 45 or 50 or something. And i can't stand the christian theme. i don't beleive in god so i can't relate to this book."},{"Title":"Grail: Library Edition","review":"I would have to say that I wished I never read Lawhead's series. It has been disappointing from beginning to end. Main characters in the beginning books (like Charis and Merlin) have become paper cutouts by the end of this series, to the point where I do not understand why Lawhead has them in his book anymore. He also makes plenty of errors in his books, and this is no exception. Another thing I find incredibly tedious about this whole series is the fact that there are endless wars through all of the books. There is at least a battle in every book--and in some, like &quot;Pendragon&quot;, are a tale of battles from beginning to end. You would wonder if the whole world was coming to attack Britain, the way Lawhead writes it.For this particular book, the main mistake Lawhead makes is not reading his other books in this series, or at least not remembering what he said in them. At the end of &quot;Arthur&quot;, it is noted that &quot;the Grail was never found&quot;. Um...but in this book, it was found, and lost, and recovered, and at the end of the book a shrine to it is made in the Northern end of Britain. Since there is no indication anywhere else that the Grail disappeared from Northern Britain, one would have to assume it's still there. This makes me realize how inconsistent of a writer Lawhead is. This guy could be a great writer, but it's mistakes like these that keep him from becoming such. Lawhead is definitely no Tolkien.Another major mess-up is in his inability to keep Loth and Lot straight. Loth is Lot's father in &quot;Arthur&quot;, and by the time the book starts introducing Lot it is clear that Loth is already long dead. By the end of &quot;Arthur&quot; it is clear that Morgian seduced Lot to produce the twins Gwalchavad and Gwalcmai, and in this book Morgaws. Yet in this book Lawhead keeps calling Lot &quot;Loth&quot;, although it is pretty clear that it is Lot that is being referred to and not Loth. It also is not clear to me why Morgian's relationship with Lot is considered incestuous, since Lot is the son of his father Loth and his first wife, and Morgian was Loth's second wife. Lot is not her flesh and blood; she's his stepmother. Although it's weird to be sleeping with your stepmother, it's definitely not incestuous is she's no blood relation.It was very pointless to make Gwalcmai and Gwalchavad twins. This did not serve any literary purpose. The fact that Gwalcmai gets sent off and doesn't return until the end of &quot;Arthur&quot; is testament to his uselessness. I honestly thought that &quot;Grail&quot; would be about Gwalcmai, but was sorely disappointed. We are never given the story of his wanderings, although according to &quot;Arthur&quot; he's been gone for 17 years. The other thing is that it is not revealed until the last book of &quot;Arthur&quot; (the chapter that Aneirin narrates) that it is revealed that Gwalchmai and Gwalchavad are the result of a union between Morgian and Lot. So how is it that Gwalchavad already knows this by &quot;Grail&quot;? According to Lawhead, &quot;Grail&quot; comes before the last book of &quot;Arthur&quot;. Gwalchavad can't know it. It hasn't been revealed yet. Gwalchavad states Merlin told him--how did Merlin find out? I would think that in &quot;Arthur&quot; Gwalcmai and Gwalchavad wouldn't be surprised by Morgian revelation if they already heard it from Merlin, yet they are shocked to hear it when she says they are her sons in &quot;Arthur&quot;. And why is it Merlin can't figure Morgaws out at all, if he knows about Gwalcmai and Gwalchavad? I couldn't understand that at all.I am still not convinced that Morgian was any great threat. She seems way too easily defeated. I don't think that Morgaws (who never existed in any Arthur tales and is a figment of Lawhead's imagination) is that threatening either. I'm still trying to figure out why Charis was so freaked out by her but refused to say anything.I recall one of the opening statements Morgian makes in this book is &quot;Not for nothing am I called the Queen of Air and Darkness&quot;. The first thing I thought was, &quot;Oh, yes, you are&quot;. Lawhead has not really developed Morgian much, and even though he finally does so here, it's not enough. Fine, so we finally know why she's so pissed off. It doesn't strike me as any reason to get so vengeful towards someone she hardly knows--ie. Arthur. She also seems very ineffectual. She tries to kill Charis and fails, and never tries again. She tries to kill Merlin and fails, and never tries that again either. Every attempt she makes is doomed to failure. So it wasn't that surprising that she failed again here.There is also a scene where some of the Cymbrogi are supposedly dead. If you're like me and read the last chapter of &quot;Arthur&quot; before reading &quot;Grail&quot;, this scene is ruined for you. There's no surprise to it.I read somewhere that Lawhead believed that the King Arthur tales needed to be brought back to &quot;their Christian roots&quot;. Um..guess what. The King Arthur tales started out as part of Celtic mythology, and authors such as Geoffrey of Monmouth and others are the ones responsible for inserting Christian lore into a tale that was never Christian to begin with. I have done some reading on what past editors of these tales have done, and most of them edited these stories with a particular goal in mind--ie. for Monmouth it was turning Arthur into a Norman hero, and emphasizing the fact that he fought battles against the Saxons, who were the Normans' enemies. These tales have been subject to so much manipulation over the years--isn't it time to say &quot;enough's enough&quot;? Apparently not, for Lawhead has decided that the legend needs even more manipulation. I can't say he's done a good job.I suppose I only have myself to blame. I really should have done more research before buying these books. Now I can't even give them away--most people I know weren't that impressed with the series either."},{"Title":"Jewish life in the Middle Ages (A Temple book)","review":"This is a tour of Jewish life in the Middle Ages (12th-18th century). It is themat so that is examines attitudes towards the Synagouge in one chapter and examines the attitude of Jews towards the Slave trade and other occupations in another area. It examines all facets of Jewish life from communal life to Rabbis, occupation, family life, marriage and clothing.A fascinating view into the life of Jews in Europe in the Middle Ages that shows the incredible diversity and depth of the Jewish community and shows how much we can learn about their culture and how they coped in a world that was often unsteady and insecure.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Jewish life in the Middle Ages (A Temple book)","review":"The most important thing to know about this book is that it was written at the end of the 19th century, before the Holocaust and before the spasm of hatred in the early 20th century that led to a mass exodus of Jews from Eastern Europe. Important, too, is where this book doesn't cover. There is almost no mention of Russia or the Baltic States, although Poland does come up several times. Also, as far as this book is concerned Scandinavia does not exist. Spain, France, Italy, England, Portugal, Germany, Palestine, Egypt and to some extent Morocco and Algiers are the regions of primary concern.The author takes pains at the beginning to point out that while the Medieval period may have been something of a Dark Ages for Christendom, the Jewish communities of Europe (or \\"Israel\\", as he refers to it) were shielded from much of that until the end of the period when they became increasingly isolated, culminating in being sent to live in ghettos in many areas, or simply exiled. However, Jews were frequently the subject of specific legislation which both limited what industries they could enter- money-lending in many areas was the only form of activity left open to them- and taxed them exorbitantly. At one point, the Jewish communities in England provided one-twelfth of the royal revenue. That communities could thrive despite that is remarkable.The topics covered here include religious life, social life, home life, marriage customs, love and courtship, games, clothing, trade, slavery and education, to name just a few. It discusses not only the laws governing a topic but the deviations by area as well as the ways in which restrictions were countered by different communities.The amount of knowledge the common Jewish man in Spain was responsible to master- everything from Religion and Philosophy to Optics and \\"Indian\\" mathematics- was staggering. The author makes the case that the Renaissance was ushered in by the Jews, to a great extent those who brought Arabic and Indian learning with them from Spain. He notes that Italy, where there were the fewest restrictions on Jews, was where the Renaissance initially flowered. I would agree.The book ends by exploring the relationships between Jews and Christians. That so many laws had to be issued so frequently to restrict social exchange between the two groups, the author argues, shows how deeply the communities were connected. The author cites many examples, famous and mundane, to show how often Jews and Christians worked and socialized together.The author appears to apologize in the introduction- and in places throughout the book- for the character of his contemporary co-religionist. These are the hardest parts of the book to read, in part because he never makes clear what, specifically, is wrong with the Jewish character, and in part because it smacks of the ingrained self-effacing seen in so many oppressed minority groups. But this, in and of itself, is instructive too.Recommended for any student of Jewish history."},{"Title":"Earth: Our Crowded Spaceship","review":"Although this book was written in 1974, when Asimov was unaware of the technological advancements that have dramatically improved the efficiency of resource use, the basic premises he works from remain. Humanity is still using non-renewable resources at a growing rate and at some point they will run out. The threat of global warming is a serious one and no one really knows what the consequences will be.Asimov targeted the material at the level of the late middle and high school student. It is a description of the main technical advancements such as agriculture, medical advancements, and improvements in hygiene that have dramatically increased the average life span of humans. He then performs some simple calculations that demonstrate that the time will soon be reached when the human population will reach the capacity of the Earth to sustain it. When this happens, the human population will almost certainly drop at a dramatic rate.His solution is to be proactive and take actions now to reduce the growth in the number of humans. The proposals are mild, yet controversial to some people. They are the expanded use of family planning around the world and the continued development of new technology to improve housing, health and quality of life.As always, Asimov argues with a thoroughness that leaves little room for doubt or argument. Until humanity finally learns how to control the growth of the population, this will remain one of the best explanations of the reasons why it needs to be done."},{"Title":"The Horolovar 400-day clock repair guide","review":"Purchase was as described but seemed to take a long time to arrive.

Not every police officer is going to go through some of the scenarios she talks about but it sure is nice to have an idea of things that may come. God forbid my husband ever have to kill someone or end up getting seriously injured on the job but if he does I will be better able to support him through times of trouble. 'Some people feel it is all about negative things but let's face it. Cops are being killed and injured at an alarming rate these days. If you wanted a feel good book that talks about happy things then maybe you should have married a clown. It's a dangerous job that takes a toll on the heroes who are willing to take it. Most people bring their stress home because it's a physical and mental reaction to dealing with possible threats as well as departmental problems. That stress can and usually will seep out and affect the whole family. Sure there are going to be cops who are able to hide the stress but that doesn't mean it's not there. My own husband does not show obvious signs of stress but I know him well enough to see that sometimes it IS there.

Being a cop is a demanding job, and sometimes the very skills required for competence - such as being able to suppress strong emotions like fear, anger, or even compassion - are harmful to officers' private and personal lives if carried over to the home. I Love a Cop gives practical, no-nonsense advice to what to expect from the demands of the job, coping with stress or trauma, and much more. Of especial value are the chapters about dealing with domestic abuse, threats of suicide, or other severe cases and problems - including how to recognize the warning signs and when there is no other option than to just get out. Though I Love a Cop is intended especially for the loved ones of police offers, its solid advice is also highly recommended for the loved ones of anyone in a high-stress, risky or demanding occupation. I Love a Cop is also highly recommended as supplemental reading for anyone considering a policing career, as there is also plenty of sage wisdom about what to expect on the job and how to balance demands of the job with those of family life."},{"Title":"I Love a Cop, Revised Edition: What Police Families Need to Know","review":"This is a must have for anyone going into, thinking about going into or already in Law enforcement; especially if you are married or getting married.

I personally don't think it is meant to scare anyone with the what ifs and could happens that are mentioned in the book. It does do a good job of explaining how the job changes for the officer from when the first start off as the eager rookie to possibly ending as the jaded officer.It does touch on the subjects of stress in the job, how to properly and improperly handle it, moving up in the ranks, PTSD, how to get help from outside the relationship and in it, problems that affect home life due to the job.It does also touch of domestic violence within the police family, which can happen to both officer or the spouse/kids, and touches on how to fix or remove yourself from the situation.My husband and I already have a very open relationship and he shares at lot of what happens at work with me and this keeps him from becoming to depressed. But every couple is different and some people can't handle all that \\"horrible\\" information. But this book does a good job of reminding the non-cop of what your officer goes through on a day to day basis. And even on a career basis.I would encourage the spouse to read this book with their officer or to read out certain sections. Particularly the chapter about the police paradox, about how bringing your police persona home is not always a good thing and how to separate from it.I also like the factor that this book is fairly secular and seems to leave that up to the individual reading it rather than telling them whom or what they must follow in order to survive the job as I have seen in some books."},{"Title":"I Love a Cop, Revised Edition: What Police Families Need to Know","review":"This was one of the most educational books I have ever read.

It is true that the author seems to have done the appropriate historical research for her story, and that is normally a good thing, but this author feels the need to drone on for pages and pages in proof of her efforts. Instead of using historical facts and societal practices in the easy, off-handed manner of the best romance writers, Ms. Small treats us to endless explanations of things that even those with only glancing historical knowledge should have no problem understanding. The characterization is thready, clinging to one or two endlessly re-iterated traits to distinguish one person from another. Finally, and most gratingly, the use of &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;yer&quot; to distinguish brogue (which is acceptable if one has only one or two characters with an accent) in a book which is composed entirely of characters of Scottish origin, quickly becomes irritating--in my opinion it would be better done to simply use &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, and &quot;you're&quot; with the brogue assumed, or occasionally implied.All in all, not a read I would recommend to any romance fan."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book is excellent. It's steamy, it's a good story, it has interesting dialogue and the plot is really good. From the second the books starts until the last page, it has you in a trance. I was literally up until 3:30am one morning reading because it was so good. That's all I can really say about this movie without giving away any great secrets: it's really, really, really good!With that being said, this particular Kindle edition is an atrocious raping of the written word. There are misspellings (and not like \\"consience\\" instead of \\"conscience\\" -- it's like \\"Dpola\\" instead of \\"Fiona\\"), there are mispunctuation (once again, it's not like putting a comma outside a quotation mark, it's like: \\"she said' it's going to be\\" fine.\\"), and there are so many random unintentional italices, that it is literally too distracting to read.So, like I said, the plot it amazing (I have never read Beatrice Small, but I am convinced she is a great, talented author and I will be reading more of her books). If you like the steamer side of romance novels, you'll definitely like this one. HOWEVER, I do not recommend buying it on Kindle because you won't get the full experience of the book.* I should also like to include a small side note to my review. I have had the Kindle for about three weeks and it truly is my new best friend. I have had NO other problems with ANY other books. If you love reading, like I do, or even only read once in a while, you need the Kindle. It's worth it's weight in gold! I consider it the best invention of the decade! I love love love my Kindle (buy it!), I love love love this book (buy it!), but Amazon needs to work out some bugs with this one novel."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Ms. Busbee has written another wonderful novel filled with history and romance. Fiona is a hidden character in all of us romantics! The book was so intense, I finished it in three days. The ending was somewhat predictable but well worth the reading effort."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I would have to say that anyone who gives this book less than 4 stars is a fool! There was enough history included to keep things straight for those of us who are not history buffs with respect to the Scots, but not too much as to confuse.Upon reading this book I fell in love with many of the characters and hated some, such as King James. This novel was a thoroughly refreshing read! Most romances are the same plot over and over and over again. Two people fall in love, have a problem, and overcome it in little to no time and live happily ever after-yada yada yada. I found myself wondering while reading this book if Fiona and Angus would be reunited; that only made it more exciting!Also too many authors skimp on the sex sections! Small gives enough detail for them to be titillating and informative of the characters emotions while not crossing the line of vulgarity. Face it ya prudes-sex is part of love!This novel has everything love, loyalty, anger, deception, passion, jealousy, and most importantly sadness because that is how life is and was. Definitely not some sugar-coated fairy tale. Fairy tales are for children!Lastly, I have one small complaint. When Angus and Fiona are finally reunited the book ends immediately. I would like to know more about how Angus and Fiona got on after the 5 years they were separated! They had to have some problems.This is the second Small novel I have read, the first being Hellion which I love almost as much. Being a person who is usually reading authors like Stephanie Laurens and Julie Garwood... I am now a completely devoted fan of Bertrice Small!"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I have read *all* of Ms. Small's books, and they've been a wonderful treat for me. Of course, I have a special place in my heart for the Skye O'Malley series, so I tend to read non-Skye related books a bit apprehensively. This book quickly became my all time favorite !Do yourself a treat---make a hot cup of tea, curl into a comfy chair and read this book in one LONG stretch ! Enjoy !"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This book started off great, exciting when she agreed to be Angus's mistress for stealing his cattle. But what I couldn't understand is how could she be with Nairn for so long, and be happy if she really loved Angus. That's what I didn't understand. She was with Nairn more than the man she loved, or thought she did. There were some interesting scenes with Nairn and Fiona, but I felt like she was cheating on Angus, for some reason. Overall it's a good book, but it seems like Fiona doesn't know what she wants or who she loves."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"In 1422, the Laird of Loch Brae, Angus Gordon, catches Fiona Hay stealing his cattle to pay dowries for her sisters' weddings. He accuses her of the crime and she offers her maidenhead in payment. Angus says the cattle is worth more than just one night in the sack. Instead he makes her his mistress.When King James returns to the Scottish throne after twenty years held as a royal prisoner in England, he does everything to unite Scotland under his rule. He worries about the Highlanders, who have failed to swear fealty to him. Even though he knows that Fiona and Angus love each other, the King sets in motion a plot to turn Fiona into the lover-spy of Colin MacDonald, a wild Highlander. The plan works with Colin being duped into abducting Fiona. With no trace of her, it appears that Angus and Fiona will never share the lifetime of happiness that both richly deserve.New York Times best selling author Bertrice Small writes her best novel since the early &quot;Skye O'Malley&quot; books with BETRAYED. The novel is extremely erotic (even for Ms. Small), but is very enjoyable due to the brilliant and charming lead and secondary characters, who bring alive the reign of King James I. Historical romance fans will enjoy this fabulous story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This book got my attention when I read its &quot;free&quot; excerpt. It so intrigued me that I ordered the novel immediately. I just knew it was going to be romantic, sensual and adventurous. I was not disappointed. This is historical power and romance at its truest and best; a beautiful, spitited, yet honorable lass, two men who love her, and a king with much power and little mercy. Ms. Smalls is a genius in the arena."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Bertrice Small is one of my all time favorite writers. Somepeople complain about the similarity about the story lines. (Boy meetsgirl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl to handsome stranger, boy gets girl again.) I like Mrs. Small's writing because it is different from the typical romances. She is also very detailed and historically accurate. Her characters are very deep and her descriptions are so vibrant. I lose myself in Bertrice Small books every time without exception. This book was your typical Bertice Small book...."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Bertrice Small, but her last few books had been very disappointing. Betrayed is the best one she's written in a while. The only thing I didn't care for was that Fiona spent so much time apart from Angus. But I was glad to see that at least Fiona didn't end up in some damn harem, because I was getting pretty sick of that same old story in too many of Bertrice Smalls books! Betrayed is worth a read."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This was a sad excuse for gratuitous sex. Almost zero plot, a young girl sleeps with two men she 'loves' in dozens of places, positions and situations. They may have had their clothes on for maybe 1/2 of the book. Maybe. All in all, a waste of time."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"It started out all right, but soon plunged into long stretches of dry historical facts that read like \\"Robert, Duke of Albany, brother of late king Robert III, held hostage by his nephew, Murdoch Earl of Fife, who murdered the last English king, who chose a bride--\\"Soon I stopped caring who anyone was, or attempting to keep track of them. The plotting was choppy with no vitality or momentum, the narrative pedestrian and unimaginative -- and, come to think of it, isn't \\"imaginative narrative\\" one of the top goals for a writer? All the characters are cardboard-thin, and the narrative point of view skipped all over the place; sometimes you're reading three different character's thoughts on the same page!And the main plot point, the kind sending Fiona to be a spy...Why didn't he just get someone who was WILLING to do it???Well, that's where I stopped reading, so unfortunately didn't get to the \\"gratuitous sex\\" parts I heard mention of."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Written under the genre of historical romance, this tale could better have been listed as adult. The basic plot of a highland lass, only fifteen years old, finding true love simultaneously with two men is a sheer cover for the unending, gratuitous, raunchy bedroom scenes.Although descriptions of lush landscapes are well-written, the characters aren't dressed long enough to enjoy them and the only emotions portrayed are lust and jeaslousy.For a good Scottish romance, look elsewhere - try Jude Devereaux or Julie Garwood!"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"The book itself is typical Beatrice Small. A great story set in historical fact. HOWEVER, the kindle edition is so laden with mis-spellings and poor punctuation, that it is very distracting for the reader. I would recommend getting this book in the paper version."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I've read enough in this genre to know by the first two pages if I'm going to be interested enough to continue. Vocabulary is very important and yes, I was intrigued. I enjoyed this story for its engaging plot; the author got right to the point, and I loved the historical accuracy.I felt very much connected to Fiona and Black Angus. However,just when I'd fallen for Black Angus,he's swept out and another is swept in. Surprise, surprise, I fell for this fellow too! My Fiona would have been a little more expansive in her grieving process.Still, the story touched me and was rare in its unpredictability."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This book was more typical of Bertrice Small's recent romance novels. I still prefer her earlier novels like The Kadin or Adora. Romance readers should be prepared for the explicit sex when they pick up one of her books. Bertrice Small is a wonderful writer with vivid historical descriptions."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Ms. Small has succeeded in creating another in the person of Skye O'Malley. Keep up the good work! I read your books as fast as you write them. I am a HUGE fan!"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Ms. Small's books are always very sexual. Anyone reading them knows that after the first one or two they read. The plot was great, although Angus Gordon not trying to find her didn't have much credit. Any man, that in love with a woman, would do whatever it took in order to find her-- not go off to England to &quot;greive&quot; as if she was dead. Ms. Small, Keep up the good work! I'll buy 'em as fast as you can write them!"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"While I have enjoyed every book Ms. Small has ever written, this is by far my favorite ! I have already re-read three times...and unable to put it down between readings !Fiona Hay is a woman between a rock and a hard place throughout her life, doing her duty by her sisters, and to uphold her own honor. She makes mistakes, learns from them and is rewarded by being loved by the two most magnificent men one can possibly imagine. Interestingly enough, I enjoyed the character of Colin MacDonald even more than Black Angus Gordon...what a dynamic, rich character he is !If you want to be swept up in medieval Scotland, and experience first hand of the 'taming' of the wild northern clans, then &quot;Betrayed&quot; will captivate you completely !"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"Betrayed was all in all an enjoyable book with a feisty heroine struggling to do the best by her family. This title contains just enough history and sensuality for a balanced story. A personal favorite for me is the way Ms. Small subtly ties one book to the other, but unfortunately there was neither predecessor nor successor to this novel. I enjoyed the premise thoroughly."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I think she did a great great job. I think the story could have been a little longer.

I finished it in 3 days. A truly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I absolutely love a story with a great sense of history! Bertrice Small has never disappointed me on that score, but with this one I believe she has outdone herself! It puts me greatly in mind of Robin Hood, William Wallace, and other historic legends. If you love those types of stories with such a great sense of history, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I believe this book to be the best Ms. Small has written. There is just enough history to help you understand whats happening in the story, but not so much as to make you not want to read on. I liked the chemistry between the characters. Fiona, kicked heinie in my opinon. She did not hide behind her thoughts and feelings like many think women of her time did. Angus is great once he get over his non commitment stage. I liked Narin best of all. I hated him for stealing Fiona from Angus, but as the book goes on you find out he is really a nice guy with a big heart. I really give this book 10 stars.....its my favorite romance novel"},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I did like this book but felt the 'love story' was a little off since the majority of the book was with Colly. Oh well, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This book was very gripping from the first page to the last. What distinguishes Bertrice Small from otherhistorical romances is in most of herbooks she broaches the question if a woman or a man can love someone and still enjoy sexual relations with another person."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I received this book years ago when I belonged to a book club. As an avid reader during that period of my life I would chew through a novel every two days.I got this book hardcover and started my usual reading. I cannot put good books down usually, as I feel like it is similar to stopping a movie right at the most gravitating point. I picked this book up and the dishes never got done, the laundry went to hell, the kids ate at McDonalds, and I did not sleep until I was on the last paragraph of the last page.By far not the normal romance novel of two falling in love and conquering some issue or villian. Bertrice Small throws in another lover. It gave me conflicting feelings as I never read a romance novel with such a twist. It was exciting and startling. It actually ruined me from enjoying other romance novels.I had sold my hard copy in a yard sale many years ago. I repurchased this book in Jan 2012 because I still cant get it out of my mind and have already reread it."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This romance is well named for it seems in it everyone is betrayed or betrays or both. It's a gripping story of love denied and reclaimed with all of the historical details and sensual scenes Small's fans have come to love. Like all her stories that I have read, this is not a typical historical romance. The hero and heroine are separated, people you come to love die...yeah, it's a Bertrice Small story.We first met Fiona Hay at the court of James I in \\"The Border Lord and The Lady,\\" book 4 of Small's Border Chronicles series, where she appears as the beautiful mistress of Angus Gordon, a clan chieftain and friend of King James. Then suddenly the MacDonald of Nairn steals her and we hear no more. I was so curious I tracked this book down...this is her story. For those fans of the Border Chronicles, I highly recommend reading this along with that series perhaps before The Border Lord and The Lady.The story begins in 1422 when then Prince James is a captive of the English throne. Fiona Hay is 15 and the eldest daughter of her parents, who are both dead. She has 5 sisters and promised her mother on her deathbed that she would see them all married. One has been wed but she has four more to see to the altar. In order to pay their dowers she has stolen cattle from 25 year old laird Angus Gordon. When she is caught, Angus exacts as a price her maidenhead and takes her as his mistress. Right away I didn't like him, as she was an innocent just trying to care for her family. He could have made her his wife, as his sister urged him to do, but no. I felt he deserved to lose her.Two years later James Stewart is now on the throne of Scotland and Angus visits him at court taking Fiona his mistress and parading her as such before all at court. While he has fallen in love with her he won't tell her and he has yet to marry her. When King James sees that Colin MacDonald, the laird of Nairn, is taken with Fiona, he takes advantage of the chance to plant a spy in the Highlands and sends Angus off on a mission and tells Fiona the laird of Nairn will abduct her, but that she must go with him. He also tells her that he has picked a bride for Angus and it isn't her. She is distraught but feels she has little choice. Colin MacDonald loves Fiona enough to steal her but not apparently enough to allow her the man she loves. Thus, three men, none of whom is deserving of her, have betrayed poor Fiona. But the worst betrayal was the king's for he lied to her repeatedly for his own selfish gain causing her much heartbreak.Pregnant with Angus' child, Fiona finds herself in the Highlands and handfasted to Colin MacDonald, who thinks the child is his. The story kept me reading late at night as few have. I had to know how this would turn out. I did think that Small had Angus and Fiona too long apart. She was too long with the wrong man though he turned out to be a good one. I found myself hurrying through some chapters looking for Fiona and Angus to be reunited.What I found a bit hard to believe: If you were betrayed by your king, would you name your child after him? I don't think so. And why would Fiona believe that Angus who she knew loved her wouldn't help her if she got word to him she had been stolen? There were explanations but I wasn't quite convinced. I also could not see her going along with the abduction. There were times I wanted her to not just be angry but to act on that anger. Instead she always adapted to the circumstances. But that is just me."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"This is my first Beatrice Small book and I really enjoyed it. I liked her writing style and her character's are believable, likable and endearing. The story has enough unexpected twists and turns and kept me fully engaged. I will definitely read more of her books."},{"Title":"Betrayed","review":"I totally agree with SassyCassie. I really liked the characters and the story. It had me on the first page. I am a fan of Bertrice Small and I too would have liked to hear a little more about Fiona and Angus at the end of the story.

Buckley the Elder routinely sailed an ocean every 5 years or so, and his Son was often part of the crew. All the ship's members had tasks, and on this trip Christopher was in charge of bringing along projects for fun and diversion during the extended voyage. The one I will remember was the model he brought for the group to construct, of course a ship, and for him it could be no other, The Titanic.His is not low brow cheap shot humor, although you may be surprised by how inept some other Authors are when engaging him in written debate. He writes within this book on a variety of subjects guaranteed to make you laugh, and for those that take themselves, or a given subject too seriously, he will annoy you. Even if the latter group is the one you find yourself in, if only to yourself, you still cannot deny the wit, and the intellect that is behind his thoughts.So if The Pope appearing on Oprah selling his new book intrigues you, or perhaps Johnnie Cochran writing a letter of recommendation for the squeezed fruit who was his client piques your interest, this read is for you. If the two topics I mention do not suffice, there is always his written feud with Tom Clancy, satire on Star Trek, or perhaps the \\"How I went 9 G's in an F-16 and Only Threw Up Five Times\\", there is something here that will cause you great pain in your sides, as he is the cause of pain for his adversaries in their nether regions.The stories I mentioned are a tiny fraction of what awaits the reader, for I have not touched upon the selling of Lenin's embalmed corpse.Buckley the Younger is wonderful, or as the Author Tom Wolfe states \\"Fifty years ago the 3 funniest writers in the English language were named Shaw, Mencken and Muggeridge....today they're named Thompson, O'Rourke, and Christopher Buckley...\\"If you have not tried this man's work, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Wry Martinis","review":"Chris Buckley is my favorite author, having written masterful satires like \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" and \\"Little Green Men.\\" This is not a novel, as I was dismayed to learn, but just a collection of Buckley essays.

The essay about George Bush (Sr.) and martinis is hilarious -- I still refer to an extra-dry martini (just wave the vermouth bottle over the glass, not opening it) as the \\"George Bush\\" martini. Get this book if you have read everything else Buckley has written."},{"Title":"Wry Martinis","review":"Wry Martinis is an easy to read, funny collection of essays.

I would have rated this book a 10, except he filled the last half of the volume with more sobersided essays. These were not as interesting. You finish another funny piece around the middle of the book, manage to stifle your laughter, wipe your eyes and say to yourself, &quot;OK, I'm ready for the next one.&quot; Only the next one isn't funny, or even particularly interesting. What would the world be like if Dave Barry, Calvin Trillin, or Fran Lebowitz pulled such a stunt?The book was worth the price, though, just to read the articles on Buckley's feud with Tom Clancy. You'll have to excuse me now, I've got to get to the library to locate a book that Buckley recommends called &quot;Bassholes&quot;, by Ed Weiler."},{"Title":"Wry Martinis","review":"American conservatives are doomed to suffer in squaredom for a simple reason (besides weak hair): their stance of Permanent Moral Disapproval. Whatever virtues this state may possess, hipness is not one of them. Fred MacMurray may be an admirable paterfamilias and a model of bourgeois rectitude, but he will not win the dance contest on Soul Train.The Right has a serious fun problem. Like evil runes possessed of a curious power, the words carved on the id of every teenager worth her salt -- sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll -- send conservatives into a howling, medieval fury. The inconvenient fact is that all hipness contains a spice of nihilism, a tiny but flavorful soupcon of who-gives-a-****, that is anathema to the Right. To the degree that conservative writers embrace Cool Style, they simply cease to be conservative. -REVIEW : of &quot;Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing,&quot; edited by David Brooks (GARY KAMIYA, Salon)That statement is, I suppose, fairly typical of how the Left views conservatives, and may in fact be largely true. But it misses two extremely salient points : (1) those who do embrace Cool Style cease to be humorous, after all, if you think it's perfectly fine to engage in wildly varied sexual experimentation, then 99% of the jokes ever told in the history of man, particularly those with sheep in them, no longer have punch lines; (2) no the Right isn't out having this sort of fun, we're home with our wives making jokes about the hipster doofuses that think that such behavior makes them cool. [Recall the hilarious Republican response to Ted Kennedy's 1988 Democratic convention speech, where he used the tagline &quot;Where was George ?&quot; Answer : Home in bed with Barbara, sober.] Humor, particularly satirical humor, by its very nature, requires you to take a pretty jaundiced view of humankind; it practically requires the stance of Permanent Moral Disapproval, which Kamiya finds so offensive. The natural result is that almost all of the humorous political writing in America today is being done by conservatives. The collection that is panned above, for instance, includes an embarrassment of riches, including Joe Queenan, PJ O'Rourke, Andrew Ferguson, and Christopher Buckley.Wry Martinis meanwhile is a collection of twenty years worth of the writings of Christopher Buckley--an editor at Forbes FYI, regular contributor to the back page of The New Yorker, former speech writer to Vice President Bush, and the son of William F. Buckley. The book contains many funny pieces ranging from travel essays to book reviews. Among the funniest are his NY Times review of Tom Clancy's novel Debt of Honor, which is so scathing that it provoked a mini-feud between the two. It starts by citing Mark Twain :Somewhere, if memory serves, Mark Twain said of one of Henry James's books, &quot;Once you put it down, you can't pick it up.&quot; &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; the eighth novel in Tom Clancy's oeuvre, is, at 766 pages, a herniating experience.And things get really ugly thereafter. One of Buckley's favorite devices, especially in his New Yorker bits, is to take one seemingly innocent item out of the news and then spin a comedic scenario around it. Among the factoids that get this treatment :* 'They both come to my house. We serve them a Martini. And we have an exchange between the two.' -Tom Brokaw in The New York Times, proposing an alternative presidential-debate format* A group of conservative political operatives is expected to announce today the launching of the Conservative TV Network, a 24-hour pay cable-television channel expected to debut in early 1996. -USA Today* To save money, airlines in the United States are circulating less fresh air into the cabins of many airplanes. -The New York TimesThese brief essays are generally very funny, but even better, the modus operandi set him up to perpetrate a terrific hoax. In Forbes FYI, he started out a piece with a seemingly similar blurb :It has come to our attention through private channels that the Soviet government is preparing to make a very unusual, indeed unprecedented, offering : the embalmed remains of V. I. Lenin.The following fabrication proved so successful that the Soviet government was deluged with bids and Peter Jennings reported, and later angrily retracted, the story on ABC News.These and the many other pieces make for a truly funny collection. It belongs on your shelf, in the midst of the collected works of H. L. Mencken, Tom Wolfe, Andrew Ferguson, and P.J. O'Rourke, and the other equally funny curmudgeons who have so masterfully turned the Human Tragedy into a Human Comedy.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"Wry Martinis","review":"I am normally a huge Christopher Buckley fan, and I was excited to get Wry Martinis. I knew it was a collection of (largely) previously published work, but why should that matter? Unfortunately, it turns out to matter a lot. Buckley's magazine pieces would no doubt be funny if you came upon them one at a time in a magazine, just the way Andy Rooney could be funny at the end of a 60 Minutes broadcast. Strung end-to-end, however, these short essays just become irritating. Here's one thing Buckley doesn't like. Here's another. And another. The effect is only slightly more appealing than a six-hour tape of Andy Rooney."},{"Title":"Wry Martinis","review":"This is such a disappointment.

Some chapters in this collection of essays are laugh-out-loud funny, such as 'Hemlines of History'; others taught me a lot about aircraft and aircraft carriers; still others had me bored and wondering if the essay was supposed to be poking fun at the elite, or written in complete seriousness about a world I know nothing about, nor really care about. Maybe its because I live on the West Coast, and we are more informal, but some of Buckley's concerns and gripes don't seem all that important to me.

You know, Christopher probably hates the fact that his family connection is constantly brought up in reviews, and I would be a touch more sensitive to his feelings, but, frankly, I think he's profited from it and why not give credit where it is due? I'll admit it--I'm envious. Here was a boy born with a golden dictionary in his hand and money to boot. And then he gets to go to Harvard, work on the Lampoon, be an editor at Forbes (and do a little junket travel as detailed in one of the more nauseatingly sycophantic articles here), write speeches for the Vice-President, and then he becomes a best- selling humorist. I'm so green with envy I'm sitting here looking a bit like the Incredible Hulk.It wouldn't be quite so bad except that he even sounds like a nice guy, someone that I could be friends with (if I was wealthy or a politician or a fashion designer or the owner of my own company or you get the picture). Even his politics don't rub me quite the wrong way as his fellow conservative humorist, P.J. O'Rourke.

Also presents the legacy of the Armenian Genocide and the danger of such a tragedy befalling the Jews (ironically the Zionists worried about the Yishuv during World War One whereas the Holocaust occured to the Diaspora during World War Two); the influence of that very fear on the Nili Group of Pro-British Ottoman Jewish spies; the significance of Franz Werfel's Forty Days of Musa Dagh during the ghetto uprisings and the Armenian Genocide in the literature of the time as well as direct eyewitness details of the Genocide. An excellent read, cites many nearly obscure primary sources from the World War One Period. Useful for Jewish-Israeli Studies, British policy during World War One as well as Armenian History."},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","review":"To describe Kierkegaard is, to say the very least, difficult! Not that his style of writing is boring or even overly difficult. Not at all! His style is poetic, warm, and loving. Yet all the while, he makes you feel uncomfortable, leads you to questioning your faith, and often makes one angry! However, the thing that I admire most about the author and the book &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;, is how he has led me to recklessly look inside myself, so that I can see the the truth about who I am! In short, no other author has ever made me just &quot;think&quot;, the way that SK has. I have read and heard much of modern theology. For me, this &quot;modern theology&quot; only scratches the surface of these important thoughts. SK will take your mind and heart, to spiritual depths that are thus far, undiscovered."},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","review":"I am a minister, and although I though I was a prety good theologian, I only understood the fullest of Christ's message (if this is attainable at all) after I started reading this book.From the beginnings, through his prayer on the first pages, it is the most brillant Christology/Soteriology ever exposed.I had to stop reading this book because I wasn't sure that I was ready to deal with the type of feelings that I was being exposed to, and I wanted the book never to end, to be honest.Although I am a convict Protestant, I must say that the Orthodox principle of Theosis started to make sense to me.If you want to \\"get it\\" Christ, I would recommend this and \\"Works of Love\\"."},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","review":"I seldom review classical works feeling that posterity has spoken on their behalf far more weightily than I could hope to. However, I had to comment on this fantastic, underrated text. SK wrote in his journal that while he often used pseudonyms in his other works, in part, to distance himself from the ideas, in this book the pen name was employed to distance the ideas from him, feeling himself an imperfect messenger. If we have any access at all to the center of SK's program, this is it, yet it is rarely mentioned as an important work of his authorship.There is no doubt that Either/Or, Fear and Trembling and Concluding Unscientific Postscript are all brilliant. However, Practice in Christianity deserves every bit as much attention as these works. It is a work of self disclosure calling the reader to examine the basis for their faith and confront the startling choice between imitation and offense based on the risky prospect of embracing paradox. It is also one of SK's most accessible texts that can be read devotionally. One of my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","review":"_Practice in Christianity_ is one of Kierkegaard's more underrated books, and should not be overlooked. I will summarize his concepts as best I can: In this book Kierkegaard encourages a rigorous and \\"militant\\" practice of Christianity. By \\"militant\\" he does not mean violence in the physical sense, obviously. What he means is a determination to constantly find better ways to understand God and Christ, even though every question that gets answered seems to spawn more questions. Rigorous Christianity is a continuous chasing after that which perpetually eludes us. Even though we may never reach a true catharsis in our understanding, the process of continually seeking understanding is still beneficial to the individual. It helps to strenthen the uniqueness of our individuality, and helps to set us apart from society in a way that preserves the \\"heterogeneity\\" of society. Kierkegaard stresses the importance of maintaining heterogeneity within society because this is essential in the creation of individual personalities, and is an essential ingredient to conscious life in general. Kierkegaard states it thus: \\"woe to the Christian Church when it will have been victorious in this world, for then it is not the Church which has been victorious but the world. Then the heterogeneity between Christianity and the world has vanished, and Christiantiy has lost\\" (p. 223). It is important that society does not ever reach a consensus on what to believe in, because then we will all rest on our laurels and abandon the continual, rigorous striving that is essential in enhancing our individualist personalities. The loss of individualism is synonymous with the end of conscious life and self-awareness as we know it. There must always be individuals who stand out as beacons of virtue, if for no other reason than to infuse other people with life by making them feel inadequate and subjugated. Rigorous, militant Christians must always turn their back on the world and strive for something better, and indoing so they help to blaze a trail into higher realms of understanding, dragging the reluctant congregation behind them.If these concepts sound interesting to you, I highly recommend this volume. Die hard atheists will probably view this book as a fruitless discussion over a moot point. But people who consider themselves Christian, and want to set themselves apart from other lackadaisical, so-called Christians, could benefit greatly by reading this book. This is not a book for people who show up to church just to show up and then fall asleep in the pew - it is for people who want to reach a higher standard of rigorous practice in religion."},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","review":"This is Kierkegaard at his highest and most potent. This work was so ideal, in regards to Christianity, that Kierkegaard himself could not write it, but rather it was written pseudonymously by Anti-Climacus who also wrote The Sickness Unto Death. Kierkegaard writes not only to those in Christendom but also, I think, to himself. Anti-Climacus is the judge of Christendom and Kierkegaard does not want to pass himself off as that judge. He considers himself merely one of the sick while Anti-Climacus is the doctor. This book will challenge you and your faith, but in such a good way. If you don't have faith and don't consider yourself a Christian, then you may not be that interested in the book honestly. And I don't recommend reading this book for pure scholarly purposes as I think that undermines what Kierkegaard wanted. Though, I do think even the non-Christian reader can, if he or she so wishes, get a clearer understanding of what Christianity really means for the individual. But if you do consider yourself a Christian and if you want to really begin to experience the love of Christ, then read this work. You will begin to understand that in order to be a Christian, not only do you have to have faith, but you also have to live contemporaneously with Christ. In my opinion, this is the most important work by Kierkegaard, even more important then Fear and Trembling or Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Surprisingly, it is also easier to read then many of his early works; although, I do suggest having a Bible and a dictionary at your side at all times. This brings me to my only complaint and it is not a complaint about the work but rather about the layout of the book. Firstly, I must say that this is a great translation into English; however, the notes are at the end of the book. This is, I think, a downfall because you will find yourself often flipping to the end of the book to look up the notes. But I still give the book 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Practice in Christianity : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 20","review":"I bought this specifically because I wanted some of the writings in the book, so there's not much to say about it's contents.

A short history describes the beginnings of the Verein movement in Germany, its development into the largest colonization project in Texas history, and the fulfillment of its goal to create a settlement of German immigrants on the 3,800,000-acre Fisher-Miller grant and in a number of other places in Texas. Published in English for the first time are the twelve reports made by Prince Karl Solms of Braunfels, who was the leader of the expedition in Texas. These reports describe the activities of the Verein and the first phase of German colonization in Texas.Of special interest to the descendants of these early Texas settlers is a list of over 4,000 immigrants compiled from German and Texas ship passenger lists, which provides such information as age, names of accompanying family members, place of residence in Europe, name of ship, and dates of departure and arrival.

Certainly, decisions about traveling across the ocean to a strange, undeveloped land were not easy for the immigrants who made the trip or for their friends and family members who were left behind in German lands.

This version is true Science Fiction presented in professional style and acted with clarity, reverence to material and with believability befitting works of this stature and beauty.This is a true gem worthy of notice and deserving a stronger look than others of its ilk.From the first minute on it pulls you in and makes you care about Jarvis and his treacherous journey across Martian soil to try to reunite with his crew back on the ship. His encounters with the alien life there make you feel as though you were truly on the journey with him, and Tweel (voiced by a human, I think) becomes a link to the powerful force of adaptability we all possess as human beings in Jarvis. The music gently guides, rather than assault us throughout the story, but also audibly reminds us of the terror inherent on this planet when need arises.From beginning to end, this piece mesmerizes and enchants without resorting to maudlin overexplanation of a character's action.

Written to make life in Massachusetts sound like an adventure in a bounteous land, the book ignores the extreme hardship of the first winter and instead focuses on the rich resources of Massachusetts and the relationship the Pilgrims developed with the Indians. Here, the book drives home two points: (1) Europeans had long come to North American to fish and trade. These activities left a mixed legacy that the pilgrims had to overcome. (2) The Indians were everywhere. In fact, the first trip by the Pilgrims to visit chief Massasoit was motivated in part by this fact: Indians families were coming in great numbers to Plymouth to look at the English and interact with them.

The colonizers' tracts and the travelers' accounts exaggerated the romantic attractions of the New World. The vast and abundant resources of the New World were admired, in a propagandistic and persuasive discourse. Both the Puritans and the colonizers (which were often one and the same) wrote exaggerating accounts of their adventures to lure Europeans over to the New World.

Much of this information has been useful while some of it seems only to serve the limited agendas of those seeking to mislead the public. In this context, work on the subject should be treated with a healthy dose of discernment. Fortunately, there are a growing number of helpful, informative remote viewing books and this is one of them. Remote Viewing: The Science and Theory of Nonphysical Perception, by Dr. Courtney Brown, is the most definitive textbook on remote viewing yet written. Dr. Brown, one of the early pioneers in applying chaos theory to social science data, covers all facets of the remote viewing process, including both theory and data analysis. The result is a detailed scientific presentation, the result of years of remote viewing work done at the Farsight Institute, a nonprofit research and teaching organization set up by Brown in 1996.Brown explores how the remote viewing process works, many of the anomalies associated with remote viewing, and how to do statistical analyses of the results. The book is meticulously written and thoroughly presents the various facets of setting up an RV session, how the viewer and monitor execute the session, and eventually interpret the results. Brown investigates the \\"fuzzy\\" aspects of remote viewing, how it defies linear, mechanistic reasoning yet nonetheless shows repeatability in different viewers' sessions, both from beginning and more experienced practitioners. The book also contains many examples of experimental designs formulated around remote viewing experiments carried out at the Farsight Institute.Brown's book is written as a scientific treatise on the subject and should be recognized as one of the first of that genre. The book deserves to be published by a university press so it could be used as classroom primer. As it stands, remote viewing practitioners and scientists alike will find Brown's work both foundational and forward-looking in the many questions it raises about why remote viewing works and the consequences for modern science. Remote viewing is still a mystery to us but its implications are large. Brown goes a long way in this book in making that mystery more accessible to academics and the reading public.(Dr. Simeon Hein is the author of Opening Minds and the forthcoming Planetary Intelligence.)"},{"Title":"Remote Viewing: The Science and Theory of Nonphysical Perception","review":"Author of upcoming \\"Footsteps in Stardust - Soulprints in time\\"REMOTE VIEWING - Until quite recently would have been considered another fancy name for clairvoyance. However around 1995, the world became aware that the military in many major countries around the world had been spending huge amounts of money on remote viewing, it was indeed a valuable part of their intelligence gathering agenda.Since then, Remote Viewing has taken the human consciousness by storm. In 2005, a Google search for \`Remote Viewing' yielded 326,000 references, in June 2009 the same search yields an unbelievable 18,300,000 references!Among the scores of publications - some of dubious integrity - there are many great books written on the subject, but Dr Courtney Brown, in this book, has given us the added depth of his scientific expertise, and lays the foundation for the readers' own experiments, if he/she wishes to take this exciting field to new and even greater heights.Dr. Courtney Brown was one of the original pioneers in this field. After having set up the Farsight Institute - a non-profit research and teaching organisation in 1996 - and after many years of meticulous study, developed the framework for Scientific Remote Viewing. His first two works; \\"Cosmic Voyage\\" and \\"Cosmic Explorers\\", were eyeopening, and what got me interested in Dr. Brown and his work. \\"Remote Viewing - the science and theory of non-physical perception\\" is so much more detailed, and adds the \\"Scientific\\" to Remote Viewing. One may argue against Remote Viewing, but with Dr Brown's expert knowledge on the operation of the human conscious and subconscious mind, and his ability to apply that in his research, Remote Viewing has certainly become \\"Scientific Remote Viewing\\", and no thinking person can really scoff at that!Perhaps one of the more important facets of Dr Brown's work as outlined in this remarkable book is in the non-physical, or \\"subspace\\" reality, and the science of \`subspace psychology'. We will certainly be hearing more about subspace psychology in the coming years.The book itself is well presented, filled with illustrations, worksheets and examples; and should fascinate anyone who is ready to take on board the ground breaking ideas of human communications with - even the cosmos.The price is not exactly low, but you get 313 pages of real value - well worth it."},{"Title":"Remote Viewing: The Science and Theory of Nonphysical Perception","review":"Courtney Brown has done an excellent job of explaining the theory and practice of remote viewing in this book.

Andreski confirmed all the suspicions I had about anthropology and the other social science from my graduate years on. The field is unjustifiably overspecialized, it covers the same ideas and materials that the classics (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Spencer) presented adequately more than a century ago(albeit in changed jargon), and a lot of cant and methodological mysticism hide--essentially--that many researchers, if not most, have nothing new to say.This is not to deny that much is out there that is original and advances the fields, and there lies an issue: I think Andreski is overpessimistic in the prospects of social science as &quot;hard&quot; science. His coverage of the dilemma that social sciences face--volitional humans with minds of their own--is well taken, as is his point about the dilemmas physicists and chemists would face if atoms and molecules all of a sudden became volitional entities.Even so, we can push diversity and unpredictability of behavior too far. Humans are of one species with the same brain structure, the same capacity for language and culture, the same potential for tool use--and despite the diversity in the world's cultures, there are many universals--from incest tabus among primary kin to susceptiblity to propaganda. It seems to me that more attention needs to be focused on the commonalities of human populations, and that is the major disagreement I would have with Andreski.Nonetheless, I rate the book as a five; reasonable people can disagree and still see the strengths in each others' work."},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","review":"I and my fellow graduate students perched to take our master's degree comprehensive and Ph.D. qualifying Eeaminations at UCSB were required to read this book, following two years of graduate study and prior to further study when the book was first released. I still remember it after over 25 years speaking to its staying power and the author's message. At the time, the book was a wake-up call for all social scientist to be versed in the classics, humanities and the sciences before endeavoring to add to the wealth of human knowledge. Dr. Andreski warned against doing research and using new jargon to repeat what had already been studied or discovered and reported, especially if the original work had been done by the Greek philosopher/scientists. It is a humbling book to read particularly at that time in one's life. I recall it as straightforward and direct to the point or rather points. I would recommend it to anyone interests in philosophy and social science or preparing to continue their education in these areas. I thank the faculty who had the foresight to mandate we read this book. The book puts one's own work and thought into a larger gloval and historical perspective. Dr. Andreski's work reminds us that society is built on those who came before us and who were creative with fewer resources and databases. I like this book for four reasons: 1) it reinforced my appreciation of a fine liberal arts education; 2) it appealed to my sense of irony; 3) it provided me with official approval to believe enough in, yet laugh at, both myself and my profession and others; 4)in today's terminology, it addresses the importance of thinking outside the box. This is not a book for those who take themselves so seriously or are so insecure that they cannot see the irony or accept the humor within their lives and their careers."},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","review":"Andreski provides a refreshingly honest look at the social sciences. He offers evidence for his claims and offers humor throughout. Although the book was written over 30 years ago, it can easily be applied to today's academic world. The problems illuminated by Andreski only seem to have gotten worse. He is greatly concerned about the decline of \\"true\\" education and points out how terminology and pseudo science have come to dominate the social sciences. As a result, those in the profession are no longer making meaningful contributions to knowledge and this can be largely attributed to the dumbing down of the academy (and the exclusion of history and philosophy). Andreski doesn't condemn the use of statistics in the social sciences as a whole, but wants it to take its rightful place as a mere means to knowledge. Instead, too much emphasis is placed on using \\"math\\" and models, and meaningful contributions that do not fit this criteria are ignored. Furthermore, the statistical models are not being used as a complement to, but instead as a replacement for learning history and philosophy. Andreski offers humor throughout and is unusually effective in making his points. This is definitely a classic and should be mandatory reading for all in the social sciences."},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","review":"I must say that this book is an enjoyable read. The author's points are well versed and the book is crafted with care. Unlike much reading in modern Social Sciences, Social Science as Sorcery does not rely upon a jungle of terminology. This book, in fact, is a rebuke and questioning of the direction in modern sociology (and more importantly atomistic positivism) and its method. As the title suggests, it pokes fun at the social science by showing how and why men err in their reasoning.Although Andreski is a serious author engaged with a serious subject, he employs the opposition arguments with humor and wit to show their arguments absurd - reduction ad absurdum. In fact, as one of his many points, Andreski states that a good sense of humanity is needed to engage in social studies.Andreski indignation is aimed towards the modern social science research and method. Andreski re-galvanizes some points brought out by C. Wright Mills in his famous \\"Sociological Imagination,\\" where Mills analyzes and attacks modern university sociology (see especially chapter 11) with its unthinking reliance upon statistical gathering and hidden political manipulation/agenda. Yet, I found that Andreski's book is clearer and much more explicit on this point. In comparison, Mills seems to balk; and therefore is apprehensive and muddled in his indictment. As Andreski points out in the beginning of his book \`much of what passes as scientific study of human behavior boils down to an equivalent of sorcery....' (p. 10)For example, Andreski, like Mills, attacks Talcott Parsons by demonstrating his verbosity (of which he presents his famous and hilarious formula (A/K - 1 =V); where A is Ambition, K is knowledge and V is verbose jargon; therefore \\"when knowledge exceeds the ambition V becomes negative; and negative verbiage amounts to conciseness.\\" p. 82-83) and for adding practically nothing new to the ideas associated with sociology. In fact, Andreski feels that those who practice sociology are no longer men of the same stature as J.S. Mill, Herbert Spencer, David Ricardo, Augustus Comte, or others who were required to find their living outside the confines of teaching. (p.195) It is in this condemnation, where he finds his contemporaries inferior.However, Andreski doesn't throw the sociological baby out with his objections about the social science. He writes \\"Therefore, if he is honest, intelligent and has a wide range of knowledge, a sociologist or political scientist need suffer from no feelings of inferiority in regard to his colleagues in the natural sciences: and if they sneer at the shakiness of his edifice he can always answer: all right, if you are so much cleverer, why don't you try to say something about my subject that is new and can be backed by good arguments.\\" (p. 199)Andreski's book is jam packed with gems like this that will help an astute and keen observer of the social science to avoid methodological pitfalls and focus attention to the actual problems of the world. This is exactly what makes this book so quotable and amusing to read. Moreover, as another reviewer had put it, this is what makes Social Science as Sorcery so relevant today - no matter what your personal views are.No wonder this book is out of print.Social Science as Sorcery was crafted as a waking call to all those who seriously consider the moral questions of man and the future. This should be required reading to anyone interested in going to graduate school and pursuing a PhD in any of the fields of the Social Studies; Sociology, Anthropology, Economics, History or Political Science.The book's chapters are as follows -1 Why Foul One's Nest?2 The Witch Doctor's Dilemma3 Manipulation Through Description4 Censorship Through Mass Production5 In the Footsteps of Monsieur Pangloss and Dr. Bowdler6 The Smoke Screen of Jargon7 The Uses of Absurdity8 Evasion in the Guise of Objectivity9 Hiding Behind Methodology10 Quantification as Camouflage11 Promiscuous Crypto-Conservatism12 Ideology Underneath Terminology13 Techno-Totemism and Creeping Crypto-Totalitarianism14 The Law of Lighter Weights Rising to the Top15 Gresham's and Parkinson's Laws Combined16 Ivory Towers or Bureaucratic Treadmills17 The Barbarian Assault on the Corrupted Citadels of Learning18 Conclusion: Ethics and the Advancement of Knowledge[...]"},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","review":"Good books are worth rereading periodically, and I came to Amazon today to replace the copy I gave away decades back in an unwise fit of dispossession. The book's contents are fading into memory wallpaper, but I remembered how much I enjoyed the sly wit of academic heresy, the clear reasoning and how wonderfully readable it was--especially compared to the run-on paragraphs of unfathomable jargon he provided as as examples of contemporaneous social science \\"research\\" papers. (This is a problem that has worsened since Prof. Andreski wrote this book, probably owing to the ongoing bureaucratization of academia and the convenience of opacity when making dubious arguments.)Judging from the prices of used copies (up to roughly 20X what I paid for it new) it has weathered well, and I suspect the papers he so incisively skewered are gathering cobwebs in the basements of university libraries. I can't provide you with a good synopsis 30+ years after reading it, nor recommend it as a great buy at current prices, but until somebody reprints \\"The Social Sciences as Sorcery\\" I suggest canvassing libraries in your area to avoid missing out on this very wise, necessary (and fun!) book."},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","review":"Stanislav Andreski's book is essential to expose the verbiage and the presumption of a significant part of contemporary social sciences. I do not know how are the Social Sciences Departments/Faculties in other countries, but here in Brazil, the most prestigious universities, we saw the teachers saying the most obvious mediocrity with the utmost poise. It's the respected nonsense with a doctorate."},{"Title":"Social sciences as sorcery","review":"Typical high brow thinking. No one but other high brows want to read this droll, boring crap thus the author and publisher resort to catchy buzz words that attract interest. I checked this out at the local university and narcolepsy hit me so fast I thought I was reading A. E. Waite's The Holy Kabballah again!

Foster Series that originally sold for 2 and 3 dollars each.If you are a total and complete beginner, I guess it would be ok. But I was disappointed. I got this same book when I was 13. That was a long time ago, forty years. A lot has changed in forty years about painting. Brushes, materials and grounds are very different. Something this old isn't able to address that. If you want something for collecting, this might be the thing. But I didn't find it helpful at all for what I needed.A much better book and one that isn't much more expensive is &quot;Fourteen Formulas for Painting Fabulous Landscapes&quot; by Barbara Nuss."},{"Title":"The outlaws of medieval legend (Studies in social history)","review":"This book delves into the many outlaw characters of Medieval Britain, historical, semi-historical and those of so called myth that may have contributed to the Robin Hood legend. Hereward, Fulk Fitzwain, Eustace the Monk, William Wallace, and Gamelyn are all covered with at least one chapter dedicated to each. Outlaws of Medieval Legend also looks into the possibility of Robin Hood being a real living person, even if their reality differed from that of the Robin Hood Stories. Besides that it explores the sociological reasons that the Robin Hood and other British outlaw legends and historical figures were so popular during the middle ages and continue to be so to this day. I highly recomend this book to anyone with any sort of interest in the subject matter.Personally I always liked to think of Robin Hood as a just and righteous Anglo Saxon Thegn that had lost everything after the Normans took over England in 1066 and was fighting a guerella war against the oppressive Normans. I also always liked the idea of Robin Hood being a heathen that would rob the corrupt greedy Christian church and political figures."},{"Title":"The outlaws of medieval legend (Studies in social history)","review":"Even though Keen's book is not the most recent book on the topic, he still has some very good things to say. This edition republishes all his original material from the 1960's with a new introduction, explaining how some of his ideas have changed due to recent scholarship. This book is not a revision, just a reprinting. He has a chapter on outlaw ballads as an expression of peasant discontent, but has stated that he may have overstretched his conclusions.However, his book is still good to read in order to gain a broad understanding of English outlaws, he focuses on Robin Hood, but mentioned several other outlaw poems as well. For me personally this was the first time I read an overview of the life of Hereward and the tales of Gamelyn. I've heard of William Wallace, but didn't really know anything about him. Keen also has a chapter on Eustace the Monk, one of the outlaws who can be tracked down and pinpointed to exact dates. These other outlaws received a chapter or two and Keen explored both the overlapping themes among them and explores the historical background which produced the tales.His chapters on Robin Hood outline the fictional character and overview a few of the ballads. He notes how tough it is to try and find a historical Robin, and states that it may never be done. A few candidates have been put forward but they are all on shaky foundations and speculations. We know the rough century/century and a half in which the stories first began, so the original figure or figures who inspired them must have lived in the same period. Overall a good book if a little outdated by more recent scholarship. A good introduction to outlaw literature."},{"Title":"The outlaws of medieval legend (Studies in social history)","review":"This book dedicates each chapter to a different medieval outlaw and describes their exploits. I wish it went into more detail the villans described are Fulk Fitzwarren, William Wallace, Gamelyn, Robin Hood, Eustace the Monk, Hereward of Wake, and describes the detail of peasant discontent relating to ballads. It could have been longer and more detailed and had more heroes such as Janosik .

Many people will read the very detailed account of his life and feel sorry for how the prostitutes that he fell in love with and married used and abused him breaking his heart each time. Others will learn of the deep corruption in Nye county where government officials live off illegal payoffs and wage war with the brothel owner who refuses to pay them off.So who IS the real Whoremaster? Was it Walter who loved the fallen ladies that sold their bodies? The hookers who controlled Walter with their false pledge of love and marrage only to run off with his money? Or the corrupt Nye county government officials who sold their souls and the people trust with corruption?What you may realize after reading this well written book is that the real whoremaster is not the honest owner of a legal brothel, but those who abuse the a trust, public or private, to become drunk on power and greed. No one in this book comes away with clean hands. Real life is so much more complex then any ficton story."},{"Title":"Whoremaster: A biography","review":"Wendy captured the essence of the man and the business he ran.

Many authors would be tempted to narrow the study, and focus on political history alone. Kenneth Morgan, however, covers social history as well. Every chapter has a section on the arts, for example. In the hands of most authors this would mean that the book touches everything and explains nothing, but Morgan gets the balance just right.There are things Morgan misses out that some readers would complain about. A good example is that the affair of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson is mentioned in a single sentence, while many other books give a great deal of attention to it. It certainly was of great interest to the public at the time, and to this day. It seems, however, that Morgan merely touches on it because it has ahd little influence in the long term. Morgan also resists the temptation to chase irrelevant topics out of personal interest.This little volume will be very useful for foreigners who would like to get a good grasp of modern Britian. Students would do well to begin with a careful study of this book, using it as a touchstone to compare other sources. If Morgan does not mention a subject, theme or event, it is probably not very important.Finally, the book is a good read. Morgan kept me interested from start to finish. He not only covers the most important events, but he gets behind them to an understanding of the spirit of the times."},{"Title":"The life of Lenin","review":"Published in 1964, the author of this book was able to take advantage of much information that only became available during the late 1950's. Fischer's detailed account of Lenin's life is filled with many insights on the nature of the communist system from someone who saw Lenin in person and knew many of the personalities politically involved with him. The author is careful to redefine difficult to remember agency acronyms so the reader never feels lost and the style of writing flows easily. Though it is over six hundred pages in small size type, I never found myself bored but was intrigued by the complex yet fully explained events centered on the chaotic years from 1914 to 1924. Lenin was a master juggler, able to handle many issues at once and without any care for feathering his nest. Nobody who lives in a democracy will be thrilled by the dictatorial rule described in this book but, through hellish times, Lenin pulled Russia through. This is a worthy volume for any fan of history, philosophy and politics."},{"Title":"The life of Lenin","review":"This book was written 48 years ago and is still the best and most informative book you can read about Lenin without being able to read Russian."},{"Title":"The life of Lenin","review":"I read this book to learn more about Lenin after taking a Russian history class. If you like biographies, you will like this interesting book. It provides a balanced view of Lenin's life, and his influences and weaknesses."},{"Title":"The life of Lenin","review":"Written at the height of the Cold War, and it shows. There is an abundance of memoirs by individuals who observed or participated in the events of 1917-1924 which make for much better, and easier, reading. Lunacharsky's \\"Revolutionary Silhouettes\\" is delightful. \\"Lenin\\" by Landau-Aldanov is opinionated and entertaining. Others include \\"Days with Lenin\\" by Maxim Gorky; \\"Russia in the Shadows\\" by HG Wells; \\"Encounters with Lenin\\" by Valentinov; and many more. If one is looking for a serious analysis of Lenin's political thought, modern writers such as Neil Harding and Lars Lih are more useful."},{"Title":"The life of Lenin","review":"Eh, it was a pretty good book. Therefore I must conclude it was a worthy read. However, it was long as hell--even for a paperback. Let us keep in mind that some among the living have no desire to spend all their waking hours in front of a book when there is perfectly good barbeque to be eaten. Yes, I can taste it now. Then again, why spend all our hours merely working on gluttony (allegedly one of the seven deadly sins, no less), are there not better things to be had like the knowledge gained from an enlightening book about a man who--perhaps more than any other--affected most of the civilized world with his doctrines and lore? Shall we succumb to our lowliest desires at the expense of wisdom? Frequently, this may be the case. Usually, it is. Of course, there are many who may feel the tasty jaws of indolence knawling slowly away at their rotting brains, but let us begin. Still, it was an awfully long book.For instance, did you know that there are children in the United States' educational system that have never read a book on Lenin? Similarly, five people out of ten can't drive well. No doubt, that fact has little to do with this book, but nevertheless, although it's not germane, it still bears presidence in some fashion. Even if all our military might combined to fire their weapons in salvo, it could not achieve the cuncussive force of this man's mind. Whereas I once didn't think so, I now do.

It addresses issues that many of us may not be aware are abusive habits...to habits that are entrenched and need serious therapy and how to get professional help.

This book, by far, is the best and most complete book I've read....and ultimately the most helpful in healing from abuses of all kinds. I have referred back to it many times in my path to healing. I shared it with my Stake President and he saw to it that each of the ward libraries in our stake have one. It should be required reading for every auxiliary calling in the LDS Church; lack of knowledge and resources is a massive problem within the Church; I say this with first hand knowledge. After telling 24 Priesthood leaders of the sadistic abuse I suffered for the first 16 years of my life and the continued abuses to keep my quiet; they simply did nothing in regard to the abuses. I know this is not what the Lord taught in administering the priesthood. I believe fear, misused patriarchy, stigma and lack of knowledge are among the biggest problems in confronting the ugly truths in this life. This book has outstanding depth, critical (sometimes disturbing) truth, and points to solutions. One of my favorite chapters deals with forgiveness and the complex nature of it in regard to such serious sin against us with horrendous long-term consequences, using one of the best scriptural examples we have. It emphasized forgiveness as a process, not an event and why offering forgiveness prematurely can truly inhibit healing in many ways. I love this book, love the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the LDS Church. Though I appreciate very much, the efforts the Church has made in this direction in recent years, there is so much more that needs to be learned and expected as members, and especially leaders. This book is well-rounded, honest and I believe an inspired help in that direction. It's written by LDS professionals in this field, among them, abuse survivors themselves. I'm sorry to see it's not easily found and is out of print at this time. Not a huge surprise considering all the adversary has in mind for the individual, the family, the Church....the truth.

Though the LDS Church is not the only denomination that faces the problem the LDS Church Leaders have provided an example for how to \\"Confront Abuse\\". It should be remembered that it was President Ezra Taft Benson who ordered the report of Bishop Glenn L. Pace. Noemi P. Mattis and Elouise M. Bell, who contributed to \\"Confronting Abuse\\", chaired the Task Force on Ritual Abuse. When other denominations seek ways to cover-up the abuse that takes place in their denominations, \\"Confronting Abuse\\" provides an example of how religious denominations should take responsibility for addressing the issue and assisting the survivors. \\"Confronting Abuse\\" offers helpful insight into many forms of abuse, but I find it especially impressive that extreme abuse has been acknowledged and confronted.

Abuse touches most, if not all of us, whether we recognize/realize it or are willing to admit it.

It's an LDS perspective on understanding and healing.

Maples of the World isn't perfect and left me in question on a few things, but really, I have quite a few books on the genus Acer and this one is head and shoulders above all the rest. It has a very deep, terribly well-researched section on all the different cultivars of maples. It is well-written, well thought out, and the writers are bona fide maple experts. If you love maples (and what serious gardener doesn't?) consider buying this book.

As I tried to read it again today 8 years later with much gained experience I realized how poorly written and edited this book is. I'm sure it's not the editor's fault as they are most likely not familiar with derivatives. Even the basics of options are botched in this poor excuse of a book. The author emphasizes that you be clear in communication with your broker when taking/offsetting positions. How ironic. The author is not even capable of basic math. 5000 x $.01 = $500? or 5000 x $.02 = $1000? Sad. The product of our American public school system? Don't bother and look elsewhere.

But at the same time if you are a person who starts yawning on seeing a delta or gamma, you better stick with Ken Roberts and Cook's books. For as one reviewer has rightly said those are good for light entertainment and fantasy, etc.. But if you want to learn the ropes then there is no way out except falling in love with deltas and gammas. There is no free lunch. The reason why i withheld the fifth star, is that most of today's options strategies are software based and this book sheds insufficient light on that subject. Also another note to two previous reviewers, options cannot exist in isolation. Options are based on futures (except stock based options) and hence they cannot be studied or understood without refering to futures. Anyway i don't think there will be many books out there which can teach options only in isolation. so good luck. and as i said if you don't want to take the pains for example, like learning underlying relations between futures and options, stay away from this arena.

This can leave the reader confused as to which is correct.Similarly, because the details of the basic groundwork are partly contradictory, the reader is left with less confidence as the book becomes more complex.This is a great book for someone who is already comfortable with the basics of options, but if you are looking for an introductory text on options, try &quot;Options for Dummies&quot; or a similar book."},{"Title":"All About Options","review":"After I finished reading Option Volatility and Pricing by Nattenberg (intense book, but good if you are into options) I picked up this book to detox my brain.

I found that other than this dual writing style, the book was easy to follow and did make sense when the author stayed on one topic instead of going back and forth. The book does discuss theories, deltas, gammas, and strategies but I thought that the placement in the book was poor. I did get some benefit from reading it but will probably purchase another book that is more devoted to only options."},{"Title":"All About Options","review":"I know nothing of options and bought this book to learn about them. Its incredibly poorly written. The author goes from jargon to jargon without really explaining anything. Even the Glossary is full of jargon. One of the worst books I have read, ever"},{"Title":"All About Options","review":"McCafferty may be a trader, but he's no writer. The book is like a cascade of thoughts and knowledge with no organization. Here's a thought, if I want to learn about futures, I'll look for a book called \\"All About Futures\\". Poor math aside, instead of babbling on about Deltas and Offset strategies in the first chapter, how about telling me how to read a quote, and where to go to get them. The cover says \\"The best software programs for hedging or speculating\\". In fifteen pages of \\"info\\" he happens to mention ONE fairly specialized software program. After learning all of the fundamentals of Options and Options trading, I might find value in some of the points in this book, but by then I'm sure I will have found one with a much less confusing approach."},{"Title":"All About Options","review":"This book was far too confusing and unorganized.

If on the surface Olivia Langdon Clemens appears to be the quintessential Victorian lady--frail, neuresthenic, domestic--her inner strength and unflappable judgement are skillfully uncovered by Willis, who in this work produces that rarest of things: a literary biography that is both literary and biographical."},{"Title":"Mark and Livy the Love Story of Mark Twain and the Woman Who Almost Tamed Him","review":"Mark and Livy represents the only full-length survey of the woman behind Mark Twain - wife Olivia Clemens, or Livy.

Her book is a must have for any lover of poetry."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I Liked the book,enjoyed reading it.The verdict could go both ways.There was enough evidence to prove guilt,and enough reasonable doubt.People can't believe the jury voted not guilty but I can.It's hard for people who don't live where they are subjected to police injustices to believe that police would deliberately tamper or plant evidence.THEY DO,it's obvious they did in this case.Doesn't mean O.J. is innocent,but I believe they needed more evidence to make the case more solid.Sorry Marcia,with the clowns in the police department that investigated this,you didn't stand a chance to win."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"The scientific evidence was over the heads of the unintelligent jury, but didnt Marcia and her cohorts ever hear of Newtons Laws of cooling? Had they applied this mathematical concept to the 2 bodies, they could accurately have determined the time of death to within 20 minutes. This would have dismissed any doubts about the time theory."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. It didn't offer much information about the trial that wasn't widely publicized and it was published pretty late in the game by the standards of Simpson books. What I found most troubling was that Ms. Clark trashes everyone involved in her side of the case including Detectives Lange and Vannatter, Dennis Fung, LAPD brass, even Chris Darden. These were people who, like Clark herself, did their jobs under intense pressure and scrutiny who made a few mistakes, as she did. She then goes on to insult nearly everyone else involved in the case, blaming the verdict on so many different people it's difficult to determine who she really thinks is to blame. The purpose of the book seemed to be to throw out enough wild theories and speculation (for the not guilty verdict) that maybe we'll find one to believe, which is eerily similar to the strategy of Simpson's defense team.I had so much respect for her during the trial and thought she did a great job. Many experts have attacked her for what she did and didn't do (most notable Vincent Bugliosi), but as a layperson I found her intelligent and credible. Unfortunately, in the end she sold out her collegues who went through the same trials and tribulations that she recounts as a living nightmare. And why did she do it? To make money from her role in the case, while throughout the book she repeatedly denounces others who did the same."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Marcia Clark is a woman of guts, heart, and force, and she and her fantastic team of talent won that trial, as everybody else knows.This book was the only one on the Simpson case I waited for, and anticipated. Marcia should be commended for her endless months of work. I think she's a flipping hero and an asset to her gender and her profession. Get used to it."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This is the book for you if you are less skeptical than those imprisoned on the jury for the Simpson criminal trial. Ms. Clark could not sell herself or her case to them. Now she has taken millions in advance to try to sell herself and her case to those who do not know what happened in the courtroom.I own more than forty books that are, all or in part, about the Simpson trial or trials. Ms. Clark's -- alas! -- is not the worst of the lot, but it is far from the best of the lot. From the point of view of the prosecution, even prominent blowhard Vincent Bugliosi is more persuasive. If you would learn why the jurors would have been derelict had they not acquitted Simpson, read Dershowitz's book or, even better, read KILLING TIME.Ms. Clark, it appears from her book, was unable or unwilling to surrender either the timeline that made little sense or the police officers who told little lies. She phased herself out of her own case for weeks while incompetents made a hash of the DNA evidence. She dissembled about child care, mugged for the cameras, and made a dozen debilitating mistakes and then, in this book, blames Judge Ito. Judge Ito was, I agree, no month in the country; but Marcia was not even a Sunday drive. If I were foolish enough to step into a ring with Mike Tyson, I would never last a minute, but I could hope he would not knock me so senseless as to blame my loss on the referee.Ms. Clark had better come to grips with two statements that I regard as facts. One, O. J. Simpson killed or participated in the killing of one or both victims. Two, O. J. Simpson got away with his crimes due to the ineptitude, stubbornness, and childishness of Marcia Clark more than any other factor (except his money)."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I like Mr. Rob's review of the book. I gave ita 2 b/c it must have been hard for Marcia toreveal her steamy encounter with a hotel doorguy in Europe at age 17. Could have included more details on that.I am gonna pardon her for being so bitter and filled with wrath. Cuz when a person is angry, she often say things she doesn't really mean.With her talent, even if she is not practicing law, I believe Marcia can prevail in other areas. Such as be a good mother and take care of her two boys.Say Mr. Darden is married, am I not correct.??"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I have read most of the books written about the O.J. Trial. All have been more about setting forth that particular author's personal/ or political agenda and not about true analysis.What I fail to find in any of these books is what role did the media play in turning a simple crime of passion into the racial mess that this trial came to symbolize?This story is simple. Man and woman have a very sick/tormented relationship, where many sick games are played. One day man loses his head and murders woman and the poor guy who comes to her rescue. Man goes to trial. Man goes to jail for a crime of passion. End of story.Instead the SCLM (So Called Liberal Media) as described in the Eric Alterman's book, &quot;What Liberal Media,&quot; enters the picture driven by the almighty dollar and turns this simple crime into the trial of the century simply for the profit margin.We still trust the media to inform us and they failed miserably as they have done in every important story of our generation. There is no liberal media bias. It's all about the money and polarizing the country to fuel the tragic story of the Simpson case was more important to the Media than actually telling the real story.They forgot that Nicole and O.J. loved each other and created two very lovely kids together. Race had nothing to do witth it until the media focussed on it.Marcia Clark lost her case, because she drank the Kool Aid from the media and followed their narrative as opposed to trying the case for what it was a crime of passion."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"For OJ to be guilty, you must believe that he quickly disposed of the bloody clothes, shoes, and knives so they would NEVER be found, yet brought the socks and glove back to his home! And then smeared blood all over the console!The coroner who did the autopsies testified &quot;the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM&quot;. The limousine driver testified he brought OJ to the airport at that time. When you read this book, note how they avoid discussing these facts."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"She belongs in jail for impersonating a Lawyer. SHE is the reason the OJ Simpson is walking the streets. This book shows what an egotistical person she was/is."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"The clue is the testimony of the coroner in July 1994: &quot;the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM&quot;. By August 1994 somebody knew who planted the glove (see Steven Singular's &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot;). The 'LA Times' reported on June 7, 1996 that Vannatter collected blood from the victims before the evidence was turned over for analysis.Marcia Clark previously prosecuted twenty murder trials winning all but one (p.2). Teresa Carpenter made this a very readable book. Page 3 says there &quot;was enough physical evidence to convict O.J. twenty times times over&quot;. Does this mean it was too good to be true?Page 62 says the killer had been in a frenzy to kill Ron Goldman, but killed Nicole swiftly and efficiently. Doesn't this suggest Ron was the target, and Nicole was an innocent bystander? On page 76 she quotes Keith Z. as to stalking by OJ; since they had appeared in public, couldn't someone have tipped off OJ with the news? Didn't Ron Goldman resemble Keith Z. enough to be mistaken for him in the dark? Did this cause Keith Z. to go into hiding for many months afterwards?Page 105 says Nicole's be had blankets and sheets in a rumpled heap. Would Nicole leave it like that from Saturday night? If not, does this suggest that something else happened? Page 123 says &quot;the FBI found a single Caucasian hair on the glove from Rockingham&quot;. It could not be traced to the victims, or the police officers there. Whose glove was it then?Page 144 discusses asking for the death penalty: &quot;it would have been immoral to seek his death&quot;. Because of his innocence?Pages 157-9 and 163-7 tell of her youthful experiences, and her first marriage; a husband who &quot;displayed&quot; physical aggression. Page 205 tells of Faye Resnick's book, which told of beatings and abuse of Nicole. But these had never come to the attention of the DA's investigators! Faye made other statements which could not be corroborated.Page 228 says Nicole's family needed OJ's financial support, and discouraged Nicole from leaving OJ! I don't remember the media reporting this. Page 230 says Fred Goldman would check with Marcia before talking to Geraldo. Didn't Joe Bosco write that Fred was sent to the press as a diversion? She also says &quot;the Goldmans and the Browns were simply beyond out control&quot;?Pages 240-1 tell of the strategy to use domestic violence. &quot;One, to strip the jury of their illusions about the defendant; two, to give us the opportunity to present a compelling motive for murder&quot;. In other words, if you can demonize the defendant, then it'll be easier to convict him. Note that there is no mention of actual guilt here. Page 242 claims Paula Barbieri left a &quot;Dear John&quot; message for OJ that fatal Sunday. But other books say she visited OJ in jail regularly.On page 308 she criticizes Tom Lange for appearing &quot;cool and unbiased&quot;. Did she want him angry and emotional? On pages 334-7 she discusses the Fuhrman problem. But Marcia does not tell what was causing the problem between Chris and Mark. Or why Chris refused to deal with Mark.Marcia speaks highly of Allan Park, the limousine driver. He arrived at 10:22, but saw nobody until 10:53 (p.369). He left for the airport after 11PM. His testimony convinced the jury to vote &quot;not guilty&quot;.On page 396 she talks about the odds for a match on DNA, &quot;one in 57 billion&quot;. Doesn't she know that these figures are made-up and have no scientific basis?Pages 405-8 tell of the attempt to have OJ try on the killer's gloves. If they don't fit, you must explain it. Later, a new pair of gloves were produced, they fit perfectly. New gloves fit snugly, but after wearing they develop a looser fit. Here new gloves fit easily, but older worn gloves tighten up? Something's wrong here!Page 411 tells of the Silga sole that was sold to Bruno Magli (and other shoe manufacturers). You can visit a store and see if each style has a different sole. Marcia wonders where all those photographs were during her trial. Perhaps they were waiting for photo-editing software that would run on a 486 (see &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; for December 1997). No one could locate any store, salesman, witness, or receipt that would show OJ bought a pair of Bruno Magli shoes.Marcia says OJ is the guy &quot;who wears cashmere-lined gloves&quot;. Don't they cost the same as fur-lined gloves? On page 413 she says you &quot;can see the similarities between the defendant's head hair, for example, and what the killer left behind&quot;. Similar-looking hair is NOT proof they're the same. Read the book &quot;Tainting Evidence&quot; for more details.Pages 437-441 describe what happened when the Fuhrman tapes surfaces, like a deus ex machina.Page 451 tells of Fuhrman's testimony: to be convicted of perjury, the lie had to be material to the case. If he lied about racial slurs, it was not material to the murders. But if he planted evidence, then he had the right against self-incrimination. On page 463 she says OJ needed &quot;time to wash himself up, wash off the blood, change the clothes&quot;. But no bloody clothes or shoes were found at Rockingham, nor was any blood found in the drains. To believe OJ guilty you must believe that he quickly disposed of the bloody shoes, clothes, and knives so they would never be found, yet kept one glove and both socks!On page 483 she talks about the civil trial, but doesn't tell how it was fixed. She tells how witnesses altered their testimony. Doesn't this remind you of the legendary show trial of Stalin? Testimony changed to ensure a conviction?...accept the truth: OJ was guiltless..."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I am a middle class african-american female and I actually enjoyed the story. I learned a lot of facts within the book that I did not know especially pertaining to the evidence. But somethings are better left unsaid. The stereotyping of a certain group of people was very unnecessary. Some of the sly remarks like &quot;hood&quot; referring to O.J. Simpsons home truly offended me as a reader. To constantly refer to him a traitor of his people should have simply been left out of this book. That is something that is and has always been known in the African-american community and It didn't take Marcia Clark to point this out. I consider myself a very intelligent and articulate person. But to truly understand someone try walking in their shoes for a day. Maybe If Marcia would have done that she would have understood how to approach the people who sat on that jury. Not everyone is born with a silverspoon in their mouth but as individuals it is up to us to change our conditions..........."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Having attended law school and wanting to be a prosecutor myself, I watched most of the Simpson trial and read most of the books. I read Bugliosi's book, Toobin's book, Pretrocelli's book on the civil trial, Lange and Vanatter's book and a few others. I was left with the impression that the prosecution blew the case. I didn't read Marcia Clark's book until 2010 after developing a further curiosity about the case. The fact of the matter is that all those people who blame the prosection had the benefit of hindsite as they performed their Monday morning quarterbacking. Until you read Marcia Clark's first hand account of someone who walked the gauntlet for almost a year, you cannot fully understand the dynamics of the Simpson trial. Sure the prosecution made some mistakes, but people like Bugliosi - who makes some great arguments regarding Simpon's guilt - can't seem to understand what the prosecution was facing from the very outset. The racial dynamics, Simpon's celebrity, a weak judge and a defense team willing to say and do anything to win proved to be insurmountable obstacles for ANYONE. Whether it was Jill Shively who saw O.J. in the Bronco ruining her testimony by selling out to Hardcopy, Kato Kailan - a mere witness - trying to take the 5th at the Grand jury or Paul Barbieri's failure to tell the prosecution that she literally broke up with Simpson on the very day of the murders, it was just too much to overcome. For goodness sakes, her co-prosecutor, Bill Hodgman succumbed to the pressure and was taken away on a gurney shortly after opening arguments. In my opinion, it was too much for one person to bear and yet Marcia Clark fought for justice like a tiger. Despite the fact that she had to know the case was doomed from the outset with this downtown jury, she continued to fight tooth and nail for justice. While the workload and the pressure from the trial were daunting, she had to simutaneously deal with intrusions on her personal life. Her ex-husband files a custody case to take away her kids in the middle of the trial. Her ex-mother-in-law sells topless photos of her taken twenty years ago to the tabloids. Despite all that, she worked night and day to fight for justice for Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. I could go on and on and on about how formidable and yes impossible the task became. I do not know Miss Clark and have never met her. But her book has changed my mind about this trial - not about Simpson's guilt which was obvious from the start - but about how Simpson came to be acquitted. Marcia Clark fought as hard as anyone can for justice and deserves our admiration and accolades. To say that the prosecution lost the trial is simply not accurate. I hope that this book will dispel any notion of why this case was doomed and serve as a lasting testament to a civil servant who fought the good fight as well as anyone possible could."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Yeah, I am a white guy. And you can call me any names that you would like, but it is upon you to prove it. Marcia Clark has written a book and has laid herself open to all the negative attention and snide remarks that she endured during the case that IMHO was a gut wrenching travesty. Marica proves to me that she is a mighty fine lawyer, a great mother and even more important a real LADY that dealt with extremes with the utmost integrity and honesty. She should be held up as an American heroine for what she endured, doing battle daily for more than a year with the \\"Dream Team,\\" and their race baiting and a judge that was oh so very weak. I can't remember ever reading a book that made me want to meet and honor such a very special person as I do Marcia Clark. The trial was all about race and nothing that the prosecution could do would change that. They are the heroes. But instead, they are held up to ridicule for what they did or did not do. Orenthal James Simpson is guilty of snuffing out two lives with vicious and bloody attacks and if you don't get that message from this book, you have a serious lack of comprehension or you just don't get it. It would be a great honor for me to be able to meet Ms. Clark, just to thank her for what she went through while trying to find some sort of justice while fighting all of the elements that she came across. Great book. I am proud to live in a nation that has people like Marcia Clark. being an attorney, mother or just a lovely person. Ms Clark.

I hoped to learn more about what was going on behind the scenes that I had witnessed. What I learned was that, whatever awful thing it was, none of it was Marcia's fault.Letting O.J. remain at large after his initial questioning (leading to the infamous Bronco chase)? The LAPD made that decision. But Marcia anticipated trouble: \\"What if he pulls a Polanski?\\" she demanded of D.A. Gil Garcetti. (Polanski, you may recall, was a famous director who fled to France while under investigation on a rape charge. The fact that he was a French citizen with a home, friends and family overseas, while OJ had no such connections, made the parallel tenuous at best, I thought.) Definitely \\"Not MY fault!\\"Failure to \\"paper\\" Judge Ito when he was announced as the trial judge? (To \\"paper\\" is to protest the assignment and have the judge removed; the catch is, you can only do it once and you MUST take the next name proposed by the court.) A. There were worse judges on the list; B. Bill Hodgman, prosecution co-counsel, gave the tumbs up on Ito. \\"Not MY fault!\\"Putting the inept Dennis Fung on the stand, where he was shredded, day after day, by the defense team? A function of the LAPD's decision at the outset to give the case to this criminalist for investigation. Marcia would have chosen a more competent, experienced investigator - of course. (With 20-20 hindsight, who wouldn't have? Other than the defense team, that is.) \\"Not MY fault!\\"Failure to follow up when she learned about Mark Fuhrman's disability claim file - from Furhman himself - which contained very damaging statements made by Fuhrman? Let me quote: \\"The truth is simple. No one told me.\\" And, \\"Frankly, I didn't know what to do with the information Mark had given me.\\" And, other matters were much more pressing... \\"Not MY fault!\\"I could go on, Marcia Clark certainly does, though she also states that \\" don't mean to sound like a whiner.\\" In which case, she should not have written this book. You should read it only if A. You have an all-compelling interest in the O.J. case and simply must read every word on the printed page concerning it (in which case, this book may be as good as any of them and is somewhat entertainingly written) ; B. You have run out of excuses, rationalizations, and copouts of your own and want advice from an expert; or C. You are related to Marcia Clark. Closely related."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I bought this book as a compulsive purchase at an Everythings a dollar store. I was driven to this by morbid curiosity when I noticed that there were pictures in the middle of this book. Well the pictorial was a bit lacking in sensational morbidity, but the rest of the book was very enlightening to me. I never did follow the trial, but I must admit that without ever fully examing the evidence and circumstances I assumed O.J. was guilty. I guess it was that Slow Poke Rodriquez Bronco chase that my personal verdict was hinged upon. After reading the book I was surprised at how obvious O.J.'s guilt was. Could this guy have made a bigger mess? The only way this could have been more obvious is if he had brought Nicole's corpse along to co-star in one of his nylon commercials. This book does an excellent job of outlining how the justice system can be sabotaged by the media, ignorant jurors and a defense team with an unlimited cash supply. I applaud Marcia Clark for co-authoring this book, she has done an excellent job of explaining the behind the scenes politics of justice."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This is the first book in years that has kept me so captivated and eager to read on. It really was a struggle to put the book down! What I enjoyed most was Ms Clark's informal and relaxed tone, I truly felt like I was sitting next to her throughout the trial. It also brought to light what a gross miscarriage of justice the OJ case was. I followed the trial on TV, almost constantly, but never realised how much evidence was concealed by the defence, or indeed the untruths that were told.One important issue raised in the book was that of racial discrimination, and how this can divide communities, families, and friends. In this context, racial prejudice along with the defendant's celebrity status made mockery of the entire US justice system. While reading the book, I felt great sympathy for the prosecution, as they battled on, relentless in their quest to bring wrong to right. However, I did not feel an overwhelming bias in Ms Clark's writing, something I would have expected with a book of this nature. Instead, I found her account to be mostly balanced as she relayed the events that took place during the criminal trial. Of course there were frequent personal opinions and insights, but the reader was always left to make up their own mind.Lastly I would like to focus on the parts of the book not directly linked to the trial, namely events in Ms Clark's adolescence up to the time of her first divorce. I found these to be incredibly personal and from the heart. It is easy to see how these times in her life have made her the strong and determined person she is today. I was very much inspired by the way she handled the very lowest points in her life and I think there is a message to be learned from her - never give up, life is a roller coaster full of ups and downs. Persevere and things will surely get better."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"She tells a narrowly focused story, but I really expected to hear how the trial effected her AFTER the verdict. She is also very candid about the fact that she thinks everybody else screwed something up that made her job harder (I agree). Quizical and confused..probably a good read if you're a lawyer."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Unquestionably the best I have read so far on the Simpson case. I've read books by Darden, Shapiro, and Bugliosi. Clark lays open the thought processes that went into making the many difficult decisions that the prosecution faced. The many questions and criticisms that were lodged against the prosecutors are answered and explained in such a straightforward, in-your-face style, that critics can only respond by claiming that Clark takes no responsibility and is quick to blame others. People will believe what they want to believe. But if you approach this book with an open mind, you'll see that Clark is fully aware of, and admits to, her shortcomings and mistakes. It was well worth the wait and I highly recommend it to both supporters and detracters of the prosecution"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Marcia Clark succeeds in making her book about the Simpson case interesting and lively, and I think the reader does get a pretty good idea of what kind of person she is. The book is highly predictable, however, in that Clark in almost mechanical fashion slants events to justify her own actions and approaches with regard to the Simpson case. Like just about anyone in her position, she justifies, rationalizes, dumps on her enemies, praises her friends, and turns the Simpson trial into a Manichaean struggle of good vs. evil.Overall, I didn't find her a very appealing personality. She seems snippish, shallow, and self-promoting. But apparently, that's Marcia Clark."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I actually held Marcia Clark in higher regard BEFORE I read her self-pitying memoir about her life before the Simpson case (who cares), during the case (OK somewhat interesting), and after the verdict (again, who cares). She divulges that she used some of her student loan money for a trip to Israel, kept her first husband under wraps, and she managed to thrive in law school despite being forced to study in a backgammon parlor ! She is self congratulatory at length when recalling her successful prosecution of the Stalker of actress Rebecca Shaeffer but fails to mention that the guy had confessed. Ah and then the Simpson case falls in her hands. The courtroom procedues are the most interesting part of the book but Clark loses herself in slogging details that are not relevant to the Reader. And the infamous verdict. She blames the Judge. She blames the Jury. She emasculates Johnny Cochran, refusing to acknowledge that he simply out-lawyered her. Also taking the blame are Mark Fuhrman, Kato Kaelin, the Media, Robert Kardashian, and Barry Shoeck. Relatively gentle with Chris Darden, she fails to blame the person most at fault: herself. She had a slam-dunk case and she knew it. She clearly fumbled the ball when not taking into account thr Jury dynamic, a superstar Defense Attorney, and a preening Judge. But never fear: this book and her status as a celebrity legal reporter earn her a good living."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"One of best written books I have ever read on the O.J case but it was a book about defending herself not regrets to my regret. I believe O.J killed her because she was going to be costing O.J too much money and giving her any of it (via the divorce which was happening at time of murders) would liberate her from him and his control lust. The idea that she used domestic violence as a reason for the murders opened yet another door for the defense. I would have threaten to go public with the lie detector test in exchange for 15 year sentence at camp cupcake if it meant ending the case early but no one played hardball, they didn't even take full body pictures of O.J. Also I would use the absence of a police conspiracy in O.J's statements to the police and O.J's \\"good bye\\" letter as proof that the defense was lying and if O.J didn't know about any police conspiracy then no police conspiracy existed. Other books actually contain letters by O.J, but its not about regrets but rather more absence of same lack of warrior spirit and a person who just assumed after the race riots that a reasonable person would act reasonably. The juice should have got the juice. Give the juice the juice. She also should have announced upgraded charges and went full bore for the death penalty as the opening statement and then used the defenses refusal to bring evidence against Mark Fuhrman as more proof of lies by the defense."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"An interesting book which sheds light on why the proscution lost its case. Marcia Clark comes off as an intelligent workhorse with the usual mix of good and bad qualities (I run into women who are like her every day). And in the Simpson case, judging from this book, she and Darden were simply out of their leagues.Admitting personl fault, moving past instinct to facts, recognizing the importance of salesmanship, these are important traits for success in any situation. The book depicts Ms. Clark as having been overwhelmed from the begininng, so lost in the thicket she never developed the persepective it took to take a complicated case and win. One shouldn't expect her to write a book where she admits she blew it but that's the impression I got after wading through all 500 pages.Lastly, who thinks we got the real truth about her relationship with Darden, her nervousness at being trust into the celebrity spotlight, her adjustment to attention, money, and fame, which accompanied her role in the OJ Simpson trial? For a case which was fought on a battleground of versions of truth it would have been refreshing if she'd offered complete candor about how her life was turned upside down. My hunch, she doesn't recognize the concept."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"From the moment I picked up &quot;Without a Doubt&quot; I was hooked. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Marcia really expands on the fine details of the investigation of O.J. Simpson. She talks of the police mistakes, the District Attorney mistakes, and Chris Darden's as well as her own mistakes. The pace is unbelievable! This is a must read for anyone even remotely interested in the murder investigation and subsequent trial of O.J."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"During the trial it was hard to learn the truth from the fiction. The tabloids were printing false information left and right. Now we have the chance to read a true account of the evidence as well as what took place during the trial. Who better to tell the story than someone who lived it day in and day out for months? Marcia explains honestly why she did the things she did while fighting for the people in the trial of the century (ex. why she called certain witnesses even though it may have seemed like a bad idea). Marcia is a strong, intelligent woman who calls it like she sees it. Great book"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Ms. Clark is very forthright and sensitive. Above all veryhonest. She doesn't hide anything. She comes across as a real humanbeing. I enjoyed reading her book and infact have started reading it again. I think Ms. Clark offers much to this nation. I also think she got sold short in people laying the blame on her. Ms. Clark did a fantastic job aganist incrediable difficulties. It is sad that money and politics play so heavyly in justice and it is by no way Ms. Clark's fault."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"although quite lengthy, marcia does an excellent job of walkingthe reader through this very captivating account of a true travesty ofAmerican justice"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This book was, for me, the most eagerly anticipated of theseemingly dozens out there. I wanted to know what was going throughthe prosecution's head during this debacle. Ms. Clark's frustration was abundantly evident as the trial dragged on and on, seemingly forever. Three things will stand out in my mind and they were:No bells of doom rang out when the jury had not just a majority of women, but a majority of women who were black. Women in cases like this rarely have sympathy for the victim. I feel it's because if they did, it would mean that they would have to identify with them. In my mind, the case was over when the jury was seated. They didn't care about the victims and were dazzeled by the defendant. The supposed shock that a policeman who worked with gangs would have used a racial epethet.. It's more rare if they don't. That there was virtually no discussion in the press when more than one juror explained the quick verdict by saying that they had veen deliberating for nine months. I understood that they were given instructions every day not to form an opinion until they had all the evidence. The book was very good and answered most of my curioosity about Ms. Clarks's take on this whole mess that was the Simpson trial. I wish her luck."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This book is enjoyable and interesting. I found her commentsand assessments of the trial and the people involved much morebalanced and honest than you might expect. She cleared up a great deal of the misinformation and sound bite impressions left by the TV coverage. Recommended without a doubt!."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Just when you thought you heard just about everything you couldpossibly hear about the Trial of the Century, comes Marcia Clark andher book \\"Without a Doubt\\". Although it promises to address everything from her early romances to her struggle with the Simpson case, I found that the bulk of her message was directed at clearing up the confusion left by the other authors on the Simpson case. To me, this was just perfect. The Justice Systme to me is quite thrilling. Marcia has only increased my feelings towards the search for Justice and the battles that are fought each day. This is a must read for those who still believe O.J. is innocent. If this book dosen't persuade you into believing he is guilty, than perhaps you should have accompanied \\"Sojourner\\", the Mars pathfinder!

Anyone who watched the announcement of the verdict and saw the shock and disbelief on O. J. Simpson's own face, as the not guilty verdict was read, would know that even the defendant knew he was guilty.The prosecution never had much of a chance, because the presiding judge, Lance Ito, was a bumbling idiot who could not control his courtroom and make sound evidentiary rulings. . Instead, Lance Ito allowed his courtroom to become a three-ring circus. As a career prosecutor, I was appalled at the time at what went on in that courtroom, and Lance Ito's courting of the media was reprehensible. It was also clear that he was awed by and enthralled with the celebrity of the defendant appearing before him. One need only look to the civil trial in the matter to see how an effective judge controlled his courtroom. There, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki made sound rulings on evidentiary matters and remained in control of his courtroom at all times. Consequently, justice was obtained in the civil case.This tell all, no holds barred book is a well-written, engaging behind-the-scenes account of the \\"trial of the century\\". While Ms. Clark does include some personal information about herself, it is in the context of why she became a prosecutor and makes for a more fully fleshed account of how and why she may have acted as she did under the circumstances. She admits to some mistakes, and probably one of the biggest was having been lulled into a false sense of complacency about the competence of the criminalist assigned to the case, rather than going with her gut instinct to get whom she thought would be the best person for the job. Consequently, she was saddled with criminalist Dennis Fung, who for his incompetence in such a high profile case should have been summarily fired thereafter.As for the defense \\"Dream Team\\", having watched their antics on court TV during the course of the trial, it was clear that they were playing to the media for all it was worth, and the media was lapping it up. So much of what the defense did went beyond what was sanctioned by evidentiary rules and the rules of professional conduct that I was both amazed and appalled. That they got away with this kind of behavior was reprehensible. The only one able to call them on it, however, was Judge Lance Ito, and he failed to do so. The blame, therefore, for all the shenanigans that went on during the course of the trial lies squarely on Lance Ito's shoulders. He definitely gets the prize for one of the greatest failures in American jurisprudence.Still, one cannot forget prosecutor Chris Darden's ill-advised decision in proceeding to have O.J. try on the bloodied, weathered gloves found at the scene and at his home, rather than waiting for an exact duplicate pair to be delivered by the manufacturer. In light of the fact that the manufacturer had advised the prosecution that the original gloves would have shrunk as much as fifteen percent due to repeated exposure to dampness and extremes of heat and cold, it was downright stupid for Chris Darden to proceed to have the defendant try them on. While Ms. Clark had counseled Chris Darden not to proceed with this demonstration, but rather, to wait for the new duplicate pair, he did so anyway with disastrous results. As the lead prosecutor in the case, however, the fault for this debacle lies squarely with her on this issue, rather than Mr. Darden, because when you are the lead prosecutor, the buck stops with you. Ms. Clark need look no further than herself for this major faux pas and for the ensuing creation of Johnnie Cochran's famous, catchy sound bite, \\"If the glove doesn't fit, then you must acquit\\". Never mind that the new, duplicate glove fit O. J. to perfection!Notwithstanding the glove debacle, the forensic evidence against the defendant was overwhelming, despite the bungling of criminalist Dennis Fung. Unfortunately, the painstaking forensics case put together by the prosecution was lost under the smokescreen set off by the defense. The \\"Dream Team\\" played the race card to perfection to a sound bite crazed media that helped create a public frenzy, no doubt aided by the celebrity of the defendant. The defense team's cries of police mis-conduct and the Fuhrmanizing of the trial was a pulp journalist's dream come true. It was also a travesty of justice, as all the hoopla and media distortion masked what the trial was really about, the savage and wanton murders of two innocent human beings. Moreover, while much has been said about this being a crime of passion that the prosecution tried as dispassionately as possible, one must keep in mind that Judge Ito tied the prosecution's hands in large part, while giving the \\"Dream Team' an unprecedented free rein.This book will keep courtroom junkies enthralled with its war stories and sneak peak into the \\"trial of the century\\". Ms. Clark gives an excellent analysis of what went wrong, and while some of it may be a bit self-serving, she is right on the money for the most part. This is a riveting, page turning account, and she doesn't hold back any punches. Ms. Clark painstakingly goes through the evidence that was presented at the trial, as well as that evidence that Judge Ito, in his infinite wisdom, did not allow the prosecution to present.

Simpson trial. In this book she gives us all of the trial details from the first time she heard about the killings until the day the jury brought in the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. It's an interesting book in that it gives you insight into how each trial element was handled and the behind-the-scenes planning that has to occur to try someone.However, Ms. Clark never feels the need to attach any of the blame for losing the case to herself. Her biggest scapegoat is Judge Lance Ito. By all accounts he is a weak judge and let the defense get away with more than they should have been allowed to, however I find it hard to believe that there was nothing that she or the DA's office could have done about it. In the book it always seems that things are about to fall apart until she steps in at the last minute and fixes everything.This is the third book I've read about the Simpson trial (and it will be the last). I found Ms. Clark's book much more informative about the trial than Christopher Darden's &quot;In Contempt&quot;. The Darden book was much more of an autobiography and to be honest I wasn't all that interested in his personal life. Thankfully, Ms. Clark keeps her personal life story to a minimum. So, I'd recommend Ms. Clark's book if you want to get an inside look at the prosecution side of the trial. However, if you want a less biased look at the whole thing read Jeffrey Toobin's book, &quot;The Run of His Life.&quot;"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Any reasonable person who listened to the evidence at the so-called \\"trial of the century\\" knows without out a doubt that O.

After reading the book, I have no doubt about why they lost. This self-serving diatribe of Marcia's is deplorable. If you believe her, she single-handedly bore the entire burden of the case; the rest of the team only minor players! However, she will take NO responsibility for any of the prosecution's fumbles. She accuses every other player in the trial of possessing super egos, when it appears the biggest ego in the group is Marcia's.She'll have you believe that she shrunk from the media spotlight, while every one else was seeking and revelling in it. She convenietly waited until all of the other books were published, so that she could de-bunk anything that anyone had to say about her. It is painfully obvious that the case was lost because of her ineptitude for understanding basic human feelings. Doesn't a prosecutor have to understand people, what motivates them, what angers them. what gets them to cooperate? Seemingly she wasn't blessed with any of these skills. She is appalled and offended when her &quot;bad&quot; witnesses turn to &quot;good&quot; in the civil trail. Poor, poor Marcia!Perhaps a little introspection would have helped her. Through &quot;Without a Doubt&quot; the only thing Marcia Clark has proved is that she is obnoxious and disliked."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Because I disagreed with the verdict in the first Simpson trial and thought Marcia Clark was treated shabbily by all concerned, I looked forward to her book, expecting an insightful description of how her quest for justice was derailed by those who wanted to acquit a murderer by pandering to racism. I was disappointed. Clark comes across as one of the most petulant, whining, immature people imaginable. Most distrubing, and least professional, is her glee at reporting what she thinks are the foibles of the people she worked with on this case. (She even tells us when she didn't like the way they dressed.) No one would want to work with her after reading this, nor should they. The only errors at trial Clark admits to are minor tactical ones. Unintentionally, however, she illustrates what lost the case for the prosecution: failure to dismiss Chris Darden from the case when it became obvious he didn't have a grasp of the proceedings. Clark's own book makes clear that Darden made serious mistakes even before the glove debacle, any one of which Clark would have described with sarcasm if it had been done by anyone else. You wonder if Clark is even aware that her book proves the opposite of what she has intended."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Clark's book \\"Without a Doubt\\" is a rebuttal to her critics and pundits, most notably - if not mentioned outright - Jeffrey Toobin, author of \\"The Run of His Life,\\" arguably the definitive book on trial. Like Toobin, Clark leaves no stone unturned to prove that O.J. Simpson was guilty of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend, Ron Goldman.Clark's \\"Without a Doubt,\\" gives a detailed view of the case from the prosecutions' perspective and helps readers understand why many of the so-called errors (such as the composition of the jury and selection of witnesses who did and did not testify) actually had solid legal and strategic reasons behind them. Unlike Toobin, she devotes little time to witnesses, discounting many as lazy or liars, clearly separating them into \\"good\\" and \\"bad,\\" discarding those who may have helped bolster their case.Both agree OJ was guilty - his lawyers knew it and the evidence, overwhelming. Both agree the defense played the race card from the get go. Where they differ is in how - Toobin argues that the case was the prosecution's to lose, which they did, through their incompetence and sheer arrogance. Clark believes the case was doomed from the start by a dream jury unable (or unwilling) to understand the evidence.Although Clarks book is rich in legal details and evidence for courtroom aficionados, Toobin gives a far more vivid account of the trial through vivid recounting of the murder trial and behind-the-scenes - almost gossipy - look at the lives and testimony of the main participants and witnesses.Clark's disdain towards Judge Ito on all levels is very evident, always referring to him by his last name except when he does something nice (then she refers to him by first name, \\"Lance\\"). Every decision seems to be a compromise; in this regard, Toobin's account is somewhat more credible, as he explains that for the hundreds of legal decisions he had to make, the judge did make a mistake in a few.In his book Toobin does not hide his disdain for the prosecution - to the point that you wonder if they even granted him an interview. Almost all references to Marcia Clark are exceedingly negative - with regards to her appearance, arrogance, tardiness, aggressiveness towards witnesses, stubbornness (\\"she was going with her gut\\"), at times desperate attitude, even her way of speaking, always \\"ranting,\\" \\"sputtering\\" and \\"snarling.\\" Clark does her best to show how professional and prepared she was during the whole proceedings - in a way she lays out a defense of Marcia Clark.Christoper Darden, another prosecutor, fares no better as Toobin spares no chance in attacking and belittling him, comparing him time and time again to the older and wiser Johnnie Cochran Jr., defense lawyer for OJ Simpson. Darden is referred in Toobin's book to as amateurish, impetuous, splay-footed, skinny, shell-shocked, pouty, and at one point, emotionally and intellectually inferior to Cochran. Ouch. Clark on the other hand shows nothing but admiration although she accepts that Darden did make some mistakes, no doubt because of the stress everyone was under.Toobin provides a wealth of information about the lives of all the defense lawyers, the good and the bad. Shapiro comes off as a likable, somewhat smarmy but breezy lawyer desperate to keep himself in the limelight and protect his reputation at all costs. Cochran is \\"pontifical\\" and clearly inspires awe, \\"eyes ablaze, full of blustering vitality,\\" especially when at the end of the trial he surrounds himself with bodyguards.In comparison, Clark criticizes the Defense mercilessly for their underhanded tactics, showing why many of their actions were wrong from a legal and moral standpoint.Both agree Simpson was guilty. That the Defense did a lot of fancy footwork and some downright dirty tricks. But in the end, the reasons of why the jury acquitted are left for the reader to decide. Was it because they were clearly biased towards Simpson from the start, as Clark believes, or was it because they feared reprisals to their loved ones if they convicted O.J. in a heavily charged atmosphere of racial tension in L.A., as Toobin alleges?It's worth reading both books. Somewhere in between the two accounts probably lies the truth of what really happened."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I seem to be one of the few reviewers who was left withambivalent feelings about this book. I found it interesting, but cancertainly sympathize with those people who found the \\"not my fault\\" theme irritating."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I just finished reading Without a Doubt, couldn't put it down. It is the first book about the Simpson trial that I have been able to read all the way through. It felt truthful and real, there was no exaggeration or grandstanding for effect. If anyone has been involved in the court system at all then they will really appreciate the intensity and importance of this book. Marsha is not self serving or whiny......I enjoyed her honesty about the case and about herself. If she had not written about herself, people would be accusing her of hiding things. I found the book very affirming, as I have been involved in the Victim advocacy system for 13 years and have just left the 'justice' system for work where I can offer my skills without having to be belittled and bashed by the attorneys appointed by the system for the criminals and the abusive parents. Thank you Marsha."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Yes, I followed the trial, and no, I'm not ashamed. It was a fascinating, history-in-the-making spectacle. At some point I knew I would buy a book from one of the players, but--believing that O.J. was guilty--I refused to put my money in the hands of anyone writing on the defense side. Marsha's book seemed like the right choice. I wasn't disappointed.She brings us behind the scenes to see the inner workings of the legal process with graphic, sausage-making-like detail. We see how legal technicalities, a weak judge (Lance Ito), racially-biased jurors, media influence, and an outmatched prosecution team can lead to such a blatant miscarriage of justice as the acquittal of Mr. Simpson. There was so more to it than Mark Furhman, the LAPD, the &quot;race card,&quot; or &quot;jury nullification.&quot; One is lead to the conclusion that opening celebrity trials to the media is a huge mistake, and that because of rules of evidence and &quot;prejudicial influence,&quot; the jury in this case knew fewer of the pertinent facts than the casual TV viewer.Readable but not eloquent, the writing delivers a good sense of Marcia's character--like it or not--and a few juicy tidbits on the other players. Someday a more definitive and comprehensive historical summary of this case will be written by an independent professional writer. Until then, Maria's book is the way to go. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I pledged to never read one of the multitude of books on the OJcase, but I found this book for only ( )--couldn't pass it up.What a great view of what the majority of Americans thought had happened during the &quot;Trial of the Century.&quot; The most startling and disappointing aspect of the investigation and trial was the vulnerability to celebrity of many involved. The shameful way Judge Ito pandered was recorded each day, but to find that jurors and even investigating officers fell prey to celebrity was disgusting.Marcia Clark does not paint herself as a &quot;victim.&quot; Nor does she come off as the loveable heroine. She is quite honest about her mistakes, both personal and professional. And it was the case of her career which ultimately ended her prosecuting professession.

The book is also a portrait of a woman whose commitment and character are truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"With all the terrible crime scene police work, I don't think anybody other than OJ himself can ever find out whether he was guilty or not. But a book reader's interest is not to uphold one set of criminal evidence by suppressing another. As a book, Without A Doubt is a decent read. It's entertaining without being overly melodramatic. Marcia, of course, is just as brutally honest about, if indulgent of, her emotions in the book as we've seen her throughout the trial back in 1995. Credit should be given to her vivid characterization of the players: Judge Lance Ito as a wimp; John Cochran, a demagogue; Chris Darden, a 'model minority'; and of course, Marcia herself, a tough, chivalrous, and yet compassionate professional. Whether these characterizations are truthful or distorted is for the academics; but Marcia's strong personality came through in the book and transports the reader back to the anxieties and fears we all experienced throughout that restless year.It is very amusing, to say the least, that to Marcia the whole world seems to form one big conspiracy against her. The press, the criminalists, the cops, the jurors, the judge, the colleagues, the ex-husband, everybody was terrorizing her life. Then you have the defense team taking every possible cheap shot to upset her plan. One has to wonder if it has ever occurred to Marcia that a real winner in this day and age makes other people play her game, not vice versa.The book adds virtually nothing, except for Marcia's side of her personal life, to what we don't already know. Perhaps the most thought-inspiring thing about the book is Marcia's personal journey through race issues. She claims, for example, to have had no idea of how the black community would react to Mr. Shipp's testimony. Despite her attempt at being open-minded, what she lacks is not the right attitude, but the fundamental understanding of the sufferings of minorities.The views in the book, just like all other books about the trial, might be unsurprisingly 'biased' or selective. But it's great for those who aren't seeking to validate their own opinions or to beat a dead horse. After all, remember, after the trial Marcia has nothing left to lose. The trial is over, and history becomes story-telling. Marcia's own imperfections leave us reflecting on what we've learned from all of this."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I was extremely impressed with the honest approach that Clark and her co-author took to write &quot;Without a Doubt.&quot; The reader gets to know Clark as a person who was, despite how it appeared, intimidated greatly at times by the magnitude of the Simpson Trial. Nonetheless, her character as a compassionate person and capable lawyer are inspiring. The book was gripping and extremely well written. Everything said was said well. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Marcia's book, Without a Doubt&quot; was very good reading. I found it difficult to put down. Sure, she was angry, hurt and disappointed in the verdict. Wouldn't you be if you spent that much time, energy and sleepless nights on a case, let alone this case. I give Marcia credit for doing what she did. The only thing I fault her for is letting the judge run over her and her team. Judge Ito, you should be ashamed of yourself. &quot;Without a Doubt&quot; is a book which is full of facts and behind the scene tidbits about the &quot;Trial of the Century&quot;. As was asked by another reader, what happened to Judge Ito???"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Throughout the entire trial of O.J. Simpson, I refused to believe that&quot;he&quot; did it.

Her candor,her humor, her frustration and her tears are all easy to share. I finished the finalpage with only one thought........&quot;if only ......&quot;"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I was not a follower of the &quot;trial of the century&quot;. I found it boring and tedious. Two innocent people were dead, but the trial was a circus. Everyone seemed to be playing to the camera. Every night new &quot;authorities&quot; would pop up to comment on the day's proceedings. Every once in a while I would pay small attention to headlines about a certain cross-examination by the defense or the prosecution. To my mind, the biggest fault was with the judge, a little man with an ego way too big. I had a strong dislike for every oily member of the &quot;dream team&quot;. But, I had a strong admiration for Marcia Clark.Only lately have I started to read anything about the trial. I looked forward to hearing Marcia Clark's words. Although I haven't read her book, I did listen to the audio. She's a tough woman. Funny, when women are tough, they are described as &quot;bitch&quot;. Yet, tough men are decisive, gutsy, or sharp. In listening to her speak, I found a sharp, savvy, knowledgeable woman who eventually became frustrated by the circus, and who's only wish was to see justice done. I, too, am a civil servant, and we're always getting shot down as being lazy and un-dedicated. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Some of the hardest workers in the world are civil servants. Marcia Clark showed that. She and her colleagues did their best to steer the trial toward the main issue... two people were dead and the evidence they had showed O.J. Simpson did it. But race and celebrity got in the way.I've read some comments on this book that Marcia blames everyone else for the prosecution not winning and and whines through the whole book. Nothing could be farther from the truth. She readily admitted to the mistakes she and her colleagues made. When she spoke of the defense lawyers' or judge's mistakes, it was in their violation of the law, trial procedures, judicial ethics and just plain good manners. Many times in court, she wanted to scream, but she kept her cool. She did as any mature person would behave. When things make you angry, you have to be calm or you'll look like an idiot and lose all credibility. Funny, I saw the &quot;dream team&quot; act immaturely at times, yet the media dubbed them &quot;incredible&quot;. If Marcia didn't speak up, she was being &quot;timid&quot; or &quot;listening too much to the polls&quot; that said for her to become softer.In the end, a guilty man went free. All I can say to Marcia is... you done good, kid. Remember, what goes around, comes around. You did your best and you're still standing, as you said. O.J. can smile all he wants, but what went around will come around for him, too. Last week he lost his house; it's only the start. He will get his just desserts in the end. I believe that will all my heart. Right now, that's all we who believe he was guilty and the victims' families have."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Marcia Clark did a wonderful job writing this book. Like somebody else said she answered almost all of my questions about the &quot;defendants&quot; trial. I couldn't put this book down. She gave reason on why the prosecution team couldn't submit some of the evidence. That was really what I wanted to know and now I do. She also describes growing up!The trial was the biggest of the centuryand this book is the best of the centur"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"The clue is the testimony of the coroner in July 1994: &quot;the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM&quot;. By August 1994 somebody knew Fuhrman planted the glove (see Steven Singular's &quot;Legacy of Deception&quot;). The 'LA Times' reported on June 7, 1996 that Vannatter collected blood from the victims before the evidence was turned over for analysis.Marcia Clark previously prosecuted twenty murder trials winning all but one (p.2). Teresa Carpenter made this a very readable book.Page 62 says the killer had been in a frenzy to kill Ron Goldman, but killed Nicole swiftly and efficiently. Doesn't this suggest Ron was the target, and Nicole was an innocent bystander? On page 76 she quotes Keith Z. as to stalking by OJ; since they had appeared in public, couldn't someone have tipped off OJ with the news? Didn't Ron Goldman resemble Keith Z. enough to be mistaken for him in the dark? Did this cause Keith Z. to go into hiding for many months afterwards?Page 105 says Nicole's bed had blankets and sheets in a rumpled heap. Would Nicole leave it like that from Saturday night? If not, does this suggest that something else happened? Page 123 says &quot;the FBI found a single Caucasian hair on the glove from Rockingham&quot;. It could not be traced to the victims, or the police officers there. Whose glove was it then?Page 144 discusses asking for the death penalty: &quot;it would have been immoral to seek his death&quot;.Pages 240-1 tell of the strategy to use domestic violence. &quot;One, to strip the jury of their illusions about the defendant; two, to give us the opportunity to present a compelling motive for murder&quot;. In other words, if you can demonize the defendant, then it'll be easier to convict him. Note that there is no question of actual guilt here. Page 242 claims Paula Barbieri left a &quot;Dear John&quot; message for OJ that fatal Sunday. But other books say she visited OJ in jail regularly.Marcia speaks highly of Allan Park, the limousine driver. He arrived at 10:22, but saw nobody until 10:53 (p.369). He left for the airport after 11PM. His testimony convinced the jury to vote &quot;not guilty&quot;.On page 396 she talks about the odds for a match on DNA, &quot;one in 57 billion&quot;. Doesn't she know that these figures are made-up and have no scientific basis? Read &quot;Tainted Evidence&quot; for the details.Pages 405-8 tell of the attempt to have OJ try on the killer's gloves. Later, a new pair of gloves were produced, they fit perfectly. New gloves fit snugly, but after wearing they develop a looser fit. Here new gloves fit easily, but older worn gloves are too tight? Something's wrong here!Page 411 tells of the Silga sole that was sold to Bruno Magli (and other shoe manufacturers). No one could locate any store, salesman, witness, or receipt that would show OJ bought a pair of Bruno Magli shoes.On page 413 she says you &quot;can see the similarities between the defendant's head hair, for example, and what the killer left behind&quot;. Similar-looking hair is NOT proof they're the same. Read the book &quot;Tainted Evidence&quot; for more details.Pages 437-441 describe what happened when the Fuhrman tapes surfaces, like a 'deus ex machina'. Page 451 tells of Fuhrman's testimony: to be convicted of perjury, the lie had to be material to the case. If he lied about racial slurs, it was not material to the murders. But if he planted evidence, then he had the right against self-incrimination.On page 463 she says OJ needed &quot;time to wash himself up, wash off the blood, change the clothes&quot;. But no bloody clothes or shoes were found at Rockingham, nor was any blood found in the drains. To believe OJ guilty you must believe that he quickly disposed of the bloody shoes, clothes, and knives so they would never be found, yet kept one glove and both socks!"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Despite its almost-500-pages length, this book is a very quick read for anyone familiar with the Simpson trial. And you better already be familiar with the trial before reading this book, because the book focuses on the trees and largely misses the forest. The world revolves around Marcia, and Marcia's always right.The book contains plain misrepresentations of fact -- such as the time Clark told the court that she \\"needed to be home to care for her children.\\" In fact, she WANTED to be the one to drive them to her husband's home that night, but her husband could just as easily have picked them up at her house. What that misrepresentation got the prosecution was an extra weekend to prepare for Rosa Lopez' testimony.How did Clark first fix on the fact of O.J.'s guilt? \\"I had prosecuted literally thousands of defendants. I could feel a clench in my gut when I realized we had the right man.... That familiar twist in my stomach confirmed it.\\" Apparently she still doesn't see that the technical facts the prosecutors put in front of the jury don't matter if the evidence was presented in such a way that the jury didn't understand that the prosecution team had made \\"a point.\\" Nor does she \\"get\\" that Furhman was sank, in large part, because she didn't object to Bailey's misleading questions on Fuhrman's cross-examination, where Bailey flipped back and forth between asking Furhman if Fuhrman had \\"addressed\\" anyone with the n-word, or if Furhman had ever \\"used\\" the n-word -- two very different things.She proudly describes herself as the \\"lead prosecutor,\\" but when mistakes in the investigation and presentation of evidence come up, they aren't HER responsibility -- it's always someone else's fault.She doesn't see that although her experience in the trial was intense, it wasn't unique. Many of her readers have also gone through similar experiences. For example, she says, \\"Fact of the matter is, Chris Darden and I were closer than lovers. And unless you've been through what we went through, you can't possibly know what that means.\\" (p. 374) Perhaps she really thinks no one else has felt an emotional tug toward a co-worker during an intensive project, but that frankly shows her lack of perspective on reality.Better books on O.J. include Toobin's The Run of His Life, and Bosco's A Problem of Evidence."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I couldn't put the book down, it had me that totally captivated. To read what Marcia went through with the case and her own life impressed me. You get to know her as a compassionate women, who values her family, friends and her job.And puts everything she has into each. Good luck to you. And I am happy to see her back on Geraldo."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I just finished the book, and it is a compelling record of Marcia Clark's perspective of the \\"Trail of the Century\\". I found it riveting, and fast paced compared to the trail itself. She offers insight to otherwise esoteric and detailed exhibits of proof, and I hope she writes about other famous trails, or should I say travesties of justice? A must read, for anyone who followed the trail..."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"It sounds trite but the truth is that I found this book so riveting I could not put it down. You can feel that the process of writing this book was cathartic and absolutely essential for the author's sanity! This is so much more than a book about the O.J. trial; it is a soul-baring memoir filled with insights on the human condition. The writing is honest, very personal and infinitely entertaining with lines we can all identify with like, \\"I was so high on hope not even common sense could bring me down.\\" Thank you, Marcia Clark, for fighting with every ounce of strength for what you thought was right! It's so true, it's all we can ever do.I highly recommend this book!--Suza Francina"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Not only an inspriration to women, but to all men and womenwho strive for principle, integrity, and honesty. She is to becommended for her back breaking efforts for justice in the face of insurmountable odds. And, if that were not enough, she managed to face heart wrenching self discovery issues, that by themselves are life altaring for any man or woman! What an ironic sideline that this truly tragic and historical event in American history was the stepping stone to her hard fought battle to self acceptance and happiness. Fate has it's mysterious reasons and results. Way to go Marcia! We love you! I only wish there were a way to send this message personally to this person of such integrity."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Since I was predjudiced against the author, I wasn't surprised to find the book a stinker. You have a better coverage of the evidence in books by Rantala, Lange/Vannatter, Bugliosi, Fuhrman. Here and there I did glean a new fact. For example on page 17 we learn that Burt Luper is a black detective. Some of the more conspiratorial Simpson fans on the Internet have accused Luper of being an evidence planter. The major problem I have with the book is that it takes the same point of view on just about all issues that Marcia had during the criminal trial. She learned nothing in the interim. For example she still defends not using the Bronco chase evidence. On page 191, we read:&quot;Worse, if we introduced the Bronco evidence, it would give the defense an opening to slip in the records of the calls Simpson had made from his cell phone while motoring up the 405. We'd get the tape of Tom Lange talking him in off the freeway, telling him what a wonderful guy he was, how his children needed him; in the background, we'd hear Simpson's groans of anguish. We'd get a parade of witnesses who would recall the tearful protestations of innocence and grief&quot;.What she doesn't say, of course, is that the Bronco chase was effectively used in the civil trial without the defense having any such counter. They had no recordings of his protestations of innocence. She just can't own up to the fact that the defense bluffed her out of using some very powerful evidence.One interesting thing was that Marcia could play the piano by ear at age 6. However she &quot;was a nervous, fidgety kid and had a hard time sitting still long enough to practice&quot; and she &quot;wouldn't have to bothered figuring out how to read music&quot;. I think this is a good metaphor on her approach to just about everything. Unfortunately for the cause of justice, the Simpson case required a prosecutor who could actually perform the music well."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"The verdict of the jurors still haunts me, and the expression on Marcia Clark's face, as she looked each juror in the eye as they announced their decision, is something that I will live with for the rest of my days. How could they be so blind....and stupid? I was very impressed with Marcia throughout the entire trial. I thought she was so professional and covered all extremities- but I cannot understand her choice of jurors. Several of these people were of the same race as the murderer and others were so 'hooked' on his fame that it would have been impossible to obtain a guilty verdict. Why were there not a greater number of intellectual people on the jury who would have understood the scientific evidence? The fact that only 1 in 57 billion people can have the same DNA (with only 5 billion people in the world) would suggest to even the most academically 'challenged' individual that OJ was there at the scene of the horrific murders. The mountain of evidence illuminated by this terrific lady and her prosecution team highlights the gross injustice to the 2 families involved. I agree with Marcia when she criticises Judge Lance Ito for his unprofessional bias towards the defense, allowing them to constantly interrupt and throw red herrings into the circus ring, which is what it became eventually. This man was terrified of Johnny Cochrane, and that became very obvious as the trial came to a conclusion. I didnt really understand, though, why Marcia did not introduce the Bronco car chase as evidence, as a false beard, passport and a lot of money, are not items one takes to a graveyard to visit a recently deceased wife! Also, why did Nicole not have her home under surveillance camera, like many Americans do- especially as she knew she was going to be attacked by her ex husband...and she did know it.? I have become even more engrossed in this trial since the outcome and agree with the expression 'trial of the century"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"An interesting book which sheds light on why the proscution lost its case. Marcia Clark comes off as an intelligent workhorse with the usual mix of good and bad qualities (I run into women who are like her every day). And in the Simpson case, judging from this book, she and Darden were simply out of their leagues.Admitting personl fault, moving past instinct to facts, recognizing the importance of salesmanship, these are important traits for success in any situation. The book depicts Ms. Clark as having been overwhelmed from the begininng, so lost in the thicket she never developed the persepective it took to take a complicated case and win. One shouldn't expect her to write a book where she admits she blew it but that's the impression I got after wading through all 500 pages.Lastly, who thinks we got the real truth about her relationship with Darden, her nervousness at being trust into the celebrity spotlight, her adjustment to attention, money, and fame, which accompanied her role in the OJ Simpson trial? For a case which was fought on a battleground of versions of truth it would have been refreshing if she'd offered complete candor about how her life was turned upside down. My hunch, she doesn't recognize the concept."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This is a whining, snippish, shallow, put the blame on everybody else book written by a woman who seems to possess all these qualities and then some! Her attempts to explain why critical evidence in this case (especially the police interview with Simpson the morning following the murders and the contents of Cowlings Bronco after the slow speed chase) was not introduced are self serving and weak, since apart from the DNA and blood evidence, they were the strongest links in the chain of extremely incriminating evidence which pointed to NO ONE BUT SIMPSON. As for the Mark Fuhrman issue, by virtually ignoring him and hoping he would go away instead of fighting this underhanded defense tactic with every breath in their bodies and every weapon at their disposal, she and the other members of the prosecution HELPED the defense turn the trial into a racial issue.You can't put the blame for the not guilty verdict entirely on the shoulders of the jury, Marcia. You must take a look in the mirror and acknowledge your own responsibility. You didn't fight for justice in this case as hard as you should have. You gave up way too soon, and you let the rest of the DA's office down, the state of California down, right thinking people down, the Brown and Goldman families down, and most of all, you let Ron and Nicole down."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"It wouldn't have mattered who prosecuted this case. The jury were never going to convict OJ after the race card was played.Pretty good account of the trial, and an interesting insight into the author's ordeal in handling such a nightmarish case. She lays into Judge Ito & the cyncical tactics of Cochrane.You come away doubting that the jury system really delivers justice."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Reading this book eight years after the trial, I can't help wondering if the DA's office realized they had to try Simpson against great odds and Marcia Clark was then an unknown. If they expected to win, would they have assigned a more senior, experienced, media-savvy DA?We'll never know. But, as Clark points out in several places, police, judge and prosecutors gave OJ unique advantages. He appeared at the \\"site visit\\" unencumbered by chains and the judge may have been awed by the status of the defense lawyers.Regardless, Clark \\"caught\\" the case and she wanted it. I don't think she wanted glory. She wanted a challenge. And she makes sure we understand she wasn't given the resources to meet that challenge effectively.Clark didn't have control of the courtroom. For example, a media consultant gratuitously offers to \\"help.\\" His insights, Clark says, were useless. Yet he gets a seat at the courtroom table, thanks to Clark's boss.And unlike private lawyers, Clark had limited options for co-counsel. She was assigned a \\"partner\\" who was competent but not strong -- he was out sick every time a tough witness came up.Some reviewers say Clark used this book to excuse herself. To some extent, that's true. She does come across as strident and even whiny in places.However, she does have something to whine about. She had only two months to prepare for trial -- circumstances totally beyond her control. She didn't have a chance to get close to the victims and they didn't want her to. The Browns had depended on OJ for money so naturally their feelings were mixed.After reading books by OJ jurors, I suspect Marcia Clark misunderstood the effects of jury stress and failed to read the jurors' body language. She writes that the jury didn't seem to be paying attention -- yet the Simpson jurors were treated like prisoners themselves, subject to random search and little outside stimulation. Some were literally going mad.There are numerous first-hand accounts of jurors who say, in deliberations, \\"I don't care how this comes out. I want to go home.\\" I can't help wondering if the OJ jurors shared those feelings.Of course, there's no doubt that OJ's resources allowed him to challenge police evidence that typically would be ignored. And Clark herself admits she ignored focus groups that suggested jurors just didn't like her style.Whatever the story, Clark landed on her feet, her privacy gone but a new career awaiting her. Apparently she got four million dollars for this book. Not a bad consolation prize."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This is a poorly written book. Its more about her and her feelings than the evidence and trial strategy. I was hoping she would defend herself against Bugliosi's critical comments in &quot;Outrage,&quot; but she virtually ignored them. Perhaps because there is no defense."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I would have paid triple for this book! Good luck in future endeavors, Marcia.

Unfortunately Hoag has the luxury of providing a more agreeableending to her stories. Marcia Clark provides answers to a lot of questions and does it in an open and honest way. And, even knowing how this sorry tale ends up, I had a hard time putting the book down. I've bought two copies of this book and have a long waiting list of people who want to read them. I doubt any of them will be disappointed. I do think the reaction to this book will be based on the readers general attitude towards Marcia Clark and strong women in general. That's been apparent in some of the other comments I've read here."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Judging from the other comments, most reviewers were like thejuror's: They made up their minds who to believe without giving herbook a real reading.I was always curious about why there were so many black women on the jury, why was it held in an area that had a large proportion of undereducated people from which to draw from, the glove incident, Fuhrman testimonies, why no mention of the Broncho freeway chase, etc. She answered most of my questions (she didn't really say much about the suicide note and (shame on me for wanting to know!) the entire story between her and C. Darden though). It was a very enjoyable book that I couldn't put down until I finished it!^MThe only other question I have now is what happened to Lance Ito? Is he still a judge???"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This was a compelling story written from her point of view.

Never before has one been paid so much to say so little and point fingers at so many. It seems Ms. Clark should do a little house cleaning of her own instead of going to town on &quot;The Dream Team,&quot; Mr. Darden, and Judge Ito. Admittedly, they all played their parts but Ms. Clark has the audacity to say that she knew the case couldn't be won from the questionairre process of jury selection. If that's so, what business did she have going forward as one of the lead prosecutors? I'm sure there must have been someone in the DA's office who could have mustered up the positive energy and tenacity to believe that this case could be won. Ms. Clark not only comes off arrogant and bitter, she comes off misinformed, ignorant, and lacking any real or meaningful perspective on a case she spent years living. Her revelations (or lack thereof) are a mile wide and an inch deep. And it is a sad commentary that one cannot learn from their failures. Where is the silver lining? The nugget of wisdom after such an ordeal? It seems that Marcia Clark could learn a thing or two from Vincent Bugliosi in his book, &quot;Outrage.&quot; But then, she'd have to actually listen to someone other than her own press."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"This is a touching story of a woman who wants justice and a woman who didn't get it. I am quite a young person so I did not follow the case as well as others, but when I read this book I understood the dissapointment. I never realized how much Macia Clark and her team went through and how much evidence they had. I did not realize how horribly unlawful Lance Ito was and how the Dream Team used him. There were parts in this book that made me so mad I felt like yelling, finding one of the Dream Team members, and smacking them in the face. There were parts where I felt like decking the jury, and there were parts where I just wanted to kick Lance Ito off the chair. The Dream Team somehow turned the case from the conviction of a double-murderer to crap. They used information that was completely irrelevent, and...just READ THE BOOK and you will understand. I cried at the end, for what Macia went through and the verdict she got is devestating. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I listened to the audio version of her book. I put on headphones with tape #1 and headed out for my walking exercise. 2 hours later I'm still intently listening (and walking). She puts a lot of emotion into her reading.

I know I do. From that moment on I was riveted to the O.J. Simpson case, a drama that was slowly unfolding, slowly gaining steam. Each passing day brought more tabloid coverage, more drama, more controversy. Then the criminal trial which began in January 1995 was the best show in town. It lasted nine long months and seemingly every day had a new twist, a new controversy. The O.J. Simpson case was fascinating because all the elements were there -- celebrity, Hollywood, race, interracial marriage, an allegedly botched forensic investigation, accusations of police corruption, this case had it all. It divided the nation.I find Without A Doubt (1997) by Marcia Clark (with Teresa Carpenter) a well written account of Clark's experience as the lead prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial in 1995. Clark writes not only about the period of time between June 12-13, 1994 and October 3, 1995, but also gives us a sort of semi-autobiography. This book goes beyond just the facts (and opinions) in regard to the case. Clark opens up her life and lets the reader in. She has strong opinions on some of the key players in the whole O.J. saga, such as Judge Lance Ito, the Dream Team, criminalist Dennis Fung, LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman, fellow prosecutor Christopher Darden, and many more. The book also features quite a few black and white photographs.Clark received some criticism for taking a year and a half to write this book, but it came out great. If you're up for a good read on the O.J. Simpson case from a key player in the proceedings, then Without A Doubt is highly recommended. It will take you back to that period of time in the mid-1990s when the nation was obsessed with the so-called \\"Trial Of The Century\\"."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Anyone remotely interested in the infamous \\"trial of the century\\", also known as the \\"O.J. Simpson Trial\\", must read Marcia Clark's book \\"Without a Doubt\\". After the verdict was handed down on October, 1995 nearly everyone involved with the tril from lawyers to members of the families involved rushed to get out their own books detailing their own versions of the double murder trial. Marcia Clark published her own book, really the last one on the trial last, and it is really the best of the lot.Clark was the lead prosecutor in the trial and in her book she documents how O.J. got off, what went wrong with her team in getting a guilty verdict, and the aftermath of the trial. She leaves no stone unturned and discusses who she felt were telling the truth on the stand and who was there to garner their own fifteen minutes of fame and how ultimately the trial became a media circus with its own cast of characters. She also makes it clear that the trial became the trial of O.J. and not a trial about two innocent people who lost their lives clearly at his own hands.A remarkable and brave book, \\"Without a Doubt\\" will make you realize even if you think the verdict was truthful that the man (who is currently serving time in prison for another case) is indeed guilty of a double homicide."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Didn't think I'd be interested in this book because I was not interested in O.J. Simpson,however, her book was more than just about O.J. Very interesting and very well written. Would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"Happened upon this book just before Simpson's recent comeuppance - what goes around comes around - sentence. It is an excellent account by the prosecuting attorney on the against all odds obstacles she and her team faced during this murder trial : inept police follow up, a wet-behind-the ear judge and a mostly black jury whose sole concentration during this trial focused on the irrevelant question of racism. The not guilty verdict rocked the world and must surely have divided the races of the USA back to the days of civil rights."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I read four books after the trial. I read the Schiller 1000 page saga, Outrage, the present book and a book on Johnny Cochrane. Each book was different and gives us different insights.I think it is clear to any reasonable and unbiased thinking person that O.J. did in fact kill Nicole and Ron and it is just as it is clear that Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK. Also it is clear from the other reviewers that Marcia Clark evokes a certain emotional response that colors their view of the book. If you still think O.J. is innocent then I think that is a personal problem or internal devil that you must deal with but it is not related to reality. As the title says \\"Without a Doubt\\" he was guilty.Johnny made buckets of money as a criminal attorney. Both he and Shapiro could make sums of money in hours that only the rest of us can dream about. Johnny drove a Rolls and Shapiro rubbed elbows with the LA movers and shakers.Marcia is more like the average citizen, working for the DA's office, probably driving a Chevrolet or Honda. She was a single divorced mother that commutes to work. After the trial she had decided enough was enough, and she wrote the book along with everyone else. And I say good for her! Make a buck or two! Its America.Now for the book. It is what you might expect. It is the story of her involvement with the trial. It presents some prior background on her life and earlier trials and then goes in detail through the O.J. saga and what it was like from her perspective. I think is a well written book and for the most part entertaining. \\"Outrage\\" is a bit more gripping and Schiller's \\"American Tragedy\\" longer and more comprehensive. But this book is what we would expect. It deals mainly with her role and it is a solid job. She was basically a civil servant and she was the front \\"man\\" facing a raft of America's most famous lawyers including the above mentioned plus F. Lee Bailey. Then to complicate things, the whole mess was presided over by the star blinded Judge Ito. Together they faced essentially 12 black female jurors who loved Johnny and O.J.Could she win? \\"Without a Doubt\\" she could not win, but it was nothing to do with her.Recommend. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Without a Doubt","review":"I always believed that O J Simpson turned his ex-wife and Ron Goldman into a Pez dispenser, however unless you read the book, you've only got half the story.

She had an uphill battle not only in the courtroom."},{"Title":"Travels With a Hungry Bear: A Journey to the Russian Heartland","review":"I enjoyed this book.In America we take food for granted, it is always around. Whether in a book store or a baseball game, at the Grand Canyon or in a church we assume the availability of food: the ubiquitious coffee shop, restuarant, or snack bar. We may not have money, we may worry about the calories, but never do we fear the possibility that food simply may not exist at a given place and time. It is inconceivable that we could actually be somewhere, hungry, and no matter our wealth or stature not be in a position to have food.Such a circumstance was common in the USSR, it is the meaning of 'shortages'. This book explores some of the dirty details behind soviet farming and it's constant shortfalls. How quotas encouraged destructive practices, and how corporate structure is unfit to manage the routine uncertainties inherent in a farm.This isn't the whole story of course, experiencing the USSR in 1989 is like watching only the last \\"Matrix\\" movie. You'd know why the series died, but wouldn't understand why it ever lived. Was the USSR always so backwards?

It has some good ideas, and the project sections in the beginning of the book are very complete. However, the second half of the book is a different story. As you are rushed through the carvings, critical details and views are left out, some of the directions become unclear and confusing due to a poor flow in writing and bad use of verbiage, and the authors even contradict themselves on their woodcarving techniques. If you are a beginning woodcarver, be wary, you might end up a bit lost.

So in depth, in fact, that I am actually sitting down just to study it, with no distractions!Richard Box has written a very informative book that looks at all aspects in design of embroidery and needlework, with both practical and observing exercises in each section.At the end of the book, you will be able to confidently sit down and design an embroidery by yourself, and may be hooked on doing so.The author puts his aims best himself in the Introduction when he says\\"\\"Your exclaimation \`I feel happer with a needle in my hand' may become \`I now feel happy with a pencil in my hand too'.\\"The book is full of pictures of embroidery, and other textile arts, with a technical look at the elements of the design that they have in them.Well done Richard, I say."},{"Title":"Color and Design for Embroidery","review":"The title of this book is rather deceptive in that you certainly don't need to be adventurous or daring to find this book helpful. I do sedate landscapes and found his book an excellent guide. Basically, if you do the least bit of original design in your work - altering an element or two, changing colors around - or if you do whole original works (but haven't actually gone to art school) this book is extremely useful. It covers the basics of design and color with a focus on the embroiderer or fiber artist. You can do all the suggested activities in the book in order as a complete design course, or pick and choose sections as needed. If you wonder why some of your works look great and others look, well, not as great, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Color and Design for Embroidery","review":"I am an artist who likes to embroider, and I already design my own embroidery, but I purchased this book hoping to pick up a few tips on making my embroidery design more effective - varying stitches, shading, actual information about embroidery design. This is not only not that, it is completely useless. Think of this as a course syllabus (not a course, just an outline) on the basic principles of design like color, line, composition, tension, etc that has a few uninspired pictures of embroidery. There's nothing embroidery specific or about designing embroidery, or interesting and unexpected ways to use color in embroidery. Actually, there's no substance of any kind about either embroidery, color, or design, and there most definitely is not anything practical. From the color section: \\"Orange, like red[,] is generally warm, positive and exciting. It is thought to be a proud color...\\" It's a proud color is not a statement of any value, but that's more or less what you're going to get from this book.If you're an embroiderer who is new to design, don't buy this book. Buy a book, any book, on the basic fundamentals of design. Buy a short book or a long book depending on how much information you want, but get a real design book. They might tell you something about color and design that is more helpful and substantive than the fact that blue and yellow make green, or that lines can be of varying thickness. I have lots of books that I buy just for the pictures, and I love close looks at embroidery and textiles, but not even the pictures are good. The embroideries featured are mostly outstandingly mediocre, and used as references for the concepts outlined in the book - but really inane references like, this embroidery has curved and straight lines. A child could tell you that for free.Edited to add: I took one course on design fundamentals and color mixing in college, and that was mostly a studio course, not lecture, so it's not like I am any authority on design. I don't have much knowledge above a beginner level, and as an artist I am mostly self taught. The issue here isn't that I have an advanced knowledge of design and therefore did not find a beginner book useful, it's that the book offers no substance."},{"Title":"Clerical Error: A True Story (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"A very open and honest book of one mans life destroyed by someone that everyone trusted and loved.I can imagine the author has carried this sadness and yes perhaps bitterness most of his life. The worst part of carrying something like this is the fact that no matter how good or honest or how well someone knows you, (even all of your life) someone else who is so charming and enthralling like Father Malachi, can convince others YOU are the one lying and they will doubt you but believe them.Those are the tools a sociopath uses. Fr. Malachy Martin used others in any way or fashion to serve his own ends. From the church, to the women he abused, to the friends he deceived, to the loyal listeners or readers of he himself. Now none of what he said or wrote is believable to me.I wasn't shocked about some of the goings on within the church, that's life, but to go as far as a mental institution for the author?? to go 'that' far? Let alone to find out who the main antagonist was, Fr. Malachy Martin; a well beloved (up till now) and well known priest and the dastardly deeds that lurked deep within him. THAT was the shock!I've read most of Fr. Martins books and thought of him as this wonderful Irish grandfatherly type, a wise man figure who knew much of the interior workings of the vatican. I now believe that most of what he spouted definitely was his own political agenda. I guess I've been as duped as the author was and glad to have my eyes opened about Fr. Martin's true personality. This book shows how easily we can all be deceived.What a tragedy Mr. Blair suffered, not only the adultery, the loss of his wife and children, but the horrendous loss of support from his own peers in the church who knew him so well, yet didn't believe him and chose to believe Fr. Martin.I will say that the background of Blairs life in the seminary at times was just a little too long of tooth and drawn out, though I did find it interesting, but half way through is when it became fascinating and I couldn't put it down till I finished it. I know of one illustrious name in particular in the book that lent absolute credence to the whole book for me and I believe it to absolutely true, no doubt in my mind. Good book, good read, and if you want to know how a sociopath's mind works and manipulates, this is one of them from a personal viewpoint."},{"Title":"Clerical Error: A True Story (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"Robert Blair Kaiser, who brilliantly made his mark as the principal Time correspondent covering the First Session of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), describes his memoir as coming-of-age stories, his own and that of the Catholic Church at Vatican II. Sadly, as much as Kaiser has grown up, and moved on with his life despite personal tragedy, the institutional Church might be characterized as stuck in arrested development, still mired in sexual scandals that have bankrupted dioceses and tarnished the image of the priesthood and religious life. This book directs trenchant criticism of the Church on matters of sexuality.The first two parts of Kaiser's book take enjoyable excursions, first through the life of a Jesuit novice and scholastic in the 1950s--considerably different, I can tell you, from my experience as a Jesuit novice in the early 1980s. Kaiser was a Jesuit for ten years, leaving before being ordained a priest. He describes what it was like to undergo Jesuit formation in the years before Vatican II, some of his experiences being quite humorous, and some of them darkly foreshadowing later crises. The second part of the book details Kaiser's post-Jesuit foray into journalism, eventually leading him to Rome as a Time correspondent just as Vatican II is called. Kaiser's religious background, social skills, and curiosity prepare him well to deliver the inside story of Vatican II to readers in the United States and United Kingdom; only The New Yorker's pseudonymous Xavier Rynne (Francis X. Murphy) had as much if not greater impact on the English-speaking world's encountering the revolutionary spirit of the Council.The third and greater part of the book tragically recounts the dissolution of Kaiser's marriage. As Kaiser becomes increasingly absorbed with the Council and with his related personal successes (his book on the Council wins high acclaim), and so abandoning his young family for days and weeks at a time, his wife Mary turns to one of his friends, the Jesuit priest Malachi Martin, for solace and companionship. In time, Kaiser begins to suspect that Mary and Martin are having a sexual relationship. Some of Kaiser's other friends, however, feel that Kaiser is paranoid, that he has been overworking and is losing his grip on reality. They go so far as to direct Kaiser to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. In time, Kaiser (who, as the narrative makes clear, has his own moral failings) finds evidence that Mary has been using birth control pills during his long absences; later he obtains copies of Martin's scandalous letters to his wife. He is finally vindicated when Martin's superiors begin to accept, all too late, Martin's culpability in the affair.If this sounds like a pot boiler, it certainly reads like one. The emotions are raw, and Kaiser's actions almost vindictive. (Mary, who is as culpable, fares better than Martin.) Indeed, if not for Kaiser's impeccable credentials as a journalist, and the independently raised concerns about Martin's morals and ethics in other situations, one might be tempted to shrug off this account as simply Kaiser's biased personal perspective at best and fantasy at worst. Kaiser's story rings all too true to let Martin and, for that matter, those who protected him, off the hook.Apart from this sordid affair, Kaiser's account raises troubling questions about the institutional Church's ability to grapple reasonably and effectively with matters involving sexuality. From the tragic and harmful effects of repressed sexuality among some clergy and religious to its controversial handling of the birth control issue in the 1960s the institutional Church has been desperate to uphold its bulwark of moral certitude in matters of sexuality. Meanwhile, for decades, the People of God have largely been drifting from a Church that has been prone to just say \\"No\\" on most matters of sexuality while appearing widely and flagrantly hypocritical when it comes to the sexual failings of the clergy and religious.In Kaiser's view, the institutional Church discourages the People of God from thinking for itself. It was his ability to recognize that for himself that allowed Kaiser to finally grow up. (The reader notes with caution, though, that Kaiser's view of women in this book has usually to do with their sexual attributes and not much more. This does a disservice to his claim.) But encouraging the People of God to think for themselves is only half the answer (and is happening anyway, with deleterious effect as far as religion is concerned); the other, more difficult challenge ahead for the Church is moving towards a more positive embracing of sexuality, to become a Church that says \\"Yes\\" on matters of sexuality and of love in a healthy and responsible environment. Ultimately this will mean deeply reexamining, in the light of contemporary science and the actual, lived experiences of heterosexual and homosexual men and women, basic questions about sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, and marriage and sexual expression in the context of faith and morality. The Church will also need to review current proscriptions that currently serve as barriers to people's exercising their faith in the context of the Church. Finally, the Church will need to do a better job at communicating its message, following up on positive statements made by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI."},{"Title":"Clerical Error: A True Story (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"Clerical Error is a very interesting book. There is not a single Catholic interested in Vatican II that would not love it. Kaiser either met or knew every person of note involved in Vatican II.He tells all about himself as a young pre-Vat II husband and he admits to being somewhat less than noteworthy. Indeed, he was a wretch. His knowledge of how to love and how to show love to the beloved was sorely lacking. He was pitiful. He does not deny this fact. It is no wonder that his wife, Mary, took up with the odios priest, Fr. Malachy.Kaiser was undeniably naive. He was also undeniably self-confident and cocky. His note-worthy friends were equally naive regarding the feminine gender. How pitiable it is to realize that men such as they rule the Catholic Church and they are the ones who make the rules for the rest of us to live by. What a farce. They preach as though they know the mind of God. Yet, they know nothing of love, in depth love, intimate love. And they do not even realize that they know nothing except what they read.

He finds love and the story peaks with a kaleidoscope of famous names and fascinating people in a setting of the Church and the city of Rome. It culminates in fascinating revelations of naivete and pathological intrigue. You can tell the author was a Time reporter, since you cannot put the book down."},{"Title":"Clerical Error: A True Story (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"From TheHistory of Vatican II by James Hitchcock:Time magazine, which was a much more influential journal then, than it is now, was represented at the Council by a reporter whose name was Robert Blair Kaiser. He had been at one time a Jesuit. He was not a priest but he had been a Jesuit, had studied for the priesthood, and was therefore somebody who knew something. He wasn't an ignorant man who had to learn it all from scratch; he was fairly sophisticated in religious matters. But Robert Blair Kaiser's reporting was very much along the same lines as that of Xavier Rynne, the good-guy liberals versus the bad-guy conservatives. Every day there was a shootout at the O.K. Corral over some issue or other. Fortunately most of the time the good-guy liberals managed to disarm the bad-guy conservatives. They shot the guns out of their hands. But unfortunately the bad-guy conservatives kept getting more guns, and so there would be another shootout maybe a week or two later.As it turned out in some of the autobiographical things which he later wrote, Kaiser had a very clear agenda from the very beginning. One major part of that agenda was birth control. He had been poking around in that area and making contact with certain theologians who were privately or secretly supportive of birth control before the Council. He had made contact with certain influential Belgian and Dutch theologians. When he went to the Council he understood that there was a liberal agenda, the modernist agenda as we've called it, and he was going to use his magazine, Time magazine, to push it. And he did so, and very effectively. Unfortunately the average American Catholic, and this includes most priests and most nuns, learned what the Council was all about more from Time magazine and The New Yorker than from any other source.There is a massive failure of education here on the part of the Church. One would assume that given an event like the Council that the hierarchy would have put into gear a massive educational project. They would have been lining up books, they would have been training teachers, they would have been announcing schools, workshops in every parish, whatever. And they would have insured the fact that what was presented to people as the authentic teaching of the Council really was the authentic teaching of the Council. To an amazing degree this task was neglected. There was, in fact, as far as I can see, practically no systematic effort to educate Catholics as to the meaning of the Council. They were left to discern its meaning in just about any way they could. And if they were reading the New Yorker they got it from Xavier Rynne, and if they were reading Time magazine they got it from Robert Blair Kaiser. Some variation on the views of those two men appeared in most of the secular press. So not only did there persist a good deal of confusion as to what the Council was all about, but there was even a completely skewed, even false notion of what it was all about. Victories that could not be won on the floor of the Council itself, victories that could not be ratified in the Conciliar decrees, were won after the Council in terms of what people thought the Council said as opposed to what it actually said. The obligation of obedience was used over and over again to get reluctant people to go along with the Council's changes, until such time as obedience had outlasted its usefulness and then the shift was to independence and freedom."},{"Title":"Clerical Error: A True Story (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"Svengali, Rasputin, Martin.

It was one of my first contacts with social movements literature. Since then, I plug almost everything I read on social movement to the theoretical framework described in this book. I guess the main quality of this book is that the author recognise the contributions made by different schools of thought on social movements and tries to situate them in a larger framework rather then dismiss them. Therefore, anyone working within a specific area of social movement studies can gain something from the reading of this book. However, the major contribution of this book is probably the theorization of the \\"cycles of contentions\\" based on changing political opportunity structure. As the opportunity structure open for a social movement, the movement is on the rise... when it close, for example because of a change in the public opinion caused by a rise in insecurity and violence, the movement disolve. Although a very simple theory, it appers very effective in understanding the rise and fall of social movements.As any student of social movements would argue, this book does not cover all aspect of social movements (e.g. identity, emotions, ...) but Tarrow does leave enough space for other approaches while developing is how theoretical approach to social movements. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics (Cambridge Studies in Comparative Politics)","review":"Aside from some introductory matter on the various schools of thought in social movement research, here Tarrow mostly focuses on the influence of political structures on the formation of popular movements. This includes both external political and social influences, plus developments in the interactions between movements and the states/regimes they are confronting. Tarrow mostly uses movements that have had strong political effects in various nations (mostly Europe) as examples for his theories, and utilizes the concept of \\"cycles of contention\\" to elaborate on the evolution of movements over time. This specialized focus does lead to some interesting results, such as Tarrow's reconstruction of the disparate revolutions in Europe in 1848 as a widespread movement, or coverage of how states can co-opt a movement's message as a means of control. He has a nearly Marxist conception of such trends, but mostly avoids the tiresome pontificating that is usually fostered by Marxist theorizing. Another bonus is the final chapter of the main text, dealing with new phenomena in globalized or transnational social movements. The book does lose steam frequently as Tarrow gets distracted with long histories of the movements he uses as examples (including way too much repetitive information on the 1848 phenomenon), while his generally strong writing does occasionally lapse into diffuse professor-speak, which sadly is unavoidable in this field. But in the long run, this book offers mostly powerful coverage of politicized social movements, and the study thereof.

This book is valuable in that the reader can use Tarrow's arguments to understand the dynamics of current movements. As the previous reviewer noted, Tarrow does leave out some important aspects of social movements, such as emotion, which detracts from his argument.What I disliked about this book was the writing style of the author. It seemed that he was trying to express even the most simple concepts with verbose, pedantic language that made his arguments difficult to understand and distracted the reader from the points he was trying to make. For example, he defines a cycle of contention like this: \\"a phase of heightened conflict across the social system: with a rapid diffusion of collective action from more mobilized to less mobilized sectors; a rapid pace of innovation in the forms of contention; the creation of new or transformed collective action frames; a combination of organized and unorganized participate; and sequences of intensified information flow and interaction between challengers and authorities. Such widespread contention produces externalities that give challengers at least a temporary advantage and allows them to overcome the weaknesses in their resource base. It demands that states devise broad strategies of response that are either repressive or facilitative, or a combination of the two.\\" (Page 142.)The only reason I can fathom that anyone would feel the need to write in such an absurdly inflated style would be if the author's argument and thesis weren't strong to begin with, and the author's intention was to confuse the reader. I think the author could have gotten his point across in a much clearer and concise way. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading it to peruse the sample pages for more examples of the author's style- then decide if you can stomach this book.Overall, good information, but the writing style is ridiculous."},{"Title":"Charismatic Challenge: 4 Key Questions","review":"I am a pastor who is not charismatic, so I am somewhat sympathetic to the author's viewpoints.

John Napier knows absolutely NOTHING aboutCharismatic theology, but yet he tries to debunk it. He completelygives the reader stereotypes, misconceptions, generalizations, and complete prejudices of what Pentecostals believe. This book is fiction...NOT fact. He uses a verse in 1 Corinthians that talks about believers being baptized into one body (the body of Christ) by one Spirit. He uses that verse to try to completely disprove the Baptism in the Holy Spirit doctrine. However, he doesn't do a very good job of it. If he knew anything about Charismatic doctrine in the first place, he would know that Charismatics consider that verse to be talking about a different baptism. Here's the reason. In 1 Corinthians 12, it talks about believers being baptized into the body of Christ BY the Holy Spirit. In John, however, it says that Jesus (not the Spirit) will baptize us IN the Spirit (not Christ). It's reversed roles. These two can't possibly be the same baptism. It must be two separate baptisms if the Spirit baptizes us into Christ, and Christ also baptizes us into the Spirit. Two separate events, two different baptisms. The baptism that Mr. Napier is talking about in this book is what Charismatics call the believer's baptism or the baptism BY the Spirit...NOT the baptism IN the Holy Spirit. Anyway, enough with correcting John Napier's misguided definition of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Back on subject, this is an extremely bad book. If you want an HONEST study of what Charismatics REALLY believe, read a book by someone who is a Charismatic...not an anti-Charismatic like John Napier who knows absolutely nothing about what he's talking about.

It was translated to English from the Russian by Strobe Talbott, who has been Deputy Secretary of State since 1994. Shortly after publication, Khrushchev officially said that he did not write it. However, he only said this out of loyalty to the Communist Party, and there is little doubt as to its authenticity (especially with the information found in formerly secret Soviet archives). This book traces his life from his childhood, his roles during Stalin's reign, his years in power, and how and why he lost power. Getting the Soviet side on events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the schism with China from a man who understands them better than anyone else provides a good balance to what we read in standard Western history books."},{"Title":"Khrushchev Remembers","review":"One of the most interesting books about the USSR history.

Khrushchev is still widely believed to have been the author. He is supposed to have dashed it off one summer and then said to himself, \\"Where will I get this published? Ah! Time-Life!\\" The tapes reached Time-Life, we all read it, and we told ourselves, \\"Isn't that interesting.\\"A little thought should be sufficient to dispel the notion that the KGB would allow Khrushchev to sit in his dacha dictating tape after tape with no interference. He certainly dictated tapes, but the tapes were censored and edited by the KGB, and then a deal was struck between the U.S. and the USSR, after it was decided, at the highest level, that such a book would be mutually beneficial. Brezhnev could use against some of the resistance he was encountering from Stalinist hardliners, and Nixon could use it to increase support for detente.The CIA and the KGB cooperated in carrying out the operation. The tapes were given to the Time bureau in Moscow. Strobe Talbot ... Time's bureau chief in Washington, brought the tapes back with him. I was present in an apartment in which he hid them for a couple of days. The tapes were then translated and a manuscript developed. During this period Time refused to let people who had known Khrushchev personally, including White House staff members, listen to the tapes.Knowledgeable people began to tell me. \\"I don't believe this.\\" \\"There's something mighty fishy here.\\" When they read what Khrushchev was supposedly saying, they were even more incredulous. But the book came out, Khrushchev Remembers, accompanied by a massive publicity campaign. It was a great propaganda accomplishment for the CIA and the KGB....I had written, correctly, that before publication Strobe Talbot had taken the bound transcripts of the Khruschhev tapes back to Moscow, via Helsinki, so that the KGB could make one final review of them. I told Schaechter and Talbot that if they came to me, looked me in the eye, and told me I had the facts wrong, I would take out the section on Khruschhev Remembers. Neither of them ever came by, the paragraphs stayed in my book [CIA and the Cult of Intelligence], and in any event Time went ahead with the two-page spread anyway.As I pointed out in the preface to The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence in 1974, democratic governments fighting totalitarian enemies run the risk of imitating their methods and thereby destroying democracy. By suppressing historical fact, and by manufacturing historical fiction, the CIA, with its obsessive secrecy and its vast resources, has posed a particular threat to the right of Americans to be informed for the present and future by an objective knowledge of the past.

He is also the man who spoke against Stalin after his death and showed the Soviet people what monstrous crimes and recklessness that brought Russia into war with Germany from 1941 - 1945 by way of the Molotov-Ribbontrop alliance agreement which dismembered Poland in Sept of 1939 and which started the world war in Europe.Khrushchev is also the Soviet leader who gave permission to publish the first book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn with his One Day in the Life of Denisovich which provided the world the first glimpse of the horrors of the terrible Gulag system which destroyed million of lives. A fervent atheist and committed Marxist-Leninist who was totally dedicated to the Soviet state he nevertheless could be a charming and persuasive individual. He admits that the propertied classes of the Soviet Union should be eliminated (liquidated) and is one chapter reproaches Stalin for allowing the food shortages in the Ukraine in 1947 be so terrible that parents in famine condition eat their own children to which Stalin merly shugs his shoulders and walks off. Stalin doesn't care one whit about human life of his citizens after all there is no God and since there is no God there cannot be a soul so why should this matter. Much Soviet history is in this book which will interest specialist students of this era especially events in World War II.It is also a story of one person's political survival under immense stress and arbitrary death sentences. Stalin's ways were unpredictable and capricious. Probably this because what Stalin wanted: complete fear for the people so they would become passive like sheep unable to strike back at him. Kruschev mentions that when you met Stalin for a meeting you didn't know whether you would come out alive. He explains the unpredictable paranoia of Stalin and his methods for destroying imagined and real rivals such as Trotsky and other communist party leaders."},{"Title":"Khrushchev Remembers","review":"I have had this book for a long time and never got around to reading it until recently. My reason was that it always got pushed down the queue by something more compelling and it sat for years in my \\"pending\\" purgatory.The memoir is worth reading because it gives another side to the now fading story of the \\"Evil Empire.\\" It's presentation, translated and edited by Strobe Talbot, a long time pro in the diplomatic world comes with all encompassing commentary and detailed notes, by Edward Crankshaw. You gain a view of Khrushchev and the USSR from the other side, a view that even touches on the craziness going on in our own political chaos of 2009.Khrushchev, who denounced Stalin after his death, attempts to leave a trail that absolves him from direct responsibility for the diabolic viciousness of Stalin while standing steadfast in his backing of the horror of Lenin. This all has to be taken with a grain of salt as Khrushchev was very close to Stalin and it appears impossible for him to imply that he was not complicit in the horrors. One has to come away with the conviction that he played along to get along. Indeed, to survive.The relevance to today's world is scary. It has become fashionable for all sorts of brooding conservatives to compare Obama to Lenin, Stalin and Hitler. I have heard the arguments from those I have thought of intelligent. I have read with shock the writings of the self anointed conservative intellectuals who promote this libel. I am amazed how these people with intelligence can be so horribly ignorant to make even a crude analogy.\\"Khrushchev Remembers,\\" is just one of thousands of books and other source material that expose such nonsense for what it is while also providing a historical record, vetted by Crankshaw, that fills in the gaps on an era that was critical to our lives to this day.

At the time this book was published in 1974, he was lauded in the media as the male equivalent of Gloria Steinem; unfortunately, his ideas changed radically after this book (for personal reasons described in Susan Faludi's bookBacklash: The Undeclared War Against American Women), and he went on to write books such asWhy Men Are the Way They Are,The Myth of Male Power,Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap -- and What Women Can Do About It, etc.However, this earlier book is not without value. Here are some quotations from it:\\"But the more I become involved with seeing men change and resist change the more I find that the men who most limit themselves have one thing in common---they cannot listen.\\" (Pg. 9)\\"In my own research, I found men unwilling to give their sons dolls, with no thought that this might help them become better fathers.\\" (Pg. 12)\\"When a discussion or men's and women's liberation starts questioning one stereotype after another, men usually get frustrated: 'Won't there be any differences left?

It is through this need that society can manipulate him.\\" (Pg. 97)\\"Most men say, 'If I don't teach my boy to be a boy, he'll lost his identity. I'll make him insecure.'

Although it's about Kinsey and sex sex sex it actually got sort of redundant and boring. With Boyle's unigue talents I would think he'd be one of the last writers in the world who could make sex boring, but perhaps he was just being faithful to his subject. I was really disappointed."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"T.C. Boyle has a mean pen. In \\"Drop City,\\" he offered a devastating depiction of the \\"turn on, tune in, drop out\\" culture of the 1960's. With \\"the Inner Circle,\\" he homes in on mid-twentieth century sex and mores.Boyle has written several successful novels based on historical characters and events. \\"Water Music,\\" his first commercial success presents a fictionalized portrait of Mungo Park, the 18th century African explorer. \\"Road to Wellville,\\" another great commercial success is set in Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium in Battle Creek, Michigan. \\"The Inner Circle\\" is the fictionalized story of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's study of human sexual behavior.John Milk, a nave student is Dr. Kinsey's first recruit to \\"The inner circle\\" of people who will come to be known as sex researchers. As Milk becomes entwined in the bizarre goings-on of Dr. Kinsey, he also falls in love and marries Iris, the book's moral compass. Kinsey is intent to show that our sexual proclivities and actions are mere manifestations of animal behavior. As the book progresses, the research methods become more and more bizarre, including exhibitionism, voyeurism, homo sex, group sex and so forth.John and Iris Milk's loving relationship, their conventional marriage, and their desire for children provide a counterpoint to the idea that sex is animal behavior pure and simple and that there is no place in our relationships for love. The climax (forgive the phrase) comes when Iris' morality threatens Milk's career.Boyle gives Kinsey the personality of a fanatic. This book can also be read as a morality tale on what happens to those that give fanatics blind loyalty.Boyle is a craftsman with words and phrases. His craft is evident in nearly every paragraph through well chosen and ordered phrases.With Ken Kesey's passing, T.C. Boyle is now perhaps the sharpest novelistic commentator on what it means to be an American. \\"The Inner Circle\\" may not be Boyle's strongest effort, but it is a credible novel and the sex research keeps your interest even when the peripheral characters come off a little flat."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"T. C. Boyle is an amazing writer. The Inner Circle unfolds in the world of the 40's in Indiana. We get the food, the drink, the smell, the cold muddy winters, the baby crying and of course, the sex, the endless sex between the men of the Inner Circle, Prok as they call Professor Kinsey, having sex with the three men of his team in endless succession while they worked on the huge feats of research in virgin territory, researching Americans who turned out to be not as virginal as people thought. Boyle's fine writing shines in this operatic book, we can almost hear Prok's booming voice, calling for our sex history, calling us to bed."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I wonder if T C Boyle had any misgivings concerning his decision to narrate 'first person' through the fictictious John Milk. I wish he had these doubts in the first chapter and then reconfigured the novel as it would have worked better for me if he had used the third person narrative as he did in \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\". John Milk's first person narration really grates due to his weak voice and the events around his marriage were depressingly repetitive and just uninteresting reading.John Milk is obsessed about his work and the fact finding collection of sexual detail which impacts on his relationship with his wife, Iris. Boyle's use of the Zombie Cocktail at the end of the novel, especially if based on fact, is a serious endictment on Kinsey's character, and could be argued as an early example of attempted Date Rape. Kinsey came across as a control freak and possibly a borderline personality.The basic plot is fascinating concerning the collection of facts for the Kinsey Report which is arguably the most pivotal sexual analysis of the 20th Century. I believe that this report was instrumental in breaking down the barriers promoted by Christian, Jewish and Muslim suppression of sexual freedom which they have fastidiously enforced for obvious self-purporting reasons.Potentially, this novel could have been much better but sadly is limited by the extensive Milk element to the plot.Footnote. Bizarrely, this novel was characterised as Gay by the Charing Cross Library. One wonders if they think if a book is about sex then it has to be gay!!"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"When I was growing up I learned a lot from Dr. Kinsey's books which were shelved in between my mother's anthropology textbooks from college, and not that far from the novel Fanny Hill. Mr. Boyle is a very good writer who has a heart, and I felt drawn into the story of the main character, Milk, from the first pages. But here is why I think I enjoyed and got more out of the movie and would, unusually, recommend it much more than Boyle's book. The film, Kinsey, colorfully and creatively presents the sex researcher's work and life against the back drop of prudery, ignorance and fundamentalist Christianity that was guiding (retricting) people's knowledge of their sexuality at the time. It shows the life-long fight Kinsey went through to have this subject allowed to be viewed as part of science. As such the movie highlights Kinsey's courage and the path-breaking nature of his study and shows how it went straight up against the social norms of his day. The movie and this book are timely, they come at a time when Bush and his cronies are trying to drag us back to the days of fundamentalist morality and Kinsey's work is under specific attack. But the book the Inner Circle, is focused so narrowly on the daily lives of Kinsey's group and on Kinsey's shortcomings that I feel his pioneering work is ultimately rendered mundane and lacking, even perhaps cruel and wrongheaded. So the emphasis is way off, IMHO."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Boyle does a great job painting the 1940s and explaining the characters, but in the end I do not like either of them. Where is the protagonist?Kinsey is shown as uncompromising, and yet weirdly inconsistent. He is obsessed with maintaining professionalism yet he parades around in a loincloth! AND he convinces Milk to do the same -- yet the dialogue in which he does that is strangely absent. That revealing bit was something I wanted to read, but, alas, it didn't make the cut. And there are numerous other juicy and \\"human\\" developments that are glaringly skirted over. Yet other more mundane bits are thoroughly covered, making the book less interesting.Is it the scientist in Prok that believes he knows all about the \\"human animal\\" when in fact he is clueless to the human side of those around him? In the end, I cannot understand how Milk was so bewitched by Prok when his narration effectively shows me what a jerk he is. I wish Boyle was able to let me see what Milk sees and why he loves him so."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"As a recent appreciator of TC Boyle's genius I saw the movie Road to Wellville, read the novel and then read Boyle's latest offering, The Inner Circle.Reading The Inner Circle felt like a block of cement was firmly clutched in my hands weighing me down, down, down. I didn't say mill stone around my neck...I meant I voluntarily held onto that armload of cement and allowed it to lower me into that pit of dark, deep, weirdness that is the human animal, Boylestyle.Not only am I a recent Boylie...I am in awe of the way this author fits his work into the appropriate time period and pulls it off...believably.Okay, so the work is about a controversial giant who contributed to society's study of sexual matters. Boyle's fictional character--a made up assistant-- takes the reader into the world or the \\"inner circle\\" and maybe into much more than even the renowned researcher Kinsey would allow us to view;the experimentation and practicing of what was being studied; sex. Similar to the inside of a tornado, the circle spins into itself... stirs things up... and what is discovered isn't always pleasant, but a whirlwind of disturbing possibilities.I am currently reading another Boyle book, Drop City. How does he do it? Don't know, just hope he continues to do, and to be."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Thursday, April 20, 2006\\"The Inner Circle\\" by T. Coraghessan Boyle, 2004\\"This was a sort of dissatisfying book. It is accurate in the general details, as far as I can see. The problem is that the characters are so mangled that you want them to just take a step back and reconsider their position, to see if it is reasonable. The unstable marriage of John Milk is the impetus of most of the action. His marriage does survive, more by gumption than anything else, but the reality of the Kinsey Institute had to be different. I do not see the characters in real life acting like this. Dr. Kinsey was the son of a stern minister, and I do not imagine that even if he felt sex was not anything like he was taught, he still would not necessarily be so free about it as it is portrayed in this story. In fact I do not see that there was as much rampant homosexuality as described herein. Maybe I grew up differently, but in my youth, guys did not play around with each other so much as depicted here. It was possible, but I never was involved in it, and the people I have known, even in the seminary, do not seem to have been involved in homosexual relations like in this book.All in all, I wanted to slap John Milk and have him stand up to Dr. Kinsey and go out and get a life for himself, separate from that institute."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"it is wel written and very good to read. A must"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The very first review by Douglas A. Greenberg hit the nail on the head. On finishing the book I felt Prok was a monster, Milk a wuss, and Milk's wife the only character with balls.As I read thru this novel, it came across too much as autobiographical by a notional participant and seemed to lack a clear fictional focus... I kept asking myself: \\"What's the author's point?\\" but never found an answer. A novelist who only reports life but does not illuminate it shortchanges the reader.Not a satisfying book. I've recently read a few books by Michael Cunningham, and Boyle's book seemed gutless and colorless in comparison."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I look forward to each new novel by T.C. Boyle with great anticipation; he's a gadfly, an iconoclast who can weave a fascinating web of words filled with twists and turns and verbal pyrotechnics. He can be impishly cynical toward social idealism of all types, as clearly expressed in *The Tortilla Curtain* and *Drop City*, but he also can show a softer, more sympathetic side, as demonstrated in what I consider his finest novel overall, *Riven Rock*.As always, Boyle has created a novel that's at the very least, a good read. I devoured this book, cover to cover, almost without stopping, which is a testament to Boyle's ability to write lucid, entertaining prose. There is a noticeably a less manic feel to his writing this time around, however, and it's unclear to me whether this was a deliberate strategy, based on the sensitive nature of his subject matter, or whether instead Boyle found his inspiration just a bit lacking.The fact that *The Inner Circle* deals with Alfred Kinsey and his pioneering work on sex research certainly makes the novel all the more alluring and addictive, I confess. Assuming that Boyle has taken only minor liberties with the actual historical characters of Kinsey and his wife Clara, the book illuminates in excellent fashion the motives, mindset, and methods behind Kinsey's single-minded pursuit of his research. Boyle does (apparently) a fine job of depicting the character and personality of Kinsey, albeit from the virtually uncritical perspective of his narrator, the mild-mannered fictional research assistant, John Milk.Frankly, to me the larger-than-life, hard-charging Kinsey comes across not as a \\"great man of learning,\\" but instead as something of a lunatic, almost a monster, a man with clear psychological pathologies that drive him to pursue his sexual research in a fanatical, single-minded fashion. His research programme seemed to be based on the (to me) absurd proposition that humans are, after all, just like other animals in our basic sexual drive and its various forms of expression except that \\"society\\" \\"interferes.\\" To me, this perspective is based on a fundamentally flawed conception of human nature, one in which an essential animalistic human core is simply overlain with \\"socialization\\" and its attendant hangups. No; more accurately, human beings' most \\"animalistic\\" tendencies and behaviors are permeated through and through by culture, and so to try to strip away \\"socialization\\" to get at the \\"raw sexuality\\" is a project that is doomed not only to fail, but to distort badly the actual nature of human sexuality.That Professor Kinsey (\\"Prok\\") expects his researchers (and their wives!) to drop all emotional associations with their sexuality to the point of partaking in ghastly quasi-public sexual performances reveals not a thoughtful scientific perspective tempered by empathy with his human subjects, but the fanaticism of a veritable sociopath, a bully, a proverbial control freak. If this, in fact, is Boyle's intention in his depiction of Kinsey, he succeeds brilliantly.However, what I found disappointing is that all other characters in the book, including Milk himself, come across as flat, shallow, and unmemorable. By the end of the book the reader knows very little about the inner life and motivations of these people, even as the depths of their sexual lives are plumbed and chronicled, page after page. What struck me as particularly wanting was Boyle's portrayal of the motives and mindset behind the \\"low level\\" homosexual inclinations of Kinsey, Milk, and the other male assistants. Somehow, the way this activity (called \\"H-behavior\\") unfolds and the way that Milk, at least, experiences this doesn't ring true, and ultimately falls flat.Furthermore, despite the often-fascinating passages dealing with the evolution of the Kinsey project, the interactions between Prok, Milk, Clara Kinsey (\\"Mac\\"), Milk's wife, Iris, and the rest of the principal characters, ultimately as a *story* the book moves along rather turgidly much of the time, and ultimately it doesn't really go very far. The climactic scene, centering around conflicts related to Kinsey's megalomaniacal demands related to coerced public sexual performances by his assistants and their wives, is largely much ado about very little. Then, shortly thereafter, the book just kind of ends. I found this a bit disappointing.Overall, this is not Boyle's best effort, but he's such a talented writer that even a near-miss by Boyle is likely to be better than the best writing of most other contemporary novelists. If you've enjoyed his previous books or if you simply suspect that the Kinsey project makes for one heckuva fine subject for a novel, you probably will find *The Inner Circle* a satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I bought this book the day it came out, both because I had liked \\"Drop City\\" so well, and because, hey, a book about Kinsey and sex has to be somewhat interesting. I came away a bit disappointed. This book lacked a real focus. There were moments where this book seemed to make sense and actually managed to be enjoyable, but must of the time, it was rather cold and unlikable.The character of Kinsey himself (\\"Prok\\") was far too flat. It was not clear to me what it was about him that drew his followers so deeply into his inner circle. For the same reasons, I disliked the protagonist, John Milk. Why he followed Kinsey so blindly at the expense of his marriage and happiness is a mystery. The book followed him through his emotional turmoil in a cyclical fashion, with the plot rehashing itself repeatedly with no growth on the part of any characters, with the exception perhaps of Iris, Milk's wife. But Boyle leaves her in the background, definitely a shame.The plot of this book had promise. Kinsey was a fascinating man, and he conducted fascinating research. But Boyle describes the research and the accompanying sexual exploits in either an illusory manner (when it is homosexual sex being discussed, or 'H-behavior') or in a way that is far too medical and sterile to be anything but uncomfortable and boring.Overall, I didn't dislike this book, I just kind of felt like I was reading to finish, instead of for the joy of the book. It's not a bad book, it's just nota very good one. Read \\"Drop City\\" instead to see what Boyle is really capable of."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Having seen the film, \\"Kinsey\\" before I began to read T.C. Boyle's \\"The Inner Circle\\" really helped me to fill in the visual component of Boyle's always fat and juicy prose.Using the docu-fiction form, Boyle riffs on certain known facts of Kinsey's time at IU, his groundbreaking research and uses John Milk as his vehicle into that particular world that Kinsey created during his tenure at Indiana University as a professor of Biology and more importantly as a sex researcher and author.Boyle writes of Milk's entrance into Kinsey-land: \\"That was the moment it all began, though I didn't realize it at the time...how could I? How could I have foreseen that a shallow, manipulative girl I hardly knew would be the motive force that was to lead me to Prok (Kinsey) and Mac (Kinsey's wife), Corcoran, Rutledge, to the desk at which I am now sitting...\\"Boyle paints Kinsey as a kind of Machiavellian, all-knowing leader of his group of researchers and their families: \\"What he (Kinsey) wanted above all else was to gain the sort of intimacy that yields up confidences, and he had a true genius for it---for putting people at ease and bringing them out. Absent it, the project would have never gotten off the ground.\\"Kinsey is a warm, loving person who, as long as you do as he advises, would do anything for you. When Milk's wife, Iris has an affair with another researcher (\\"I knew why she'd done what she had...she'd had one man in her life, just one and I'd had Mac and Prok...\\") Kinsey at first is happy that she has acted out her fantasy. But when Iris decides to leave Milk and live with her lover, John... Kinsey intercedes and the whole situation is diffused. In fact in a scene very much like one between a father and son or a King and his Page, Milk goes to Kinsey not only for consolation and advice but for action and interference: \\"...I love him (Kinsey)...not in the way I love Iris...but in a deeper way, in the way a patriot loves his country or a zealot his God...\\"\\"The Inner Circle\\" is an intriguing read: it is beautifully written as befits a T.C. Boyle book but it is also a strongly, no-holds-barred sexual book as befits it's subject. Don't come to Kinsey-land expecting a bland re-telling of the Alfred Kinsey life story, because you won't find it. What you will find is a passionately thoughtful novel written by one of our major contemporary novelists at the top of his form."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I'm a big fan of TC Boyle but I just couldn't get into this book. His last novel, Drop City, was one of those rare books where the characters are drawn so expertly and their situation so intersting, that the book could go on forever. Unfortunately, this book, The Inner Circle, is none of those things, and only feels like it goes on forever. This is a literary novel where everything is over-described merely for descriptions sake. Take for instance the scene where the two protagonists, John Milk, an assistant to Alfred Kinsey, and Kinsey himself, are interviewing prostitutes out on a city street. The cops come and arrest the pair. Boyle writes \\"...and dropped two conjoined disks of metal over my wrists. In a word, handcuffs.\\" Ten or so words to describe something everybody is already familiar with and can readily visualize, handcuffs, and then goes and uses the word anyway.All that boring detail wouldn't be so bad if the book and the subject matter were interesting. But they aren't. The book keeps Kinsey and his research as a backdrop to what it's really about, a fictionalized character by the name of John Milk who is there from the beginning. We get to see his life in detail, from school, to marriage, to fatherhood and everything in between.This was 400 pages of very well written verbiage with no point to it. It was something that wasn't that enjoyable and which I forced myself to finish."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"What a great concept for a novel. Here we have a young man, John Milk inexperienced in life. He goes to work for an entomologist who has been studying the gall wasp. But with the gall wasp fairly well understood, the entomologist has decided to change his field of study. He's decided to study sex, and his name is Kinsey.When you combine a good concept with a good writer you get a good story. And T.C. Boyle is a good writer. Without telling you too much of the story, the Inner Circle is composed of those researchers who worked close to Kinsey.While this is a novel, it appears that the character of Kinsey is portrayed rather accurately. The book is chiefly concerned with Kinsey's obsessive pursuit of sexual knowledge, but it also comments on the nature of marriage, family and the compromises we make in the hopes of earning love, acceptance, and a living. I shall be surprised if this book doesn't head to the top of the best seller lists."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"TC Boyle is one of the finest storytellers around and his consistent output of never less than fascinating books ('Riven Rock', 'Drop City', 'A Friend of the Earth', 'The Road to Wellville', etc - 10 in all) establishes him as an appropriate novelistic biographer of the life work of Dr Alfred Kinsey. Kinsey's enormously important contribution - THE KINSEY REPORT - to the edification of knowledge of human sexual behavior is well known, well documented, and now even 'playing in a theater near you'. So we have a running start in reading this book.TC Boyle capitalizes on our knowledge of the Sex Doctor to provide the matrix of this elegantly written, attention-consuming novel. Yet in his typical style, Boyle uses fact to create fiction, and in doing so he focuses on the Inner Circle of those dedicated people who spent countless hours touring the country taking individual sexual histories from students, prostitutes, male hustlers, prisoners, known perverts, as well as 'respectable' upper and middle class men and women.Chief among these investigators is the young, naive, intrinsically wholesome, innocent John Milk. By using Milk as the Kinsey-devoted and obsessed narrator Boyle allows us to understand the impact of Kinsey's revolutionary findings on the 'regular citizen'. Opening with a Prologue dated August 25, 1956 and closing with an Epilogue dated August 27, 1956 (creating the time in which Milk is writing memoirs after Kinsey's death), John Milk takes us through the period from 1939 to 1953 when he grew to be Kinsey's first and primary assistant. Milk describes not only the unraveling of Kinsey's work, but also the consequences of working with the obsessed biologist. Milk, his new wife Iris, and his coworkers Corcoran and Ruttledge (with their wives) become increasingly involved in the secrets Kinsey uncovers to the point of participating in voyeurism, homosexual affairs with Kinsey, group sex, filmed sex, and wife swapping - including sleeping in a planned manner with Kinsey's wife, Mac.It is this inner circle dynamic that makes THE INNER CIRCLE a fine novel fed by reality, woven by reportage and observation, and written in a flowing graceful manner that defies putting the book down. The book is wisely divided into two parts - 'Biology Hall' (the beginnings of the controversial investigative stage of Kinsey's studies) and 'Wylie Hall' (the headquarters for the burgeoning success of Kinsey's first book on the male and the continued work on his second volume on the female). And that takes care of the scientific side of the story.The overriding theme of the book is a love story - primarily that between John Milk and his bright wife Iris, who struggles with the strains of her husband's obsession with his 'god' Kinsey and always attempts to keep her life with John grounded in love rather than solely in animal behavior. We care about this couple and while we learn a lot about Kinsey (his physiognomy and infamous anatomy, obsessive compulsive behaviors, powers as a public speaker, and near hypnotizing methods of interviewing), he remains an emotional outsider at the end of the day.Boyle has succeeded in enlightening us, in entertaining us, in challenging us - and in achieving yet another fine novel to a career as one of our more important American writers. Grady Harp, November 2004"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Boyle is hands down one of the best storytellers writing today; his sense of pacing is unrivalled in modern fiction. I loved this book as I have loved everything he has written (biased?). This time out he has chosen to tell the story of a young student, John Milk, at Indiana University who comes under the thrall of Dr. Kinsey (or Prok or the Sex Doctor of the now famous Kinsey Reports). Boyle builds on rumours of Kinsey's private life including a rather uninhibited sex life. Kinsey will have no one work for him who is sex shy. To prove that they are not, his inner circle, including their spouses, are asked to engage in increasingly uninhibited sexual acts. Though Boyle describes these acts in sometimes explicit terms, they are quite boring. He describes these acts in deliberately dry and mechanistic terms. I read a review that said they were hoping for a more exciting (?) book given the subject. It seems that is exactly Boyle's intent. Much like he lampooned the free love ideal in _Drop City_ and the Doctor who took the ladies into the woods in _The Road to Wellville_, (which seems to have been the seed of this book), Boyle's story seems to challenge Kinsey's base assumption that we are no more than human animals and sex is mechanics and nothing else. Though the scene in which Milk's wife finally rebels against Prok seems late in coming, I did enjoy this book. Granted there are few sympathetic characters here (yet again), yet the book is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Boyle slyly offers a story about Kinsey through the eyes of the true protagonist, John Milk. If Milk had offered himself as an apostle to Buddha, he would be the person Buddha would answer with the famous, \\"When you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him. His way is not yours.\\" Instead, Milk, meets Kinsey, also known as Prok. Prok is charismatic, manipulative, and demanding. And John Milk is like playdough in his hands. It is hard to understand what exactly goes through the mind of people who sublimate themselves to someone in whom they put all trust and hope. Boyle does an excellent job with Milk. We understand Prok's initial glamour, so strong it holds Milk, even when he is not so comfortable with what is demanded.So many readers feel that this story does not hold up to others in Boyle's lexicon. Perhaps, I have only read Drop City, which I liked a lot. This is a book anyone would be proud to have written. It is a superb character study within an important story. It is also a reminder to examine our life choices, the priorities we place on work versus love; and it is a brilliant warning to think about the leaders we choose and to watch out that we don't give up too much to these leaders.Yes, this is a book about a member of Kinsey's inner circle reflecting on his life working for the great man and how that work has been important though it has cost much confusion and disharmony in his personal realm. The rather weak quality to Milk, is intended. He has become a man, who must now that he has told this story, start living his life with no one guiding him. For someone like Milk, that would be as awful as it would be useful. More importantly, it is a book about true believers and their enablers and how everyone needs someone who will tell them when enough is enough. Listen up America. We've got one of those in the White House, and he isn't promoting free anything, least of all love!"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"When I started reading Boyle back in 2001, I sensed right away that I'd put myself in the presence of an author at the height of his prowess. After the Plague, Riven Rock and his collected Stories all prompted this notion. Drop City confirmed it. Now comes The Inner Circle, as if I needed more proof. Written in the style of a memoir, or a confession novel, the Inner Circle is a story of obsession. (Other critics and reader have said \\"love\\" in place of obsession, but I think they are only partly right.) Through the book's 418 pages, protagonist and narrator John Mile falls under tow spells simultaneously, that of the persuasive sexologist Alfred Kinsey, and that of his girlfriend and then wife, Iris McAuliffe. Milk is nearly ripped apart by these two lines of devotion, and the effect is a tension that makes The Inner Circle among the most quickly readable novels of its scope. As if Milk's story isn't gripping enough, Boyle gives us a Kinsey that provokes powerful and ambivalent reactions on almost every page. He's a man of towering academic ambition, admirable in his zeal to inform mid-century America's ideas about its most sacred and animal act. At the same time, he's a sexually manipulative taskmaster, someone who lives in that Nietzschean realm beyond good and evil.This book is scandalous, affecting, funny, tragic and above all entertaining. What you'll learn about Kinsey and wartime America is worth the cover price alone. What you'll learn about the conflicting impulses that make us the \\"human animals\\" we are can't begin to be estimated."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"There were several factors that ushered in the Sexual Revolution in America. One was undoubtedly the work of Dr. Alfred Kinsey from the late 1930s to the early 1950s and his groundbreaking publications SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE HUMAN MALE and SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE HUMAN FEMALE, also known as the Kinsey Report. Kinsey and his colleagues cataloged America's sexual habits and stunned the nation with their frank and scientific approach to a topic considered taboo in polite company. So who was the man who pioneered \\"sex research,\\" and who were the men and women who helped him in his study as both researchers and subjects? T.C. Boyle, in his latest novel THE INNER CIRCLE, imagines Dr. Kinsey as a dynamic, oversexed and eccentric individual obsessed with his work.Like THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE, Boyle's fanciful and fun fictionalized portrait of John Harvey Kellogg, THE INNER CIRCLE takes an interesting American icon and writes a novel around him. Here we are introduced to Dr. Kinsey, or \\"Prok\\" as he is called by the narrator, John Milk. Milk is a shy, small town senior at Indiana University when he takes Kinsey's class on marriage and sexuality. The class itself is controversial, and Kinsey quickly becomes known as \\"Dr. Sex.\\" He asks students and faculty to give him their sexual histories for his fledgling research. Milk volunteers and is eventually offered a job with Kinsey, thus becoming the first of the inner circle.Over the years the circle grows, and John Milk marries and starts a family. The inner circle, however, is where his loyalty really lies. From the beginning his relationship with Kinsey is complicated. Kinsey apparently hires Milk as his assistant based on physical attraction rather than on skills or experience (Milk graduates with an English degree, not a science degree). They become involved in a sexual relationship, and soon after that, Milk becomes involved with Kinsey's wife, Mac --- with Kinsey's consent and even encouragement. And thus the story goes; Kinsey directs his research and the sexual lives of his inner circle.Kinsey, as imagined by Boyle, is a bizarre character; manipulative and often unfeeling. Sex for him is a purely physical act with little or no emotion involved. Milk is passive, which makes him a good narrator. However, despite the tantalizing subject matter (and Boyle doesn't spare the reader the sex scenes), the book starts to drag around the middle. We are privy to many intimate moments and much personal information as the circle gathers histories across the country and experiments personally, but Boyle doesn't seem to be able to move the characters much beyond that and none are particularly likeable. In fact, the novel is a bit frustrating in the emotional stagnation of John Milk and the utter control over him and the others that Kinsey seems to have. Why should we care about Milk? What about him are we to relate to? Boyle is unclear.On the one hand, THE INNER CIRCLE is a book about sex; the sex lives of individuals and the sex life of a puritanical mid-century nation. On the other hand, it is about relationships; both power relationships and marriages. Milk's marriage is, as one might easily imagine, strained under the weight of his work and also under the demands Kinsey puts on his inner circle to participate in his lifestyle of insatiable sexual desire.THE INNER CIRCLE is less dynamic and recommendable than THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE, but only because it is slightly repetitious and thus verging on dull. Overall though it is an interesting novel, centered on a unique personality and a moment of awakening in America.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I've been a fan of T.C. Boyle for quite some time. Among my favorites of his are some of his short stories, Road to Wellville and Tortilla Curtain. Along the way he has thrown in a few stinkers such as Riven Rock, but I respect him as a great writer.In the Inner Circle, it reminds me a bit of Road to Wellville. In that book, the main focus of the book was John Kellog of cereal fame and took on the issue of dieting and healthcare. The story had a sense of humor and a number of challenging observations about the subject matter.In this book the main focus is Kinsey and his pioneering work on sexuality. It's certainly timely considering the movie, but this book falls a bit short on the subject. The real protagonist in this book is Kinsey's assistant John Milk. Milk and his wife Iris are somewhat sympathetic characters but the whole story fails to take life and fails to have that bit of farcical humor that I usually see in Boyle's books.In some ways it amazes me that a book that is about the quest of the study of sexual behavior fails to excite, arouse or even bring a smile. In fact, the book's perspective is especially dark and the story essentially focuses on how a man's obsession (Kinsey's) can eventually cause great harm to him and everyone around him.Overall, I'll tepidly recommend the book because it is well-written and reseached. It's an interesting topic and Boyle has the talent of creating prose that interests you no matter what the topic."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"T. C. Boyle in his latest novel writes about the famous or infamous-- depending on your point of view-- Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University and those people closest to him: his wife Mac and his three male assistants, their wives, and a movie photographer who joins the group late in Mr. Kinsey's career. Everyone has an opinion about Kinsey and his research and we all bring our own emotional and sexual baggage to this book. I suspect that many reviewers probably reveal more about themselves than they illuminate about Mr. Kinsey.We see Kinsey through the eyes of the narrator Milk, who initially takes Kinsey's class (Kinsey is known as \\"Prok\\" be his associates) in Marriage and the Family at Indiana University where in order to take said class, one had to be married or engaged. Milk became \\"engaged\\" and signed up with a coed with whom he had no relationship in order to get into the course. (The class sounded nothing like the marriage and the family course so popular on the Baptist campus where I attended collage more than 20 years later.)Boyle tells the reader in the \\"Author's Note\\" that \\"all characters and situations have been invented, with the exception of the historical figures of Alfred C. Kinsey and his wife, Clara Bracken (McMillen) Kinsey.\\" He also lists Kinsey's various biographers for his factual material about the Kinseys. What Boyle has created is a totally believable portrait of the controversial, bowtied Kinsey who becomes flesh and blood as seen through the eyes of his disciple Milk. We know that he eats trail mix, loves to lecture on classical music, is frugal to the point of being stingy, is an atheist, is totally nonjudgmental about any kind of sexual activity, regardless of what kind or variety, and sees all of mankind as \\"human animals.\\" The writer also has recreated the 40's and 50's in the U. S. with total accuracy: from references to Martha Raye, Billy Holiday and Billy Graham, to Pearl Harbor and the U. S. getting into World War II.What makes this novel a terrific read is Milk's conflict between his literal hero worship of Prok and his devotion to the work that Kinsey, along with Milk, who becomes his assistant, is obssessed with, as well as the certainly unconventional sex at the time that the \\"inner circle\\" engages in and Milk's love for his wife Iris, a naive, lapsed Catholic, who is just as independent in her own way as Prok, and is constantly at odds with him about what she sees as his interfering with her marriage, both from the inordinate amount of time he expects his followers to spend taking sexual histories, often travelling away from Bloomington for long stretches of time to obtain them, to his belief that everyone in his inner circle can have sex with each other.This novel is not your typical candidate for the NEW YORK TIMES best list of the year although it certainly deserves its place there."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"A most enjoyable read, but not on par with Boyle's best (IMHO, Drop City, Riven Rock, Water Music). As always with Boyle, the pleasure is in the little details and characters that are fully realized. However, unlike Drop City, the gripping story is missing here. Perhaps that's the point, because Prok is the story, and nothing else. And because I found Prok to be preying, indulgent and mostly just plain mean, I guess my feelings towards this book will always be at arms length."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I expected something a bit lighter. No overt violence in this book, but some of the situations depicted were (emotionally) gross and unsettling.What I found most fascinating was the complex and nuanced portrayal of Kinsey (\\"Prok\\"). Prok is often utterly loathsome and despicable in how he treats others, but nonetheless possessed of impeccable integrity on his own terms. At one point, the narrator, Kinsey's research assistant John Milk, says something like \\"Say what you will of him, but Prok was no hypocrite,\\" and in the end you have to admit that that's true.The psychological relationship between Prok and Milk is abusive, though Milk seems largely unaware of just how badly he is being treated. One element of the plot I found downright painful was that Milk, Prok's most loyal and longstanding researcher, was chronically underpaid and always poor! But that wasn't the worst of it -- not even close.And yet, in a perverse, almost grudging way, it seems that Prok really did care for Milk, and that Milk's dedication to Prok, though clearly indicative of his own abysmally low self-esteem, is not entirely unwarranted.I wasn't sure whether to give this book three or four stars. I guess what impresses me about the story is that it presents some intriguing contradictions that ring true. One is that in order to accomplish what Kinsey did accomplish, which I think is undeniably of value historically, he had to be freakishly intense, monomaniacal, ruthlessly manipulative--in short, a somewhat pathological character. (The book is fiction, of course, but I'm assuming that the portrait of Kinsey is based in fact.)Also, just when I would start to totally hate the guy (which happened periodically throughout the novel), when I wanted something REALLY BAD to happen to him, or at least for Milk to grow enough of a brain (and balls) to finally smash his boss's face in, Boyle would deftly make me see \\"Prok\\" again in a more favorable light, as his acolyte Milk saw him. And it was all entirely believable. People are enormously complicated, and this book drives that home as well as any novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"My favorite TC Boyle book. Every person I recommended it to has loved it. Kinsey is a fascinating character and a perfect subject for Boyle."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Like other TC Boyle I've read, the author manages to take an idea with fantastic potential and bore it up with a flat narrating character and a monotonous writing style."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Kinsey and his acolytes get the Boyle treatment here. Our narrator, the fictional John Milk, the first of Kinsey's assistants, is involved from the early days of the groundbreaking sex research. A picture of a determined, single-minded man emerges. Sadly that single-mindedness makes Kinsey something of an insensitive person; reading body language like an expert but not really caring what's signified if it gets in the way of his life's work. As is mentioned in the course of the narrative, though, isn't that the way with a lot of people considered Great?The one thing I had issue with-- and I guess it's a big issue because the entirety of the book is just this issue-- is that the narrator was not all that interesting. Completely in thrall to his worshipful master, he wasn't even his own person to have a personality. I didn't understand what Kinsey was supposed to have seen in him in the first place to want to hire him on. The guy didn't have a scientific background, wasn't a brilliant mind, and nothing much stood out that would make him memorable when he and Kinsey first interacted. Maybe he thought he was hot and wanted him for eye candy? That's one of the first things we learn about the narrator. That he's, quote, a \\"heart-throb\\". Oh well, I don't know.With just as much (if not more) personal drama, as there is Kinsey stuff, and the narrator being as uninteresting as I've said he was, you might want to pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"This was not my favorite Boyle but I am reading everything he wrote so that tells you something.

But the characters were so unlikeable it was hard to really get into the book. Glad it was a library book and I didnt spend money on it!"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"This novel gives a fictional account of life among the Inner Circle of Dr. Kinsey, famed sex researcher. The main character, John Milk, is entirely fictious, however the author bases a lot of the plot on the actual researcher's life, research, methods, and very likely- his sexual proclivities. The story moves quickly, some of which I attribute to the subject matter itself (how is sex not interesting?), and almost immediately the reader is immersed in research about sex histories, \\"H\\" behavior, and how this ground breaking work interferes with relationships both within and outside of the Inner Circle.There is not any measurable growth for Milk, who despite his growing uneasiness about the research methodologies never breaks from the Inner Circle. I would imagine for many readers this would cause the climax of the novel (pun intended) falls flat as Milk is either unable or unwilling to change his course in Kinsey's circle.Overall, however, the novel is an interesting read, providing some insight of what might have been truly going on behind the scenes in Kinsey's work. The relationships between characters are very believable, and the struggles within them are very realistic.On note of the audiobooks, the narrator's voice was so jarring that initially I didn't think I would be able to get through the novel- his stuffy, flat tone just didn't seem like it would be something I'd want to listen to for 15 hours! But, after about the first disk, the voice seemed to work and his tone, inflections, and pronunciations were exactly as Milk probably would sound like."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"After I read Drop City I grabbed The Inner Circle.Not a good book. TC has a very interesting cogent style but this book was a bit thin in story. I'd suggest bypassing this novel for Drop City, a delightful read."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I doubt this book ever would have been published had it not been for Kinsey's being a popular subject at the moment. Though the writing does capture a sense of what it may have been like to be involved with Kinsey's research, there is little enhancement of the facts which one may see on any site about Kinsey.The characters are poorly drawn, dialogue very weak. What I had thought would be an interesting and well-developed piece of characerisation and plot grew boring very quickly."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I loved the movie for \\"Road to Wellville\\" although the novel was for me a slow-paced and languorous read quite unlike the film. However, I was drawn by this book cover and story premise, and besides, I firmly believe an author deserves a second chance, so I picked up \\"The Inner Circle.\\" It lacked focus, pace and plot as with the other novel, but somehow I rather enjoyed parts of it. Although technically a work of fiction, the author definately did his research and his backdrop is that whole controversial Kinsey sex thing from the 1950s, you know, that dirty old man doctor who started studying bees, and naturally progressed to the field of human sexuality. Huh?? Yeah, exactly. Anyway, the story is about Kinsey's virginally timid assistant and occasional boy-toy John Milk and how later he and his wife and the rest of the group get to experiment with breaking all the social sexual rules all in the name of \\"research.\\" I believe Kinsey and his kin did more than a little in loosening morals/mores and helping usher in the sexually uninhibited atmosphere of the hippie subculture that was soon to come."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"My reviews tend to be brief:For \\"Inner Circle\\": \\"Typed\\" not \\"written\\" and certainly not \\"authored.\\"Not an elegant sentence stirs you.

It also does not explain why PROK'S wife MAC went with it all.Some time, specially after 150 pages the book is pure rambling without any direction!!I am pretty disappionted with the book because of its lack of direction.Since I am not getting any good voteswhy not read the real book BY KINSEY?"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The Inner Circle, T.C. Boyle's novel based on the life of pioneering sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, is a decent read that goes on rather longer than it needs to. The book is interesting, and not just for prurient reasons (although there is plenty in the book to satisfy the prurient), but also for the portrait of Kinsey. Boyle really captures his strangeness and the obsessive genius that drove him. However, the first half of the book is much better than the second - there's more humor, the plot is fun and a little bit racy, and the entire narrative is imbued with the innocence and idealism with which Kinsey began his project. As the story goes on, however, all that idealism evaporates and with it goes much of the energy of the book. It becomes a dark story of manipulation and monomania as Kinsey's obsessions become increasingly powerful and his need to control the lives of those around him become more overt.All in all, I would say that it's a good book, but not a great one. It's certainly not Boyle's best work; both Drop City and World's End are better, although I suspect that his short stories are probably the best showcase for his talent. Anyone who's interested in Boyle is probably better off picking up If the River Was Whiskey (which includes the great story \\"Sorry Fugu\\"), and anyone who's interested in Kinsey or the Institute for Sex Research is better off just renting the movie Kinsey."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Those readers who have recently seen the Liam Neeson film Kinsey will find a lot of familiar material in T.C. Boyle's The Inner circle. But whereas the movie pretty much focused on Alfred Kinsey, this novel centers on his young research assistant John Milk. In The Inner Circle, Kinsey is presented though the prism of John's life, and to a lesser extent, his wife Iris, who had a somewhat troubled and ambiguous relationship with the famous sex researcher.Big, bold and ambitious The Inner Circle gives us a sweeping portrait of Alfred Kinsey and his band of cohorts as they traversed the country, recording sex histories while trying to understand the makeup of human sexuality from an incontrovertibly \\"scientific\\" point of view. Told in the first person, and in clipped, clean prose, Milk portrays a world of academia where above all, they wanted to be regarded as scientists, to legitimize the field of sex research, and elevate it to its proper place among the behavioral sciences.Most of the action in The Inner Circle takes place during the 10 years between 1939 and the landmark publication of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male in 1948. The 38-year-old Milk tape-records his memories in 1956; the year of Kinsey's death, with an affable and intense voice, and the reader is inevitably lulled into liking this hesitant young scientist. We soon learn he is married to Iris, that there seems to have been some sort of trouble between them, and that they now have a young son.In 1939, the virginal, naive young Milk, then an English major at Indiana University, joined Professor Kinsey as his first assistant. Milk attended a lecture by Kinsey and was soon mesmerized. Alfred \\"had a particular gift for delivery that never resorted to tricks or theatrical gestures, his voice clear and distinct, every inch a man of science expatiating on a subject of deep interest to all humanity.\\" John wants to help advance science, to be part of the charismatic visionary's effort to reveal the truths about our erotic lives, and thus free us from the chains of social propriety.The strength of the novel is Milk's (and Boyle's) formidable portrait of Kinsey. At first he is the eager, bow-tied scientist, an idealistic clinician who will crouch over a copulating couple to point out the fleshly details of their orgasms, or objectively listen to the ramblings of one of the most notorious child molester's on record. At other times, he could be a kind of psuedo hippie, who loved classical music, lunched every day on trail mix, encouraged bi-sexual freedom, and gardened virtually in the nude. He was witty, generous and loyal - a total gentleman. But he could also be controlling, manipulative, and exploitative. Milk reveres him as a genius, but Iris regards him as a monster.Boyle is a gifted writer and his essential message in The Inner Circle is disarmingly clear: Where does one draw the line between science and spiritual love? And does promiscuity really bring liberation, fulfillment and happiness? Milk is encouraged by Kinsey to experiment sexually, but this comes at great cost to his marriage. The story is full of accounts from students, married couples, prostitutes, gays, and various fetishists about their sexual practices. This is a complex, multi-faceted book that effectively portrays an era where battles raged between the puritanical forces of society and the objectivity of science, and where a group of people tried to dispel the myths of sex as dirty, shameful, private, obscene and totally unfit for public examination. Mike Leonard January 05."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The Inner Circle is the story told by John Milk, a fictional member of the inner circle of Alfred Kinsey during his exhaustive sex research in the 1940s and 1950s. John is an impressionabe college student when he comes under Kinsey's (nicknamed \\"Prok\\") spell. John lost his father early, and has a distant relationship with his mother, and he easily becomes close to Prok and his family. John does believe in the research, but the book is a great story of succumbing to manipulation. Through Prok's guidance, John experiments sexually, and who knows, he may have done that anyway, but I believe Prok loosened his inhibitions. Finally, Prok is so manipulative that John does things he doesn't really want, just to please Prok--even trying to get his wife to participate in group sex.I won't moralize here. The book stresses, and I believe, that whatever happens between consenting adults if fine. The story deals with the idea of idolizing people, and how these people can manipulate you by their sheer charisma--especially when said idol is a surrogate parent. John is a weak character, and awkward, who eventually must realize what is important to him and stand up to Prok.It's an interesting setting to explore the ideas of inhibition, manipulation, and love. Not to mention that The Inner Circle is a good read. I liked Drop City better, but this book is interesting as well."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"One thing for sure, T. C. Boyle is usually up to something. You can't take his stories at face value. Nor do they turn out to be what you expect. Sometimes his narrator just isn't to be trusted, and you have to read between the lines.All of this is true of this novel about the famous author of the Kinsey Reports. If you're expecting something steamy with a behind-the-scenes look at the man and the men who were part of his research team, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting an insightful study of Kinsey himself, something deeper and more substantial than the recent movie, you'll be only partly satisfied. The reason is that Boyle chooses to tell the story through the point of view of an assistant of Kinsey's, who worships the man, even when his behavior is questionable.Boyle's Kinsey is not sympathetic or heroic, but Milk, the narrator, tries to withhold information about him that would portray him in a bad light, rationalizes what he reveals, and seems in denial about the rest. As a result, the book becomes more a study of Milk, a weak man who allows himself to be used and manipulated by Kinsey, while at the same time he is dominated by his young but not unlikable young wife. When he insists in the final pages that love at times must take precedence over animal desire, he arrives at an understanding that any sensible reader would have held from page one of the novel.So the book is an odd and quirky journey, that leaves you with a somewhat jaundiced view of all its characters, especially the great man himself, and you marvel that his work, which contributed to a much needed sexual liberation, could be based on such ethically compromised underpinnings."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I'm a TC Boyle fan. Loved Drop City and A Friend of the Earth. This one sits somewhere between those in my estimation - better than A Friend of the Earth, but not quite as engaging as Drop City. By that I just mean to say this might not need to be the first Boyle book you read, cause there are some good ones to choose from.As ever, I love his sense of humor, his ability to combine intelligent plot-lines about engaging characters with enough wit and verve to keep the pages flipping. The narrator in this one is a bit of a flat personality, but he's flat in a complex way, if you know what I mean. He speaks in a language part clinical and part literary, with a wry aftertaste.I have to admit I don't know much about Kinsey other than this. Yes, I did see the film, but if this book is credible than the film barely scratched the surface of the subject. If Boyle is to be believed the Prok is a problematic figure in a major way. As this book details, Prok didn't just want to break through our society's ignorance about matters sexual. The Kinsey in this book is really rather freaky. He likes a lot of things personally and he's staunch in saying that no sexual behavior at all can be called deviant. That's a bit hard to swallow. Was it just necassary to break through the taboos of the time? Or did he really believe that sex with household pets was just fine? I'm not sure, but I am thankful to Mr. Boyle for once again giving us a thought-provoking, engaging piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"\\"The Inner Circle\\" provides a fascinating fictionalized inside look at Alfred Kinsey and the creation of the infamous Kinsey Report, soon also to be documented in a feature film starring Liam Neeson. The story is told through the perspective of young John Milk, a student at Indiana University who goes on to become one of Kinsey's research assistants.The narrative voice is strong, often compelling, particularly in its depiction of the ambivalent sexuality of its central characters, propelled by Kinsey himself, but the long-expected, somewhat inevitable denouement (which should pack an emotional punch) somehow manages to fall short and the story wraps up a little too tidily.Still, this is an entertaining read and a worthy introduction to TC Boyle, whose works I had never read. \\"Drop City,\\" which I imagine to be a superior book to this, is next on my list."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"While Boyle creates interesting characters and the premise of this story has great potential, I was largely disappointed by this novel. I love TC Boyle's short stories, and I've come to expect great things from him, so when this novel dragged on and on, giving the reader no real new tugs to pique our interest, I wondered where Boyle's editor was. Perhaps the writing style and repetitiveness were meant to give the reader a sense of the boredom and monotony that even group sex could come to have for a sex researcher, but I understood that after 200 pages, and this novel could have been half as long. I love TC Boyle, but this would be the last novel of his that I'd recommend."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The Inner Circle describes the experiences of John Milk, as he becomes the first member of the inner circle of controversial human sex researcher Professor Kinsey (Prok). At the outset Milk is a naive and honest young man finding his way in the world without a father just before the outbreak of World War two. Prok is described to us through the eyes of Milk, who believes that Prok is a truly great man. Milk fails to see how he is manipulated and used by Prok, but it makes no difference because he feels privileged to be part of the Inner Circle. After getting married, his young wife Iris challenges his beliefs about sex and his dedication to the research. Ultimately, although Milk is unquestionably the most dedicated and non-cynical member of the inner circle it is eventually he himself who is overcome by emotion and breaks their code of objectivity.The book raises a number of interesting themes that have relevance to contemporary society. The conflict between objective and subjective views of sex is central to the storyline. Whilst the book makes no moral judgment on this issue, it does expose the nature and dangers of a purely scientific approach to sex. The book also bares out the way in which personality cults can lead non-cynical people (often seeing themselves as true believers) into being willingly exploited. Equally though, Prok is no hypocrite or despot, but a man driven by a conviction that science must be placed first and people's eyes opened. His personal sacrifices to this cause are perhaps the greatest of all. The media's ability to distort facts, maintain the status quo and ultimately slow progress is also touched upon.I found that the book is a steady interesting read but no page-turner. It does however tackle many interesting and thought provoking issues. Sex is handled in the book with complete objectivity, much in keeping with Prok's view of scientific integrity. So despite the fact that all manner of sexual activities are described, the book never becomes voyeuristic. Overall this is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"T. C. Boyle is one of my favorite writers and I've probably read just about everything he's ever published. I don't like everything he's written, and I tend to like his historical fiction the least -- as a matter of fact, reading his \\"Riven Rock\\" was such a painful and torturous experience for me that when I finished it, I felt like never reading another book again.I have a problem with historical fiction in general. It's basically a matter of telling lies about someone, usually someone who is dead and therefore unable to defend himself. But beyond the fact that it's essentially dishonest, I'm uneasy with the fact that the line between truth and fiction is deliberately blurred for no apparent reason other than to tell a story. Perhaps I'm old-fashioned in this regard, but I think fiction should be fictional and non-fiction should be truthful.So I was not looking forward to \\"The Inner Circle.\\" It probably sat in my bookshelves for over a year before I finally decided to read it. I didn't have very high expectations, but even if I had, this book would have probably exceeded them. I read most of it on an airplane, which is one of the worst places to read a book, but if a book can hold your attention on an airplane -- where it has to compete with constant engine noise, occasional turbulence, restless passengers, and pointless announcements from the pilot -- it can probably hold your attention anywhere. And \\"The Inner Circle\\" definitely held my attention.The book is a character study of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, but despite his field of research, there's very little in the book that has to do with sex. A lesser author might have tried to titillate the reader with depictions of sexual acts, but Boyle doesn't need to. His characters are so vividly drawn that they're interesting in and of themselves, regardless of how they spend their time.The book doesn't paint a particularly flattering portrait of Alfred Kinsey -- but whether Kinsey was truly as obsessive and domineering as the book makes him out to be is beside the point, since this is a work of fiction. Besides, the true subject of the story is Kinsey's fictional assistant John Milk, who is also the narrator. We meet him first as an undergraduate, a naive young man who knows nothing about sex -- either from a scientific standpoint or from personal experience -- and we follow his personal and professional development as he becomes Kinsey's first researcher and later gets married and raises a family. We get a better picture of Milk than we do of Kinsey, since everything we learn about Kinsey is filtered through Milk's loving and uncritical eyes.The book is enjoyable from start to finish, and as with all of Boyle's fiction, it's artfully written. It's easy to read -- even on an airplane -- so I recommend it, and I look forward to Boyle's next novel, whether it's historical fiction or not."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The Inner Circle is T.C. Boyle's novel of the work done by Dr. Albert Kinsey and the Sex Research Institue at Indiana University in Bloomington.The novel is told by first person narrator John Milk. Milk is a naive IU English major when he attends a lecture by Kinsey in the days prior to World War II. Milk sets up a visit to Kinsey's home on the outskirts of Bloomington, Indiana the home of IU.Milk is hired by Kinsey to help him with his sex research interviews staying until the professor's death in 1956. Milk receives a deferment during World War II so that he can serve as Kinsey's assistant. Milk is later joined by two other men who interview thousands of people on their sex lives. The job involves travel for interviews to the slums of Indianapolis to New York, Detroit and overseas among countless other towns and cities. Kinsey is an excellent interviewer who trains Milk and works his staff for incredibly long hours. He was a tough taskmastere who demanded much of his men. Kinsey's past is only briefly noted and we really never get inside his mind. Was he a genius or a self-deluded fraud? A mixture of both? We are left to make up our own minds.Milk weds a complex woman named Iris who dislikes Kinsey. She refuses to undress and engage in a marital sex swap held at the bohemian home of Kinsey. Kinsey enjoyed having home movies made of persons in coitus. Milk engages in sex with both Dr. Kinsey (call profk by his staff) and Mrs. Kinsey! He also engages in both heterosexual and homosexual sex all for the good of science. (or at least that what we are told!). Kinsey was himself a bisexual whose calm professorial demeanor hid the smouldering fires of a sex addicted middle aged man.Kinsey was a professor of entomology and zoology at IU. He had a Ph.d from Harvard. Profk was interested in nothing but sex as observed and participated in by what he called \\"the human animal.\\" He was an atheist who believed nothing done to satisfy sexual urges was harmful to the human being. He was amoral. Kinsey enjoyed gardening, hard work on his sexual research, classical music evenings and sex with anyone at anytime!Kinsey won fame with his two surveys on male and female sexuality in the late 40s and early 50s. The books became bestsellers and landed him on the covers of such magazine as Time.Kinsey traveled widely lecturing to everyone from university students at Berkely and other campuses to the prisoners at San Quentin. He sat for thousands of interviews with clients who opened up to him on their sexual biographies. His work is still viewed as controversial even in our age of so called \\"enlightenment.\\"John Milk's narration allows us to view life in the Midwest during the mid twentieth century era. Bloomington was a small conservative college town with the bombshell work of Kinsey adding the only notoriety to its reputation.Boyle tells the story in a fluid literary style. He is alert to the flora and fauna of the changing seasons and the growing eccentricity of Kinsey as the years passed. Kinsey failed to see love in sexual relations which led to his conflict with Iris Milk the strongest character in this tale. Many of the other characters are flat and one dimensional in their depiction by Boyle.John Milk is a meek and mild man obedient to his hero Dr. Kinsey. He is blind to Kinsey's moral blindness and inability to truly love another human being.T.C. Boyle has written another excellent novel in \\"The Inner Circle.\\""},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"This review is, in a way, a split personality. \\"The Inner Circle\\" is another great example of T.C. Boyle's mastery of his prose; the characters are well defined and fleshed-out, the story arc moves forward and well as character development deepens...but, it was just a little too long winded - not Boyle's writing, but the story itself.How do you separate the two? Well, it is probably because this book is based on facts and real people. Boyle does a great job of bringing this chapter of American cultural history to life, but the second half of the story is a bit too drawn out; I don't blame this on Boyle, because I believe the real events actually transpired that way and Boyle did a great job of capturing that. The film \\"Kinsey\\" was the exact same way. The story is fascinating about the research and early developments, but gets a bit tiring as it gets into the latter years and the battle Kinsey had to go through.So what does that mean? I think that it means (I am too young to actually remember the events) that I felt at the end the same way the characters did in real life...tired of the closed-mindedness of the repressed in America. It is kind of like rolling my eyes when the Attorny-General of the US covers up the lady liberty statue because it exposes a breast; this kind of stuff is exhausting to keep track of and defend against. And I think that Kinsey was that way in the end; and so was I after reading this book (and watching the movie).I recommend this book, but reader beware...when you are done, you may feel the same way that Kinsey (and I) did at the end."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"This review discusses: The content of T.C. Boyle's \\"The Inner Circle,\\" the performance of it by Richard Kramer (the book on tape), and Bill Condon's 2004 film, \\"Kinsey.\\"Given that both Boyle and Condon each fictionalized their own accounts of famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, it is surprising how similar \\"The Inner Circle\\" and \\"Kinsey\\" are. The film is a Cliffs Notes version, while the book more thoroughly chronicles Kinsey's beginnings as a biologist studying gall wasps to eventually becoming an international celebrity with his groundbreaking work in sex research. Boyle, who has approximately 400 pages to cover the subject, gives a much more detailed account than Condon, who only had the space of a 2-hour film. But Condon still manages to include a lot of the same highlights Boyle hits upon regarding Kinsey's research and his struggle to get it. Both the book and film pick out important aspects of Kinsey's research like talking to prostitutes, his interviewing techniques to gather sexual histories, talking to child molesters, etc. Both works also address his sexual relationships with his three male research assistants.Though similar, Boyle and Condon do present much different pictures of Kinsey. Boyle tells his story via the fictional John Milk, a virginal college student who becomes Kinsey's first assistant, and so this portrayal is almost God-like, as it is told through the eyes of a young protege who sees Kinsey as a daring scientist. The film, however, speaks omnisciently, better showing Kinsey's fragilities and even portraying Kinsey's slight sex shyness (while in the book Kinsey has no sexual hesitation at all). Kinsey's wife, \\"Mac,\\" comes off as loose and carefree in the book; in the film, she is tightly wound, nervous, and more concerned with conforming with the conservative society around her. In the book, Kinsey's first research assistant, Milk, is curious about and inexperienced with sex; in the film, the equivalent character is sexually adventurous and promiscuous from the get-go. In the book, Kinsey and Milk till a garden in the nude; in the film, they merely go shirtless.For a basic and rough intro of Kinsey, see the film, \\"Kinsey.\\" For a more thorough look, read the book, \\"The Inner Circle.\\" If you are considering listening to the book on tape, a warning: Richard Kramer's performance is a bit monotonous. Yes, the character John Milk, who is narrating, is supposed to be mild-mannered, but Kramer's reading is a bit dead. I really think that T.C. Boyle himself should have read for the audiobook (I've seen him read from \\"The Inner Circle,\\" and he breathes life into it.)Overall, \\"The Inner Circle\\" is lackluster compared to Boyle's other works. It does a good job of telling history (a fictionalized version), but lacks the usual momentum of Boyle's page-turning style. The characters are a bit flat and unmemorable. Nonetheless it's clearly written the way Boyle writes. Expect his lucid narrative, his New Yorker-magazine-like vocabulary (i.e. succurus, insouciant, macaroni et formage), and his chapter/section endings that leave you in suspense.I saw the film \\"Kinsey\\" on the single-disc DVD. Let me tell you there are absolutely no special features on it, just the director commentary. Not even the trailer is on it! There's only a preview for an Orlando Bloom/Liam Neeson film, and you can watch the film with English or SPanish subtitles, and audio track in Spanish or English 5.1 or English DTS. The producers, wickedly so, also released a two-disc special edition DVD the same time as the single disc. The special edition has loads of special features. So if you're not sure if you'll end up loving the film, you might want to rent it first, and then if you love it, buy the 2-disc edition. Otherwise if you buy the single disc first and then want a bit more, you might end up with both editions just to see some special features!My Overall Ratings:\\"The Inner Circle\\" book by T.C. Boyle ***1/2 (of 5).\\"Kinsey\\" film directed by Bill Condon *** (of 5)\\"Kinsey\\" single-disc DVD special features * (of 5)\\"The Inner Circle\\" book on 10 audiocassettes, read by Richard Kramer ***"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"I would give the writing 5 stars. I stayed with the book all the way through because of it. I give the story line 1 star. The subject matter in this historical fiction book eventually succeeded in grossing me out. I didn't care for the characters and I admit, I like to be able to relate in SOME way to at least one. Prok was a charasmatic cult leader who appeared to be living out his own personal fantasies in the name of science. Whatever. Has all this knowledge of how many times a day someone partakes in self-gratifying behavior really benefited society? [...] Milk drove me nuts. I kept hoping his wife would be the redeeming character in the whole book but I felt let down by her too. As a mother and RN when the mention of infant and child sex came up I was physically repulsed. I wish I'd thrown the book down then and moved on."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The work of Alfred Kinsey is explored through a fictitious narrator, John Milk, who is there for the first lecture Kinsey gives on sex and soon after becomes involved in the sex research that will form Kinsey's legacy and change the world. But life in the inner circle is far different from the life presented to the media...T.C. Boyle's novel is an excellent look into one of the 20th century's most interesting and important thinkers/scientists, someone who brought sex from the shadows and shame and into popular culture. It's no coincidence that the two books \\"Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male/Female\\" came out just before the sexual revolution of the 1960s.Kinsey is a fascinating figure himself, a kind of forward thinker who believes all sex is natural whatever your inclination and practices what he preaches. Where the book becomes interesting is in the tangled web of interconnecting relationships between all of the characters who sexually share themselves and their partners among one another leading to devastated feelings and the limits of the sex research and Kinsey's philosophy of free love which fails to take into account real love, just physical sex.The inner circle resembles a cult almost with Kinsey as the leader and his \\"followers\\" doing his bidding, worshipping his strong personality and mission of bringing sex out into the open. It's ironic because Kinsey is so anti-religion and yet he expects complete fealty to his cause and his beliefs without question from his followers. But his utter single mindedness in his pursuit would lead to an early grave and leave a kind of darkness and hollowness to the people in his life after all he put them through.The novel is a fantastic read with Boyle taking you right there into the times, personifying Kinsey perfectly and giving the reader a clear and vivid picture of the times and the impact his work had on society at the time. The reader also comes away with an understanding of how Kinsey went about collecting the data via interviews and later filmed recordings.Where the novel fails is in its length - I felt that at just over 400 pages it went on a bit too long. The focus on the imaginary narrator became a bit dull especially when the book's main subject is Kinsey and the story should have stayed on him more than meandering away. Also, this is a book where not much happens. That didn't bother me as I didn't expect much to happen (it's not that kind of story, more of a character portrait) though it could bother some people who might be looking for a novel with lots of twists and turns - this isn't that book.Besides that, this is a brilliant novel of an important and interesting figure of 20th century history who is brought to life with the expert skill of master writer TC Boyle. Fans of Boyle will enjoy this book while those seeking an idea of who Kinsey was but don't wish to trudge through a dry non-fiction book will find \\"The Inner Circle\\" suits their needs. An excellent read, Boyle proves once again his exorbitant ability in the written form outshines many of his contemporaries - definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"T.C. Boyle is a competent writer, but that's the extent of it in this slow novel that is dry of wisdom. Skip it."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The focus of THE INNER CIRCLE is Professor Alfred Kinsey, the sex researcher that John Milk, an employee of Kinsey and the narrator of this novel, considers one of the great and original geniuses of the twentieth century. Professor K, as described by Milk, is brilliant yet methodical, inspiring yet controlling, generous yet manipulative and demanding, and profoundly insightful yet a detail man. He is also a crusader against oppressive sexual mores and attitudes but a major sexual predator. With Prok, Boyle should get his due: He has created an unforgettable character.One subject of this novel is the relationship between Prok and Milk. Milk describes Prok as a father figure. Further, he is a true believer in Prok's philosophy of sex, which holds that all sexual desire and activity is normal and that people must overcome their sexual inhibitions. In this type of novel--that is, one with a charismatic father-figure protagonist and sympathetic and dependent narrator--authors sometimes write toward moments of truth, which test both the greatness of the protagonist and the commitment of the narrator. Here, I will say that Boyle does write to such a climax in TIC. The question for the reader is: Is John Milk's moment of truth genuinely traumatic and affecting?TIC is a historical novel, with Milk describing his 14 year association with Prok. This begins when Prok is a professor lecturing on sex to students at Indiana University, follows Prok through years of research that culminates in two best sellers, and ends with Prok's early death a 62. While Boyle also tells us plenty about the carnal private lives of Prok and his incestuous crew, the professional history of Kinsey is, essentially, about the relentless pursuit of data. While this story becomes progressively weirder, it is not especially dramatic. Further, the publication of Prok's two best-sellers are not presented as triumphs, since Kinsey viewed them as the first books in a series that he would never live to complete. As a result, this is a history book without a great narrative arc. Prok worked hard and died too soon. The sexual revolution that he enabled and that was his true goal began a decade after his death.There's much to enjoy in this novel. Boyle writes an involving story and loads Milk's narrative voice with a subtle lyricism. And I like the character Iris, who stands up to power and charisma, retaining her sanity and, say, rightly calling some participants in Prok's research child molesters. Still, for a book about the sex lives of Kinsey and his crew and their investigation into American sexual practices, Milk's voice yields a book with a very restrained feel. Just like Margaret Mead said in her criticism of Kinsey's research: Isn't sex supposed to be fun?"},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"How does one pronounce Coraghessan anyway? When I spotted \\"T.C.Boyle\\" on the cover of this novel, I thought perhaps here was the same writer whose stories I have enjoyed in the pages of The New Yorker. Evidently the long Irish middle name is cumbersome for a book jacket, but yes, this is the very same writer, with the evocative prose and interesting subject matter that make for compelling reading. His ability to transport readers directly into the moment is remarkable. Herewith, a few lines toward the end of INNER CIRCLE, little to do directly with the storyline, but replete with meaningful metaphor. It's a quick flashback of protaganist/narrator John Milk as beneath the bleachers at UC Berkeley he awaits the seminal speech of Kinsey's career.\\"The smell - of the adjoining locker room, of the distilled and rancid sweat of the generations -- brought me back to high school and a reverie I'd had after my concussion on the football field. They'd brought me into the locker room on a stretcher, my mother's voice floating round the door like a bird battering its wings against a pane of glass, my consciousness fading and then looping back on itself till the world opened up on me like a woman's smile, though there was no woman there, only the grim bald-headed team physician, administering smelling salts.\\"Of course, Milk is no heroic masculine jock. He's the initial and youngest member of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's research team of the nineteen forties and fifties, a group of young would-be scientists who are cleverly juxtaposed in this scene amid athletic equipment and sports trophies. No, these young men have stepped aside from the norms of their generation, have missed the war and devoted themselves entirely to Kinsey's over-arching \\"project.\\" A data collection effort that culminates in the two momentous tomes that have come to be known collectively as the Kinsey Report.These Inner Circle members are sex researchers and employed to collect hundreds upon thousands of sex histories from Americans of all walks. In fictional style, Boyle describes in clinical tones the process of their work. Yet, the most vivid prurience only emerges as we step behind the curtain walling off the inner circle, and become voyeurs into their secretive, exploratory personal lives. Kinsey, his three chief researchers and the spouses of all four push the envelope of sexual mores, in the name of research of course. The highly sex-charged, ever-inquisitive and insatiable Kinsey leads his young charges and their wives down a destructive path. It's predictably sad, but fascinating as we watch through the eyes of John Milk the deleterious effects of Kinsey's quest on the relationships and marriages of this inner circle. Needless to say, physiology does not conquer all. Tremendous writing that makes me next want to go find Boyle's \\"Drop City\\" straight away."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"There's no doubting T.C. Boyle's chops - the writing itself in \\"The Inner Circle\\" is top-notch. However, the storyline was so off-putting, it became harder and harder to finish the book. Finally, I was down to about 15 pages a day. Don't get me wrong: I picked up \\"Circle\\" because I saw and enjoyed Bill Condon's \\"Kinsey: Let's Talk About Sex.\\" But where Condon's movie artfully balanced Prok's brilliance, his...ummm...quirks, and the political pressures, Boyle's book focuses increasingly on Prok's sexual \\"acting out\\" as the tale goes on. And, wow, does it get odd. If you saw \\"Kinsey,\\" stop there. The book didn't add to my knowledge of Kinsey.And, one note of the power of film: reading the book, I couldn't get the image of Liam Neeson out of my head. I had to go online to see pictures of the real Kinsey to dislodge Neeson from my brain. It reminded me what a great and brave job he and Peter Skarsgard turned in."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"The first thing that struck me while reading this was the remarkable similarities between it and Bill Condon's screenplay for the movie \\"Kinsey\\". Kinsey's naive and idealistic assistant John Milk follows so much of the same path as Peter Sarsgaard's character in the movie,it was almost as if I was reading a novelization of the film. The major difference is Sarsgaard is single, while Boyle's protagonist is grappling with being a husband and a father all the while continuing his work for Kinsey with a near brainwashed zeal.I think the fact that I had already seen the movie added to my enjoyment of the book. It certainly peaked my interest in reading it to begin with, although I loved \\"Drop City\\". What I found a tad disappointing is I can't say I really liked John Milk. Even with a first person narrative I found him weak, an attribute he points out in himself. Consequently I found a falseness to where he ends up, and by the time I had finished was left a bit numb. As a companion piece to the movie I think it's an interesting compliment. By itself, I don't know that I would've enjoyed it quite as much."},{"Title":"The Inner Circle","review":"Since several previous reviewers have detailed the story line, I will not repeat them but would like to add several thoughts obtained by reading the book and by attending a discussion session lead by Boyle himself. This book is fiction and is entertainment, and quite well done in both areas. Boyle has to combine his research on the actual knowledge about Alfred Kinsey as recorded in the archives at the Institute with his own fantasies about several aspects of the investigation of human sexuality. It is difficult at times to tell what is based on history and what is based on Boyle's imagination. The chief question raised by the book is whether or not human beings can conduct such sex research in a dispassionate manner. To project the images of the scene, Boyle has to show you the world as seen through the eyes of a character John Milk, who is not very articulate or very sophisticated or experienced in sexual matters. Boyle does very well at projecting that character, who is well described by the very articulate and humorous Boyle. The dominance of the inner group of researchers by Kinsey is also well presented in a manner fitting the late 40's and 50's in midwestern USA. Boyle presents the shyness of the characters and their lack of detailed knowledge about sex in a manner that fits well with the era described. Kinsey's two books on male and female sexual behavior were landmark descriptions that prepared the way for the more knowledgeable world we live in today. Where does love or fun fit into such a story, read it to find both answers. For those of us to remember this period in history, it is a thoroughly entertaining and ambitious novel by Boyle."},{"Title":"Rurouni Kenshin: v. 7","review":"Saito Hajime,Former Captain of the Third Squad of the Shinsengumi,re enters Kenshin's life to set the stage for the next possible revolution of Japan,in this,the first volume in the \\"Kyoto\\" Story Arc.In this,the best volume of Rurouni Kenshin at this point,we have the beginning of a more darker storyline.We have a new villian who is in every way,Kenshin's equal.By day,he's a Police Officer for the new Meiji Goverment,while at night,he's a spy for a local Crime Boss.Saito enters the Kamiya Dojo to conclude a duel the two had 10 years ago and I'll tell you:this is one of the BEST fights in both the Anime Version and in this edition.From the pre-fight chat the two have,on how Kenshin is actually weaker now then he was in the past,to the duel itself,everything is perfect!Once again,we have incredible artwork from Nobuhiro Watsuki,who brings every aspect of this suspenseful battle to life.And thats only the middle section of this volume.Without listing any spoilers,the true meaning of the fight isn't what you would suspect and the absolute ending to this voulme will leave you wanting more.I really don't have anything negative to say about this volume.With this being the first entry in the \\"Kyoto Arc\\",it really starts it off with a bang......just wait for the last couple of fights later down the road,they're just as good as this battle.Buy this volume now!"},{"Title":"Soda Fountain Classics","review":"Shows how to make almost any kind of old fashioned soda fountain treat.

I agree with Gary in all respects. I would add that the emotional portraits of both the manic-despressed wife of one of the protagonist, and the drug addicted brother of one of the main characters are spot on. These passages resonate with authenticity, especially the section on how addicts kid themselves continuously that they will quit \\"next Monday.\\"I also enjoyed the healthy dose of entymology and near-voodoo religion. Blunt was very factual yet entertaining in introducing these themes and they added greatly to the book.One of the other reviewers downplayed Blunt in comparison to Steve Hamilton's Alex McKnight series placed in the UP of Michigan. Those were nice, but there is far more characterization and plotting in this book than in either of the first two by Hamilton.I am getting my hands on everything Blunt has written with high hopes they're all as good as Black Fly Season."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"I loved Blunt's first book and was extremely happy to note that this second one is even better.

In spite of his cool name, his story and characters blow hot and cold in this mildly interesting police procedural.Detective Cardinal is our hero, and he must find out who is dismembering people prior to killing them. Drugs are involved, and quite a few bodies will pile up before the last page.Mr. Blunt nicely writes about life in this small Canadian town/city, and one can vividly imagine much of the scenery of this novel because of his careful and descriptive writing. It seems that many writers are employing an overused trick to get us to believe a character is sensitive--his partner or child has a chronic, incurable illness. Our hero has private monologues about how tough it is for him (or her) to deal with this situation, but she or he does so privately and bravely.The story is fairly interesting, and the conclusion is satisfactory though quite predictable. Cardinal should leave his wife and marry his partner; a few hot scenes would really spice up this bland broth!"},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"The third of the Cardinal-Delorme mysteries sees the Canadian cop duo investigating an apparent attempted homicide when an amnesiac redhead turns up in Algonquin Bay with a bullet wound to the skull. It rapidly escalates into a story about a biker gang, a drug war, Voodoo-like magic and ritualistic murders. And this time it's summer, so the oppressive weight of the northern winter is swapped for an oppressive weight of silently vicious black flies. As in the previous installments, Blunt also includes a subplot about Cardinal's home life, this time dealing with his manic-depressive wife, Catherine, and his estranged daughter, Kelly, who has not quite forgiven her father for confessing to corruption and pulling his ill-gotten gains out from under her final year at Yale. But in a return to the model Blunt followed in \\"Forty Words For Sorrow\\", he spends just as much time - if not more - exploring the lives and minds of the villains. The sections Blunt devotes to Kevin Tait - heroin addict and aspiring poet who daydreams of escaping to Tangiers, and of being interviewed about his work by David Letterman and Martin Amis - show that Blunt might capably make a stab at a crossover novel. Such a balanced approach makes for a richer read. This is more about the characters than about solving the case. Indeed, the police work becomes almost secondary. Readers who prefer plot-driven mysteries and figuring out whodunnit may well be disappointed - and the climax is oh-so-convenient - but those who like their genre fiction with a little more depth and colour will find plenty to enjoy here, not least Blunt's occasionally stirring language: \\"Thick and soupy, the air pressed a filthy finger into the back of his throat and held it there, wiggling it every time he moved, as if the air itself were composed of vomit.\\" Nice."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"Perhaps starting in the middle of a series has lessened the impact, but I found this to be just average. I'll have to go and look for the beginning."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"\\"Black Fly Season\\" was my first Giles Blunt novel and, after reading it, I'm surprised Blunt is not a runaway best seller. \\"Black Fly\\" has all the right stuff of a perfect mystery/thriller: interesting characters, a well-tuned plot, crisp dialogue, and an unlikely but effective northern Canadian setting. Blunt's writing style is similar to Lee Child - high praise - while the content is reminiscent of Ken Goddard, who has written some fine crime novels (\\"Balefire\\", \\"Prey\\"...) featuring the US Fish and Wildlife Department. Giles and researched his subject material well, and throws in some neat forensics to boot, making for the classic summer read that will keep you up long after you should be sleeping.A young girl his wandering around the local Algonquin Bay watering hole, incoherent and obviously suffering from amnesia. With good reason, it turns out - she has a bullet lodged in her brain. Homicide detective John Cardinal and his partner Lise Delorme are on the case, trying first to identify the redheaded young victim and then try and find those behind the attempted murder. From there, Blunt takes us on a guided tour of the north woods heroin trade, complete with renegade bikers and a mysterious and evil Voodoo-like religion. Blunt keep the story line clean and the dialog mercifully crisp, focusing his efforts on unraveling the crime while building a uniquely depraved bad guy. The thriller clips along to a suspenseful if predictable climax and high adrenaline entertainment for the whole trip. This is highly recommended reading; I'm looking forward to catching up on Blunt's previous efforts that I've missed."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"This was the first time I'd read a book by this Canadian author, and I was very impressed with Mr. Blunt's writing and plotting skills. We have two very likeable police partners in this series - John Cardinal and Lise Delorme. The book is set in Algonquin Bay, Ontario, Canada (250 miles north of Toronto). John and Lise have a different type of mystery to solve. A young woman is discovered walking around acting strange, and she doesn't remember who she was. It is discovered that she has a small-calibre bullet in her brain. Then bodies start turning up. One is particularly gruesome. The body of a biker from a local gang is found minus his head, hands and feet. Mr. Blunt gives us a good insight into forensic entomology as Lise and John try to solve what appears to be ritualistic killings. They are up against a particularly odious killer in this one. This appears to be a great series, and I intend to read the previous two books in this series soon."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"Mr. Blunt creates one of the finest mystery novels I have ever read with this book. He has multiple characteristics embedded in his writing that make him one of the very best mystery writers ever. His articulation is excellent. His vocabulary is a few levels up from the usual 8th grade vocabulary used, even by many of the masters. And, perhaps the most interesting technique of all is the \\"architecture\\" of the book. The use of small and fast reading chapters; the elegance and depth of character development; the complexity of the crimes and the intricacy of finding the one who was responsible; all combine to make this book a very fine work of Murder/Mystery Authorship.The book is very much centered around the use of Santeria, a Cuban form of Voodoo, but with particularly nasty methods. This version of voodoo believes that one can kill animals, and even human beings and make their spirits do work for you; gather information for you; etc. But in order to make those spirits do their work for you, the sacrifice must be done in the right phase of the moon, and the victim must be horribly tortured to death, while mutilated so that all blood runs out of the body. This is the scene that Officer Cardinal and his partner Officer Delorme are dealing with in this story.The detail, at just the right level is particularly well developed by Blunt in this story. He has a knack of being able to write about a horrifying crime scene just to the right limit, where only the characters actually get nauseous; but not quite the reader. His ability to describe the relevant details of a scene is glorious and his sentences are not over-modified with excessive adjectives and adverbs to create the illusion of literary style. Blunt actually has literary style, which is one of the things that make this book so attractive and interesting to read.The climax is very much climactic. And the development of the story, especially from the reader's perspective is superb. This book is very highly recommended for all readers of the Murder/Mystery Genre, and for any reader looking for a page turning experience that is on the edge of actual classic literature."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"This novel, the third in the Cardinal/Delorme series continues the action in a small Canadian town with the two dedicated detectives hot on the trail of a vicious and elusive killer. The novel moves along quite well with the reader constantly wondering if the police can outdo the bad guy. Delorme and Cardinal are a great pair of characters and the author really plays them off each other very convincingly. Cardinal seems to be more fleshed out in this story. We learn more about his distrubed wife and other demons he has to deal with. I would like to see more about the Delorme character in the next novel which can't come too soon. This is a really good series."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"Near Algonquin Bay, Canada, the patrons are enjoying their drinks at World Tavern when the woman entered. Black fly bites were all over her body and she flitters from one table to the next. When locals try to pick her up starting with asking her name, she says she has no idea. They call her \\"Red\\" for obvious reasons. However, another patron local cop Jerry Commando takes the baffled woman to City Hospital.Doctors quickly realize the cause of her perplexity and amnesia has nothing to do with frying her brain on drugs; instead the docile woman was shot in the head as there is a bullet lodged in her brain; she does not remember the incident. Homicide Detectives John Cardinal and Lise Delorme head the investigation that includes keeping Red safe because both law enforcement officials believes that the person who injured her shot to kill and once he or she learns she still lives will be back to correct their mistake.The return of Cardinal and Delorme (see THE DELICATE STORM AND FORTY WORDS FOR SORROW) bluntly means a great time for police procedural fans. Their latest entry is as terrific as usual starting from the moment Red enters the remote local's bar, through a medical procedure to remove the bullet, and continuing as the two detectives know that she is a target, but to insure her safety may have to use her as bait. The motive for the attempted killing will chill the audience much more than winter in Ontario as it is based on real cult murders on the Mexican-United States border. BLACK FLY SEASON is a complex chiller that will shake the audience with its art imitates life premise.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"I really enjoyed FORTY WORDS FOR SORROW, my first exposure to Giles Blunt, and have looked forward to his subsequent work. However, this novel more closely resembles Delicate Storm the Forty Words. Moments of pleasure, pages of boredom, this novel is an uneven disappointment for readers of Forty Words. Where John Cardinal was at his best struggling with his moral delimmas in Forty Words, he has become flat, stilted, and predictable in Blackfly Season. The dialouge between Delorme and Cardinal has taken a turn for the obvious, and no longer resembles the tension inhernet in Forty Words.The novel started out well enough, holding my attention through the first 100 pages or so, but I quickly found myself racing to get to the end. The climax to the central plot was wildly unrealistic, as if conjured up by the very Santeria Gods Cardinal and company where battling against.I won't give away any story elements, but readers of Forty Words beware - Blackfly Season will not be remembered for much more than those annoying flys."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"I have read all three books in this series and they just keep getting better and better. Blunt has created interesting, realistic characters in Cardinal and Delorme. His descriptions are wonderfully written without being overwhelming in detail.The story flowed very well. This is not a \\"who done it\\" type of mystery. The story revolves more around who the characters are, why they do what they do, and how the mystery is solved. I would love to see this series of books get the attention they deserve."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"I bought this book based upon the review of Gary Griffiths who has a spotlight review on this book here. I think we are not supposed to refer to other reviews here, and I am not going to do so. I am going to refer to the reviewer though because I think he does a fine job and I admire his reiews a lot. Gary writes honest, insightful reviews and if he thinks a book is great then there is a fair-to-middlin' chance I am going to think it is great too. We don't always agree though and this book is one of those instances.I thought this was a good book but not a great book. All the pieces were there. Interesting, sympathetic characters, with interesting human-scale problems of their own, a puzzling crime, interesting forensics, clever/weird bad guys, and a great setting that is unusual: the north of Canada. Somehow though, somehow....when I finished this book my honest summation is that this is good, really good actually, but it doesn't quite reach that memorable plateau which defines a novel as \\"great\\". Perhaps I should have started at the beginning of the series and worked forward for a better appreciation of the characters and their devleopment because as it stands I don't think this book and the characters will be that memorable to me. If I was going to make a recommendation for a \\"northern\\" mystery series I would recommend the Alex McKnight series by Steve Hamilton first. In my mind that is a truly great series.So my opinion is this is a solid, good mystery that won't disappoint you at all. You'll enjoy reading it and won't regret the investment of time and money. Yet for a truly great series of reads, in a similar setting and environment, check out the McKnight series by Hamilton. It's first-class, memorable stuff that is wonderful enough to make you anxiously await the annual next installment year after year."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"This is a very enjoyable book, as good as \\"The Delicate Storm\\" and better than \\"Forty Words For Sorrow,\\" which I found too disturbing and too derivative of a few sensational Canadian murders several years ago (one of the culprits of which was released from prison last summer).John Cardinal is a great, realistic character, and the Ontario setting is a fascinating one. Algonquin Bay is really North Bay, Ontario; I have spent parts of the last 31 summers not far from North Bay and know the town, so for me the setting is particularly important.Blunt should be a best seller."},{"Title":"Blackfly Season","review":"I was expecting a lot more after Forty Words for Sorrow, but with this novel Blunt moves a little closer to the paint-by-numbers \\"genre novel\\" and a little farther away from what would be a true innovation: the literary detective story. Blunt gets carried away here with plot elements that seriously strain credibility, and he replaces the psychological depth of Forty Words with splatter-film detailing that you can read in any of about 32,281 other serial-killer novels. There are also continuity errors that a decent editor should have fixed. As one example, ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** a detective describes a body whose feet and hands have been amputated by saying words to the effect that \\"someone cut off his fingers and toes first.\\" If the hands and feet are gone, there's no way for the police to know whether the toes and fingers were also removed separately. ***END SPOILERS*** I'm hopeful, finally, that not every future Cardinal novel will contain the \\"wife threatening a psychiatric relapse\\" subplot. It's a lot less effective at humanizing Cardinal (I assume that's the point) than Blunt may think. Blunt also misses an opportunity in Black Fly to do something less cardboard with the Lisa Delorme character, who every so often threatens to be more interesting than Cardinal, and there are about five too many scenes in which she and Cardinal basically grunt at each other while \\"deeply understanding\\" one another's motivations and personalities (the way cops do) and \\"profoundly communicating\\" despite the fact that certain things Can Never Be Said and certain questions Must Never Be Raised (as true partners always know). The clich&eacute;, by now, is about as interesting as lint, and Blunt is capable of much better."},{"Title":"The swing (Enoch Pratt Free Library Poetry Broadsides)","review":"There comes a moment in a new parent's life when they realize that they have become their own parents. It's different for everyone. For some folks it won't happen until they're berating their teenagers, conjuring up terms and threats from their own youth that they swore they'd never use. For others, it happens at practically the moment after conception. And for me, it happened when I read my one-year-old daughter Julie Morstad's simply irresistible adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic poem The Swing. As I read the book aloud I realized that I had heard this poem myself as a child. I could even recall the images that accompanied it, filled with sickly sweet children with cheeks so large they'd make the Campbell Soup kids seem wan in comparison. And when later I heard my own mother recite this poem I was amazed to discover that my reading, which I'd done several time for my own daughter, contained the exact same cadences and turns of phrase as my mother's rendition. The difference for my daughter will be the fact that while the art accompanying my The Swing was tepid, the images that appear in Julie Morstad's gorgeous little board book are utterly lovely creations. For all those parents desperate to introduce their toddlers to poetry, or just folks who want to read their kids something beautiful for once, here is the answer to your prayers.\\"How do you like to go up in a swing / Up in the air so blue?\\" I should think you'd like it very much if you were one of the children in Julie Morstad's clever little book. Adapting Robert Louis Stevenson's words, Ms. Morstad fills her pages with kids on their way up, their way down, and everywhere in-between. They glide under cherry blossoms, observe the even rows of plants and vegetables, and swing like superheroes on their bellies. The result is a haunting but thoroughly enjoyable update to a poem that feels as fresh and fun as it was the day it was first published in the late 1800s.Etsy has been a simultaneous boon and problem for the children's picture book world. On the one hand, there is no better place for editors to find up and coming artists. Never before has a public forum of this scope yielded such rich artistic talent. On the other hand, there is a kind of Etsy \\"look\\" that typifies the people found there. It's what allows reviewers like myself to view certain kinds of children's books and sniff \\"Etsy\\" when we want to put them down. Now at a first glance Morstad's work on The Swing might strike you as falling in the Etsy vein. An unfair assumption since as far as I can tell Ms. Morstad sells her art herself and not through Etsy. More to the point, this book is better than that. Granted I wouldn't mind taking some of the images found in the book and framing them on my wall (particularly that cover image with the black background and white haired girl swinging through a field of vibrant blossoms). But there's a quality to Ms. Morstad's art that feels more than merely trendy. There's a lot of beauty here, and it ties in directly to the subject matter.Books about swinging for children are the one-act plays of children's literature. Tied entirely to a single place where the vertical is exchanged for the horizontal, it's hard to make a narrative around swinging. Indeed that's probably why books likeHigher! Higher!by Leslie Patricelli have been for the very young set while Tricia Tusa'sFollow Mehas looked at other aspects of swinging entirely (colors, etc.). The best attempt at the genre was probably Joe Cepeda'sSwingwhich had a kind of Calvin & Hobbes type of plot. Morstad's adaptation of Stevenson's poem is smart because rather than show a single kid just going up and down and down and up she shows a wide range of children swinging in all kinds of different settings.Looking at the book itself I was impressed by the design of the thing. It fools you for the first few pages, allowing you to think that you're reading yet another book where the text is on one page and the images on the other. Yet when you reach the lines \\"Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing / Ever a child can do!\\" the words curve and dive around two tow-headed children, swinging against a verdant green background. Each image carries with it a distinctive mood and feel. There's one scene of a child swinging over \\"River and trees and cattle and all\\" while a midday sun sinks red towards the horizon. Of course I've already mentioned my favorite image in the book, which is the one on the cover. Happily Ms. Morstad comes full circle with that girl. She appears at first on the cover, and then once again at the end of the book with the final lines \\"Up in the air and down!\\" There you see her white hair, little pink shoes, and jet black background in place. This time, however, her swinging has definitely slowed down and she regards the reader with a small smile and a sense of complacency you can't help but envy. Plus the fluorescent flowers are cool. Like those.I am pleased to report that while I dislike it when folks use their own children as control groups, determining whether or not a book works, in this particular case I feel no guilt in reporting that my one-year-old is a fan. I'm not sure if it's the engrossing images, the way the sentences are split up on the pages, or the way the poem sounds on my tongue, but whatever the case Morstad's The Swing is definitely doing something right. Evocative and mesmerizing all at once, this is one book that is sure to engage kids right from the get-go. With its new packaging, Stevenson's classic feels as fresh and new as anything you'll find on your bookstore and library shelves today. Beautiful. There's no other word for it.For ages 1-5."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"This really is an astonishingly modern book. He shows in part a Church capable of corruption and deceit, but also shows a Church which has what we now call a preferential option toward the poor, and a Pope also works diligently for peace.Here we have the hero, a poor, scholarly eccentric, who has been ill-treated by Church officials. His bishop did not like him and did not support his vocation to the priesthood, and told lies to boot. However, finally, a couple of bishops, one an Archbishop, look into his case and decide he has been dreadfully wronged. Rolfe delineates a structure of secrecy, deceit, and cover up. He did not anticipate the scandals of the cover-up of child abuse, but the structures of deceit are there, and one can still see them at work today.Well, the old Archbishop, after much careful and challenging questioning, determines that our hero really does have a true vocation to the priesthoood, and that his studies were sufficient. He ordains him. It just turns out that the Archbishop has come back from a Papal Conclave which is in deadlock, unable to choose a new Pope. He returns to Rome with the new priest in his entourage, and lo and behold, it turns out that his ill-treatment and his case have been discussed. By the Holy Spirit, he is chosen Pope, much to his surprise. However, the Spirit no doubt gave him strength and he accepts the office, choosing the title of Hadrian VII.Well, what kind of Pope is he? He first of all wants to be a Pope of the people, and so ensures after his election that his first appearance is to the waiting crowds outside in the world. He likes going among the crowds, even though there is some danger of assassination, though he was not the traveler that J. P. II is. He insists on having his quarters built and decorated in a utilitarian way, eschewing grandeur. Having experienced poverty, he is very solicitous towards the poor and devotes a lot of Church resources towards ameliorating poverty. So, he anticipated the preferential option towards the poor.Some have pointed out that his Pope has a great deal more influence in the world than any modern Pope has had, Hadrian VII showed himself as vitally interested in peace. Truly, the Pope would not be able to engineer a division of the world into spheres of influence for various favored powerful nations.There is good and bad in the Church, and Rolfe's Hadrian VII sets out much of both.Rolfe himself was quite an eccentric, and so is his Pope. The style is full of archaisms and wierd bits of learning, but Rolfe was theologically astute, too. His Hadrian is a very complex and facinating character, somewhat depressive, hard working, kind, and strange. This novel is so interesting I can forgive it a few faults. Some of it is a hoot."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"The most attractive feature of this new edition of Rolfe's bizarre classic is the introduction by Alexander Theroux, perhaps the only writer today with the fire, erudition, and vocubulary to carry on the tradition of Corvine invective. (If you like Corvo, you must read Theroux's novel &quot;Darconville's Cat.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"Baron Corvo, like Ouida, is one of those once popular novelists who have been expunged from the canon. There is an H G Wells image of Queen Victoria sitting on British society like a paperweight, once she was gone a great many things started blowing around. Well, Rolfe was one of those things. The word &quot;disturbing&quot; is used about a great many slickly written modern novels but Rolfe's mental instability is very obvious in this book (this is not always an easy book to read). High camp (lots of kissing of rings), a none-too-well-hidden homosexual subtext, the Catholic Church: it sounds terrible but this rogue text is surprisingly enjoyable and as a sort of postmodernism avant la lettre raises intriguing &quot;what might have been&quot; questons about the C20th English Novel."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"There's no denying that Frederic Rolfe--the self-styled Baron Corvo--created something truly one-of-a-kind in memorable with HADRAIN THE SEVENTH, his fantastic account of an embittered marginalized crank being called upon to serve as the first English pope in centuries. In many ways, the bizarrity of this fantasy, and its undeniable stylistic maturity and complexity, make it something akin to &quot;outsider art,&quot; the products of painters, fabricworkers and sculptors whose artworks seem a product of insanity or neurosis. The problem with Rolfe's book, however, is that as fascinating as it is intitally the novelty quickly wears off, and then you're left with chapter upon chapter left of Pope Hadrian flouncing through the Vatican making sweeping edicts and then exploring their ramifications upon Jesuitical belief--hardly the stuff of hours of reading delight."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"Anyone fantasizing about a catholic church led by an ambitious, (relatively) young, energetic, charismatic, intelligent, prescient, and competent pope, must read this book and realize it's already been fantasized about to a truly wondrous extent. An idealization of theo-autocracy, Hadrian the Seventh bears comparison (if only for giggles) with GK Chesterton's works. Delightful, morbidly absurd and surprisingly engaging, Baron Corvo's quasi-wistfully-autobiographical novel is the epitome of what-ifs, a seminal exposition in the art of might-have-beens."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"Frederick Rolfe's Hadrian is all surface and seeming - it is pontiff-ego, receiving its due recognition as a thing valuable in and of itself. A defrocked misanthropic, mysogynist Roman Catholic priest living in near hermetic solitude with his cat, and entertaining himself by counting the split infinitives in the daily paper, is approached and courted by the church, which eventually elects him Pope. Hadrian VII is a truly bizarre and interesting novel. If you enjoy Wilde, Huysmans, Orton or Alexander Theroux, or screeds of beautifully ornate abuse, you will undertake your own quest for Corvo as, sadly, not a one of Rolfe's works is in print."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"Yes, well, um, quite...This eccentric, dainty, precieuse story really has not much to do with Roman Catholicism or the Papacy...It has almost everything to do with its eccentric, dainty, precieuse author, who certainly was an odd fish--It is his confession, vindication and divine wish-fulfillment all in one. Or was he really all that odd? His is the story of the eminently talented, gifted, sensitive soul left to drift in the world, his talents unappreciated by the vulgar herd, left with only his pride as consolation. He very much resembles Baudelaire's description of the poet whose \\"great wings prevent him from walking\\"--And this book encompasses his vision of what he would do could he but fly. But it must be said that this literary flight is, simply put, more odd and curious than grand or tragic or majestic or poetic. It is, like its author, idiosyncratic to the core.Reading this book, for me, was like rummaging in a linguistic attic, chancing upon a forgotten turn of English or Ancient Greek and smiling wistfully before putting it aside again.

It's about a &quot;nobody&quot; who became pope - not a new concept by any means - with some obscure details on, and innovative reforms of the catholic church.I found the characters to be believable, underscoring my general feeling about the hierarchical structure of, and the personalities residing within the church.Although it's a bit of a hard read in terms of its language usage, I enjoyed it and have recommended it to other people."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"I read this a long time ago and it left a very distinct and longlasting aftertaste. In my childhood, I met more than a few Catholics caught up with the elaborate outer crust, rituals and language of this religion, the religion of my childhood. Hadrian the seventh is more extreme in this way than all of those characters put together. You do not have to be a Catholic to enjoy his very original use of the English language. It is a classic. Poverty seems to have chased Frederick Rolfe even after death. This book is out of print! I read this book during the same period while I was at university that I read the Autobiography of Aleister Crowley, Milarepa by Evans-Wentz and Borges and shortly after that Marques, just before he won the Nobel Prize. I promise you young folks that reading these crazy books would take you on more thrilling trips than drugs, fast cars and mindless sex. It is all in the mind, is it not?"},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"It is gratifying to see that Fr. Rolfe, a/k/a Baron Corvo is still the cause of violent polemicism in modern readers. There truly was no one like him, not even Joyce, for love of language.Were he not so self-focused he might have written a corpus of much more sustainable themes; and yet his entire oeuvre is shaped and iterated by his own disappointments and failures (there were so many: he was so tired). In this book, he takes revenge on the world, and triumphs--as pope! What a wonderful conceit. It should be read slowly. It is truly to be savored."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"To the other reviews here, I'd like to mention Corvo's disconnection from the real world. He seems to believe that kings and popes still really ran the world like they did in 1300. His Hadrian VII persuades Europe to be carved into an Empire of the North, ruled by the King of Prussia, an Empire of the South, by the King of Italy. The American Republic, is given all of South America; the Japanese Empire, gets Siberia; and the rest of the world goes to the King of England. Uh, yeah."},{"Title":"Hadrian Vii","review":"Frederick Rolfe styled himself Fr. Rolfe to write this book, to make it look as if he was a Priest.

There is significant information about aircraft performance at high density altitudes, special weather considerations in the mountains, techniques for evaluating mountain airstrips, flying non-standard approach patterns. It is not as exciting a read, nor does it give as much attention to specific aircraft handling skills as F.E. Potts' &quot;Guide to Bush Flying,&quot; but is the recognized standard for an armchair introduction to piloting an aircraft in the mountains and should find a place on any pilot's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Day of The Beast","review":"On the dust cover of the first printing of this book in 1922 it had these words in bold letters, NOT A WESTERN, as if to warn the potential buyer what they would be getting was not the usual Zane Grey fare, and most likely contributed to the low sales of the book. Harpers had no faith in this book, nor did ZG's wife, Dolly, who had urged him not to write it. But this was a book he HAD to write. He felt enormous sympathy for the returning soldier from WW1 and how they were treated medically and emotionally, especially those who returned from the battle field after the first rush of excitement and jubilation the first one's received. Those later returnees were offered no parades, no notice at all, becoming almost victims of the war. Added to this was Zane Grey's hatred of the way society was changing, particularly the morals and the general conduct he saw being displayed by the young women of the day--\\"The Roaring Twenties\\" we call it today. This is his protest against that age or time as seen through the eyes of a returning veteran, who does not have long to live. And yes, a lot of what he was protesting against, is still with us today. We never seem to learn as a society; history repeats itself. This book may seem dated, the use of language and its descriptive qualities have changed somewhat, but all in all this book does a good job in depicting what was happening in the country following WW1. The Day of the Beast will never be one of ZG's big sellers, and for years the ending left me wondering if he actually wrote the book this way; but I have come to know more about him as a person through my study of him as a writer and can now see what he was trying to say with this book. If you read this book for what it was intended, then you will not be disappointed. It is NOT A WESTERN, but a very readable and enjoyable book exposing what the author believed was grievous to society then, and by the way even today."},{"Title":"The Day of The Beast","review":"Zane Grey's personal disgust with the &quot;modern woman&quot; drinking and smoking after the war is reflected in the disillusionment of a returned war veteran. After fighting to protect the U.S. homes and females, he finds values radically changed. Gives a good look at the sudden culture changes."},{"Title":"The Day of The Beast","review":"Nothing is new under the sun. This could be true now, To think this was written about 1920 is amazing it just goes to show how people haven't changed. The story is about a young man who returns from WW1 after being in battle for 3 years many battle scars and emotional wounds. Coming home was a dream that turned into a nightmare. It was written in ZG great style but it is not a western, but I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Day of The Beast","review":"I was not able to finish this book - it was a depressing story of the solders returning home after WWI.
