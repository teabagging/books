I cannot fathom why teachers require kids to read this book. It glorifies gang life and makes heros of criminals! My son told me what a great guy Dally was because he took the wrap for a friend who broke some windows and helped that he Pony Boy and Johnny when they were in such trouble. What this really means is, he covered and abetted the actions of a vandal and two boys involved in the death of another! This makes Dally a good guy? The author tries to make us identify and sympathize with these boys who are thrust into unhappy circumstances and react by becoming hoods, thieves, liars and killers! We're supposed to empathize and champion these boys? Yes, they had their gentle spots and even showed great bravery at the fire, but that cannot negate that our children are being made to like and admire these criminals! I don't want my son to identify with these kids! I don't want him associating with kids like these and I CERTAINLY don't want him to look up to or emmulate kids like this! What IS the point of this book? That everybody feels pain? Do we really have to glorify crime and deception and expose our kids to this ugliness to teach them that? Why aren't they reading Tom Sawyer and A Tale of Two Cities? Why aren't they being taught to look up to good honest, decent living people? No wonder our teens are in such trouble these days.

He has to learn to cope with harsh surroundings, gang violence and the pressures to succeed. Along the way he is faced with many life-altering decisions.The main character in this book is a young boy named Ponyboy; he is the one who serves as the narrator in the story. Ponyboy is the youngest of three brothers. The oldest of the brothers, Darry, is a gallant protector and father figure to Ponyboy and Ponyboy&#65533;s other brother because a tragic accident had occurred in the family. Sodapop, Ponyboy&#65533;s second oldest brother is a more carefree and fun loving kind of guy. He and Ponyboy are very close. The other characters in this novel are: Two-bit who brings the group their definition of entertainment, Dally a fierce notorious lawbreaker, and Steve, Sodapop&#65533;s best friend, who&#65533;s always ready for a good fight and loves the hood life. There is also Jonny, who acts as everyone&#65533;s kid brother. He is always sweet and nice due to his living situation at home, and past traumatic events.These boys make up a very colorful circle of friends. They are always there for each other know matter what. Together they have the time of their lives. They are &#65533;The Greasers.&#65533;Some of the other characters, from the Upper-East Side consist of Cherry, a spunky little red head that touches the hearts of both sides. She also happens to be a cheerleader at Ponyboy&#65533;s school. Bob, Cherry&#65533;s boyfriend gets in more trouble than you can imagine. Randy is Bob&#65533;s best friend and also his side kick. Together the boys wreak havoc among the greasers just because they can. Everyday these characters run into numerous amounts of problems. They deal with things such as fights, family, friends, girls, and even murder. Each day is filled with enough adventures to last a lifetime.My favorite character is Ponyboy. He is my favorite because he learns so much and you feel as if you are learning and growing with him. Many of the challenges and outcomes he deals with are so gut wrenching and heart touching that I did not want to put the book down. I felt as if I could relate to each and every character on a different level. I absolutely loved the book. I could not put it down. The structure and composition, combined with the energy level of the book were elaborately well done and very mind gripping. I would not change a thing about the book at all; otherwise I feel it would not be worth reading.I completely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. I feel, that all types of people can relate, in someway or another, to this book. So go out and get your copy today, otherwise you will be missing out."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think the book, Outsiders was an awsum book.

Its about these boys trying to make the best out of there lives and ya they get into some trouble, but in the end they come out heroes. I thought it was a good book because its real life. This book just shows the truth about life and how kids live it. Yes I have to agree that we don't alway live it the safe way, but it sure is the truth about how kids treat other kids on the way they look or dress and not on how nice and sweet they are."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is a book for mature teen's. If you want to read a book read this book . This book is about teens in gangs and fighting among each other."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersThe book I have read was called The Outsiders by: S.E. Hinton. This is one of those books that once you start reading it you can't put it down. Just because it is fiction doesn't mean it couldn't happen!!!This book was about three Curtis brothers Darry (age -20),Sodapop (age- 16 going on 17), and Pony boy (age-14). There parents were killed in a car accident. The three boys can only stay together if they behave. There are two groups the Socials aka. Socs (wealthy kids) and the Greasers (poor people or not as rich as the Socs.). The Curtis boys are the Greasers. When Soda was 12 going on 13 his hobby was horseback riding and he loved a horse named Mickey Mouse and this horse would not let anyone ride and was very mean to everyone except Sodapop. Soda used to go to the stable everyday just to ride him and he could spend hours there because he cut school so he could work to help pay the bills. Darry also works many hours to pay for food and pay the bills. But still finds the time to go to school and play football and work out to keep his nice build.Johnny is the child of alcoholic, abusive parents. Since his parents do not pay much attention to him, Johnny sees the greasers as his true family. In particular Dallas is the most protective of him. Johnny was once beaten up really bad by the Socs. and is now terrified of them. One day Johnny, Two-Bit Mathews (real name is Keith; he is a wisecracking greaser who regularly shoplifts. He prizes his sleek black-handled switchblade.), Dallas, and Ponyboy went to a movie. They had met two girls Sherry Valance (but her friends called her Cherry b/c of her red hair, she is a Soc and Bob Sheldon's girlfriend) and Marcia (Randy's girlfriend, and also a Soc.). They were there only because their Boyfriends were drunk and they didn't like to see them like that. Johnny, Two-Bit, and Ponyboy went over to go sit down and they started talking. Ponyboy and Cherry found out they have a lot in common. Dallas drove Johnny, Ponyboy, Two-Bit, Marcia, and Cherry home in his T-Bird. When they were driving they noticed the blue car drive by and Marcia and Cherry noticed it was the Socs. car, they started to get very nervous. Then when Dallas had stopped the car the Socs. had come back around and Randy and Bob had come over to the car because they thought they had seen their girlfriend in the car. Randy had asked why they were hanging out with the Greasers and Marcia said \\"because you were drinking and I don't like to see you like that.\\" Then Marcia and Cherry got out of the car and told the greasers that she would see them later. Johnny and Ponyboy had laid down to look at the sunset and they feel asleep. When Johnny had woken up he saw that Ponyboy was still sleeping he had woken him up and told him to go home. When Ponyboy had gotten home he had realized that he was extremely late. Darry was waiting there ready to yell at Ponyboy. When he opened the door Darry let him have it....Sodapop tried to stop them but it wasn't going to work. Darry got so mad that he hit Ponyboy! Ponyboy had never been hit and he got so upset that he turned around and ran back to where he and Johnny were laying. Darry felt bad and tried to get him come back, but Ponyboy just kept running. He got back to Johnny and Johnny had asked what was wrong and Ponyboy had explained the whole thing to him. Ponyboy thought that if they went for a walk around the park he could go home. This is where disaster strikes them.....You will have to read the rest and find out what happened!This book is very interesting and I can relate to some parts. Just remember your friends will fight and defend you if they're real friends. This book has affected me by letting me see what it is to have a really bad life. I advise you that you should ask your parents to set a guideline and lay down the rules because when you get too much freedom things can go wrong!*****Have Fun!*****"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Well... **1/2The Outsiders has potential for \\"being gold\\". There is some very fine, well-written dialouge and unique ideas for the time period (1950s). But on the whole, this was definitely not my favorite book. The characters go through \\"A Series of (Unfortunately) Predictable Events.\\" It's the domino affect: one \\"tradgedy\\" leads to another, with little interest in between. And let's not forget the small but important fact that S.E. Hinton was 16 when she wrote this; this was not written by someone with a college degree in writing. I do not know if anyone noticed but the whole thing is a recycle of \\"West Side Story\\" which the author must have regarded fondly as she wrote the Outsiders. The gangs growl, yell, then fight, the kill somebody, a great unanimous gasp goes up and shakes the love affair going on. The morals are pretty used too--see the good in the world; be yourself, etc. And the characters, with the exception of Ponyboy and Cherry, are very one-dimensional, thin, and cliche. However, as I said before, kudos to the graceful stream of dialouge--that's one thing the author's nailed; conversation rarely sounds cramped and doesn't slack to the usual \\"Greaser\\" talk one might expect.Still, I won't spoil it for you. If you want to read the book, that's fine; just be aware of what you're reading."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy is a youth fourteen years of age split into two personalities, one a good natured boy confused and afraid, the other the classic steriotype of an inner city youth. Set in a dank, inner city neighborhood, two rival social groups have escalated their hatred for eachother to a new level. The &quot;Socs&quot;, one of the groups, are a seemingly endless mob of vicious, violence-frenzied, rich and malevolent problem children dwelling in \\"the West Side\\". The other, named the Greasers, are the home of Ponyboy (the protagonist) and poverty-stricken children fighting for survival. Following his heart, Ponyboy meets a &quot;soc&quot; girl which leads to a chain of events which will forever more, change the greaser's life.This text does not deserve the &quot;20th century classic&quot; rating which has been given to it. While a better 5th Grade reading alternitive to Judy Blume, this book is surprisingly plot-oriented for a supposed &quot;classic&quot;. The book has no reedeeming symbolism, nothing to give to the world, nothing to teach us about ourselves like most classics do. This book is great for young readers though, who can never read a story unless the plot starts in the first few chapters. But for more experienced readers, the book may come off as childish and callow. The plot is hollow, and S.E. Hinton's writing style is quite simple. In conclusion, as a book, &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is decent, not horrible, not great.

This book, and movie only survive because teachers have been taught that they must teach this book.While the \\"idea\\" of this book is interesting, exploring class warfare through the eyes of teenagers, the book itself is not worth reading.

The socs habit of jumping people for kicks has some grave consequences here and things are never the same again for any of the players. One thing leads to another here where Johnny and Ponyboy go into hiding then Johnny dies and Dallas too. I was so sad for Ponyboy and felt his pain at losing his best friend. What a lonely and sad world he suddenly faced for despite the wild ways of Dallas Winston it was Dallas he hung out with along with Johnny and all this ended for him practically overnight.This book is still as good today as it was then and I highly recommend it especially for young people.A.M Torres author of Love Child (sold here on Amazon)"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I loved this book.

It's a real page turner and really relates to real life. The part I really liked was it was written by a teenager, S.E. Hinton. The author wrote it so people my age could relate to it and we could read it easier since it was written on our point of view.The Outsiders is about life. How you can live on either the bad or good side of the tracks which determines whether your a greaser or a soc. The greasers are regular people only they dress differently and aren't great off money wise. The socs are high class kids with a lot of money and too much freedom. The socs and greasers have always been enemies and are always getting into fights with each other. One great thing about the greasers is they are like one big family. For example, Johnny and Ponyboy get into a bad fight and a soc ends up being killed. A friend of theirs helps them escape police and hide out until things cool down. That just goes to show how tight they are with each other. They risk their lives and freedom for each other.I definitely recommend this book to all teenagers. Even if you don't like to read you'll love this book. It really touched me and I wish more people knew how things aren't always how they seem. To let them realize they shouldn't take everything for granted. I know I do now that I've read this book.

I loved it. The narrator, observant but quiet Ponyboy Curtis, tells us that he loves to read books, and often compares things in his life to things he has read about. At the beginning of the novel, Ponyboy has a very shallow perception of the rich West-Side Socs on the other side of town. But as the story progresses he gains more and more perspective on friendship, brotherhood, and life in general. I've seen this concept of growing up so much in many other novels, but never has it been portrayed so uniquely and poignantly as in The Outsiders. As the dust of the storm finally settles, Ponyboy is able to remember the past fourteen days without pain and decides to tell others about it to prevent them from making the same mistakes. This was my favorite part of the story. The literary character of Ponyboy Curtis has inspired me to read more, but none will ever be as good as The Outsiders."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I saw the movie when it first came out years ago. I became &quot;fascinated&quot; by the lives of those boys. Ponyboy, Soda Pop, Two Bit, Darry, Johnny and others. I read the book, as if to continue my longing to understand them more in depth. After reading the book, I was even more entranced. Written from the view point of a 16 yr. old made it easier to relate to. To see these boys grow, living the consequences for their actions and literally grow from them, represents all of us in our pre teen and teenage years. They capture your heart, take you to a time where everything is different. Yet, is still familiar to us. I recommend this novel to anyone, young or old, who likes to read about trials, triumphs, understanding and friendships. The memory of this book and it's characters will remain with you forever. I can testify to that. I read the book in the 1980's and here, almost 20 years later, I'm writing a review on it. So please, give yourself or someone that you love, a chance to become wrapped up in the world of &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.... a classic that taught us that &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\" was written in 1967 by S. E. Hinton andis a story about the life of greasers, people who live in the projects and generally have long greasy hair, in the 1950's and 60's. It is written as a first person narrative by a 14 year old greaser who lives with his two older brothers. Ms. Hinton wrote the book to illustrate prejudice in society and the fact that it is an unfounded bigotry. The book has some interesting and truthful underlying themes woven into it. It shows the different views of people from the stereotyped worlds of the greasers and the Socs, longtime enemies. The Socs are generally characterized as the rich kids who have everything, and the greasers are the indigent thugs with long greasy hair. We see how society favors the one and shuns the other due to the social standing which they have obtained from their money and looks. The Socs are loved by the people because of their appearance and seeming innocence, and if they do something wrong the incident is glossed over or blamed on somebody else. We see this when it is said \\"...Socs... get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next.\\" (pp. 3). The greasers, however, hate the Socs because the Socs attack them just because of their hair or even just for fun. The greasers are looked down upon because they don't have nice houses or because their hair is longer, and society immediately looks to put the blame on them when something goes wrong, not caring whether or not the criticism is earned. Also shown is the fact that not everyone is like the few that the stereotype is based upon. Johnny is a kind, thoughtful teenager who is mugged by Socs just because he isn't clean-cut like them. There is also Ponyboy, who is a handsome boy who does very well in school, would probably fit in perfectly with the Socs, but is poor, and is therefore looked upon as scum. Cherry is a Soc who Pony meets at the movies. In his discussions with her he sees that the Socs can be caring and nice, and aren't all mean rich boys who beat up greasers for fun. Cherry even says \\"...if I see you in the hall at school or someplace and don't say hi, well, it's not personal or anything, but...\\" (pp. 45). Pony and Cherry love many of the same things, but can't be friends in public because Cherry would be scorned and ridiculed for hanging out with him, and Pony would be beat up for even trying to be friends with someone of such high \\"status.\\" \\"The Outsiders\\" brings to the front the problems of social prejudice and categorization that are evident in society, even today. The book shows readers not to discriminate against other people, and the consequences of such an action. Not only is it stupid to ignore and shun people because of social status or appearance, but also many great opportunities for friendships and relationships are passed up. S. E. Hinton did a magnificent job in portraying these truths, and in the process wrote a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I am now a freshman in high school and read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; back in 7th grade because it was required reading for middle school.

I mean, if your a teenager, you'll like this book simply because of the way its written and if your an adult well you will want to be young again. S.E Hinton describes so well this book with feeling, hatred, love, friendship, loyalty and much more. When I finished reading this book, I hoped that I could've been in that period of that time and watch all of those events happen. I just finished seeing the movie today wich includes Tom Cruise as Steve, Matt Dilon as Dally, Patrick Swayzie as Darrie, Rob Lowe as Sodapop and a unknow actor for Ponyboy. The movie is exactly like the book execpt some differences like, in the book they talk about East and West side but in the movie they say North and South.

I can resite it word for word, but yet I still read it. I will never get sick of it. This book changed my perspective of life.

Things can change so fast you won't relise in time to get prepared. Make the most of life. Life can end just as suddenly and unexpectidly as it began. One minute you have friends, and then the next you're alone. If you truly put your mind to something you can acheive anything. You shouldn't dodge your problems, or lie to yourself to make them go away, because they will just get you into more trouble. If you lie to yourself you may belive what you say, and then when you find out it's true it will hurt even more. And last, that having 1 or 2 really good friends is better then having a bunch of school friends,&quot;because thats what they are school friends not buddies.&quot; A book which truley deserved the Marget A.

I'm now pushing 34 and recently read it for the second time. What astounded me the most was that a 16-year-old female (Hinton) wrote a story from a 14-year-old male's point-of-view. Quite an impressive feat! It is a classic, heartwarming story of three brothers (and their friends) fending for themselves as well as against a wicked gang of &quot;high-society&quot; Socs. Of course, the protagonist's story goes deeper than that. My personal favorite part of the entire book was Robert Frost's classic poem, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay,&quot; because it has a personal touch, one I can relate to.

If you are into violence and that kind of stuff than this is a book for you. There are two gangs, the Socs and the greasers. The socs are rich the greasers are poor.

He tries to make every thing okay with the two gangs sometimes other times if he is really mad he doesn't quite want to do that. Overall this book was a terrific book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a book that describes the life of kids that live very close together, but are from two different worlds. The book revolves around the \\"Greasers\\" (lower class) and the \\"Socs\\" (upper class). The Greasers and the Socs don't get along at all and often fight with each other. They both stay on their sides of the city and don't go around each others neighborhood unless they are looking for trouble. Both the Greasers and the Socs are like big gangs, they all stick together and they will help each other out when they need it. Both groups will soon find out though, that the lifestyles and the decisions they make can be costly. One tragic incident makes everyone realize that the problem between the two groups is bigger than they thought and that it was getting out of control. Through all this the characters will learn the importance of family and friends. The difference between them can be over come, if they would look deeper then where people live, what kind of car they drive and where that stand in social status.S.E. Hinton wrote this book when she was a teenager. This is a very well written book and it is exceptional for a teenager. Other books that she wrote, like Rumblefish, are very good also. Rumblefish is similar to The Outsiders."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really enjoyed this book by S.E. Hinton. It is about a bunch of kids(Greasers) who stick with each other and help one another through tough times. The main character, Ponyboy, has two older brothers, Soda and Darry. Ponyboy's best friend, Johnny, killed one of the people in a gang, the Socs. They ran away to the country to hide out. They hid in a church and after a couple of days it caught on fire while Ponyboy and Johnny were at a store. Little kids were playing in the church and then it cought on fire. Ponyboy and Johnny go and save the kids but a burning piece of the ceiling fell on Johnny and he was rushed to the hospital. Johnny eventually died. Another character, Dally, only really cared for Johnny. Johnny was practically like his brother. Since Johnny died, Dally really wanted to die to and he robbed a store. The cops were after him and Dally pulled out a gun and the police shot him. Dally got what he wanted because he always gets what he wants. I also really enjoyed the ending of the book.

In \\"The Outsiders,\\" relationships are based on fear and hatred, even between brothers, as evidenced by Darry and Ponyboy. The two distinct groups, Socs and Greasers, generally keep their distance except to participate in horrific gang fights where one boy is stabbed to death.In the final chapters, the characters gradually release their hatred and become courageous and compassionate people.

Hilton does a great job of describing events and feelings that the characters go through. The book is a little old, but the theme and ideas still are going on in young people's life today. It's an all time classic.Hilton has the best wording to poetry how dire the situation is. My favorite is said by Ponyboy \\"I feel asleep in a hoodlum's jacket, with a gun next to my head.\\" The way she writes just the simplest line, but beneath it is a deep meaning. She brings the character to live. You feel as if you know them and you feel their problems are your own. Her writing is unique, her names different. Ponyboy and Sodapop just two of the cool names she has in her book.This book is great. You'll instantly fall in love with it. The first sentence captures your attention and after that you won't be able to put it down.By Me"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I saw the movie \\"The Outsiders\\" after reading he novel by S.E Hinton. If I could rate the movie with a scale from 1 to 5, I would give it a 4 because of several reasons.I didn't give it the highest score (5) because in some parts, it's kind of boring and the theme is not that interesting. The book is much more interesting than the movie, and I think that they could've done a much better job.Even though, I didn't give it the lowest score because the characters acted very well and they really act according to their personalities. You could tell who was who. Also, the setting was well done.In conclusion, the book is better because you can picture things, how you want. The movie resembled the book, but something of it was missing. I think that if they did it again now, they could add much more detail and make it a lot better."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In the past months, we read an extraordinary book. This book was named \\"The Outsiders\\". This is one of the most interesting and fun books that I had ever read. This is one of the books that had really made me reflect of many things. The problems that were the most important were economical problems, different social classes, and different people's point of view. We saw the movie of \\"The Outsiders.\\" I think the movie wasn't as good as the book, but I did like it. With the book I could feel the different point of view of the characters, and with the movie I could see how they really felt and not just imagine them, actually see it. If I could rate this movie form 1 to 5 I think I could give it a 4. This movie really made me see the different points of view of the characters. I think that the movie was almost the same as the book because the characters almost always said the same think as the movie. The character that I liked the most in the movie was Dallas. He really got into his character as the book said. Also, the settings in the movie were really good; it was as I thought it would be. I really recommend you to read the book and then watch the movie, because if you see only the movie I think you won't understand it as well as if you would read the book. The book will first make you reflect and imagine it and feel everything better, then the movie will show you everything!

He and a fellow greaser, Johnny, are on the run. Johnny has done something no one, especially the socs, will ever forget.During the book, The Outsiders, the reader experiences movies, fire, trains, and the ever famous rumble. The Greasers, as well as the Socs, learn there is more to some people than what is on the surface or how \\"tuff\\" they are.I think the book was phenomenal. It goes into so much depth and truly touches everyone who reads it. I think it puts people into a right state of mind by seeing how truly luck we are.

We read The Outsiders as one of our books this year for Seventh Grade. It was one of the only books I actualy liked that we read in Middle School, besides The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle.The Outsiders was very well written. I really liked how readers got the opportunity to step into Ponyboy Curtis' shoes and see what he thinks about all of the events that happen to him and his pal Johnny.I have a warning for readers: Do not watch the movie before reading the book, it has different parts to it than the book. Read the book then watch the movie, you will like the movie just as well as the book.I have to give S.E. Hinton her props on this because she was only 16 when she wrote it.

In the beginning you feel like you could take on any Soc in the business, but later in the book you come to realize that those stuck up Socs are not the group to get stuck in the mix of.

I wasn't too excited about it at first because it didn't look like my type of book. I thought I'd hate it. Man, was I wrong! Five stars doesn't do this book justice. I don't even think a million stars would. The main character, Ponyboy, and all his friends are greasers. When the word \\"greaser\\" comes to mind, I think of someone who smokes and does all these wild things and is to be avoided at all costs. That's what everyone else thinks of Pony and all his friends. It's not true at all. They're wonderful guys-they just haven't been given the chance to prove it. They can't walk down the street without worrying if they're going to get jumped or not. People spit at them and call them \\"white trash\\" (or worse), or they run from them because they're afraid it'll hurt their reputation-when all they want is to belong. I'll be the first to admit, this is a sad book. An extremely sad book. But it really makes you look at things differently. Pony's parents are dead. He lives with his older brothers, Darry and Soda. He's one of the lucky ones. His friends either have no parents, or they have parents who don't care. Most of them are more cheerful than me! They've tried their best to enjoy their lives, but there really isn't much they can do to make their lives better. Most of them, especially Johnny, Pony's best friend, feel like they have nothing to live for. That's not true. They're all very, very special guys (for those of you who've read this, yeah, even Dally)-they just don't realize it.This is an amazing book-one that I could read again and again. I've never read a book more than once, but I could sit down with this one and read it from start to finish and enjoy every minute of it-time and time again."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"A reader's first impression of The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is a story full of overwhelming violence and unwise actions. You will soon find out that its much more than that. It is a story about a group of boys who are trying to find their inner self and where they belong in the twisted world in which they live. They have to pretend to be people they really aren't. Throughout the story they are in a never-ending battle of rivalry.In a small beat up town in Eastern, Oklahoma a group of young teenage boys who all belong to a group called \\"Greasers.\\" The Greasers consists of Ponyboy, Dally, Darry, Sodapop, Two-bit, and Steve. They call themselves the \\"Greasers\\" as a trademark of where they live and who they are. They are in a constant battle with a group of rich teens from the other side of town. The group is known as the \\"Socs.\\" The Soc's consists of Bob, Randy, Cherry, Marcia, and the rest of the rich teens. The Soc and Greasers all live in a world of hatred and violence towards one another.One night things were taken too far and because of that Johnny and Ponyboy come to the conclusion that they must run away. Trying not to get caught, they sneak onto a train heading for Windrexville in the dark of the night. They reach Windrexville and hide out in an old abandoned church until things at home can settle down. Along the way the boys are faced with many difficult decisions. They decide to cut their hair to disguise themselves and because they are on such a low budget they have to buy supplies that will last a long time.After things settled down, Darry came to get Ponyboy and Johnny and bring them both home. While on the road they happened to see a church that was on fire. They rushed over to the church, jumped in the window and tried to save the children stuck inside. The next day Johnny and Darry find themselves lying in a hospital bed trying to recover from what happened. Then the worse thing happened!In my opinion this was a well-written story that everyone will find interesting and fun to read. The story helps you understand the difficult decisions life brings upon us and how you should be yourself. This is a book that everyone should read.

I had to read it again in 9th grade, and it was still pretty good. Now, as an 11th grader, I read it a third time. Looking back, I can't see why I even liked it!As a Tomboyish 7th grader, the violence and smoking was cool for me. Now that I'm older, it seems childish and stupid. Now, I'm thinking of questions I didn't think of in 7th grade like: Why do these guys get so much enjoyment out of beating up each other? Why didn't Ponyboy and Johnny just go to the police and tell them it was self-defense? How did Darry keep custody of his brothers? And too many other questions!In 7th grade again, there was only one kid in the class that didn't like it. Now, most of the kids in my class don't like it anymore.I also re-watched the movie and that wasn't as bad as the book, but still pretty close. The movie tried to use beautiful music and lovely backgrounds to try to make us feel bad. After the movie and book ended, I was thinking, \\"but what did he learn?\\" What did Ponyboy learn? Not to judge people? Always tell the truth? Respect your brothers? He went through all that just to learn those lessons he already had in the first place? This book was just an endless marry-go-round.If you want a good and less-violent book about coming of age, I'd recomend Sisterhood of the Travel Pants or Can't Get There from Here.Sadly, I'd rather read Twilight (another book I didn't really like) a hundred times before I'd read this again."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"An absoulutly horrible book.

Back then, they were considered a gang, although nowadays, the concept is laughable. Anyway, this so-called &quot;gang&quot; is known as the greasers. They wore leather jackets and had greasy hair. This went back to the Happy Days years. There is also another &quot;gang&quot; called the socs, and they are rivals. The problem is, one day one of the greasers killed one of the socs. This book tells all about all the non-adventures of the greasers. Personally, it sucked big time, but notice how all the adults in this school seemed to like it. Probably because they were alive when people like this existed. So I suppose I should recommend it to all the adults alive in the 50s. This book wasn't up to my standards, seeing how there was extremely annoying characters and promotes smoking and beating people up. Not acceptable for flourishing young minds, but maybe for adults.

You can picture the wide city streets with the shapes that streetlights cast as they reveal pieces of action that happen in the darkness. Since Pony Boy tells the story first hand, the reader can feel the emotions Pony Boy feels for his brothers and his friends. Readers can bring all their pre-formed concepts of what gang life is like, but by experiencing events through Pony Boy's narrative, a new appreciation for rivalry, encounters, and showdowns are formed.

I teach 8th grade English, and my students get extra credit for posting reviews. This is by Mia...DLR :) The book The Outsiders by S.E Hinton was amazing. It tought me so many things. My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy and Johnny went into the church and saved the little kids. That was so heroic. I also liked when Dallas helped Johnny. It showed that Dallas has a kind heart even though he seems tough on the outside. My comment on the book is that kids who love excitement and drama should read this book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"S.E. Hinton's novel of class conflict, choice and determination, set in 1950s Oklahoma, creates empathy for characters that live on the periphery of society. Hinton's protagonist, Pony boy, along with his fellow \\"gang\\" members, including Two-bit, Dally, Darry and Johnny, are \\"greasers\\". Outwardly, they are an unsavory lot. They wear their hair long and greasy, wear jeans, t-shirts and, if they can eat chocolate cake and soda for breakfast, live in unfashionable homes in poor neighborhoods and are generally doomed to poor-paying blue-colored jobs. They do little to endure themselves to those who are not of their group. For instance, at the drive-in movie, they \\"introduce\\" themselves to some girls through uncouth behavior.The average greaser's nemesis is the \\"soc\\". The soc comes from a privileges background, wears fashionable clothing and often enjoys his or her parents' indulgence.Hinton, through a series of plot elements, presents the greasers as the misunderstood heroes of the book. For instance, Johnny, the least aggressive of the greasers, kills a soc. However, the killing is clearly presents as a case of self-defense. Further, we understand that Johnny had previously been savagely beaten by the very same soc who, on this occasion, without question, had intended to kill Johnny. Johnny later suffers fatal wounds when he rescues a group of children from a burning church- the same building in which he and Pony boy had been hiding out subsequent to the killing of Bob.The toughest greaser also is portrayed sympathetically. Even when Dally ends up being shot by the police after he attempted armed robbery, Dally seems more a tragic than a threatening figure. Pony boy reveals that Dally's gun did not hold and bullets; Dally desperate act is attributed to his inability to cope with Johnny's death.Throughout the book, the greasers are portrayed as loyal and misunderstood, imbued with an anger and despair that has been etched upon their psyches through years of abuse and neglect.Despite this, Johnny and Pony boy are able to maintain a grasp upon their humanity. Johnny pays with his life. Pony boy's fate is more promising. His nervous collapse at the end of the novel galvanizes the resolve of the rest of the greasers. They vow to break the cycle wherein their fate seems pre-determined if not for their own sake, then for Pony boy's. \\"Don't get tough,\\" Two-Bit urges Pony, \\"You're not like the rest of us and don't try to be (Hinton 1989, p. 152).&qout; Soda reminds him, \\"I you don't have anything, you end up like Dallas... and I don't mean dead, eather (Hinton 1989, p. 152).\\"Where Hinton's vision lacks courage is in her portrayal of the greasers as societal victims who lack genuine flaws. Certainly the greasers keep irregular hours, watch too much television, smoke and have poor diets, but they do not have serious faults. Any faults can be readily attributes to their circumstances and to the inequitable political and social systems that subjugate them. Hinton's novel would have been more of an achievement had she been able to generate empathy for the members of an underclass who are not simply \\"noble savages\\". It is easy to accept the romantic portrayal of a marginalized class of people; it is difficult to accept a cold, accurate rendering of the same group, especially when the group's attitudes, values and behaviors are profoundly different from those of the reader.Still, Hinton's work, while it is often sentimental, is also also sensitive and even poetic. We can hear Hinton herself speaking through Pony boy when he laments, \\"I could picture hundreds and hundreds of boys living on the wrong sides of cities, boys with blink eyes who jump at their own shadows. Hundreds of boys who maybe watch sunsets and looked at stars and ached for something better (Hinton 1989, P. 155)."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was an intense book. It was an intense book because there was fighting. In the book I had pity for Pony Boy. I had pity for him because he had two good friends that where like brothers to him. There were two parts of the city, one for rich and one for the poor. Rich people always were the people that got what they wanted. The poor people got treated like dirt. So to get even they would fight. At the end they had a intense rumble.The rumble is a no rule fight. The rich people drove mustangs and the poor people walked. They called poor people greasers and rich people socks. To see who wins this rumble and to see what happens next, read this book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"ponyboy is a 14 year old boy whohas 2 brother. their name are darry and soda. darry is the oldest and soda is the middle child. ponyboys parents die in a car accident when he is a little kid. ponyboy and soda live with darry as long as they are not in trouble. a problem occur when darry hit pnyboy for coming home late. then ponyboy rushes out of the house and see johny his firend and told him they were gonna run away. they ran for a couple of blocks and then went to a park. then the socc came was about to drown ponyboy so johnny pull out a knife and kill a socc member named bob. they went to dallys home which he gave ponyboy his jacket and told them where to go and hide. when they get there they have to cut thir long hair so they wont be reconized. then dally comes to find them and gives ponyboyboy a note soda wrote. it said that darry is sorry that he had hit him. then a church is burning and ponyboy dally and johnny are helping and get sent to the hospital. there he meets and gets reunited with his brother and darry says sorry. johnny was in critical condition and l=had to say in the hospital and do did dally but dally was okay. they get home and 2 bit is gonna take ponyboy to the hospital to see his friends. on their way back pony boy is drowsy and 2 bit feels his forehead and told ponyboy that he look like he had a fever. he said he would be okay.he also had a headache. whe took about 5 asperins so he can stay awake for the rumble. then he hears that johnny dies and dally robbs a store. he saw dally kill himself and ponyboy fell and fainted. by the time he woke up his brothers were tellin him wat happened. pony boy had a small concussionand was stressed. he had to stay in bed for the week. his friend from school came to visit him. then his friend said something about johnny and ponyboy kepted reapeatin johnny is not dead and darry told his friend he should go. he was in shock to know his friend was dead"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was a really good book.

THE OUTSIDERSThe outsiders is a really good book. \\" Ponyboy, Ponyboy are you okay, \\" Johnny said as he was running over to him. This is the change of their whole lives.Friends are always there for you. When Johnny killed the soc at the park. Dally gave him money to live on until Dally got up to where they were staying. It reminds me when I was getting made fun of . My friend was there right by my side. I am always there for my brother when he gets made fun of just because he is fat, but I tell him that they are just doing that just to make you made. My sister always told me that if someone is hurting may be someone died in their family that you should always be a friend to them no matter what.You always have some one there for you at all times. When Johnny would come home at night when his dad and mom would hit him. They would always yell at him and so Ponyboy and the gang was there for him. It reminds me of when I am always sick. My mom would always be there for me. She would be right by my side. She would always give me my medicine and make my eat my food so I could get better. It also reminds me when my sister is sick I am always there for her. The Outsiders is really a good book. I enjoyed reading the=e book in class.Johnny was an abused child. His mom and dad would always hit, yell at him when they were drunk. I really fill bad about kids that get abused because their parents would be drunk or they will not do what the parents because it is something bad and they don't want to do whatever it is. Johnny wouldn't come home for that night because they would still be drunk. Just like when Johnny was in the hospital and he didn't want to see his mother at all. He told the nurse that he didn't want to see his mother because of what had happened the night before.The book is a very sad ending because after the rumble. Ponyboy and Dally went to the hospital to check on Johnny to see if he was okay. They were there for little bit when Johnny died. Dally ran out of the hospital. He want to the gas station and he robbed it. He ran to the park and the police shot him three times in the back. Ponyboy wrote the story about what had happened at the end...."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I first began this novel I was expecting very much not to like it. I was completely wrong. The book was one that I was not able to put down. The endless twists and turns kept the book interesting, and the conflict between the \\"Socs\\" and the \\"Greasers\\" was well developed.The book gave a good background on how gang life could be, as well as showing life from the eyes of a child who has lost his mother and father. Life at home was tough for Ponyboy having to deal his overprotective brother Darry. When it got real bad he ran away, or at least tried to before those \\"Socs\\" almost killed him. Ponyboy learned a lot about life and seemed to grow wiser as the novel went on.The two gangs were completely opposite in the novel. This is what caused the endless conflict between them. Every little disagreement ended in violence and at some points, death. In many scenes I had the urge to step into the book and stop everything because it was getting out of hand. It was ridiculous what these groups would do to each other, and they never held back. Although I disagreed greatly as to how they handled these conflicts, the outcomes were well written and believable.The book taught me a lot about how life might have been for kids my age at an earlier time period. I have heard a lot about how gangs were very preeminent in the past. The book showed a lot about friendship and how to stick up for each other. These kids did whatever it took to protect their fellow gang member, even if it meant getting in a whole lot of trouble. The book also made me think about what it would be like if there were gangs like this at my school. How tough life would be on everybody. Sure my school is very cliquey but it never really results in a rivalry between groups.I would recommend this book to anyone who is in for excitement and anyone wanting to learn about true friendship. The book keeps you guessing till the end, but amidst the rivalry there is one boy learning about life on his own, the tough way."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book was about three brothers with without a Father or a mother, there names are Ponyboy, Soda, and Darry. Ponyboy is an &#65533;A&#65533; student in his high school. There all in a gang called the greasers. Almost every week they will get into a rumble (a gang fighting a gang) with the Socs. One day one of the Greasers kills a Soc with a knife. Everybody thought that Ponyboy did it but it wasn&#65533;t. The person that did it was a hero and a murderer. He was a here because he saved all the children in a burning Church. But, then he get hospitalized because a big burning stick jabbed right into his back and made him paralyzed from his back to his legs. He dies a few days later of internal bleeding.I liked the book because it was very realistic. It was also scary, too, in some places. But most of all I liked it because it was a suspense book. It was realistic because it showed how the character acts and thinks. And another thing was when I read the book I couldn&#65533;t stop reading it. I just kept on reading it.I chose the book because I found it on the shelf and I heard that it is a good book. Plus my teacher told me that it is good.

By the end of the novel I was so wrapped up in the book I was sad that the book had ended. The words that the autor used made you feel like you were actually part of the book and knew the characters. The book was very moving,both funnyand sad.I would catch myself laughing outloud at some of the parts in the book, and at other parts crying. It seemed as I was reading the that S.E.Hinton had experienced all the things she was writing about by the way she wrote them, by reading the book you would assume she was in a gang or had a best friend die in a fire or even rob a store.

But you will soon realize it's a heartfelt story. It gives emotion and shows love and the power of friendship.Ponyboy, a 14 year-old hoodlum, is growing up with his controlling older brother Darry, and his softer brother sodapop who's the only one Pony can relate to. He's a good kid, and does great in school, and is just like every other boy his age, but the only problem is that he's a greaser. As a greaser, Pony and his gang are constantly fighting the Soc; the upper class.All the conflicts start when Johnny, Pony's best buddy, end up going to a movie together one night. They meet two Soc girls and when their boyfriends find out later that night, and a conflict erupts, Pony and Johnny are forced to run away.As the boys are hiding away there, they teach each other different things about life. They learn importance in things that didn't mean so much to them before then. But when tragedy strikes the boys are there to become heroes. After risking their lives, a bigger problem arises and Pony fears the loss of someone close to him.Throughout the story Pony has faced many problems but he wasn't ready for what happens later. As he is dealing with his biggest fear ever, he's also helping his gang stop the hatred and violence once and for all against the Soc. This story is full of suspense and will likely keep you in tuned."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"\\"So it doesn't do any good, the fighting and the killing.\\" This was a lesson both worlds (the socials and the greasers) had to learn in the book the Outsiders. Almost all that happened with the socials and the greasers had to do with fighting, or even killing. Johnny, Pony Boy, and the rest of their gang dealt with the first hand. In fact a couple of them have committed these acts, even killing. All this fighting you'd think they'd learn or even try to fix it. That's how this story came to be.When you think of Pony boy, a main character in the book, you'd probably think he's sensitive but brave. Also he has a pretty good personality for where he lives. Dally, on the other hand, is rough and mean. He's always into trouble and not many people get along with him. Soda Pop is in between. He's handsome and brave but fights a lot. Johnny is a scared, but can be brave boy who's lost in his dying world. Cherry Valance is a smart, pretty soc who decides to help the greasers in the war against the Socials because she hates the fighting and will do anything to stop it.So when Pony Boy and Johnny get jumped and up roar occurs in their group. So as Johnny and Pony Boy run away things start occurring until they suddenly find themselves back in their home town but not the way they had intended returning. All the while there's a big rumble being planned between the Socials and the Greasers to end all battles. This motivates many of the characters to be ready and win this rumble so they can stop some of the violence.

Hinton as a story full of overwhelming violence and hatred. In reality, this adventure filled story is about a group of boys trying to find their inner selves. Throughout the story there is a never-ending battle between the Greasers, a gang of economically poor teenagers, and the Socs, (short for socials) another gang that is a rich, well to do group of teenagers. The Outsiders is a story full of love, horror, suspense, and reality that creates a story line that is a great read for all ages.In a small, beat-up town in Oklahoma, teens like Ponyboy suffer from societal pressures such as violence, drugs, and even more. Pony, a member of a small gang who call themselves the Greasers, struggles in life because of family situations as well as peer relationships. For example, Pony believed that his brother Darry, a serious and hard working man, hated him. Also, almost every member of the Greaser gang feels that they are not socially accepted by all of their peers. A few of the members do not care, but Pony and Johnny are affected by this and especially want to be equal with everybody. They were motivated to be in a gang and fight because they wanted to appear tougher than the other gangs, which in their eyes would make them be better as a person.One night, things are taken too far between the Socs and Greasers. Something serious happens and Pony and Johnny's whole life changes in an instant. They are filled with regrets and wish they could have that night back so they could make better choices. They are forced to run away to an old abandoned church in a small town in the country side called Windrixville. During this difficult time, Pony recites a poem called \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\\" By remembering this poem, Pony wants to teach his friends to stay gold by staying true to themselves like the poem says. This poem sets the stage for the rest of the book. In the middle of each turn of events, Pony and his friends take one step at a time and start to realize that violence will not take them anywhere in life. They also begin to realize this from their young 16 year old friend, Johnny. He is the first one to realize this and he tells them not to fight anymore because it does not help their circumstances in life.The Outsiders is a great book that is likely to catch any reader's attention. It is an awesome story throughout the entire book. In the end, Pony officially finds himself as a person and is able to keep his own personality with the help of his friends. As a result, this book comes close to reality and at the same time it teaches a lesson that everyone should know about life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When a glance is given to the book The Outsiders, the cover might not catch the eye.

I loved the book. I wanted to read and read it see what was going to happen next. There was alot of interesting scenes in the story that i liked. Like when Ponyboy and Johnny saved the kids, or when they all fought the socs. That helped me realize that fighting isn't the right thing to do and that no one is really better than you, even if they have money and you dont. It can help alot of boys and girls realize that fighting and making fun of each other doesn't solve anything but someone getting hurt. People should get to know each other before they say things about them. Like Ponyboy and Randy did. I am sure they talked about each other but they finally made peace with each other.

Ponyboy portrays any regular Joe, and the Greasers can relate to any kind of gang or group of friends that care about each other.

Specially the scenes where Ponyboy is loyal to his gang and also when he feels insecure about his ideals and thoughts we have all been through something like this.

Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser, is a high school student in a city where gangs are formed based on the part of town the gang members call home. Simply put, the socs have more than the greasers do, more money, more privilege, and therefore more status in the community. When a violent encounter erupts with Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny versus several drunken socs it exposes them to the series of wild events, Ponyboy experiences first-hand the uselessness of fighting and dying for an illogical division in class. Although there is one violent scene, the story really deals with how the people he meets in his young path towards emerging manhood affect Ponyboy's relationships and perceptions. His experiences with his brothers, his greaser friends, and even a few socs are all affected by his relationships with each other, and he comes to believe that if differences exist, they are only in the unwillingness each group has to changes established, habitual behavior."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I will focus on the content and context of the book The Outsiders by S.E.Hinton. I'll say this is a pretty outrageous decent independent reading book. I believe it's a book that if I was introduced to earlier in my schoolyears or life, I would have been more interested in the book because I've already been through most of this stuff.I would definitely recommend this book to some younger readers.The author gives good complete detail of events that take place in the neighborhood. For example the details she gives on the gangs, violence, people and kinds of situations that's inside the neighborhood.I believe that someone younger will have more interest than I did. I had slight interest in the book. Someone younger might learn more, because its plot and themes might come up in the actual life we live today in different environments. Some of the things they've been through had actually been situations in neighborhoods that I've resided or been in. For example, people get killed in my neighborhood and the person that killed them skip town so that they won't get caught.So therefore I believe that it's a very interesting book.

The Greasers from the other side of tracks are stereotypical bad boys. Ponyboy a Greaser lives with his brothers. One day Ponyboy and his friend Johnny decide to talk to the Socs girlfriends. The Socs disapprove and beat them up, just for socializing with the girls. A Soc boy tries drowning Ponyboy, but Johnny grabs him off and kills him.

Trust me and do yourself a flavor and READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The first of the first. Not only is this the first teen novel ever recognized as such, but it is also one of the first books publicized as, \\"About teen-agers, for teen-agers, by a teen-ager\\" (according to the original hardback's bookflap). Written by a seventeen year-old girl, cleverly hiding her first name behind initials as so many female authors still do (paging J.K. Rowling). The book is still taught today and has slowly graduated from a contemporary tale using new slang and terms to a historical view of kids living in an urban setting before the massive takeover of drugs and electronics.In this book, the lines are clearly drawn. You are either a Greaser or a Soc. Socs are rich over-privileged kids (all white) given too much license and too little interest by their parents. Hinton suggests that the only way they can \\"feel\\" is to fight the Greasers in the town. Why anyone in their right mind would want to fight a Greaser is beyond me. Greasers are the poor kids (all white) that live on the wrong side of the tracks. Everyone's familiar with the stereotypical John Travolta in \\"Grease\\" type character. They're harsh and mean but, as we see in this tale, they have good hearts every one. Our hero is one Ponyboy Curtis. Apparently 1967 was the last year you could be named \\"Ponyboy\\" and not get daily thrashings from your peers for having such a la-de-dah name. With his crew of fellow Greasers and friends, Ponyboy's a great student and a nice guy. When he gets involved in a game of murder by bad luck, he's finds himself on the run with fellow innocent wide-eyed Greaser Johnny. From this experience the two learn what is really important, and Ponyboy finds the strength to tell the story of this friends and their lives.The idea that this book was written by a seventeen year-old is still shocking to me. There's a real maturity to the text, no question. Sure, some ideas are pounded into the reader over and over until you're completely sick of them. But the characters really do exhibit a sense of affection for one another. You believe that Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darry are brothers. You understand the love Dally felt for the puppy dog-like Johnny. The book does take on a kind of \\"West Side Story\\" track at certain times, no question. On their way to a rumble, the characters actually burst into song ala \\"Officer Krupky\\". And where are all the minorities? Severely lacking (and therefore making this book less of a great choice to teach in high schools these days).Hinton, being a woman, has an odd take on females in this book. Ponyboy is not interested in the girls in his social set. Greaser girls are, according to him, too harsh and unfeminine. The Soc girls, on the other hand, are just his type. Personally, I was a little offended by the idea that the richer a girl is the more desirable she becomes. But what's a classic tale without some archaic elements?It is a little hard to forgive the slang of this book at times. But compared to some other slangy novels, this one's pretty good. There is the occasional, \\"You dig okay\\", and other unfortunate phrasings, but they're kept to a bare minimum. I'm not surprised this book is taught in high schools around the country either. Swearing is non-existent and violence is, while common, deplored. This is a pretty darn squeaky clean story. Fortunately, it's eminently readable and somewhat deserving of its status as a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"That book is one of the greatest book I have ever read!

How hard will live get if you need to bleach your hair and run from the police? Ponyboy has many problems that he needs to face in the book The Outsiders, written by the author S.E. Hinton.Ponyboy a normal everyday boy, passing in school and to get in trouble everyday or two, but the hardest thing in his live is to be part of a gang called the greasers. Wearing their hair slick back and a leather jacket, jeans and a white shirt. Ponyboy is the weakest in the gang, but he is also is the youngest in the gang. Only the middle-class and upper class hates them. The upper class has the biggest problem they were known as the socs, short for the socialites. They think the greasers are no good. The socs are known to drive mustangs and to drink lots of whisky.Ponyboy is the youngest in the family and is being raised by his two brothers (Sodapop and Darry) since their parents died many years ago. Darry is the leader of the gang and is all tough and is known to not get in trouble but that is the opposite of sodapop he is known to get in a lot of trouble with his friend twobit. Ponyboy is the smartest of them all because they were forced to drop out of school to get a job and get money in the house. Well it seems like it all went well, through the time until many of the greasers were being founds with blood gushing from their heads, and cuts over their body and to later find out that the socs were behind this all. The socs soon tried again against two younger boys Johnnycake and Ponyboy, they started to drown Ponyboy so johnnycake helped him but it wasn't something smart (this was when the climax was reached)... Read the book to find out the ending. Later on a new problem was unraveled, there was going to be a rumble, but the only weapons to use were your fists, the first gang to leave loses, well they did as told but it wasn't the socs and the greasers who went to the fight. The greasers had many other gangs had been on their side, like two other gangs from other towns. Ponyboy ended up getting thrown around, and many people have brought the rule, people came out with bloody noses and even a black eye. Although Ponyboy was the youngest he had to help his friend Johnnycake out, since he was down one arm since he was in a fire earlier that month. One gang soon left.... Read the book to find out!The author has done a great job and effort to make this book. S.E. Hinton has made this book interesting by adding the lingo that many kids use today like \\"We ain't going to lose\\" and stuff like that. S.E. Hinton has many mouthwatering moments in this book and it is the hardest thing to do is put the book down, that is like impossible.My group and I came to a decision that this book is recommended to kids from the grades of 5^-8th. This book teaches you the right from wrong. And by reading this book it will help you to stay out of trouble all of high school, it will make you think that \\"Should I do that and what are the consequences?\\"This book review has been made from the school of Highland, also known as White Plains Middle school. White Plains, New York.

She also shows how two sides can come together if they put their differences aside and how ignorant it is to judge somebody based entirely on the kind of car they drive or the clothes they wear, or even the side of town they live in.

It was a fun-filled book that made me want to keep reading. I was always wondering what was going to happen next. The two gangs continuously brawling and one time someone got killed. This was a very suspenseful book because I never could predict what was going to happen next. The book was short, but long enough to get all the details in, like the character, and a detailed description of what was going on at every moment. And the book was very easy to read. Even though I cant relate to any of the characters in the book, I can imagine what it would be like to be in a gang. Being in a gang would be very hard because you are expected to do a lot, like get into a fight if someone makes fun of you. And if you don't then you let the whole gang down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"We all feel like outsiders at one time or another. Hinton gives a taste in this book of how it is to be an outsider with now feasible way out. Ponyboy and his friends in the \\"gang\\" are trapped. By the end of the book, Ponyboy realizes that the Socs feel the same way even though they are financially and socially secure. I recommend this book to anyone, especially boys for whom it is difficult to find good reading material. It denouces cliques and bigotry."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I loved this book! Its the best one ive ever read. The characters are unforgetable!

These boys are known as greasers because of their rough tough looks and attitudes. This gets them into a lot of trouble with the police and the Soc's. As the main character would have explained Soc's are nothing but white trash with Madras and Mustangs, by the end he figured different. There are rumbles, murders, robberies, and runaways so this book is really exciting.Many of the things that go on in this book don't typically happen these days. Sure some of them do but it is not a thing you hear about on a day-to-day basis. There are few things I can personally relate to in this book, but there are many things I am able to understand that the characters are going through throughout the entire book. The three main characters in the book are Darry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy. They are all brothers. There are some characteristics of Darry's that I share. Darry has a lot of muscle and brains just like I do. He can also be rather cold at times, but once in a while he is affectionate.This was a very good book. This book is one that everyone should read at least once. There is at least one character that everyone will in some way feel close to whether it is because they act alike or because they have the same personality. You will find a character that you can identify with.The thing I liked most about this book is that there is a lot of action and if you read this book you will know what I am talking about.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a good action book and a good story. I give this book a 9 out of 10 stars on all levels. You need to read this book to know what I am talking about, so just read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The story of The Outsiders is about a rival gang between the Socs and the Greasers. The Socs are rich kid gangs that hate the Greasers who are less well off, for no particular reason. The story tells about gang members Ponnyboy, Johnnycake, and Dally. Ponnyboy and Johnnycake are the youngest members of the Greasers gang Dally is a mean, crude person who gets in a lot of fights and trouble; in fact, he lives for it. Soda, Ponnyboy's brother is high on life and gets into fights for the fun of it. Darry, Pohnnyboy's oldest brother, is a hard tough person who tries to be both a father and a big brother to his two younger brothers.It is easy for readers to relate to the characters in The Outsiders because they seem like real people. Soda stands out to me because I enjoy life just like Soda does. Ponyboy describes Soda as a person that gets drunk on life. He lives for drag racing and dancing and gets drunk on life without ever touching a beer. In many ways, Soda leads the life I'd like to have. Ponnyboy is another character that comes easily to life in the book. I understand just how Pohnnyboy feels about the loss of his parents because my dad left my mother. Ponnyboy often daydreams about the times when his family was together. He remembers his mom's chocolate cakes and his dad's kidding. Then suddenly reality hits. I would often daydream about how life was better befor mom and dad were fighting. Then reality would snap me back. These are some of the ways this book was real for me.I think this book is excellent and provides credible portrayal of city gang life. My favorite part of the book was the bonding that came about as a result of the deaths of some of the gang members. They begin to give more appreciation and commitment to each other's needs. I also liked the part where Cherry the Soc cheerleader begins to understand why the Greasers act the way they do.I would recommend this book to young readers. Many young people who are in gangs today will find many things in common with the Greasers. There is a lesson here for everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I liked the book the outsiders because it showed the conflicts between two different social classes.

Some of the main characters were Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darry Curtis, Johnny, and Dallas were also part of the Greaser gang and the Socs, another gang, the Greasers' enemy, are some of the main characters. The Greasers ran into many fights and disasters throughout the novel, in which they had to deal with. The character in this story that I admired the most was Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy was the youngest in the gang and family, therefore one would think he would be most affected by the other Greasers' actions, but it was the total opposite. I feel that he was the backbone of the gang and family because he was intelligent, compassionate and truly the one who kept the gang together and under control when things got wild.In reality, I can't relate to any of the characters in the story because the whole novel revolves around the environment and the gangs that they are involved with and my surroundings aren't in any way like that. Nor have I ever done some of things that they have done or felt any of the feelings that they have experienced.I thought that this was remarkable novel that every teenager at some point should have the privilege of reading. The whole entire book was exciting and adventurous, there wasn't a single chapter that I didn't enjoy. Although, if I could change one element in the novel it would be that the Greasers would not express, but at least realize and appreciate the very large asset and benefit that Ponyboy was to the gang. I think that both male and female teenagers would very much value and enjoy this story. I hope that all of the people that will read this extraordinary novel will appreciate and love this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Adi R.The Outsiders, by S.E.Hinton is about a young teenager named Ponyboy, a member of the Greaser gang. He has two brothers, Sodapop who is also know as Soda and Darrel who is also known as Darry. Ponyboy loves Soda more than anyone in his family including his parent who had just recently passed away. In the gang there was also Two-Bit, the oldest of all Greasers, Steve, Dally and Johnny. Johnny, whose parents on't care for him, had just recently been jumped by the Socs, the other gang in town. In this book the Socs get away much easier than the Greasers, for example if there were a rumble in between the two gangs the Greasers would get much more severe punishments.I could relate to Johnny because about two years ago two kids came over to me when I was walking down the block with my friend and started a fight with me and my friend. Like Johnny, I had to protect myself, so I had the same feeling he had when he and Ponyboy were walking in the park and the bunch of Socs jumped them. Although, I didn't get into as much trouble as Johnny was in.I really liked the book, The Outsiders. My favorite part of the book was when Johnny and Ponyboy met Cherry. It showed that even though they were from different gangs they still kept a great relationship and a strong bond. The way they didn't drop there relationship showed me that though they kept it secret it showed that they really had great relationship.

Darry which was Ponyboy's brother he was very pertictave and he takes care and loves Ponyboy a lot.Jonny which was Ponyboy's friend always hang's out with Ponyboy.Sodapop which is Ponyboy's older brother lets Ponyboy do what hewants but takes care of Ponyboy. Jonny ran into a lot of problems what happened is the Socs bet him up and they also bet Ponyboy. My favorite character was Darry beacuse he was taking care of the family and loved Ponyboy and Sodapop but he wasent the oldest he is in the middle.I felt like Ponyboy because many people make fun of him and beat him up. Because it goes by the rich poor or in the middle I know I'm not rich and im not poor im in the middle and Ponyboy wasen't he was poor thats one thing that isn't alike about me and Ponyboy, but what is, is that we both get hitten by others and made fun by people. One more thing is that we are both loved by our familys. I liked the book a lot because it was intresting and it is a kind of book that you want to know what happens next. My favoite part of the book is when Darry yellled at Ponyboy when he got home and then Ponyboy ran away from home. my least favorite part of the book was when Jonny and Ponyboy got betten up by the Socs.

Hinton, is about two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. One day after the movies Ponyboy, a member of the Greasers, comes home late and his brother Darry starts yelling at him. Ponyboy runs away and picks up Johnny whois also a member of the Greasers. They both go to the park and meet the Socs who started hurting Ponyboy, as Johnny could not watch this anymore he pulls out a knife and kills Bob, a member of the Socs. Everything turns around and now they have to run for their lives from the police. The adventure begins now, but you have to read the book to yourself to figure out the ending!In the story, I relate to Ponyboy because he has gone through a lot of fights. Sometimes I get into fights at a baseball field by my house because there is a group of kids there that don't let anybody play. When Johnny killed Bob, he felt scared. I felt the same thing on the first day of a new school when I was little. I didn't know what to do, so I started panicking and felt scared.I liked the book a lot and my favorite part of the book was the middle because it was exciting. It was when Johnny killed Bob because you don't know what is going to happen next and it gets exciting. I didn't have a least favorite part of the book because the whole book was good. This book is good for boys and girls ages 10-14. If I could change something in the book it would be when Johnny and Ponyboy were at the movies because they talked to the girls for a long time. The whole chapter was about the two boys talking to the girls about different things and it got a little boring. This book was very exciting and fun to read!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I first encountered this book many years ago when I was in eight grade. My English teacher had us read the book. I read the book two times that year because it was such a good book that I wanted to read it again. I have also read the book several times since that eight grade class. This book is a great book for both boy and girl readers and can be followed up, if using it in a classroom, with the movie by the same title.The Outsiders is told in first-person by Ponyboy, a greaser. Throughout the book there is struggle and conflict between the socs (the rich kids from one side of town) and the greasers (the poor kids from the opposite end of town). One night Ponyboy falls asleep in the lot and returns home way past his curfew. His oldest brother Darrel,or Darry as he is usually refered to, is extremely mad at Ponyboy for worrying his two older brothers and not being considerate enough of other people when he acts. Ponyboy lives with his two older brothers because his parents were killed in a car accident. After Ponyboy and Darry argue Darry accidentally hits Ponyboy out of anger. This causes Ponyboy to run away but he planned to go home until the socs show up in their turf. The socs attempt to drown Ponyboy causing his best friend Johnny to kill one of the socs. The book then turns into an out of control spiral as Johnny and Ponyboy runaway to an abandon church. The book is told from Ponyboy's perspective of the events to insue after that dreadful night.This book is a must read for middle school students. Although written towards the middle school audience this book can be enjoyed by high school students as well. This book will have you on your toes wanting to know what will happen next so if you haven't picked up this book yet then do it now.

This is an novel written by S.E.Hinton in 1967. Ponyboy is the main character of this book who acts strong asnd brave. He also uses his head more during the book. The theme of this book is a character called Pony who figured that everyone is all the same and just humans.His parents were killed in an auto wreck. He lives with his brothers Darry and Soda because his parents were killed. He goes to the movies alone and gets jumped by the Socs, a gang of rich spoiled kids. Later in the book Pony goes to the movies with his friends Johnny, Dally, and Two-Bit and they find some Soc girls. They walk the girls home. Then they get caught by the Socs. Later Pony and Johnny meet up with the Socs and Johnny does someting illegal and they have to go hide. What will happen next? Are they going to survive?I don't like to read, but I thought this was a pretty good book. The time period was the 1960's and they do more stuff like fighting. One thing I didn't like was the bad environment for Pony because he gets hit by Darry. One thing I did like was the movies-fun scene ( Dally was smarting off to the Socs girls.) During the book the big events were explained in detail. Kids who might like to read this book are people who like tragic and action books. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 because the language used by the characters was sometimes hard to understand and confusing.Written by Josh H."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Although many readers have obviously found a great deal of enjoyment in this book, I kept thinking about the parallels between this book and the sterilized violence in \\"West Side Story\\". While young adult authors like Walter Dean Myers have used this same theme to a more realistic extreme, Myers's work never felt like an \\"Afterschool Special\\". While I can appreciate what the book must have been in 1967, I felt as though it falls a little flat today.Most people are familiar with the all-star cast of the movie before they even read the book. Having never seen the movie, I absolve myself of this prejudice. The book is centered on one of two conflicting gangs, the Greasers. Their conflicts with the wealthier Socs often turn violence. At the center of the Greasers' story is Ponyboy. The youngest of three brothers, he recently lived through the death of both parents. Granted to the custody of his oldest brother and elder of the Greasers, Ponyboy is a target. Ultimately, the choice of the book is whittled down to whether Ponyboy wants to continue living with his brothers or continue his life of violence and risk losing his family.There are points where the story takes some unrealistic terms, but it is still able to make its points and advance the plot. The way the author choses to end the book is also rather clever. Still, I missed something in the book that draws in so many readers. This is not to suggest it is a bad book so much as it is not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book already, I am reading it in class and i just love it, buy it, read it, love it (:"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders 40th Anniversary editionThe Outsiders is the quintessential middle school book. It always seemed so corny to me, like West Side Story, so I never read it. Then last year when my son was in seventh grade, his language arts teacher assigned it to the class. My son loved The Outsiders so much, he devoured all of S. E. Hinton's books and hungered for more when he'd exhausted the Hinton canon. I saw that last year The Outsiders was on a list of top ten paperback children's books of all time. It's no wonder, as there is little to date this book, and teens dig it as much today as they did in the late sixties when it was first published. And, I confess, I love it, too.The Outsiders centers on Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser who lives on the wrong side of the tracks with his two older brothers. His parents had been killed in a car wreck; his oldest brother Darry, the twenty-year-old head of the family, works two jobs to keep the family together. Middle brother Sodapop, a sixteen-year-old high-school dropout, works at a gas station. The family's goal is to stay together and keep fourteen-year-old Ponyboy, a bright studious kid, in school. Ponyboy is a dreamer, who loves movies and books, but, according to Darry, lacks commonsense. Darry is worried that because Ponyboy doesn't think and often gets into trouble, he and Sodapop will be taken away and put in a home.As if the boys don't have enough to worry about, being greasers, they are engaged in class warfare with the Socs, the gang of rich kids who live on the other side of town. As Ponyboy says, \\"It wasn't fair for the Socs to have everything. We were as good as they were; it wasn't our fault we were greasers.\\" One night Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are attacked by a group of Socs; the ensuing fight leaves one kid dead and two on the run.Hinton wrote The Outsiders when she was sixteen and understands the teenage mind as only a teenager can. She herself said that she wrote it at the right time, as \\"the feelings you have at sixteen you can't recapture.\\" And her focus is completely on the teenagers, as there are no major adult characters. Like a Charlie Brown cartoon, Ponyboy's world is free of parents. Ponyboy's parents were loving, but are now dead. Most of the living parents are abusive and neglectful, and many of the greasers often stay over at Ponyboy's house. The absence of parents adds an element of fun. If Ponyboy and his brothers want chocolate cake for breakfast, they bake a cake. If they want friends to hang around all night, their friends come over. I suspect this aspect of the book is a big draw for the teens. What teenager doesn't at some point daydream about a life without parental interference?"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Although I am a reader, I am not a particularly avid reader of fiction. I'm an even less avid reader of what most people would consider \\"classic literature\\", i.e. the kind of books that are usually required reading in public schools. Meaning my basis of comparison to other similar books is fairly limited.I first read this book years ago while I was still in 8th grade. Despite the fact that I was not much of a reader back then, I took a liking to it. Years later, I finally got around to rereading it, twice so far now, and I would definitely reread it again. As with most purely fiction books, it's hard to describe what makes them so appealing, but I'll try.I think one of the things I REALLY appreciated about this book, especially when I was in 8th grade, is its simplicity. It's one of those books that's so simple, it's beautiful. It does not try to use pompous, flowery language. It's not one of those annoyingly long books that's 600+ pages long and should have ended by page 300. It's a simple, effective story that's believable.Which I guess leads me to the other reason why I like this book so much. It's not one of those overly romantic books where \\"everyone lives happily ever after\\", as is so often the case with a lot of popular fiction books. It's realistic. There are triumphs and tragedies that give the book credibly. The characters, though we don't even get to know them for that long, sound believable and interesting and multi-dimensional.If you want to find out more about what I'm talking about, I suggest you read The Outsiders for yourself. You won't be disappointed. It's a great book to recommend especially to people who aren't much into reading or who just hate complex writing styles.Also, I'm told this book is largely similar to West Side Story plot-wise. Having never read West Side Story, I can't comment on how true or exaggerated that claim is."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think we've all at least heard of, if not read, The Outsiders. In some schools, it was a mandatory read. Unfortunately for me, it was not, which is why I haven't read it until now. It's one of those books that I had to read because everyone else had. I wanted to be apart of that club.This book packs quite a punch for being only 156 pages long. Ponyboy, SodaPop and Darry are brothers just trying to survive since the death of their parents. Darry and Sodapop want nothing more than for their youngest brother to make it to college, something they never got the chance to do. The three brothers are part of the Greasers gang. All hell breaks loose when one of the Socs, their rival gang, almost kills Ponyboy. Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny have to run away from town, their families and most importantly the cops. This book takes us through Ponyboy's journey of drama, turmoil, tragedy and loss. Most importantly, we watch as Ponyboy truly finds himself.The best thing about this book is that it's timeless. It was written in the 60s but still its message still holds strong and true in today's day and age. We are still dealing with, and battling, the same social dilemmas.When I read a book and it intrigues me (and The Outsiders did just that) I go digging. I have to find out more about the author: Why did they write the book? What made them write the book? I was amazed to find out that the book was written by a teenage girl, S.E. (Susan Eloise) Hinton, and that it was her first published book. She wrote it back in 1965 when she was 15 years old. She used her initials instead of her name because the publishers felt that readers and critics wouldn't read a book about teenage boys written by a girl. She has since stuck with using her initials for her work to keep her professional life separated from her personal life. She is a very private person and has done such a good job at doing so that you really can't find much more about her other than she likes horses.The Outsiders was made into a movie, that I'm sure most have seen. I am probably one of the few people who have not yet seen the movie but I definitely plan to."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S.E.Hinton\\"This can't be happening.

And they had a blade... they were gonna beat me up...\\" (Hinton 57). Ponyboy, Johnny, Soda, Darry, Two-bit, Dally, and Steve all stick together, along with all the other greasers in town. Being a greaser is dangerous because of the Socs. The Socs are a vicious group of rich kids who beat up greasers; however, one tragic night will change everything for the greasers, and they will all need each other more than ever.The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton is an 180 page book that has something for everyone. There is an amazing lineup of remarkable characters and a captivating plot that will pull at your heart strings and help you understand the struggles teenagers go through while growing up.One of the greatest moments of the book is when a church is on fire and Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally realize what needs to be done and they risk their lives to save a group of young kids from the fire. This choice ends up costly though, landing Johnny and Dally in the hospital.Throughout the story, the main character Ponyboy is a strong willed character who tries to understand what is right and wrong. He is a character who dreams of being more than a greaser unlike the others, he would not give up. He also ends up realizing that he and the Socs aren't so different after all. In fact, they are more alike then either side could imagine. Ponyboy has to deal with the struggles of life and learns that family is the most important thing in the end.The Outsiders is part of the realistic fiction genre. I give it a 10/10.

Ponyboy is a 14 year old greaser (lives on the east side, lower income) who lives with his two brothers, Darry and Sodapop. the Curtis boy's parents are dead, which means that they are all they've got left. well, each other and the rest of their gang. life is anything by easy for Ponyboy and the other greasers. especially for Ponyboy, who is a natural athlete and smart, he realizes he is against all odds to make something of himself. he sees the challenges his older brothers face in using their gifts - Darry has to stay home and make ends meet instead of going to college, and Soda, while genuinely loving his job as a mechanic, realizes that he wants more for his brother Ponyboy.tensions between the greasers and the socs (short for socialite, the upper-class west side kids) have always been high strung, but after Ponyboy and another greaser are spotted with two of the Soc's girlfriends at the movies, it unleashes a rage and sets into motion a series of events that are tragic, intense, and challenging.what struck me about this book was how much it felt like a character study. each time Ponyboy would discuss someone or introduce a new character, i not only got a description of their hair, eyes, dress, and any distinguishing features, but i also got an insight into the core of their being. each character, especially the greasers, were dissected and evaluated.something that i really appreciated about this book was how Ponyboy dealt with the stress and trauma of the events. without giving spoilers, i will simply say that how he reacted to the tension and the fallout of the various confrontations fits into the character-study feel to the book overall. we see who Ponyboy really is in how he reacts to the intense drama, and we learn what sets him apart from the other greasers.fave quote: \\"'You can't win, you know that, don't you?' And when I remained silent, he went on: 'You can't win, even if you whip us. You'll still be where you were before - at the bottom. And we'll still be the lucky ones with all the breaks. So it doesn't do any good, the fighting and the killing. It doesn't prove a thing. We'll forget it if you win, or if you don't. Greasers will still be greasers and Socs will still be Socs. Sometimes I think it's the ones in the middle that are really the lucky stiffs...' \\" (117)fix er up: okay - i realize i am totally in the minority here, but i thought this was slow, cheesy, and predictable (except for the realistic reaction to trauma near the end by Ponyboy). now, i realize that the value of this story is in what it represents (the struggle of us vs. them, overcoming obstacles, finding your true self, etc.) and that it is one of the most challenged books ever because of the repeated drug/alcohol/violence by young people, and i even know that it was written by the author when she was 15-16. that doesn't change the fact that i literally almost gagged when someone told Ponyboy to \\"stay golden\\" with his final breaths. yes - i know it was in reference to a poem and it was special...but that seemed cheesy beyond all belief to me. it's not that i don't think that thugs/greasers can't appreciate Robert Frost or even be a fan of sunsets, it just didn't come off as believable to me in this book - despite the fact that they are based on real characters (says S.E.

They are all time rivals with the other gang that lives on the West Side of town who are rich called the Socs. Things get out of hand when Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny Cade decide to take a midnight stroll....We think that The Outsiders is dramatic at times and adventurous and suspenseful at others.It also has a powerful impact on friendship.

Hinton, was such a good book! You would think it would be only for boys but it isn't. There is so much emotion that it's good for girls but there are lots of fights and action and gangs for boys. The genre is suspense.When I started to read it I couldn't put it down. It was so suspensful! It was one of the best books I've ever read. My favorite characters were Ponyboy and Johnny. I like them because they are more sensitive than the other guys. I also like Sodapop, his brother, because he was nice.The Socs, or the Socials who are rich, are so mean to the Greasers who are kind of poor. Their neighborhood is so violent, I am glad that I don't live there. I could picture how scary their neighborhood was because she wrote it so well. I also like Two-Bit, Steve, Darry, Johnny and Dallas. on the outside they are tough but on the inside they do care. Like Dallas, he looks like he doesn't care but near the end of the book you'll find out that he really does care.The story starts with Ponyboy going to the movies by himself. on his way home the Socs found him and started beating him up. When he got home he was all beat up. The next day Johnny and Ponyboy went to the movies and after, they fell asleep in the grass and woke up really early in the morning. When he got home his older brother yelled at him. Ponyboy was going to run away with Johnny when they met up with the Socs.To briefly say what happened, they were holding Ponyboy underwater and johnny had to stop them so he stabbed one of the Socs. They had to runaway. To find out if they got caught read the book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really liked S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders because of the unique way the book was written. Instead of the &quot;conventional&quot; writing style, Ms. Hinton wrote the book like she is Ponyboy Michael Curtis, &quot;Greaser.&quot; This book was very interesting, it had many unexpected twists and turns. The Outsiders is a very believable book, and in many ways there are real &quot;outsiders&quot; today.The Outsiders dealt with prejudice, and as you are reading this book you begin to understand what life is like for other groups and how they act towards each other. It's sad because no matter what or who is in the group, they are all classified as &quot;bad,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;smart,&quot; etc. It made me realize that I too judge and group people too easily, we all do.I would recommend this book to anyone (over the age of 11 or so) who wants to read an awesome novel about life, family relationships, friendships, social groups and prejudice.A Student at Secrist Middle School, 3rd period Language Arts"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is better than My all-time favorite &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;.

He lives a happy life as a greaser until the night his best friend, Johnny, kills a soc who jumped on him. You can feel strong brotherhood and true friendship in this book.

I would rcemend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This was the first book I'd ever read by S.E. Hinton, and I was not disappointed. What amazes me the most is how she can get into the mind of Ponyboy, a rebel who runs away to an abandoned church. This book tells the truth, it gives you an example of how teens can be influenced without a caring parental figure. It also deals with prejudice which is still alive in today's society, and one the main media aspects of today, guns. You will not be able to put this down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"It is hard for me to describe just how huge an impact this book had on my life when I was growing up. I first read this book in middle school and then re-read it many times going into my high school years. Any young adult can relate to this book, especially the way it vividly portrays what it feels like to be an &quot;outsider&quot; who's not part of the &quot;popular&quot; crowd; and the surprising flip side, that the people in the popular group may be just as lonely (and subject to the same pressures) as the outsiders. Any teen should relate strongly to this story. If asked to name my favorite book of all time, this would probably be it; it meant so much to me growing up. Thank you S.E. Hinton, from the bottom of my heart."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy is a teenager who doesn't know what he wants- except to excape from the slums where he lives.

In my Language Arts class the teacher made us read it. I thought I wasn't going to like it but I loved it!!! I read it all in just one night. Even though I have never experienced what the characters in the book are going through it was incredibly real to me. The characters and situations were real. I can identify with Ponyboy's thoughts in the book. I've read this book about 4 times and I've never gotten tired of it. It was the only book or movie that I cried during. I have the book and the movie and I am contsantly reading it or watching it. This is a really great book and S.E. Hinton is a wonderful writer.

Of course there is conflict, romance, and violence. Pickup the book you will not want to sit it down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Although I don't live in any situations like PonyBoy did, it was so real and I thought for a second I was living there. To be able to write a book like this when she was 16 and in a male dominated society I believe she's one of the best authors. Hinton produced a book of this caliber in 1967, I think that says alot of what she's capable of. I just can't wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I just got finished reading The Outsiders, and it is a great book it can relate to most teenagers lives, only set in the past.

A realistic fiction, it documents what social classes of the author's time were like.

I think it has a great moral to it telling people that everyone has problems whether your rich or poor. It also shows that fighting gets you know where in life.The characters were all outstanding and showed their chracter in the story and stick together through times of problems. This book makes me wish it was never ending becuase I wanted to keep going on and on. This is one of the few books that makes me think about it after I read it. I want to read it over and over again and I can't get my mind off of it.(seriously) I suggest this book to all ages becuase the moral of it is recognizable to anyone. This is just my opinion but I don't know how it's possible not to like it. If you read it closely, you shouldn't be let down.Read it!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This story is about young men and the strict and unfair social rules of their community. Pony boy and Johnny are the youngest members of the greasers. The greasers are the outsiders, and socs are the insiders. The socs are bullies with money, influence, and attitude. Pony boy and Johnny get into trouble when they go to the movies and talk to, sit with, and escort home, two soc girls. This seems like harmless interaction, but quickly escalates to a fight with a fatal outcome. There is more tragedy that follows this event. They story is great but the real strengh is the development of the characters and the depth of their personalities. This fictional story is relvant to all teenagers. Useful to teach themes like isolation, bullying, dysfunctional families, death, and being disadvantaged. Also interesting because it is told by from a boy's perspective but written by a female."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"M.P MIller PlaceThe title of this book is called the Outsiders and the author is SE Hinton. This book is a fictional drama and action. The theme of this book is a bunch of kids growing up in Oklahoma trying to make it through their teenage years.This book is about two main gangs called the soc's and the greasers. I believe that the greasers are good-hearted people that just didn't have the family, support and money to be brought up like a soc. The soc's were brought up like snobs and mentally and physically attack the greasers. A couple of times these two gangs collided in battle and the greasers came out as the winner. I believe it was good karma for the greasers.The greasers are good people and the soc's are stuck up and rude. They are not nice to the greasers who are looked down upon as the lower classmen."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this and the other S.E. Hinton staple books (\\"That Was Then, This is Now\\" - \\"Tex\\" - and \\"Rumble Fish\\") repeatably as a teenager. Even then they were dated in literal context (i.e. gangs are between caucasian upper and lower class in this book), but they still captured the angsty spirit of being a teen and the changes that result from growing up. It also captured the brutility that jealousy can engender as well as cause and effect. Unfortunately, as usual, Hinton also falls back on her parentless boys raising themselves, creating their own sense of 'family' plot-point. I don't know why her four books hinge on this, but it would be interesting to see the other side of this coin.As it is, the protagonist, Ponyboy, has written his story as a make up essay for a class. Within it is the struggle of somebody who has both the capacity and drive to lift himself from his poor, gang-life background, but is full of uncertainty whether he can or should. His friends and siblings are all fully realized characters, flawed, but still endearing for the most part. Even they recognize the differences in Ponyboy and in their own ways as surrogate older brothers, support him. Again, as usual, with Hinton, it takes a series of tragedies to force the conclusion of this book.I bought this for my son, though at nearly twelve, I'll likely wait a bit to give it to him. Living as he does in an era where gangs are an invasive part of city life, regardless of whether you belong to one or not, I believe it would be good for him to understand the various reasons one might join a gang, as well as experience a point of view of those who have not had as fortunate an upringing as his own."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This genuine quest for a place in this world is a masterpiece with it's descriptions bringing the characters to life and the storyline who could get anyone hooked.The story starts with young Ponyboy as a Greaser and that is what he knows and loves about himself. However as the novel progresses he becomes more and more uneasy about what he wants. Pretending to be Tuff and Tough is all part of the equation and makes him stuck but with some great friends and family he everntually realises the big picture and comes together with who he is. Ponyboy. This book shall stay gold for years to come. CLASSIC!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Friends who are closer than family taking their lives day by day, and taking it on as it comes. They meet many struggles but always manage to get their way out of it together. It was a book about character and friendship, two of the most important things in life. This book is more than just a good book, it was completely phenominal!!! I read it to my kid sister for a lesson on what it was really like to have a hard life. (She complains that she has the worst life ever and she has it soooo hard.)If you ever get the chance read this book. Not just becuse it is a wonderful piece of literature, but because it is an enjoyable life lesson that will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is my favorite book that i've read. its about two gangs who always fight. Two characters named Ponyboy and Johnny do something that get them into trouble. They killed a member of the soc gang so was forced to hide out in an abandoned church.The rest you got to read.This book might as well be made today knowing all of the violence going on.This book is mainly for the young audience.

I first learned of the story from its the movie version. I remember reading the book for the first time sometime in the summer between my eight grade and freshman year in high school.I found myself relating to some of the issues that Pony Boy is faced with. I find the story to be an accurate description of a young man's struggles in a society where his is not given a fair chance to succeed. I appreciate the way that Hinton incorporates Pony Boy's rough and tough exterior with his inner appreciation of beauty. I suggest it as a must read book for any teen."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I absolutely love this book and have for the last 19 years, having first read the novel in 5th grade. We were crazy about S.E. Hinton after that and proceeded to read everything she wrote. Outsiders is still my fave and I can still recall from memory all the dialogue. The film version stars many now-famous male actors who were quite young at the time the film was released. I would recommend the book to any young adult or adolescent who is living on the fringes of society, not really feeling accepted. The line between rich and poor is blurred by the sentiments shared by both groups in this book. A must-read for those interested in gang/youth culture."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a terrific book! I recommend it because if you are my age, it relates to you more. It'll get through to you about violence, and runnin' away from the law more than others. I absolutely adore this novella.

The story starts out explaining the situation that is occuring all throughout it, which is two diffrent kinds of kids one from the north side and one from the south side of the tracks. The point of veiw of this story is from the point of view Ponyboy see's (The main Charecter) Now he gets into a little trouble alot and has no parents to direct him, just two older brothers. Now in the mist of all that's going on in the Hatred between, if you will north and south, there was something that happened to make it even worse. This book is a good book for the ages of 12 and up. Due to some of the themes that are involved in the story. I rated this book 5 stares because it brings in many diffrent kinds of themes such as hate for each other, Dffrent veiws on subjects that matters to each group of kids, and the way they treated each other in that day in age. This book is not that long (180pgs) but is very action packed so it never drags on and is very easy reading so you won't get stuck on words and therefor very quike to read and the time will fly by as you read it. Now Most people that I have talked to have also said it was a good book. Just as an example I asked my Freind Joe about it and he said &quot;Outsiders is a very good book and I recomernd it to all those who injoy reading books that aren't too long in length.&quot; So in conclusion I will say The Outsiders is an excilent book and if you like reading short stories or even long novels, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"It will really blow your back.

The twist about the book actually being Ponyboy's semester theme was also really good. The letter from Johnny was so sad that I cied. I think that everyone should read this book. I have also seen the movie. That is also good but with the book you can really sence what the character is feeling.

The way in which the author details the differences between the &quot;greasers&quot; and &quot;socs&quot; are vividly believeable and realistic. As a reader, you find yourself rooting for and being concerned with the outcome of the &quot;greasers&quot;. This book had an influence on me more than any other I have ever read. S.E. Hinton makes you feel something for these &quot;outsiders&quot;. You begin to see things from their point of view and the world they come from. Even though I was only twelve when I read it, I remember that it had a profound effect on me. This book brought me to tears and really tugged at my heart strings. I'd finish reading it, then pick it up again and read it all over once more, that's just how wonderful this book was for me. In total, I've read it fifteen times and will be picking it up sometime soon to read again. I especially felt compasionate towards the main character, Ponyboy and the yearing he felt for the &quot;greasers&quot; to be accepted. I commend S.E. Hinton for writing such a classic. I am amazed at she could be such a compelling writer at only sixteen years of age. This book is definitely a classic. I will treasure this book forever and it will always be a part of my childhood. I am lucky enough to own a copy that was published in the 1970's and will always make sure to preserve the battered copy of this book. I will recommend this one to my children for sure.

Written from a viewpoint of hard and experienced innocence, this book is a study in the goodness in everyone, and everyone's propensity to hope. Very view books or movies have had an impact even close to this one. Read it, buy it, read it again and again and give it to everyone you know to read too."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I am a girl from a small town in TN. I am the kind of person that does not normally get into a book but, &quot;The Outsiders&quot; caught my eye and I just had to read it. It starts off sorta slow, then it gets really deep. I just don't know how I would describe it. In some ways it is to weird cause I can relate to Ponyboy, Soda, and Darry in alot of ways. And I really got into it after I realized that, I could not put it down, I absolutely had to read it. I think the book is unique. I suggest this book to all ages that are able to comprehend the facts of life.

E. Hinton, once banned in a school library because it &#34;promotes juvenile delinquency&#34; which, of course, it does not. I've taught this novel, and used it for tutoring a private student. In this edition, HInton gives a good afterword which can be used at the discretion of the teacher. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I'm looking at The Outsiders through the lens of Catcher in the Rye because Catcher's large footprint overlaps into the Coming of Age genre and so many people are familiar with Salinger's literary classic.The Outsiders is about two groups of feuding teenagers, Greasers and Socses (pronounced \\"soshes\\"). Greasers are from the poor side of town, the east side. The Socses are from the upscale west side. The story is narrated in first-person by a Greaser, fourteen year-old Ponyboy, an orphan who lives with two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop. There are three levels of conflict: the grudge between the two feuding factions, inter-family conflict between Ponyboy and twenty year-old Darry, and Ponyboy's inner struggle with self identity--what and who he wants to make of himself.At 180 pages, the book was an easy read despite the unrefined writing style, which I struggled with but readily accepted because the roughness of an untrained authorial voice sounded realistic.I was first drawn to The Outsiders because I kept running across comments about the book in discussions concerning The Catcher in the Rye, a book that I have reread and analyzed extensively with great enthusiasm. I am a great fan of Salinger. I am also writing my own coming of age novel and find it helpful to study other works in the genre. The Outsiders has sold over thirteen million copies to Catcher's sixty-five-plus million. The two books have similarities and differences worth examining.Narrative Voice:Both stories are told in first-person. Holden, though unsympathetic, scattered and seemingly unreliable, is convincing and believable. Ponyboy is sympathetic and scattered but sometimes unconvincing because of the rough writing. In the beginning he kept boring me with long descriptions to set up the characters and situation. And later on he would make repetitive asides, telling instead of showing or letting it evolve naturally. Here's an example from page 3:\\"We're poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we're wilder too. Not like the Socs, who jump Greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don't mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mom and Dad were killed in an auto wreck, the three of us get to stay together.\\" (The passage goes on for most of a page.)I know Holden does the same thing, but his voice clicks from the very first word. Listen to Ponyboy's opening line: \\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house I only had two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.\\" The sentence was expressed in reverse order. It threw me off. It should have read: \\"When I stepped from the darkness of the movie house out into the bright sunlight... .\\"Holden's opening line reads: \\"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, ... .\\" Smooth.It's not fair to compare the writing of a kid with that of a seasoned master, but it illustrates what I'm trying to get across--writing that flows is more digestible and less intrusive.Characters:In both novels, the authenticity of the narrator's voice is the most critical factor. In first-person, the reader is locked inside the narrator's head. But this is where the similarity ends. Holden comes across as privileged, arrogant and whiney, an unsympathetic character, whereas Ponyboy is at the opposite end of the socio-economic scale and quickly earns our sympathy and interest, starting with the fact that, along with his brothers, he's a recent orphan. Also, in the opening pages he get's attacked by a gang and is rescued by his two brothers and four other members of the Greasers' gang, Steve, Two-bit, Dally and Johnny \\"Jonnycake\\" Cade. The reader is drawn in by the loyalty of the boys to a member in trouble.Other sympathetic characters include: Cherry, a cheerleader and a Socs leader's girlfiriend; Randy, a Socs who leaves his gang; Mr. Syme, Ponyboy's English teacher; and Marcia, a friend of Cherry's.Hinton spends a distracting amount of time describing her characters' physical appearance. Salinger describes his characters briefly, with laser precision and only when necessary.A major weakness of Outsiders is the ensemble of villains that are flat, not sufficiently rendered to make the reader feel Ponyboy's fear of them. The Socs are pretty much faceless except for Randy, who turns out to be a pretty good guy.A major difference between the two books is that Hinton stays with this core cast of characters for the duration of the novel, whereas Salinger takes Holden through a series of mini-dramas with a succession of characters and locations, exposing the reader to a broad spectrum of Holden's life.I had trouble relating to some of the characters in Outsiders. They didn't seem real, where as all the characters in Catcher did.Setting:Neither book pays a lot of attention to setting. Salinger handles setting methodically, with surgical precision. Hinton's treatment is more haphazard. There's too much in some places and none in others. Although research indicates the novel is based on Tulsa, Oklahoma, the author tells us only that the location is a city in the Southwestern United States. Ninety percent of the novel takes place on the east side of town, Greaser territory, with the rest occurring, after a short train ride, near Windrixville during a weeklong hideout in an abandoned church on a hill.Catcher covers forty-eight hours in the mid 1940s, whereas Outsider has an approximately two-week duration in 1967.Plot:Catcher is virtually plotless. The reader is kept off balance by not knowing what's coming next but readers are so invested in Holden that they're willing to go along.Outsiders moves along rapidly with few surprises. The plot feels predictable and I don't feel much of a threat from the Socses. The plot doesn't grab me, but I read along because I'm hooked on the sympathetic main character, Ponyboy.An outstanding feature of Outsiders is the way the Greasers stick together as a surrogate family, sharing chores and looking out for one another in a bond of love and respect when functional parents aren't around to guide them. The primacy of sibling affection is a major theme, if not the premise, in both books.The book is an amazing achievement for such a young author."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My middle school daughter needed this book for class so she can annotate it.

They are separated in that way, and are pretty much like gangs. They poor ones steal, smoke, and fight with the rich ones. They all think that rich kids have it made, but then learn things are &quot;rough all over.&quot; It ends in a sad and intense way, that will definately get you thinking.

I'm reading it for the third time right now, I seriously just can't get enough of it! I think I liked it so much because not only is the story line interesting, the book is incredibly well written. This book is very easy to get into and VERY hard to put down in the middle of it! This is kind of for a classic book report thing but I would not consider this a &quot;classic&quot; because the way I define classic is a very boring book that must be read just because its a classic and lots of people have read it. A normal classic I'll read once and say &quot;phew, at least I won't have to read it another time now that I know what it's about!&quot; This book is way different, I'll keep reading it over and over just because it's so GOOD!

The Socs always thought they were better. They were rich, but not in the things that really matter. The Socs had money, but not the loyalty and feelings that the Greasers had. Ponyboy was loyal to Johnny when Johnny had killed Bob. He stayed with him at the church. That's how true friends are. It showed how teens today feel: desperate and unloved.

I didn't really have the first clue about gang rivals and the struggles that take place in the lower class society. This book opened a new understanding for a child from Eufaula, AL. Now, twelve years has passed, and I see in our world today the same struggles for young teens all over our country. The Outsiders teaches in Johnny's words that &quot;there should be a place with just ordinary people,plain ordinary people&quot;. I'm 25, and I find myself still pulling out the ragged copy of The Outsiders from 8th grade to seek an understanding when I'm faced with social decisions. I think Ponyboy's message of &quot; maybe then people wouldn't be so quick to judge a boy by the amount of hair oil he wears&quot; could teach all people regardless of age, class, and gender a bit of compassion.

If you are a good reader and you closely look at this book you can understand very much . Fighting is the result of misunderstanding . A sentence depends upon the way you take it . Here is a sentence &quot;do you want water &quot; . If a person asks her enemy she will think like this [she is asking me as if i don't have it or i begged for it ]. It can also be taken like this &quot;she is giving me water even though she has only a little . How kind of her &quot;.In this way an ordinary sentence can also be taken in a complicated way. If you want to end fighting in the world take a sentence in a friendly way so that by seeing you even she can change . And one thing about friendship is that you should believe that person with your whole heart and never ever doubt it . If you have a doubt never make friendship and break that person's heart . I not only like you to read but everyone in this world so that there will be no more fighting . Fighting is mainly going on land . Honestly this world is made by God and nothing is yours until he tells you . So why ther's a need of taking visa to come to another country . If you believe in someone you don't need to do this .

I do know that anyone who reads this will like it because its deep and its real, and I really think it touches something inside of everyone. Its one of the best books I have ever read. The night I read it I cried. Not just because of sad parts, because there were equally wonderful scenes, but because of the time that must have been spent to write the novel in such rightness and fulfillment. My english teacher, who was looking to enrich my reading experience, gave me this to read, and I must admitt I only read it out of boredom late one Tuesday night, but I have to tell you. That was one of the best Tuesday nights I have ever spent in my life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I thought the Outsiders by S.E. Hinton was a great book. It was a little humorous and it showed realistic problems and how they're solved. But what I enjoyed most about the Outsiders is, it was a story of an everlasting friendship amoung adolesence. The Outsiders focused on two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. The main character, Ponyboy, is different from the rest and is kind of caught in the middle. Throughout the story their alikes and differences are expressed. I recommend this book for teens. I recommend it for teens because teenagers could relate to the issues these characters face.

The Outsiders is a sophisticated, moving, gripping tale of teenage angst, peer pressure, ignorance, and self-discovery. Rarely do readers connect faster or more completely than with Hinton's &quot;Ponyboy&quot; character. The realism and emotion of this book are astounding. It's not a fluffy, feel-good book for kids. It's at the other end of the spectrum from Harry Potter fantasy. This is full-contact fiction dealing with the everyday drama and trauma today's kids witness or worry about: family, friends, school, violence, police, gangs, love, loyalty, fear, and aspirations. This one leaves a mark. Bravo! --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I totally loved this book. Ths book touched me deeply. Parts of it i think you have to be a teen to understand. I read it when some people might have though i was to young.(when i was 12) but I think i was ready for it. i think this is a book that if your not old enough for it you won't like it and won't keep reading it. its one of my favorites. I saw the movie which i thought cut out some very important parts. I think this book can be read many times over and it will continue to touch you. and awaken a part of you that says my life is easy my life could be so much worse.And teens look at it and say there are people like that out there cuz as a teen you see them at school hanging around and this book covers a sensitive subject. the other thing i liked about this book was the strong sense of friendship it was almost always there and i think that's what helped the kids get as far as they did.I think that if you are in 6th grade or abive and you are pretty mature you can read this book adn love it iknow i did."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"We have been reading the book the Out Siders in my seventh grade exploratory class.

In their city, there are two groups of social classes. The lower class are called Greasers and are known for their &quot;tuff&quot; (cool) hair. THe high class are called Socials, or Socs. The story follows a 14 year old named Ponyboy, who lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop, because their parents died earlier. The Greasers are close friends that always stick together and have various fights with the Socs to defend their name. Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny got into a fight with some Socs one night and ended up killing a Soc accidentally. They hid in a church in the countryside and they stayed there for several days. They left for dinner once and when they returned, they saw that the church was on fire.

The high class kids were called the socials but everyone called them Socs. They lived in the west side. The low class kids were called Greasers. Greasers lived in the East Side. The five main characters were Greasers named Ponyboy, Johnny, Darry, Sodapop, and Dally .One night Ponyboy and Johnny fell asleep in the vacant lot while star gazing. When Ponyboy came home at around 3:00 AM, Darry (Ponyboy's brother) slapped him for coming home so late while Sodapop (Ponyboy's other brother) was just minding his own business. Then Ponyboy took Johnny and they ran away. That was a big adventure Ponyboy and Johnny went on.In the story all of the main characters are boys. I can't really relate to any of thembecause everybody in the book fought and smoked. I can't relate to Johnny, Ponyboy, Darry, or Sodapop because I have two parents who respect me and don'thurt me unlike Johnny's parents. Also, I am not like any of the Socials because they fought too. I think I am mostly like Cherry Valance. Cherry likes sunsets and going to the movies like I do.I liked the book, but not a lot. My favorite part of the book was when the church burned down and Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally risked their lives to save the lives of other children and went into the burning church. All of the children in the building survived. Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally got many burns from helping the children get out of the church. My least favorite part of the book was definitely the rumble. I don'tlike violence and during the rumble there was a lot of violenceand many people getting hurt. I would recommend this book forboth boys and girls ages 11-14.

Hinton, is a very well written,hair-raising story. The story was about two rival gangs called the Greasersand the Socs. The Greasers were the poor kids also called hoods. The Socswere the rich kids. These two gangs would always fight to show which group isbetter and stronger. The main characters in the story are Steve, Two-Bit,Darry, Dally, Sodapop, Johnny and Ponyboy. Ponyboy, Johnny and Dallas arethe main charters. They all make up a gang. They stand up for each other,although they have their differences. In my opinion, the story starts whenJohnny and Ponyboy get into a fight with some Socs. In the fight, Johnnykilled a Soc to stop him from drowning Ponyboy. After this, Johnny andPonyboy are on the run from the law.I cannot really relate to any of the characters in this story because Ihave never experienced some of things they have. The night before Ponyboyhas the big fight he is determined and ready although he is not really up toit. At times, I felt this way before something important. Otherwise, I havenever really felt the way they did, or experienced similar things they did.I thought this was a very good book. It was teeming with tension. Myfavorite part of the book was when Johnny and Ponboy (with help from Dally)decide to run away. This book is written for everyone over the age of ten.All parts of this book are interesting. That is why out of one-ten I givethis book a ten."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"'The Oustiders' is a realistic story about teenagers from the wrong side of town who are left to fend for themselves after their parents pass away. There are two main conflicts in the novel. The first is person vs. society. Ponyboy and his friends are considered greasers because they don't have much money. Opportunities for success are not handed to them, so many of the greasers decide to not even try to succeed in the world. Ponyboy is different from most greasers, because by the end of the story, he decides to make something of his story, and his life, even though it will be difficult, and he knows he will have to work hard to succeed in a world that has preconceived notions of him and his kind. The second conflict is person vs. self, as Ponyboy struggles to become the kind of person he wants to be, even after the loss of his parents, Johnny, Dally, and the soc that Johnny stabbed, who was a person with a life, too. The characters in the book were both round and dynamic. They were described in detail, and their changes in attitude and thinking were shown through their actions and dialogue. Although the setting of this book seems to be late fifties to early sixties, gangs and cliques still exist for teens today, and teenagers still push for independence and begin to discover who they are. Because the novel deals with these issues that are present in the lives of nearly all teens, the young adult reader's interest in the book would remain high, even almost forty years after it was written. The book is only at a 5.1 reading level, but of course the content is more appropriate to deal with, and to interest, the high school reader."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I usually detest books I'm forced to read in school, the process of reading them being boring and slow-paced and the books ususally about boys and their pets. The Outsiders was completly different. After reading the first sentence I was immediatly hooked into Pony Boy's life and the lives of the many people around him. This book brought tears to my eyes, laughter to my lips, and a warm feeling to my heart."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was great.It got my attention from the very begining and kept me hooked until the end.

GET THE BOOK, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Well, my teacher, Mrs. Goodin, told me that i would really like this book so we started reading it in class. Right away I knew it was going to be a great book. The ending was like the best part but its the what happened in between that makes it all come together. I loved this book and I encourage everyone to read it. AND LISTEN TO YOUR TEACHERS!!! My teacher always tells me to read good books, and when I think about it and decide not to, I always end up regreting it. But when I do read them, I ALWAYS end up loving them. So...always listen when your teachers tell you to read books like The Outsiders and you WON'T regret it!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I guess I didn't think this book was so great. It is told from an interesting point of view, but the plot development was too shallow. The beggining is better than the end because there is more description and detail at the beggining. I don't know about other people, but from where I am, this book has no relation to present-day occurences, and I certainly can't relate to it at all."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"It still confuses me as to why teachers insist that this book is read and analyzed in school. S.E. Hinton wrote this novel when she was still very young, and trust me, it shows. I give her credit for trying to write a book while still in high school, but her plot couldn't have been more obvious, her details more unrealistic and unnecessary, and her characters less like gang-members. Ponyboy and his two brothers, along with a few friends, make up a gang that represents the \\"greaser\\" faction of their school, with their rivals being the rich \\"Socs.\\" S.E. Hinton is obviously a woman, and her characters that are supposed to be strong and completely masculine are instead incredibly feminine. Perhaps she should have written from the point of view of a girl; it's hard to write from the viewpoint of a different gender at such a young age. Her story was terribly obvious, and I didn't find it poignant at all. This book drew very little emotion from me. As I sat in my seventh grade class reading the story of Ponyboy and his friends, I found myself to be bored and dissatisfied. Her only redeeming point can be found in her usage of the words, \\"Stay gold, Ponyboy\\"- although even that metaphor is easy to see through. All in all, this is a truly mind-numbing book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think 'The Outsiders' was a great book!! It taught people that like 'Greasers' and 'Socs' (soshes) no matter if you have money or are more popular everyone should always be treated equally. 'The Outsiders' had many different emotions including shock when Johnny killed Randy or happiness when Ponyboy met Cherry Valance. 'The Outsiders' was a very touching story. This book was well written and was really just fantastic!!! Although there is a murder in the book it shows there's a little hero in all of us just like Ponyboy Curtis, Johnny, or Dallas Winston! I think that a moral in this story that PROBABLY WASN'T intended was that police are bad' because they shot Dallas without even giving him a chance to explain. But you should still trust a police officer when your in trouble. If you haven't read 'The Outsiders' yet, I suggest that you do!!! Well what are you waiting for? Go read The Outsiders!!!! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you'll read this wonderful book 'The Outsiders' !!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This was an awesome book!

One of the Groups is the Socs, who are the rich kids. Then the Greasers, who are the poor kids with a tough life.My favorite part in The Outsiders was when Johnny and Ponyboy saw the church that they were living at was on fire. There was school kids around and one of the teachers told everyone there were kids still in the house. Ponyboy and Johnny jumped in a brokenwindow. They saved the kids that were in the burning house. Johnny and Dallas were hurt while doing this. This showed that greasers aren't uncaring people who wouldn't help someone. This was my favorite part because I think it made a lot of Socs change there perspectives about greasers.I think that this is a great book for everyone who can understand it. This book shows a lot of different things. I think this book shows that even though you're different people you can still be friends and have stuff in common. It shows that everyone needs friends and that people have to work out there differences. Also it teaches the lesson that you don't pick where you come from but you can be friends with anybody. I think The Outsiders was a great book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"i realy like this book because it show what the realy meaning of persevre is because in this book the characters never gives up and there always toghether, and I think is a realy good book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really liked the this book, particularly way the book was written.

Like I already said, it is a very well written book. The author, S.E. Hinton, let's the readers know exactly how the characters are feeling. She does such a good job, that there were actually moments when I felt like I was part of \\"the gang\\"."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was a great read. I loved this book because it was so relevant to teenagers today. Teenagers have problems just like Johny and Ponyboy. And the idea of the two gangs in one town is similar to most high schools because the Socials represent the popular groups of students who beat up the less popular group of students who are represented as the Greasers. Also, teenagers can be in situations where they get beaten by their parents, whitch is sad, but true, and some teenagers have been abandon by their parents, like Johny who is beaten by his father and him mother left him. S.E Hinton wrote the book to be relevant to today because even though some teenagers have depressing lives, it is true."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I had to read this book for school.

Read and find out what Ponyboy does.The main character's name is Ponyboy. (Trust me this is not a girly book). His best friend is Johnny Cade. They are part of the greasers the poor people with a lot of grease in their hair. The greasers are the good guys. Johnny's parents don't care about him at all. The Socs are the Greaser's enemy. All the greaser's are friends, two are Ponyboy's brothers. Read to find out how this awful war shakes out.My opinion of the book is it's a great book. I liked how it was action packed with drama and some sad parts. S.E Hinton did a good job of writing the book.This an amazing book. I recommend this book to ages 10 and up. Read and find out how Pontboy's life is changed."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders was a book I would read more than once. There were two components that stuck out the most in this book. One, I enjoyed reading about two different gangs who eventually saw the bleak differences between themselves. Second, this book conformed the true meaning of friendship in gangs. I read this book with my 8th grade students, and they would hitch the same opinion of the book. All in all, I would recommend this book to those who are seeking a compelling read.Socs and Greasers were the rich and the poor. Some might say it depicts gangs like to today: Bloods and the Crips. I would not take it to that extent, but it is evident that Socs and Greasers had their indignant differences. How they came together was what drew me into this book. Even though the main character Ponyboy killed a Soc and one of the Greasers main members dies, eventually both sides reached a positive premonition. The belief that every side has their troubles holds a reputation with society today. As you can see, its great how S.E. Hinton took two gangs in the 1960's and gave them a resolved mindset that relates with 2012.Do you think being in a gang means violence? Of course some may think so, but thanks to The Outsiders some of my perceptions changed. The Greasers were on the poor side of town. All they had was each other. When Ponyboy and Johnny committed murder due to self defense they seek guidance from their other gang members or should I say brothers. Johnny had abusive parents at home and so the Greaser gang was the only caring family he had. I am not trying to advocate for gangs, but what I am saying is that S.E. Hinton took a debatable topic like gangs and flourished it to deliver a message of brotherhood and family. Therefore if you have had the odds stacked against you with trust, read The Outsiders and you will see that blood isn't necessarily thicker than water.It is easy to see that I enjoyed reading The Outsiders. I finished the book in a day and I thought to myself, \\"The 8th grade would probably enjoy this.\\" Except for a couple of knuckle heads who dozed off because they can't stand my class, my students were able to understand that money does not make you any better than the next person. They were also able to comprehend the fact that family does not just reside with blood. In conclusion when you read this book, do it with an open mind and you will enjoy it to the fullest!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Just fourteen and having a rude awaking to my perfect life,i couldn't understand what was going on or what i was turning into. i was losing all my friends especially one that was just like a brother.when i read the outsiders i though wow. someone understands us!

The following is a collective review from my students: The book was an amazing story of kids stuck between childhood and adulthood. However, the setting is too old-fashioned for us; it is too old to feel real. In terms of the characters, there is a lot of emotion betweeen the Socs and the Greasers. Darry is a relatable character, in particular, because he is a great father-figure. Some of the class could relate to him because we feel like the mature child in our families. Regarding the plot, sometimes it moves slowly. In addition, S.E. Hinton uses lots of foreshadowing, which led to a predictable ending for some readers. On the other hand, several of us thought the ending was completely unexpected and different from most books. Finally, before reading you should know there are lots of fights and smoking/drinking. However, as a class, we would recommend this book because the violence shows you how lucky you are."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"i'm just gonna tell you now my review is on this book being not that good.I am interested in the time period it takes over but this book just doesnt cut it. The Outsiders written by S.E. Hinton. Well lets start off by me saying this was fair book. I thought it was going to be a terrible read.But no.S.E. Hinton creates a well descriptive world of the sixties. She really puts a vision in your mind of whats going on.Allthough the characters are two Rival gangs called The Greasers and the Soc's.The soc's are a rich gang and the grasers are poor.They way Ponyboy,johnny,Two-Bit,dally and Soda are described are very sterotypical,for instance greasers rough people up and put grease in their hair.The author says that in the book. Which offended me.I dont see greasers like that.Now to the good parts.The storyline can be mostly confusing and irratable. Meaning the locations and protagonists are randomly seen doing one thing then with in one sentance the plot gets thrown off.There are times in the book while reading you really feel for some Soc blood to be spilled in fact it doesn't happen.Jimmy's parents beat him all the time and he does not want anything to do with him.I can tell you right now this was not a likely to happen during this time period.This book i have read was not the best book i have ever read.I'd rather read Dr.Suess for a whole week than have the nerve to even look at another leather jacket.I give this book a 7.5 out of 10."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I was introduced to THE OUTSIDERS for the first time during seventh-grade reading class.

It is a chilling story and makes you have a new respect for your home, family and friends."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersBy: S.E. HintonThe Outsiders is about a boy named Ponyboy who lives in a town filled with troublesome gangs and parents who do not care for their children. In this wonderful adventure Ponyboy and his good friend Johnny, have to go through in order to stay out of Juvy. In this book there are many characters that often interact with Ponyboy such as, his two brothers, Dally, Johnny (of course) and many others. This type gang that Ponyboy is part of is called: The Greasers. They grease up their nice and greasy so much that it comes out shiny. The Socs, on the other hand, are another type of gang, the rich and spoiled kind of teenagers. They have short hair and wash their hair every day. They think that they are better then everyone and the only way to show their awesomeness is by killing and showing them that they are capable of anything they want to do. So overall this book is extremely outstanding and I am recommending it to all of the good readers out there because I know it will also be one of your favorite books in the world. This book is probably best for children 10 and older and other wise it's probably the best book you will ever read, EVER!

Hinton was fifteen years old when she wrote The Outsiders? The book is about gangs. The gang's names are the Greasers and Socs. The book talks more about the greasers. The names of the greasers are Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Johnny and Two-bit. The greasers don't have a lot of money. They are not rich or poor they are somewhere in the middle, but the socs are rich.I think their relationship with each other is that they are like brothers because they are always together. They are almost the same because they are in the same gang and like fights except Ponyboy. Ponyboy is different than them because he doesn't like gangs and fights but since he is in the gang he has to fight. They are different because each of them like to do something else.The problem in the book is that the socs, the other gang, and the greasers are always fighting and another problem is that the socs beat up Johnny who is a greaser. Another problem is that Ponyboy almost got killed by the socs because they were drowning him and Johnny killed one of the socs and his name was Bob. He was like the leader of the socs.One interesting thing from the book is when they do the rumble. In the rumble they meet together, then they talk, then they start the fight. The first one that got hit by the socs was Ponyboy and he was on the floor almost the whole time. Everybody was fighting but then the socs were losing so they got a stick and they started hitting the socs. Then they left running so the socs won the rumble and they were celebrating.The greasers are like me because the greasers had a rumble and I did too. I had the rumble when I was in fifth grade. Some of my friend's names that were in the rumble are Maria and Omar.I think Ponyboy is like me because he looks young and I look young to. I think Johnny is like me because my parents use to fight a lot but now they don't and I felt bad when they would fight and I would get out of my house for a little bit so I wouldn't see them fight because I would get sad.I liked this book because it has a lot of action and because it helps people to don't be in gangs because it shows what could happen.

For example now (today) the U.S. is in war with Afghanistan. This book also was grate b/c it informed you about the two different clicks. The Socs (Socials) and the Greasers.

They went through more tough times then some people will by their 30th birthday.Yes, I would recommend this book to anybody who loves drama, action, anything they are interested in.

The greasers and socs aren't friends but the relationship between all of the greasers is amazing. They are so caring, concerned and helpful with one another.

Not one character doesn't show friendship in one form or another.I would definetely recommend this book. It is a very passionate book.

In the book, The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, you can see exactly what that would feel like.In the Outsiders Pony Boy and Johnny are in a bad gang, But, they also do good things. For example, one time they rescued little kids from a burning church. The church was on fire because they left a burning cigarette in it. This book is also about people getting jumped and gang rumbles. When you read this book, you learn about life in a gang where some of the rules are, don't go on an other gangs block, never walk alone at night if you're in a gang, and always carry a switchblade.This is my favorite book!

This book talks about drugs and drinking so little kids shouldn't read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a great book that was written by S.E.Hinton.

And the there's Johnny, the one person that Ponyboy would do anything for.Ponyboy's parents passed away, so these people are all that Ponyboy is left with. And there's the gang, but Ponyboy can't count on them. At night Ponyboy is not always home and able to have a family meal, and in the day Ponyboy does not always go to school. Instead of doing those things, Ponyboy fight in rumbles, and smokes.The Outsiders was a bit troubling because of the strong language and violence. This violence creates a distinct personality for all of the characters. S.E. Hinton really showed how Ponyboy felt throughout the book.I think that the book is aimed at older boys, maybe boys in high school. As I was reading it, however, I found that it is just for very mature readers. To read this book you have top have a very sophisticated mind and be able to handle very intense violence.I really enjoyed this book because of the details and thought-provoking ideas.

HintonReviewed by: S.SokPeriod 1&lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u> takes you back into the times of the movies such as \\"Grease.\\" There are many gangs with the trend of long, oiled, slicked-back hair with much fighting and drugs, the main character Ponyboy Curtis is an orphan living alone in a house with his older brother Sodapop and Darrel. Ponyboy goes through some tough times such as thinking that Darrel hates him and feeling like a loner all the time. Then one day, the gang \\"Socs\\" pick on and threatened Ponyboy and merely kill him when a friend named Johnny comes and save Ponyboy by killing one of the Soc members, To avoid trouble, they both run away from home with only a couple of hundred dollars, two heavy coats, and a free ride on a storage train to nowhere, Ponyboy and Johnny fight for survival and try to carry on each other in a deserted church. They show true friendship that doesn't seem to break, even with 5,000 men with double-edged swords.I liked this book because it had adventure and suspense. It says in the book, \\"Things gotta get better, I figured, they couldn't get worse. I was wrong.\\" With this said in the book, I myself, didn't think that anything worse could have happened after the fight, but I was also wrong. This sentence made me full of suspense and want to read more to find out what else could have went wrong in the book. However, besides suspense, I also like the true connection of friendship that Ponyboy and Johnny had shared in &lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u>.In &lt;u>The Outsiders&lt;/u>, Johnny and Ponyboy would not have survived in the story without their compassion and friendship, as it is said, \\"Everyone needs a friend.\\" If Ponyboy and Johnny didn't have each other, it would have been impossible to live out in the deserted all alone; one of them would have died of boredomness or loneliness. It was showed in the book, \\"One morning, I woke up earlier than usual, Johnny and I slept huddled together for warmth.\\" Ponyboy and Johnny even slept next to each other for survival! That shows true friendship: helping each other survive.My favorite part in the book was when Dally comes finds Johnny and Ponyboy. Even though Dally could have gotten arrested for helping \\"murders,\\" he still desired to give them a hand with their problems. Dally takes them out for Dairy Queen. It made me want an ice cream too because of all the wonderful description S.E.

Hinton, is a wonderful realistic fiction book about 2 gangs in a quarrel and a boy named Ponyboy,who narrates it all. Ponyboy,the main character, is part of the gang which the socs call, the \\"greasers\\". The greasers are very tough and always stand up for eachother, if they didn't, they wouldn't be a very good gang. The greasers' worst enemy are the \\"socs\\", which is short for socials. They are very stuck up, rich people who love to do nothing but jump the greasers. Usually when a greasers gets jumped there are usually weapons such as,a knife. If they're quick enough, another greaser can help the one who got jumped, but that rarely happens.A summary on the plot: Ponyboy,who lives with his two brothers,Darry and Sodapop, is 14 years old and already had a knife held to his throat. When this happens, it means a greaser has been jumped by a soc and it also means that Darry will yell at him for not using his head. It's not that he was dumb, he got straight a's, it's just that he didn't us his head sometimes. Anyways later he and johnny are walking home from the movies through the park when johnny notices a guy with 5 rings on his hand, he was a soc, and he and his friends jumped them. As they keep trying to drown Ponyboy, Johnny stabs Bob to death. They figured the fuzz (aka the cops) would be chasing them , so they ran away, and died and cut their hair. All of a sudden a fire struck at the nearby church and Ponyboy and Johnny saved the children and Johnny ends up breaking his back.To find out more read the book.I think this book is wonderful for someone who loves suspenseful, realistic books."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersThis book is about three main characters Soda, Darry, and Pony.

After reading this I realized how much I really do enjoy reading. I haven't sat down and read a book since middle school before I read &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; Now that I have, I will read more often because I liked it that much. This book was an amazing story. It was hard for me to believe that a 14-year-old girl wrote this story. I loved reading this book. It relates in a way of what life is really like for me. I have my group of friends and then there is a group of friends who we don't get along with. I am glad I got the opportunity to read this book. I will now continue to read more often. I never use to read. But reading this book changed the way I felt about reading. Reading makes you escape the realness of reality. It lets you live in a dream or a fantasy.

This book is about the life of the people in the hoods, the people who don&iexcl;t have a family, or any money. This book is about differences between the rich and the poor. However at the same time this book is about the things common teenagers go through day to day. The author, S.E. Hinton was 16 years old when she wrote this book. Somehow it feels as if she knew everything about the life of a greaser, like how they lived, how they dressed and looked. She went into so much detail about their appearance that you can easily picture how they looked and acted. For example, the character Darry, she made him a strong, good looking, smart, and kind of fatherly like type of figure. The way she expressed him was so realistic. Anyways, enough said.

This book is written for young adults about young adults, and it was even written by S.E. Hinton when she was only 16. I think that this book used a lot of description, and it really made the scenes stick out in my mind, and made me feel like I was right there in the scene. The book was written very simply and not very challenging to read but I think that it is targeted towards younger readers. The book brought out a lot of emotions in me, like not being so judgemental towards people who are not as well off as me, or that don't dress nicely or don't have a lot of money. It also made me sad to see that their are kids out there that are killing and hurting each other. I know that it is something that happens a lot in this world but it is not something that I hear about that often. I would recommend this book to young adults as well as adults because I think that it has a lot of good points for both generations of people. As an adult people deal with predujice all the time. People are always worried about how much money people have and what types of clothes people are wearing.

The book was based on boy that grows up without any parents in the \\"ghetto.\\" He and his friends are in a neighborhood gang. I would recommend this book because it keeps you interested throughout the whole thing. So, if you are looking for a good short book, this is the one to read. This book was written so well that it gives you a mental picture. In the one part of the book the Socs and the Greasers get into a fight it gets pretty brutal. The author make you think that you are going through the pain that she describes."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a great book to read and re-read day in and day out.

They hear someone saying that some of the children are missing, Johnny and Ponyboy both run into the burning building to save the children.

Randy tells Pony that he just wants the fighting to end, and Pony agrees. Randy says he will not fight in the rumble. The other members of both gangs agree to fight, and in the end they do. During the fight the police show up and many of the members run away.

Eventually, he learns that he doesn't have to be a greaser forever. He can do anything he wants with his life. He is not the only teenage boy to feel like he does. After that he is better, and adjusts to what has happened."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book The Outsiders is about a group of boys who have a gang and are against another gang of richer boys. These kids all come from broken homes and their gang is the only thing they have. This book does an excellent job of showing what tough lives some kids have to live and some of the hard things kids have to go through. All the temptations of the teenaged years are expressed in this book openly, such as drugs, violence, and the pressure of being in a gang. The Outsiders is a great book to show kids they are not alone out there and other kids share their same feelings. Peer pressure is brought out into the open with this book and it made it really make the teenaged reader connect with the characters and understand the exact situation the characters are put in. Without a doubt this is one of the best books for teenagers to read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"THE OUTSIDERSS.E.

The Outsiders is one of those books where you wantit to hurry along and get to the point but then when it's over you wishthere was more to it.

Hinton. I am against the fact that they want this book to be taken away from children. Although there are many fights in this book, it always resulted in something bad. When Johnny killed the Socs, his life was ruined because he was wanted by the police, and the Soc's friends wanted to get Johnny into a fight. It also is a good book because it teaches a lesson about being friends with someone even if they are different. Pony and Sandy were from two different gangs; the Socs and the greasers. Even though that seperated them, their interests made them alike. This book teaches many different lessons about life. It will teach kids that when you do something bad, something bad will happen to you. It also teaches people to not judge people by the way they are grouped and to accept people for what their personality is. Out of all the books I have ever read, The Outsiders is definitely my favorite and I do not think that it should be banned for any reason."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"In this book it tells whether rich, or poor, you still have some kind of problem. The rich kids are called socials or socs, and the poor kids are called greasers.

But not all greasers are like that.Pony boy Curtis gets good grades, likes to read, and doesn't like to fight, and he is a greaser. his life soon will change when one of his friends kill a social in order to save Ponyboy.

His parents passed away in a car accident. &quot;Greasers&quot; are what they are called, they're from the east side and are fairly poor.

With some events your stomach will turn and some you will feel sad. This will probably change your view of street gangs in the big cities. Most of the problems in the story are caused by neglect.

This event leads to other events, which changes their lives forever.The author, S.E.Hinton does a great job of expressing how the greasers felt and keep the readers attention.

Hinton was quite possibly the first book I ever read in School and understood. The characters are original, easy to sympathize with, and extrordinarilly well written. The book focuses on a gang of north end &quot;greasers&quot; who stick together through thick and thin, more a brotherhood than a quote un-quote &quot;gang&quot;. When things go awry the two main characters are thrown into a sea of turmoil that only their friendship could overcome. An easy book to read and follow, this book is also one of the few to which the movie does some form of justice. Other phenomenal books by Hinton include &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, &quot;That was then, This is now&quot;, and &quot;Tex&quot;,all of which also have movies that are true to the books which they are based upon. A must read for any one, particularily young adults."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was the best book i have ever read.I cryed and i usally never cry while reading a book.I cryed because the author,S.E.Hinton, described the characters so detailed that it felt like i knew them.I didn't read this book for pleasure, i read this book because i had to.It was for a book project and we had to pick a book of the list.To tell you the truth i didn't think i was going to like it,then i read and i loved it!There was so much going on you didn't want to stop.I had 3 days to fisish this book and i couldn't put it down.This book showed a lot of emotion. I am kind of a tomboy and this book was really cool becuase it had a lot of rumbles between the Socs and the greasers.The main character was Ponyboy and he was a greaser.He was 14 and i couldn't believe half the stuff he was doing.Smoking more then a pack a day, for once and so more very weird stuff.I have told people that they need to read this book because it is the best!I'm into the kind of books that have another one, so thats why i'm hoping to read, That Was Then,This is Now."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders was a great book.

I have actually chosen this book to do a sociology report for my university. Not only is this book intriguing to the younger generation, it shows extreme longevity in diversity between rich and poor, young and old. An all around fantastic book that I believe should be read by anyone old enough to understand the truth and logic behind this story. Though it is a story this happens to occur and take place on an everyday basis, at every school world wide. If you don't think it does in your own school maybe you should take a look at yourself and see if it is not you who is making it hard for someone else to live their life to the fullest. On a lighter note, I read this book for the first time when I was 11, I read it so much that the pages started to fall out, that is the time when I finally broke down and realized that I could not live with out this book following me through my many transfers in the military as every time I read it, it takes me back to that time in my life that I will always remember as tumultous and amazing.

If you read it check out the first line of the book and also the last line."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The novel, The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton was a very intriguing book. This novel shows the differences of two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. It is also a story about three brothers who lost their parents in a car accident. All the characters in this book will have to go through very interesting challenges and obstacles in this book.The main character in this book is Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy is the younger brother of Sodapop and Darry. Sodapop is the middle sibling of the Curtis family. When Ponyboy's parents died, Darry, the older sibling, takes care of Ponyboy and Sodapop. Ponyboy is very academic and is a star on the school track team. Ever since Ponyboy's parents have died in a car crash, he became very rebellious to Darry. Ponyboy and Darry fight very often. Throughout the novel Ponyboy will realize that Darry is not that bad as a parent figure and he will learn to live with him. Sodapop is a high school dropout and is the happy-go-lucky sibling of the family. Every character in the book shows great respect for Sodapop because most of the time, he kids around but when he is serious, people listen to him and take his advice. Sodapop always listens to problems that Ponyboy is having. He also makes sure that Darry is not too hard on Ponyboy. Throughout the novel Sodapop became more serious and did not kid around as much. Darry had to drop out of school and work two jobs ever since his parents died so he can take care of Pony and Soda. Darry gave up his dream of attending college so he can be the father of the family. At first, Darry was not a good parent because he was letting Pony and Soda eat chocolate cake for dinner and stay out for as long as they wanted but later on in the novel, Darry will learn how to become a caring parent. When Ponyboy is sick, Darry will bring him soup and sleep with him to make sure he is okay. Ponyboy's best friend is Johnny and Johnny is part of the Greasers. Johnny's parents do not care for him as much as Darry cares for Sodapop and Ponyboy. Johnny really did not know much about the world until he read the book Gone With the Wind. Johnny started realizing the good parts of life through nature. Dally is probably the most troubled Greasers of them all. Dally does not care for anything but he does feel guilty for other people's mistakes. Two-Bit is also part of the Greasers and he is the joker of the group.The chapters of The Outsiders were broken down very well. I would say that the turning point of the novel happened in chapter 4. In chapter 4, the Socs were drowning Ponyboy in a fountain but Johnny did something extreme to help save Ponyboy's life. In another chapter, Ponyboy and Johnny saved a bunch of kids from a burning church. This really showed how brave and caring Ponyboy and Johnny really are. Even though Johnny was brutally injured in the fire, he said it was all worth it saving those kids. When Johnny was recovering from his injury, all the Greasers went to his hospital room and made sure that Johnny had every thing he wanted. In another chapter, the Greasers and the Socs wanted to settle everything for the last time with a big rumble. This was a very exciting part of the book because it finally solved all the problems between the Socs and the Greasers. At the end of the book, the Curtis family realized that when times are tough, that they should stick together.A major theme in this novel is loyalty. Johnny showed how loyal he was by saving Ponyboy when he was drowning in fountain. Another example of loyalty is when the Greasers helped Johnny recover from his injury by getting him anything he wanted. Another theme in this novel is leadership. Johnny showed a great deal of leadership when he saved the kids from the burning church. Darry is also a leader because he helps take care of Ponyboy and Sodapop. The last theme in this novel is the separation of social classes between the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are the lower class and the gang that lives on the east side. The Socs are the higher class that lives on the west side of town. Throughout the novel, you will learn that even though the Socs and the Greasers look like two completely different gangs but the main character Ponyboy will learn that everyone has problems and people are not always different on the inside.The Outsiders really shows the importance of friendship and how friends are always there for you. I liked everything in this book except that there are too many characters in this book to remember. I would still recommend this book and I think it is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"40 or 50 years ago this might have seemed like a topical, edgy story. Today though, it seems irretrievably dated: the slang, the bifurcated social world, the emphasis on petty crime and \\"hoods\\". The character's evolution through the story's traumas has some mild interest, but now much of it comes across as trite. Again, perhaps a book for its time, but for a time that has passed. For ESL and English students, there is not much that gives insight into modern life, and it is plain wrong to give them misspellings, bad grammar, and ancient slang as content worthy of language study.

Hinton, took place in the life of 14 year old Ponyboy Michael Curtis, who was part of the gang known as The Greasers. The Greasers were from the East Part of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and were generally surrounded by poverty. The nickname, The Greasers, was given to them from the one thing they took pride in, their hair! The boys' had long hair that was slicked back with hair grease. The Greasers had one enemy, a rival group called The Socs; a shortened form of the word Socials. The Socs were from the West Part of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and were rich and popular. The Socs were raised in good neighborhoods and were known to have fancy cars and beer blasts for no reason.Ponyboy's life was great until a car accident occurred killing both of his parents. Ponyboy had to live with his two brothers, 20 year old Darrel (Darry) Shaynne Curtis, and 16 year old Sodapop Patrick Curtis. Pony was the youngest of the brothers and the protagonist of the book. Pony was smart and unlike the other Greasers, he liked school. Pony was good at school and didn't like to cause trouble in his classes. Ponyboy liked sunsets, and wanted to live in the country where there was no labels; just people. Pony was very close to his brother Soda and thought his oldest brother Darry hated him and wanted Pony to be in a boys home away from him. Darry was Pony's oldest brother who was very strict and cared for Pony's well being. Darry was tall broad-shouldered and muscular. Darry wanted to go to college but because the accident he was forced to work and take care of his brothers. Darry was an athlete at school and his name was commonly known throughout school. Darry kept his hair unlike any other Greaser; which was short. Pony knew Darry didn't belong with the Greasers and he could be a Soc, the only thing holding him back was his loyalty to his brothers. Sodapop was the middle brother of the Curtis family he had \\"Movie-Star good looks.\\" Soda was happy-go-lucky, and was very carefree. Soda had a girlfriend named Sandy, who later moves away to Florida. Soda loved Sandy and thought she could be his one true love until she moved.The rest of The Greasers included Johnny Cade 16, Dallas Winston-17, Keith (Two-Bit) Matthews-18, Steve Randle-17, and Tim Shepard who was 18. \\"If you can picture a little dark puppy that has been kicked too many times and is lost in a crowd of strangers, you'll have Johnny,\\" says Ponyboy. Johnny was raised in a home with no love, just anger and violence. Johnny was often beat by his parents and stayed with the Curtis family a lot. Johnny had black fearful eyes, which become even more fearful when he was jumped by a Soc and severely beaten by someone with rings. Johnny's face has scars from the beating. Johnny never walked alone and carried around a six-inch switchblade in his back pocket from then on forward. Johnny is considered everyone's kid brother whom they all protect and love. Dallas Winston who was fondly referred to as Dally, not to be confused to with Darry. Dally is considered very dangerous and very tough. Dally robbed stores, jumped little kids, and hit on girls frequently. Dally is rude and tough to everyone but Johnny. Two-Bit is the joker of the gang. He always had a smile on his face and lived for action, just like Soda. He loved fighting, his switchblade, and blondes.The Greasers and Socs were rivals but Pony made friends with two Soc girls whose names are Sherri (Cherry) Valance and Marcia. Bob Sheldon, one of the Socs is dating Cherry and often jumps Greasers.The story was mainly about the struggles in the lives of the Greasers and the mischief they get into. When Pony and Johnny committed a crime killing someone, to save Pony's life, they go to Dally for help. Dally told the boys to go to an abandoned church. The boys go to the church and stay there undercover for a while. They needed to stay away from the cops. The boys cut and bleached their hair to hide their identities so they will not be caught by the police. While at the church, the boys became heroes as they saved a few children's lives. Johnny became hurt doing this good deed and ended up in the hospital. Pony was caught and had to go to court for the crime he committed. The penalty was being put into a boys home.No matter what, the Greasers stayed loyal to each other. Over the course of the whole book loyalty became one of the main themes. The only thing that kept The Greasers together was the loyalty that they had for each other. When Johnny committed the crime, Pony didn't leave him. Instead Pony went to the church with Johnny and tried to take the blame for him.Another theme in the book was friendship. In court Darry and Soda are asked how their friendship with Dally is, because he had a criminal record. Both boys didn't deny being friends with Dally instead they said they were like brothers. This proved that they did not care what people thought of their friends because that was one of the only things they had left.Social groups was another theme in this novel. The two groups The Greasers and The Socs both have their share fair of problems. In the beginning of the novel Pony tells you how The Socs have the perfect lives; and have no worries. Throughout the story you realize that The Socs have just as many problems as The Greasers. Bob Sheldon, being one of The Socs is spoiled rotten and is never disciplined. Through the story you find out that all Bob wanted was some discipline but never got it, his parents always blamed themselves for what ever he did wrong.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. The book was fast reading and easy to understand. Even though the book is old, the emotions and the over all feel of the book are still relatable to this day. The plot of the story makes you want to laugh, cry, and jump all at the same time. The characters were fun and rebellious; making the book hard to even put down. I read this book in a ninth grade English class where we read each day chapter by chapter. I can honestly say I finished this book before the class did because I wanted to know what happened next."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersS.E. HintonGreasers, always getting into trouble. Socs, always getting all the praise. Ponyboy is a real smart kid with nice brothers and great friends that he can really count on. Where Ponyboy lives, there are two sides, the Socs, and the Greasers. The Socs are stuck up rich kids who have beer blasts and go around wrecking houses and jumping the Greasers, and Greasers are the more less fortunate that steal things, drive old, beat up cars, and have a couple gang fights here and there. Ponyboy, is a greaser, along with all his brothers and friends. His parents died in an auto-wreck when he was younger, and ever since, he has to be on his best behavior or else him and Sodapop will be put in a boys home. When Ponyboy and Darry get in a fight, Ponyboy runs off into the dark night with his best friend, Johnny. They go to the lot so Ponyboy can cool off, when a group of Socs show up, and jump Ponyboy and Johnny. While Bob, one of the Socs, is drowning Ponyboy, Johnny takes out his six-inch switchblade and kills Bob. Now, Johnny and Ponyboy go to Windrixville to lay low for a while until things aren't as crazy back at home. Ponyboy and Johnny stay there for a week or so, then Dally comes and takes them out to eat for a while, but when they go back to the church, it's on fire! Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally go in to save the kids that were playing inside, and when they get them all out, one of the beams fall on Johnny, and all you hear is Johnny's terrified scream. Now Johnny is in the hospital with a rumble coming up, so the whole gang knows Johnny won't be in it this time. Ponyboy goes to see Johnny as much as he can, until the night of the rumble comes. They go to the lot and have an all out war with the Socs, until they see them run away. They won! Then Dally and Ponyboy race to the hospital as fast as they can. They got to Johnny, but he was still dying. It shocked them, and hit them hard, but they never gave up. They tried their hardest to keep him alive, but it didn't work. He still died. Later, they got a call from Dally. He just robbed a store, and was on th run from the cops. The gang rushed to the lot, but when they got there, Dally was holding up a gun, it wasn't loaded, but it still didn't stop the police. They shot right through Dally, and he was dead before he hit the ground. It was harder to take now then before, two of Ponyboys friend's were dead. In the end, Ponyboy decided he could tell people about his experience he had, starting with the English assignment. So, he wrote what happened, and he told people.This book was really interesting and I couldn't stop reading. For example, when the rumble came around, I wanted to know what happened next, and if they won or lost. Also, when Ponyboy and Johnny got jumped, and had to run away for a while, I wanted to see if they got caught and put in jail, or would just be forgotten to where they wouldn't get in any trouble. Another thing is when the church caught fire, it made me want to know if the kids died, or if they would become heroes.This book was also very old-fashioned. For example, the cars and all the clothes they wore, like jean and checked jackets, and mustangs and madras. Also, the way they talked. I don't think I hear people going around and saying \\"bopper\\" or \\"golly\\" anymore. Even the way the girls dressed, it was very old-fashioned. They wore neckties, had really curly hair, and wore sweaters wrapped around their shoulders.Most of all, this book was a tear jerker. When Johnny got caught in that fire at the church, and all you could hear is his terrified scream, I thought he was going to die right then and there. Also, when I read at the beginning, that Johnny had been jumped by a group of Socs, and he had big gashes in the side of his head because he was hit by rings, I was shocked. And at the end when Dally and Johnny died, I cried really hard, because Ponyboy just lost his two best friends, and I don't think I could handle that like he did.I recommend this book to a person who loves a tearjerker and old-fashioned book about a guy who lives his life as best as he can. I really enjoyed this book, and it kept me reading for hours on end. So, hopefully, someone else will love it as much as I do.W.Wilburn"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Outsiders is a book about a 14 year old named Pony Boy and his friend Johnny. Pony Boy lives with his two older brothers in a town with two rival gangs. Pony Boy and his brothers are in a gang called the \\"Greasers\\". The Greasers are the poor gang who live in the ghetto part of town. The other gang is called the \\"Socs\\" who are the rich gang and live in nice part of town. Pony Boy and his friend Johnny got in a big fight with the other gang and killed one Soc. They left town to hide from the Socs and the Police.My favorite part in this book is when Johnny and Pony Boy saved the kids in a burning house. This is my favorite part because they are just boys who didn't have much and they went into a fire to save children. They sacrificed their own safety to save kids in the burning house. Johnny got stuck in the house and was saved by another Greaser. Johnny was burnt so badly he died.I would recommend this book only to certain people because if someone is not interested in the struggles of gangs and killing then they wouldn't like it. If you like a story with suspense and struggle this is a very good book. It is interesting to know what Pony Boy does with is life and see the problems that he has to face everyday as a poor 14 year old without a mom or dad and in a gang. This is also a very interesting book because it is not just about gangs and killing it is also on how Pony Boy helps his friends and other people around him."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is an awsome book, its my favorite. It is about gangstas like me and fagget socs like the preps.

Also, theres this kid dallas winston that stole a magazing from a store and got shot down under a street light, hes just like me too.

Personly I think it's the best book in the world. We had to read it for school (7th grade) and by the summary on the back it sounded pretty stupid.But by the first chapter I couldn't put it down. While reading this book I felt as if I was part of the gang. I could picture every little detail about the town they lived in to the way they talked. I could see the pain and sadness in Johnny's eyes when he remembered getting jumped by the socs. I gained a frendship with Ponyboy and it seemed as though he was my best friend and that I had know him all my life. I could imagine how the greasers slicked their hair back and how the socs road around in their tuff cars.And by the end of the book I knew what &quot;stay gold&quot; ment. Ponyboy,Johnny, Dally, and all the others, they were gold. They all were different in their own way but they were all the same. They just fit together like a pieces of a puzzle and when Johny and Dally died the puzzle would never be quite complete. It woulad always be missing those two pieces. I think that S.E.

She absolutely loved it and was trhough it in no time."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The title of my book is \\"The Outsiders\\". I think \\"The Outsiders\\" is a good book because it has to be a good book for me to stay interested in something that long. What drew me to the book was that the first time I met my moms dad he told me about how he was a greaser and my mom was telling me to read that book \\"the outsiders\\" because it explains a little of what he went through so I read it. The genre was science fiction. The setting was back in the day when \\"greasers\\" and \\"socs\\" existed. The Protagonist was Ponyboy and his friends and the antagonist were the \\"socs\\". The conflict was when one night Johnny and Ponyboy were going to run away after Darry had hit Ponyboy because he had stuck up for Soda pop when Darry was yelling at him. When they got to the park \\"socs\\" had come looking for a fight with them because they were talking to their girlfriends. So when the \\"socs\\" attacked Ponyboy Johnny got his switchblade out and stabbed, and killed the \\"soc\\" that was drowning Ponyboy after that they ran to Dallas hang out and he helped them get away. Poor Johnny would have to have that guilt all his life the guilt of someone having lost their life because of him.

The characters in this book are one of a kind, they aren't your typical gangsters. Outsiders is one of the most thrilling, exciting and ageless novels that has ever been written. It will keep you hooked until you finish reading all one hundred and eighty pages of it is a brilliantly written story about a group called The Greasers and all the hardship they must face because they are hood. I am not a big fan of reading books at all but after I read this book it restored my faith that books could be fun to read and interesting so overall, I think this book was amazing and it totally kept me hooked the entire time!The outsiders is about a group of Greasers and the Greasers are considered hood and thugs. They are all close in a way whether it be because some of them are family members or are just friends. The greasers all have a group of mutual enemies. These other teenagers know as the Socs pretty much look down upon the greasers and think they are a waste of life. The Socs are a gang also but unlike the Greasers they are all rich white boys who drive mustangs and get the pretty preppy girls. The story is about two young Greasers and the hardships and discrimination they must face simply because they are hood and are from a different side of town. In the story, one extremely difficult event the Greasers will have to deal with is the death of a fellow Greaser who was loved by all and \\"was a like a kid brother\\" to the gang. Also, two of the younger Greaser boys will have to endure being away from their friends, family, being fugitives because they end up being wanted for murder.The main characters of this story consist of Jonhny, Ponyboy Curtis, Two Bit, Dallas Winston (Dally), Soda Pop Curtis, Darrel Curtis, and Cherry Valance. Johnny is a sixteen year old Greaser and even though he is not good at school he approaches things with a steady concentration. Jonhnny is the son of alcholic, abusive parents. He is sensitive and shy and since his parents do not care for him he sees the greasers as his true family. In turn the older boys, particulary Dally, are all protective of him. Ponyboy is the gangs fourteen year old narrator of the story and he is also the main character. Ponyboy's interests in books and academic accomplishments make him different from the rest of his gang. Because his parents have died in a car accident, Ponyboy has to live with his brothers Darry and Sodapop. Ponyboy struggles with his differences compared to the other greasers as well as the social class division with the Socs, violence, innocence, and familial love. He matures over the course of the novel, eventually realizing the importance of strength in the face of discrimination. Two Bit is the joker of the Greasers. Two Bit is a wisecracking Greaser who regularly shoplifts. He prizes his sleek black-handled switchblade. He instigates the hostilities between the Socs and the Greasers by flirting with Marcia, the girlfriend of a Soc. Dallas Winston, A.K.A Dally is the toughest and most hood out of all the Greasers. Dally is a hardened thug who used to hang out with gangs in New York City. Dally's violent actions make him one of the more dangerous Greasers of the group. He takes pride in his criminal record and is very protective of Johnny. Sodapop Curtis is Ponyboy's \\"happy go lucky\\" handsome brother. Sodapop is the middle Curtis boy. Ponyboy envies Sodapop's good looks and charm. Darrel Curtis is the oldest of the Curtis boys and the guardian of them all. Everbody calls him Darry and he is a twenty year old Greaser who is raising Ponyboy and Sodapop because their parents died in a car crash. Cherry Valance plays a important role in this story as a Soc cheerleader.The authors name who wrote the magnificient novel ,The Outsiders is S. E. Hinton who was born and raised in Tulsa, Okalahoma. She was an avid reader as a child and started writing by the time she turned ten. Her early stories were about cowboys and horses and she preferred plots with rough riding and gunfights. When Hinton reached her teenage years she was not interested in reading because she could not find any books that were interesting to her. At that the time adult literature was too advanced. The types of books written for teens at that time were all very sweet and innocent. To satisfy her own tastes she decided that she wanted to write her own novel. One that consisted of violence and really depicted a realistic story about being a teens life. She created a character called Ponyboy and she wanted to record some events of her high school experiences. She took things that happened to her and people she knew in her life and used them as inspiration to create a story of two differnent groups of teens who butted heads constantly because of their differences. After working on the novel for a year and a half, she let a friend's mother read it. The mother liked it enough to refer her to an agent named Marilyn Marlow of the Curtis Brown Agency. A contract offering publication arrived during Hinton's high-school graduation ceremonies and the wanted to sign her. The Outsiders was published in 1967 when she was only 17 years old. Later on long after her novel The Outsiders was published she was presented with the first Margaret Edwards Young Adult Author Achievement Award.After reading the book The Outsiders I would definitely give it a 8 out of 10. I would give it such a outstanding score because it is a very realistic look into the lives of these teenagers and there is a little bit of somethign in the story that we can all relate to. It's a great story that will keep you hooked the entire time you are reading. I think it is a good book for all ages but most especially for teens. Teen life can be tough and the book gives you the perspective of the struggling, yet caring Greasers. This books emotional events whether good or bad have the ability to get you hooked on reading and wanting to keep reading to know what happens. Like I said, I am not much of a reader but I really like this book. I especially think this is a great book because it is unique from other types of teen novels. For example the current teen novel series, Twilight is not realistic because in real life, struggling relationships don't all end up in a happy \\"guys gets the girl\\" type of ending. As most teenage relationships go we all know that doesn't happen in real life! The Outsiders is also unique because it is more reaslistic in todays society and the struggles of teenagers, the different social classes and kids have to grow up at a young age due to crises an losses of loved ones in their lives. If you are not from the hood or a struggling teen this book gave you a realistic emotional look into the lives of others and makes you feeling like you should be more understanding and caring for the struggles we all endure. The storyline was unique to anything I have ever read and it kept me on a roller coaster of emotions because I could relate to some things. It will also have you laughing your butt off one moment then the next moment you're grinding your teeth angry wondering what the dirty Soc's will do next. So overall I think that this book was great and you should go out and read it. You will NOT regret it.And remember ............\\"Stay Golden Ponyboy, Stay Golden\\"!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ok, this book was required for schol.

Buy and enjoy:)"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My child had to read this book in junior high. He found it predictable and boring. Under the current curriculum of his school, the teacher spent a lot of time reading the book aloud to try to get even the kids who couldn't read well to appreciate it. Having to listen to a lot of the book made him dislike it even more. This may not be a good book for kids who read a lot. Teachers should assign Catcher in the Rye, East of Eden, and/or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn instead and perhaps break the class into smaller reading groups so not everyone is forced to go through this book. After discussing The Outsiders with my son, I can state with certainty that he didn't get anything edifying out of this book.To be fair to the author, the reading teachers I've met seem to very much like this book and enjoy reading it aloud. I give the author a lot of credit for writing this book as a very young woman.

This book is really easy to get into and I've found it to be very interesting. This on going plot has scenes about action, a little bit of romance and a lot of sentimental family values.S.E Hinton describes the characters so perfectly so that you can get an exact picture in your mind. Thought the main plot of this book happens over a short period of time, it is so detailed and full of adventureThe narrator of this book is the main character Pony Boy Curtis. He gets comments on his name because it sounds more like a nickname. Ponyboy is a 14 year old boy who lives with his two older brothers Darry and Sodapop Curtis. The eldest of the two was Darry. He looked over his younger brothers since he was stronger and the wisest. The second eldest was Sodapop. He kind of looked out for mainly Ponyboy too and usually stayed on his side when he and Darry got into arguments. Sodapop was a high school dropout because he had to help Darry with the bills because their parents got into a car accident a while back so Soda works long hours in a auto body shop. The Greasers (Which they call themselves) had a family outside of their own like Johnny and Two Bitt. The greasers got their name because they usually wore a lot of hair gel and they live on the east side of town which the poorer side.The Soc's, which are the total opposite of the greasers, live on the west side of town. They are mainly upper class rich kids that cause a lot of destruction and like to get into fight with the Greasers throughout the book.Don't equate the cover of the book with the quality because the book reads much better than the cover looks.

One fault with the book is the many characters who seem to have similar names. This makes the book far to confusing.

It's a hard life being a teen, but whoever really thought it to be this difficult just to survive. This book is filled with sorrow yet the perfect setting to help you with life.

Read this book to find out who they are."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I would give the outsiders 5* Because it has Action,Exitement ,And it is thrilling.

I would recommend this book to people who are ages 11 and up and people who love reading about life so, in other words everyone should read this book. The book is about two very different kinds of teenagers and there nightmare of violence. In this book two boys named Ponyboy and Johnny who get into some trouble some bad trouble like killing someone not just anyone but a soc-Bob. Soon a riot begins between the greasers-a rough, tough gang with long greasy haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks, and the soc's- the rich kids with all the breaks. I think this book will make a difference to anyone that reads it. You can relate to the characters which is great and it shows that no-matter how different people may seem they really are simular and can be going through the samethings. This book is exciting, suspenseful, sad, adventurouse, and educational, I highly recomend reading it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book in a day!

If you do, the book \\"THE OUTSIDERS\\" by S.E.Hinton is for you. Well the fights are good but I also like other things. One other thing I like is the characters. The main characters are Ponyboy and Johnny. Ponyboy is fourteen years old. He is tough and confused but also sensitive. Johnny is the youngest of the GREASERS. The other characters are Two-Bit Mathews, Steve Randel, Sodapop, Dallas, Darrry, and a girl named Cherry they met at the thearter. This book is about the GREASERS who dislike the socials, and Ponyboy's best friend killing a social. It's a nightmare of violence. This is a good book, so go read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After reading the book, The Outsiders I have noticed a few little things that make this particular story interesting. Although, it is hard for me to relate to this book mainly bacause I have yet to experience some of the things in the book. For example, being in a gang, gettting involved in gang fights, and having your parents die in a car accident.Ponyboy Curtis is the main character and also the narrator of the story. Ponyoby belongs to a group of low-class kids in Oklahoma who call themselves the Greasers, because they all have greasy long hair. Their rivals are the Socs, which is short for socials. The Socs and the Greasers are always picking fights with each other's group and there is never any peace.Some of the other main characters in the story include Sodapop who is a charming high-school dropout, Darry who is Ponyboys oldest brother and who has taken care of him since his parents died in a car accident. The rest of the crew is Johnny, and Dally who has a long criminal record, Steve who is Sodapop's best friend and last but not least there is Two-Bit, the oldest and funniest group member.My favorite part of the book was when Ponyoby realizes that he has to make up with Dally and change his lifestyle. The worst part of the book to me was when Johnny dies. Johnny was a real close friend to Ponyboy and would never did a thing to hurt anyone. I cannot really relate to anyone in this book but if I had to I think it would be Johnny, because I see myself as a pretty good friend.After reading the book, The Outsiders, I have realized how good of a book it was. I would recommend this book to any one who is a teenager and who also likes the story line of a book like \\"West Side Story\\" because these two books are similar in many ways. In the book The Outsiders, my favorite character was Ponyboy. Ponyboy Curtis was my favorite character because you could watch him develop over the entire book from a fighter, to a kid who has seen too many people who he loved die during his young life. His many experiences have made him realize that life is too short and enjoy it while you can."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"S.E. Hinton's novel The Outsiders is one of the best books I have ever read. This is one of Hinton's many novels. It is fictional story about a boy named Ponyboy, his brothers, and his fellow buddies. Ponyboy is 14 years old and is trying to make it in the life he has to live. Ponyboy and his fellow greasers (friends) have run-ins with the socs (rich kids from the west side). There are many chains of events that lead up to three boys dead and Ponyboy confused.S.E. Hinton is a magnificent writer, and she was only 16 when she wrote this story. All the words flow together so perfectly. Hinton is a smart, funny, and serious writer. She shows the rough tuff sides to a gang, and also the sensitive side.Hinton didn't really go into the description to the town as much as the characters. I like that about her. With her writing she makes you feel like you are pulled into the story. The characters seem so real. All the characters have a rough side, and some have a softer side too. Ponyboy, Johnny Ponyboy's best friend, Soda his brother, and well everyone except for Dally who was first jailed when he was 10. This book goes into their feelings just not their thoughts.I would recomend this book to anyone from 8th grade through high school students. This book touches anyone from ages 14-20, and I think anyone will have a great time reading this book. If I had to recomend a book to someone I would tell them to read The Outsiders. This book is the best one I've read and probably will read by far. I laughed, got watery eyes, and could not put this book down.

Hinton, is a novel with feuding rivalry between two gangs in a town throughout the story. \\"The Greasers\\", the tough guys from the east side of town who always need to watch their backs, and the \\"Socs\\", short for \\"socials\\", the preppy rich boys from the west side of town. The narrator and main character of the novel is a 14-year-old who lives with his two older brothers, Soda and Darry. His name is Ponyboy. Ponyboy lives under strict rule of his brothers, and is always paranoid of getting jumped by a soc. There are seven other greasers who are considered brothers of Ponyboy. They all watch out for each other throughout the story and through the feuding with the Socs.I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures and friendship. S.E. Hinton made this book very easy to read and comprehend by using simple vocabulary to describe intense situations. My favorite part of the book is when Ponyboy is jumped by the Socs in the beginning because it is an exciting scene and makes it really easy for you to get into the book early."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"... The book that I will be reviewing is The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. This book was outstanding in more ways than one. First off S.E. Hinton was only 16, yes I said 16 when she wrote this book. That amazing fact is the reason that I chose this book and boy am I glad I did. Once I started this book it was amazing how hooked I was on it. Every free minute I had I put in to reading this book.The book starts off talking about two gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are poor kids who wear leather and slick their hair back with gel. The Socs are the exact opposite. They are rich kids who drive really nice, expensive cars and where nice clothing. They have many fights but one fight it went to the extreme. \\"I KILLED THAT BOY\\" is the remark of a greaser named Johnny. Although he was acting in self defense, him and Pony boy Curtis (the main character) run away to another toewn and they stay in a cabin until things calm down. This event is the set up of many events to come. Such as a rumble is set up. A rumble is a gang fight. All these events keep you asking why Greasers and Socs are so different and why can't they get along. After all they are both humans and nothing makes one superior to the other.All in all I think that any teenager who reads this book will like it, probably love it. I know that now I will read more of S.E. Hinton's books because if she wrote this when she was 16 then I cant imagine how good of a writer that she is now.

This is and incredible story that everyone should read. I liked this book because it was written very well and it pertains to real life situations."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is one of the best books I have ever read. I enjoyed the controversy between the greasers and the socs. I found Ponyboy's personality very intriguing because he is very different at the beginning then he is at the end. The story of The Outsiders is very raw and true to what life was like in the small town of Tulsa, OK during the early 60s. It has appeal to young readers as well as older readers, the fact that the story deals with teenagers and is easy to follow is probably why the book is favored by so many age goups. The Outsiders will always be loved and treasured by all who read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, shows that people from different communities are more alike then different. Ponyboy a greaser is ready to fight in order to support his fellow greasers, but when he gets in a fight, and his friend, Johnny kills a Soc, things get a bit complicated. After this Ponyboy goes through a chain of events that end up showing him that Soc's and Greaser's both think alike in some circumstances. I highly recommend this book because once you start reading you will not be able to stop. The book also keeps you hooked because of excitement found throughout it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders, an amazing book, is one of my personal favorites. This book is unpredictable and well written, and causes your reaction to change throughout the book. Even though it's set in the past, it relates to today's world in many ways. There is a sequel to the book called, That Was Then This Is Now, that I wish to read in the near future.S.E. Hinton shows great talent while writing the book, particularly because she was only sixteen at the time she wrote it. I felt like the character as I read, as if I was walking in their shoes, and seeing what they saw. I was facing the problems they faced, and feeling what they felt. This truly amazing writer definitely got through to me, and touched me.As you read the book, it takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotion. Sometimes I was astonished and glad, sometimes shocked and sad. No matter which way I was feeling, it held my attention and kept me turning the pages.The story takes place in a city, with two very different sides of the town. There is the West Side and the East Side. The East Side is where the greasers live. They're hoods with no money, which are looked down on by people that are \\"better\\" than they are. Some wear hand-me-downs because they can't afford clothes. Most of them are dropouts that have a poor job and a pack of cigarettes handy. Almost everyone that isn't a greaser thinks that the greasers aren't well educated, and don't have any manners or are just plain rude. Ponyboy (Pony) Curtis, a greaser, is the main character. Darry Curtis, Sodapop (Soda) Curtis, Dally Winston, Johnny Cade, Two-Bit Matthews, and Steve, are also members of the greasers. Through the many difficult situations in the book, including deaths and murders, the greasers always stick together.On the other side of town, the West Side, the Socs are rich, stuck-up snobs. They're smart and don't have any problems (well, that's what all the greasers think). The Socs have as many problems as the greasers do, and are normal people like them. However, you'll find in the story that the greasers think they don't have any problems at all. The Socs own rich, fancy cars, such as the Mustang. The greasers and socs don't like each other at all. For fun, the socs \\"jump\\" the greasers.Pony, Soda and Darry live alone with out their parents who died in a car accident. They aren't forced to go to a boys' home, but if anything goes wrong, they will. Darry, the oldest, and Pony, the youngest, don't get along. Darry is responsible for Pony and Soda, though he takes out all his stress out on Pony. At one point in the book Darry gets furious and causes Pony's absence, creating a big scene that is central to the plot of the whole book.This extraordinary book relates to today's world in so many ways. This book definitely says that \\"you can't judge a book by it's cover\\" meaning that it's not what you do physically that counts the most, it's what kind of person you are on the inside.The Outsiders is an amazing, extraordinary, and fabulous book that I strongly recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders impressed me with it's honesty. This is a great book for young adults to read in the classsroom. There is action, drama, suspense and shocking situations. While we would never wish these situations on our young people I think it is important to expose them to the realities of other young people's lives in the world. The characters are believable and reliable. I found the sense of loyalty that is evident amongst the characters comendable and necesary, however misguided it is. It also gives us some idea of what life without the usual support systems can be like for a group of struggling young men. There is an inferred moral to the story and lessons to be learned using the language of young adults. This is a must add to the classroom reading list."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Pony was a Greaser,a lowlife gang.All Greasers hated the Socs,a snoby rich gang.But,one night things went to far,a Greaser went to killed a Soc.

Well, if you are reading these reviews you've probably read The Outsiders or are thinking about reading it. This book was one of the best books, in fact it is the best book I've ever read. I had to read it as an English assignment. Well, like any student I didn't want to read it, so I was going to put it off as long as possible. I even let my friend borrow it for the weekend so I wouldn't have to read it. Well I got it back and I read the first chapter and I couldn't put it down after that. Its so realistic that it kinda scares me. I mean it went with the society back then and it stills goes with society today. Theres still the Soc vs. Greaser problem in todays society. They maybe labeled something different but dont you ever look around your school and notice it. Theres the rich clique, the popular group, and then theres the less fortunate people, the bad group. After reading this book I noticed it a lot more and started being nicer to the less fortunate people. This book teaches you alot and its very suspensful and well written. S.E. Hinton has a very unique style of writing and its very good. I'm glad I had to read this book as an English assignment, because I would have never read it by myself. I hope that all English teachers start making their students read it, because out of my english hour not one student disliked this book. The way the characters act are also unique. There's Ponyboy, the sensitive one. Johnny, the quiet one. Darry, the big strong one. Two-bit, the talkative one.Dally, the troubled one. Sodapop, the one who understands everyone. Steve, Soda's best bud. Ok, Ive babbled on a long time....Just read the book and you'll see how great it is! Its the best book ever! May I also suggest reading S.E. Hinton's other books, That was then this is now, Tex, The Puppy Sister, Taming the Star Runner, and Rumble fish. If you've read the Outsiders book you should also check out the movie. Its great and Dally's hott! Two bit and Sodapop are hot too..but yeah, you get my point. The movie doesn't go in depth as the book though."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"this book was such a good book it was intesting i really injojed"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"According to The Outsiders there were two kinds of people, Socs and greasers. The Socs are considered high-class and had cars, whereas the greasers were low-class and had no cars. It wasn&#65533;t just money separating them but their different set of values. The greasers were more emotional and to the Socs nothing was real to them. So the only thing that was between the two was feelings. All of the characters were different in their own way, but came from the same social background. This book really brings out the negative effects of the social classes. As you read on, this book presents violence, girls, and even murder. Out of all, my favorite character is Dallas.I could relate to Darry, Ponyboy's older brother. Everyday I am hard and strict with my younger brothers as well. On weekdays everyone has to do their homework together and can't do anything else, until done. So we can't come home and go straight to the television. We can maybe get something to eat, but after that, get our work done. Since I am the oldest, I have it worst because if I don't get the job done and set an example, everything will fall apart, and it will be my fault. My little brothers answers to me, and I have to answer to my father. So basically everyone has a job to do and has someone to answer to.I enjoyed the story because it&#65533;s about young teens, like myself. The best part of the book is the rumble. All guys from different gangs fighting to represent themselves and to show they will stick up for each other as well as themselves. The part that wasn't interesting was when Johnny and Pony were at the church for the first time. No action occurred, so I wasn't pleased. In any case, I wouldn't change anything about the book because everything went together like a puzzle.I recommend this book to everyone especially young teens. It's a good story about gangs, unity, and especially fighting. I think it can teach a lot of kids to enjoy reading. Even though it is a great book written by a woman, I think guys would be more interested, but I think everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy Curtis lives his life day-to-day one step at a time. He lives in the poor part of the city and cannot afford to spend much time thinking and planning for the future. His brothers were forced to drop out of high school following their parents' deaths. The brothers now have to work to support themselves and Ponyboy. Ponyboy has to be on the lookout for the Socs, a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a good time is beating up \\"greasers\\" like him. One night, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are jumped by Socs and have to fight to defend themselves. The leader of the group of Socs ends up dead, forcing Ponyboy and Johnny to run away to the country. One problem leads to the next for Ponyboy. He now has to change his physical appearance and loose his most valued possession, his famed hair. The two friends keep a low profile to avoid being found out and turned into the authorities.After returning from a local diner, Ponyboy and Johnny find their place of refuge in flames. To make matters worse, there are children trapped inside the burning building. Ponyboy and Johnny rush inside to save the kids. They succeed in their rescue efforts, but they themselves are burnt and badly injured. The ever-grateful parents of the children take them to the hospital. Ponyboy and Johnny are forgiven for their crime, since it was committed in self-defense, and pronounced heroes.Ponyboy is my favorite character from the book. He struggles the most and is also the most objective viewer. I can relate to Ponyboy. He wants to be different from the people that surround him, and he tries to use his head to solve problems. I have also tried to use my head when faced with difficult situations. It is not easy to avoid physical force, but there is a greater satisfaction when thinking is used as a solution to a problem.I like this book very much. It has an excellent plot with great characters. My favorite part of the book is when Ponyboy recalls his first mass. I thought it was funny when he described his friend Two-Bit's actions. This was also Two-Bit's first mass and he didn't know how to react. Two-Bit always tried to get the last laugh or have the last say in things. The way he acted was very funny.I highly recommend this book to everyone. A person between the ages of 14 and maybe 60 will be able to get the most out of the story. People who like the culture of the 1950's and early 60's will really enjoy the book since it was written recalling that period in U.S. history."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book The Outsiders by SE Hinton is about two gangs who have many differences between them.

Johnny is the other main charecter. He is abused by his parents and is the Greasers pet. Dally is the toughest greaser. Two-bit is the joker of the group. Steve doesn't really have a big role in the book. The greasers are constantly jumped by the Socs.There are a few lessons in this book. The first lesson is: stealing isn't breaking the law if your not caught. The second lesson is: fire hurts. The third lesson is: before you get in a fight make sure you feel ok.I really like the book.

This book is about two-gangs that do not like each other.The gangs are the Socs(the rich kids) and the greaser( the poor and bad kids). The Socs like to beat up the greasers because they think they look weird and have funny hair. Well some of the charters in the story are pony boy, soda pop, Derry, dally, Steve, two-bit, cherry, randy, sandy, bob, jonnie, Tim shepherd, and bob. All of these charters have a very important role in this story.The major charter and narrator of this story is pony boy. He goes through a lot in this book.

Well i have news for those who think they are better than poor people well guess what you aren't because ya'll are all the same.Bob Sheldonis a Soc and the Socs think that they are better than Greasers. they beat on greasers as well as on other socs wich isnt right but they do it. Bob and his pal Randy, as well as some other socs beat up ponyboy and johnny.

In this book I garenty you will find something you can relate to. I fell in love with Ponyboy and all his friends and family from the begging. Even though I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood as a greaser in the 60's, or was involved with a murder, I can see the human in Ponyboy, and I feel like I know him. I've read the book at least five times (in 1 or 2 days each) and I own the movie. Just writting about about the story gives me shivers. S.E. Hinton's writting is so beautifully descriptive, exciting, funny, and heartwarming, once you start reading this book you can't stop. This book isn't some stupid fantasy, this is a realistic story of hard, true life.I was shocked to find out S.E. Hinton was only 16 years old when she wrote this book!

S.E. hinton wrote this book when she was only 16! She must have gotten an A+ in her writing class! It went totally in depth and made you practically feel like a greaser.

Shepherd, Nessacus Regional Middle School) \\"In my opinion \\"The Outsiders\\" was as very catchy book. Once you read the first, maybe second chapter, you never want to put the book down, it is so good. It is about a gang of boys called \\"The Greasers\\" from the east side of town. They consider each other to be \\"family\\". Most of them are poor, and live in apartments. The members of the gang are Darryl (20), Sodapop (16), Ponyboy (14), Two-bit, Johnny (16), Steve (17) and Dally. (Darry, Soda and Pony are all brothers). There is another group of boys called the Socs (Socials), who live on the west side and are rich. They are the main rivals of the Greasers. During the story, many fights occur between the Socs and the Greasers. One night when Johnny and Pony are walking home from the movies, a group of Socs jumps them. Under self defense Johnny kills one of the Socs. From there Johnny and Pony run away to an old abandoned church. They stay there for about a week. When they go out for food, and come back they see the church is on fire. Some kids that were on a school field trip at that time were trapped inside of the church. Johnny and Pony ran into the church and risked their lives to save the children. This is just one of the many ways that some of the gang change their lives thoughout the book. At the end of the story, Johnny writes Pony a letter, and tells Pony to \\"stay gold\\". When Johnny says this he also writes, \\"The way you dig sunsets\\". I think Johnny means for Pony to keep doing the things he enjoys, such as watching sunsets, reading books. Johnny says, \\"to stay gold, \`cause like the green grass, everything can't be gold forever. So he wants Pony to stay gold! To see what happens through the rest of the story, look for this book and read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The story of Ponyboy, Johnny and the rest of his greaser friends is a timeless classic that will remain a favorite of all time.

It is about a young boy named Ponyboy. He is part of a group called \\"Greasers\\". \\"Greasers\\" is a group of people who get in trouble a lot, and get into many fights with the Socs. The main characters in the book are: Ponyboy, Sodapop, Dally, Cherry, Johnny, and Dallas. The Socs are a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a great time is beating up \\"greasers\\" like Ponyboy. The main character in the book is Ponyboy. He is the narrator in the story. He has light brown hair, and greenish-gray eyes. One night, Ponyboy took things way too far. When the Socs come to fight \\"Greasers\\", the Socs drown Ponyboy, and he almost dies, but Ponyboy kills a Soc, and the rest of the Socs flee from Ponyboy. Ponyboy and Sodapop went to Dallas to borrow some money, so they can hide away from the police. Ponyboy and Sodapop bleached their hair, and cut it for disguises.The Outsiders is a book written by S.E. Hinton, and she wrote The Outsiders when she was sixteen years old. The Outsiders was S.E.

It is a great heroic story that I think everyone will really enjoy. It is a really interesting story too, as Ponyboy and Sodapop run away. What made me also enjoy the book was how S.E. Hinton made up very interesting names in the story, and the book had a great plot. \\"I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman-he looks tough and I don't.\\" \\"But I guess my own looks aren't so bad.\\" These quotes are from the story, and they are really funny.I dislike some parts of the book, such as the names of the characters in the story, like Cherry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy., but the story was good.My favorite parts in the story is when Ponyboy said that he wished he was like Paul Newman, because it was really funny. My least favorite part of the story was when the Socs came, and tried to suficate Ponyboy, because that is something very mean to do."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I am a 7th grader and I read the book THE OUTSIDERS over the summer and did a book report on it.

I wanted to dig my eyes out with a spoon every time I read the name Pony Boy or Soda Pop.Seriously a book about the inner city gangsters of Oklahoma written by a sixteen year old white girl? It sucked rocks. To this day thinking about this book makes my skin crawl.I was way ahead of my grade level at the time this compulsory read came down and it wasn't just the regression from what I was used to that bothered me.It amazed me how many of my peers liked the book. I also realized something about that tidbit, I was the guy who always had my nose buried in a book, this compulsory read was one of the few books many I went to school with has ever read, and they loved it. I was thirteen at the time, I readThe Stand By Stephen Kingthe same year, I readThe Wolf's HourandThe Chronicles of Narnia (Box Set)two years earlier, plus a slew of other stuff in between. On the same note I readThe Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)that same year and soon followed with the other two books released at the time and began the eager decade plus wait for the series to continue. Perhaps my dislike of this book is tied to having read more adult oriented and classic books?I've got respect for S.E. Hinton as an individual. Really, writing this book in defense of the under class perspective is one of the reasons I respect her as an individual, but seriously the book itself makes my head hurt, I would rather go get a few teeth drilled than have this book put in front of me again.I'm getting a lot of bad ratings on my review. I'm not changing my stance or deleting it. I am honest and I respect honesty, I occasionally give people thumbs up for making statements I disagree with as long as I think they're being educated and honest.

I was forced to read it in my English class and I hope I never have to again. S.E. Hinton does a quite shabby job of portraying the boys in this novel, whose abominable grammar is irritating and difficult to understand. The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts. Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially. The characters also set horrible examples for today's youth with their inexcusable and absurd behavior.

If you think I am crazy read the book and then you will understand. With names such as Ponyboy, Sodapop, etc. the characters of this book are ones you will never forget. This book also references other remarkable pieces of literature such as Robert Frost's \\"Noting Gold Can Stay\\" and the epic \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" This book teaches the reader valuable lessons like to stay gold throughout the hardships of life and how to use a glass bottle as a weapon. It also addresses the classic issue of the haves vs the have-nots (or in this case the socs vs the greasers) as well as the special bond between friends and how far they will go do to protect each other. Compared to all the other pieces of crap most students read in middle school (namely Tex-sorry s.e.hinton, The Face On the Milk Carton, My Brother Sam is Dead, Cold River, Canyons, Hatchet, the Pigman, and other such so called novels ugh)this work is a masterpiece. Please heed what i say, read this book and most importantly (in the words of Johnny)STAY GOLD!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Not only is this story absolutely incredible, interesting, and dynamic, but the author was a 16-year-old high school student when she wrote it!This novel proves the theory that I hear over and over again: Write what you know.

A red haze filled my mind and I slowly relaxed.\\"You've made the biggest mistake of your life. You're faced with the decision of life in jail or hide. Which way do you turn? This is the decision that Johnny Cade and Ponyboy Curtis are faced with in the novel The Outsiders. It is at this point in the story when the remarkable character development really takes off with the description of every thought that goes through Ponyboy's head. The Outsiders is so full of details and description. It's like a movie playing through your head you can absolutely get the full picture.S.E Hinton's famous novel The Outsiders is an amazing heroic story of bravery and courage right down to the last few pages; it kept me on the edge. I truly encourage anyone and everyone to read this amazing book. It's a good exciting book for anyone from the extremely good readers to slow readers because it's fast paced and thrilling I can't put it down. This action thriller will have you coming back for more of Hinton's work.PR27"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Published in 1967, it's arguably the oldest Y.A. book, and I still hadn't read it. Well, now I have. I know this won't shut up the critics, but I'm going to say it anyway -- \\"THE OUTSIDERS is Y.A.\\" It's got the young protagonists, edgy teen voice, and everything else required for membership into the Young Adult world.Rival gangs have split the city in two territories. The Greasers are the lower-class, slick-haired kids who look like thugs. The Socs (or Socials) are the high-class, sweater-wearing kids who look like they have it all together. The thing about rivalries like this is, like in Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET, it only takes a couple of love birds to cross the lines and screw everything up.Ponyboy doesn't realize that's what he's doing when he falls for Cherry, a redhot Soc who, for some reason, lets Ponyboy and his friend Johnny sit with her friends and talk. With their parents out of the picture, Darrel hopes to raise his brothers, Ponyboy and Sodapop in such a way that gang ties and social prejudices won't be able to keep them down, but that stuff doesn't like to go away easily.Despite the accidental murders, lost friends, and city-wide brawls, THE OUTSIDERS isn't about all that. It's about teens from different social classes trying to survive life's pressures, because life doesn't let up on anyone, rich or poor, loved or unloved, noticed or ignored. It just keeps coming, and they have to deal with it.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"...still a great read that I read first as a eenager, and I am way older than that now!

The gang have had the best of times having \`rumbles' (fights) with the \`socs' (another gang) until it goes too far.

But from the first chapter, that was it. I fell so hard I still haven't gotten up.This book was my inspiration for writing my own teen novels. It's one of those books that has characters you're so into you wish they were your friends. Well, first you wish they were real. And then you wish they were your friends and you could call them any time you wanted and be like, \\"Hey, Ponyboy, what's good? Can you meet up at Chat 'n Chew for some grilled cheese and backgammon?\\" That's what hooks you in from the beginning...the way this story feels so real. The intense energy of the dialogue and the fast pacing of the plot make it impossible to put this book down. And when you do put it down because you have to go to school or sleep or whatnot, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop wondering what's going to happen next. It's like you don't even know how you can get through the day without finding out.So I want you to be as hooked as I was and read this so many times that page 73 is falling out.

Everybody makes mistakes but running away from them does nothing because in the end you do face them.

I would say that this book was a realistic fiction becuase it didn't happenbut, it could have. The theme of the novel I think was friendship and loalty.This book was filled with excitement. There were gang fights, murder, fires, runaways, and death. Once you get into this moving story, you can't get out.Not only is this book exciting it also has depth and has heart. This book shows how teenagers deal with the daily troubles of social groups. Teenagers can relate and parents will be intrigued.

I really hope to see the movie one day."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy Curtis is the narrator of The Outsiders. He tells us the rivalry between two across town gangs, the Greasers and Socs. At first, being a Greaser, he only has one image of the Socs, wealthy kids with no problems to deal with. But after a fight was taken to far, everything changed. Ponyboy realizes that maybe things aren't always what they seem. Throughout this novel we listen as Ponyboy deals with rumbles, a bossy older brother, school, and the Socs, and watch him grow from it.Darry Curtis is the unofficial leader of the Greasers, who are known for their long, greasy hair. The personalities and characteristics range in this gang. There's Ponyboy who stays out of trouble and does well in school, and then there's Dally who robs stores for fun and has been locked up numerous times. Sodapop is happy-go-lucky and loves life. Lastly there's Johnny. Johnny comes from an abusive family and as a result he's very shy and fearful. The Greasers became his new family and look out for him. Johnny's a good person and becomes an important character.As you will see throughout the novel loyalty is a major theme. No matter how much trouble they're in, the Greasers always stick together. Leadership is another. Darry posses many leadership qualities. He's the leader of the gang, but also after his parents died in a car crash, he was forced to take responsibility and provide for his to brothers Ponyboy and Sodapop. A last theme is class change. The Socs and Greasers only see each other one way, rich kids and white trash. But after a character opens up to Ponyboy and shows that there's more to being a Soc than he thinks, the image starts to change. The gangs do not become friends in the end, but they do learn more about each other and broaden their image.I liked this book because it kept me wanting to read more. There was plenty of action and I enjoyed it. I think a lot of other students would like it too because they will be able to relate to it. I'm sure most students are not in gangs but the Socs can relate to the popular kids in school who everyone thinks are perfect with no problems, and the Greasers are the kids who are picked on. I would recommend The Outsiders."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was a great literary experience. Unlike other class assigned novels, this one was very interesting. How so? Well, teens these days aren't so interested in reading novels that take place during the American Revolution, or any other historical themes they can't relate to. The Outsiders takes place in a time period that may not be the time period they live in, but is very close. The novel contains many modern day themes and situations that kids of this time period will understand. There are fights, guns, fires, drugs, romance, and murder. Teens tend to enjoy something if it is close to real life, or something they have experienced. The Outsiders is that something.Set in a small neighborhood, live 2 social groups: The Greasers and The Socs. The Greasers are the lower class guys in town, while the Socs are upper class. These two groups have been at it for years, and showed no signs of stopping. That is, until the main character, Ponyboy Curtis, encounters a tragedy that will change the groups' lives forever, as well as his own. Ponyboy is a high school student who lives with his 2 brothers on the \\"rough side of town\\". Ponyboy is a straight A student, a track star, and a well-mannered kid. But not all is perfect in Ponyboy's life.His parents died in a car accident, and he is a member of the Greasers along with his brothers Darry and Sodapop. Darry Curtis is the oldest of the brothers who could have made it big in college. After his parents' deaths, he is forced to cut college and support his brothers. Darry can be described as buff, big, responsible, and very strict. He yells at Ponyboy constantly, just to keep him in line so he can live the life Darry could have had.Ponyboy believes otherwise. Sodapop is the family mascot, as he is funny, and always happy. Or so his brothers think. It seems that Sodapop can make the sad man happy, and can wash the frown off of anybody's face. Sodapop is Ponyboy's hero, just like how today young kids look up to siblings and worship them. The Curtis brothers are greasers, as stated before. Not only are the brothers Greasers, but their closest friends are too.This includes the brutal Dallas, the peaceful Johnny, the wise crack Two Bit, and Steve.This novel is mashed together by 3 themes: Loyalty, Leadership, and Social Differences.There is much mention of loyalty in the novel, because of the gang members stick together and never turn their backs on each other. When Dallas is mentioned to have been jailed several times in the story, the gang never turns their backs on him, and are not ashamed of giving him the title of \\"friend\\", even though Dallas is the most feared guy in town. Friends come before reputation in the outsiders, and that is true loyalty.Leadership was another major theme in The Outsiders. The Greasers are nothing without their leader, and they fear that they would fall apart without one. There are two debatable leaders in the outsiders: Darry Curtis and Johnny Cadge. Darry is a leader on the outside, while Johnny is a leader on the inside. Darry is a leader, because he is the most responsible man in the gang. The Greasers also see Darry as the toughest of them all, which clearly states their beliefs for a strong leader. Johnny on the other hand, shows none of these characteristics. He is not very smart, brave, or strong, but everyone in the Greasers has a place in their heart for Johnny. Johnny's parents are abusive drunks who honestly wouldn't care if Johnny died. Johnny has never experienced a real family, and the Greasers ARE that family. Everybody in the gang respects him, and listens to his request. Even Dallas will listen to Johnny's requests, and he doesn't listen to anybody but himself. The gang believes that the only reason why the gang hasn't broken up is because of Johnny. Without him, they fear that the Greasers will just be some other destroyed gang. This is proof that Johnny might possibly be 2nd in command of the Greasers. The last theme is a big one that basically IS the book's plot.This theme is called \\"Dispute between social classes\\". As stated, Greasers are lower class, Socs are high class. Socs drive mustangs, Greasers drive their feet. Socs drink alcohol, Greasers drink soda. Greasers have long, greasy hair, Socs have short, clean hair. These two groups are the exact opposites, and continue to fight over their differences. Fights burn on, just so the groups can prove who is better than the other.The book is almost entirely involved on the never ending disputes of the two groups.That is what makes this theme, the most important.This book is a classic, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone. Although this review makes the novel sound like a violent bloodbath, it really isn't. There's plenty of drama, romance, crime, and even humor. I'd give this book a four out of five. I don't give it a five because some events are a bit too old, and a bit unbelievable. Now I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll leave it up to the readers to understand what it is I'm saying.\\"The Outsiders\\" is a great novel that is intended for today's youth, who will get a better understanding of the events. You do not want to miss out on \\"The Outsiders\\"."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Soda is different, different from anybody; he understands everything, almost... He's always happy-go-lucky and grinning...\\" said Ponyboy as he walked from the movie theater.When ever anybody asks me who my favorite character is I always say without thinking Soda Pop Curtis from The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton. Soda Pop is a very sensitive sixteen year old boy. Soda's sensitive side shows when he gets a letter in the mail from his girlfriend saying that her parents wouldn't allow her to marry a gang member, Soda Pop. Another time when Soda is sensitive is when Ponyboy, his brother, runs away. Soda Pop cried for 2 nights straight.I think Soda Pop has the right to be emotional because his parents died in a car accident, the Socs never leave him and his gang alone and when his brothers, Ponyboy and Darry fight he is always the middle man, like a tug-a-war match. Soda Pop's sensitivity is what makes him my favorite character."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Have you ever read The Outsiders before?I have and man was I vexedwhen the book came to halt.It just popped up with such bewildering events,describing details,and fantastic characters that I just couldn't put the book down.If you're up for something bewildering, you can always count on The Outsiders. When you start reading the first page, you can't help but to become interested.Then you start getting reluctant to put the book down, until you just read and understand everything.It just gets better and better, once you read chapter by chapter.When it comes to detail, you can always look up to The Outsidersfor an example.Each word in every sentence has such describing details that you can see the moving images inside your head.Sometimes,each paragraph with another event and character, makes you feel as if you're a character yourself who watches everything happen,as you read the book.As when there was a rumble between the Socs and the Greasers or when Pony and Darrel got in a fight. You can just feel the tension!The greatest thing I love about the story of Pony,the Greasersand the Socs,were the characters!Each character was different in their own way, with their own attitude that helped the story move along.I rooted each character until the very end.Even though I have read every phenomenon event,every describingparagraph,and the chapter that told me what happened to the characters, Istill feel as if I'm attached and being pulled to the exciting story of The Outsiders."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Have you ever wanted to be in a gang? Well don't join a gang because one day, you might be dead! You never know when someone might shoot you. The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, is a good book about gangs. It made me realize that being in a gang is not fun and that you can die really quickly. When I was eight years old I used to read lots of books from S.E. Hinton, but when I read The Outsiders, it changed my life.This book is about a boy named Ponyboy. Ponyboy is in a gang called the Greasers. They also have their rival gang, the Socs. The Greasers don't like the Soc and the Socs don't like the Greasers. The Soc are a gang of rich people and they can have whatever they want. Socs are also always provoking the Greasers so they can fight. The Socs and the Greasers fight each other very often, which is the part I don't like. When gangs fight, it means that they have lots of differences between each other, like the Socs and the Greasers. Ponyboy lives with his brothers, who love Ponyboy and if anything happened to him they would go crazy. Ponyboy has a friend named Johnny, who is Ponyboy's best friend because they are in the same gang. Johnny's parents don't care if Johnny comes home, so he just hangs out with Ponyboy until he wants to go home. Ponyboy is about 15 or 16 years old and he is always getting into trouble. Ponyboy and his brothers know how to get out of trouble, but there is one day when someone takes things too far.The genre of this book is realistic fiction, and its level is 4.9. The Outsiders has about 180 pages. While I was reading the book, I was thinking to myself, I wonder what would happen if all of the gangs got together for a big fight, what would happen to them? Would they die? I really liked The Outsiders because it taught me how dangerous some gangs can be. I learned a lot of things from this book. For example, I learned not to do or say anything that might make a gang want to jump you. Another thing I learned is that you should not try to join a gang if you can't take what they will do to you. If I had not read this book, I would not have known how much pain they go through when they are in gangs.I would recommend this book to anyone who is or wants to be in a gang because when you read this book, you will not want to be in a gang anymore. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes violence because there is a lot of violence in this book will really make you think what they are going through."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think out of all of the books I have ever read. The Outsiders was definitely one of the best. It is set in the 1960's. The popular Socs and the rough Greasers have always been enemies, but they take it to the next level at a rumble. Ponyboy and Johnny have to go through a lot together throughout the book. Ponyboy's parents have died and he lives with his friends and brothers. Johnny has parents, but they could not care less about him. Ponyboy, Johnny, and some more friends are the Greasers and they have to learn to fight back strongly in the rumble or risk losing their reputation.You also learn that the Greasers aren't as strong as they look when it comes to losing \\"family.\\" There are lots of deaths in the book. Each death teaches the boys to be closer together and lose their tough demeanors. This reminds me of the saying, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover,\\" because people can change and grow.Middle school and high school students would enjoy The Outsiders the most. The only thing is that they are many deaths, but overall it is great. Once you finish The Outsiders, there is a movie too. I think the movie is just as good as the book. There are some parts of the movie that are different though. This one of the best novels I have ever read. We read it as a class, and most of our grade loved it.-Madison Broussard"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My daughter was required to read this book for school.

Hinton begins her heroic story with a theme of friendship and belonging entitled The Outsiders.This fiction book is about a fourteen year old kid named Ponyboy Curtis. He is in a gang called the greasers with his two older brothers. They are called greasers because they use a lot of hair grease. His older brother, Darry, takes care of him and his other brother, Sodapop, because their parents are dead. They live in a beat-up house in the middle of the city and get into fights with other gangs for fun. But in one fight a kid in Ponyboy's gang, named Johnny, kills another kid in self-defense. He and Ponyboy run away and hide in an old rundown church. Do they get caught? You might just have to read the book to find out. As the story goes on Ponyboy isn't as afraid of the other gangs and learns to stand up for himself.I would recommend this book to people who like action and suspense. Here is an example of the drama from page 5 of the text. \\"They walked around slowly, silently, smiling. 'Need a haircut, greaser?' The medium-sized blonde pulled a knife out of his back pocket and flipped the blade open. I was backing up, away from that knife. Of course I backed right into one of them. They had me down in a second.

Hinton. Soda Pop is a very sensitive sixteen year old boy. Soda's sensitive side shows when he gets a letter in the mail from his girlfriend saying that her parents wouldn't allow her to marry a gang member, Soda Pop. Another time when Soda is sensitive is when Ponyboy, his brother, runs away. Soda Pop cried for 2 nights straight.I think Soda Pop has the right to be emotional because his parents died in a car accident, the Socs never leave him and his gang alone and when his brothers, Ponyboy and Darry fight he is always the middle man, like a tug-a-war match. Soda Pop's sensitivity is what makes him my favorite character."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is the story of the greasers and the Socs, the two social groups in the boys' town. The greasers are kind of a family of friends, because for most of them all they have is each other. The Socs are more violent and like to fight. They are the rich kids who have things that the greasers can only dream of. They fight every once in a while -- but one night someone takes it too far.From that point on the story surrounds the two boys who are on the run from the \\"fuzz\\" (police). The story is told from the viewpoint of Ponyboy Curtis, who is a fourteen-year-old greaser. He has two brothers, Darry Curtis and Sodapop Curtis. Their parents were killed a few years back, but the courts let them stay together as long as they stayed out of trouble.This book is about so much more than the clich&eacute; of popular boys vs. loser boys. There are feelings and characters that you want to see succeed. That's what makes this book different from all the others, in a good way of course.I liked that the characters seemed so real, like you really knew them! I love it when a book is like that. There are internal conflicts with many of the characters as well as the good vs. evil aspect. Everyone in eighth grade should be required to read this book!Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Nick WrightThe OutsidersThe outsiders is a book about two groups of who don't get along. One of the Groups is the Socs, who are the rich kids. Then the Greasers, who are the poor kids with a tough life.My favorite part in The Outsiders was when Johnny and Ponyboy saw the church that they were living at was on fire. There was school kids around and one of the teachers told everyone there were kids still in the house. Ponyboy and Johnny jumped in a brokenwindow. They saved the kids that were in the burning house. Johnny and Dallas were hurt while doing this. This showed that greasers aren't uncaring people who wouldn't help someone. This was my favorite part because I think it made a lot of Socs change there perspectives about greasers.I think that this is a great book for everyone who can understand it. This book shows a lot of different things. I think this book shows that even though you're different people you can still be friends and have stuff in common. It shows that everyone needs friends and that people have to work out there differences. Also it teaches the lesson that you don't pick where you come from but you can be friends with anybody. I think The Outsiders was a great book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Ousiders is a book about a group of teenagers in the 1950' 1960's who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in their neighborhood. In the book there are 2 different gangs the \\"greasers\\"( the poor kids who get blamed for everything), and the \\"socs\\" ( the rich kids). In the book the main characters are greasers. The book shows the events these kids go through and also how they view the \\"socs\\". Throughout the book there are rumbles ( fights) going on,people getting jumped, people getting killed, etc. I think the best part about the book is when Ponyboy realizes that fighting is not going to solve anything and that besides differences in things like clothing and houses the two groups are similar in that they are both ghoing through tough times and trying to find their way in life. The book Outsiders was a very exciting book that had me in suspense after every chapter. This book made you want to keep reading. This book also makes you really have a different perspective on some things. The main character Ponyboy understands things that are going on that most others would not. If you want a page turning book I would recomend this book in a second."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is an awsome book, its my favorite. It is about gangstas like me and fagget socs like the preps. Johnycakes is just like me, he stabed a soc in the back when he was drowning one of my boys and ran away to an abandon church which ended up on fire. Also, theres this kid dallas winston that stole a magazing from a store and got shot down under a street light, hes just like me too.

Hintons first novel, The Outsiders, is one of the most heart touching books I have ever laid my eyes on. It explores the life of Ponyboy, a young Greaser that grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. The book also explores the true meaning of Brother hood back in the 60's. S.E. Hinton described the life of these people very accuratly because she herself grew up during the 60's and was a Greaser. The ending will rip your heart out and really make you think about what you have. If you like &quot;Tear Jerker&quot; books than you will love this one. I recomend that if you want your kids to read it when they get old enough to keep it in good condition.

I read it in my early teen years, and though it was never really relevant to my life (the setting, for one, is completely different from what I'm used to, and I was always somewhere in the middle of high school cliques - not on the outside, but not on the inside, either), but even then, I couldn't help but care deeply for each of the greasers.

Its good to see the movie after you read the book, I believe that you will be lost if you just see the movie some day without first reading the book, now that the book has much more description and you get to know better each of the characters.

I was able to identify myself with the different characters and their feelings. I felt I was inside the book. Later, we watch the movie, so we could compare both of the characters, setting, and actually see what was happening. If I could rate this movie form 1 to 5, I will give it a 3. I think the book was better than the movie because it has more events; the characters have more feelings, and you can somehow imagine better what is happening. The book was more descriptive and I think is better to imagine some of the scenes. The role of the characters in the movie was very good. I think some of the characters were really into their part and you could identify their feelings. I think Ponyboy really showed how he felt towards his brothers, the gang, and Johnny. I thought Soda was going to be stronger, and that he was going to take part in more parts in the story, as well as Darry. They skip some parts in the movie, but most of it really included the main events. I thought the movie was going to be better; maybe I just thought it was going to be more recent and with better effects. The setting in the movie was also good; I imagined most of the parts like they were shown. Some parts were really fake and different to what I imagined it would be.Well, it was a good movie and I would really recommend it, but the book is way better!-marifer ibarrola"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersWell, this movie has been one of the best I have saw but I know because of the year it was made, some scenes are boring or not that interesting because of the setting and characters. Even do this movie is very funny and also has sad moments such as the part were Bob die and Johnny. I give this movie four stars.The main actors played their part wonderful like Ponyboy he had many feelings, he acted very emotional he laugh, cried and get mad. Another good actor was Johnny when he was at the hospital, he talked very worried all sick and depressing because he didn't want to die. Also one of the important characters is Dallas, he acted like he didn't care about anything, and he said he was the coolest guy in the whole world. He love to be with girls and like to have fights.This movie and story had many interesting parts such as when Bob die or when the church was at fire that story has different plots. The plots are great they catch your attention and make the story more interesting. The setting of the story was not that good, they didn't describe it, put you know by seeing were they were and at what time. The setting was good but it would be great if they describe it more.The world I had imagine while reading S.E Hinton's book was more or less the one of the movie, all old of the 80s, the characters cloths exactly how they were, the fights of greasers and socials were like I had imagine hitting but without knifes or guns. The church on fire was like I imagine they were returning for Dairy Queen and then they saw all the small kids inside with flames everywhere. The movie discussed very well the themes of the book but the movie missed some things like the first fight when the socials were going to cuts Ponyboy hair. It also passed more things that didn't pass in the book. But anyway the movie and the book were well discussed they were very relative.Which is better the movie or the book?Well, that a good question but definitive the book, it is more exited when you are going to read it you get very enthusiastic because you want to know what is going to happen next. Also because the book is more complete describes more the characters the setting. So I liked more the book and I recommend it a lot it is very interesting and you get engaged in the novel.Paulina Lara#13 8A"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When S. E. Hinton wrote The Outsiders, she wrote a great book. It started with a fight that led you into the book's central conflict of \\"socs\\" versus \\"greasers\\". These two groups battled it out all the way through the book and, in the middle of it, there was murder, runaways, accidents, bravery, and death. In the end, The Outsiders really brings home the importance of friendship and how it can get you through the toughest of times. I really enjoyed the book, and I think others will too. While it's geared toward teenagers, I feel that other ages can relate to it also; the problems encountered are universal.The narrator, a young greaser named Ponyboy, tells you his account of everything as he saw it in 1967, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rowdy group of greasers he calls family never had a dull moment. Whether Pony was with his brothers, Sodapop and Darry, or with Johnny, Two-bit, Steve, and Dally, there was a feeling of family among the group. This is probably because none of the boys really had great family lives: Pony's and his brothers' parents were dead; Johnny's parents were cold and heartless; and Dally didn't really have a family. I don't know if they would have made it through the times ahead if it wasn't for how close they were.From the very beginning, it was evident that the central conflict is socs versus greasers. While there were a few insignificant fights between the two groups, there was a constant reminder of Johnny's run-in with some socs. He was injured so badly that he carried a knife with him from then on. However, one night was taken too far. Pony and Johnny had decided they were going to run away, but their plans were shattered when a large group of socs drove up. The socs held Ponyboy under water and were going to drown him. When Johnny realized this, he pulled out his knife and used it. Pony and Johnny knew they couldn't stay there anymore, so they went to find Dally and get his help. I suppose, in a sense, they got what they wanted - they were running away.Pony and Johnny hid out in an abandoned church in the country for a week before Dally came to visit them. It was then that Johnny announced that they were going to turn themselves in. Dally thought they were crazy, but his concerns were pushed away when they all realized that the church they had been hiding in was on fire. The three of them rushed to the scene and learned that there were children trapped inside. Instantly, Pony and Johnny were in the burning building saving the kids. It was evident that Johnny was happy doing this. In the end, all the kids were out safely and, just as the boys were climbing out, the building began crashing down. The three of them - Pony, Johnny, and Dally - were rushed to a hospital. Pony was released quickly, but Dally would have to stay in for a little while; he would be fine though. Johnny, however, had gotten the worst of it. If he survived, he would be paralyzed. It was a tough time, and Dally took it the hardest. Johnny was the only thing he had ever loved.Three people were dead in one week. The toll this took on the remaining greasers was a phenomenal one, and they could only turn to each other for support. The strong friendship among them was the only thing that got them through. This book definitely got its message across that friendship can help you through almost anything, and the characters that portrayed this were excellent. I enjoyed this book very much, and I know others will too."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is my FAVORITE BOOK IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!

I still have that copy, which has seen better days. I remember the story and the characters drawing me in from the start. It's a classic coming of age tale of kids from the wrong side of the tracks struggling to fit in and fighting against those who view them as outcasts. Not only do I find it a great read even as an adult, I feel it is as relevant today as when first published in 1967, showing that whether rich or poor, all teenagers are essentially the same, having the same concerns and fears and angst. The book speaks to kids in an unpatronizing fashion, and will continue to resonate with many long after they've turned the last page. After all, what kid hasn't been in Ponyboy's and his brothers' and friends' shoes at some point -- misunderstood and being put down simply for who they are, or aren't? I have no doubt those who have read and enjoyed The Outsiders, both kids and adults, will enjoy the other Hinton greats (That Was Then, This Is Now; Tex and Rumblefish), in addition to other troubled teen novels such as The Catcher in the Rye, The Amboy Dukes and American Odyssey."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"A boy named Ponyboy, and his two brothers, Sodapop and Derry, turn into hoodlums when their parents die in a car crash. They join a group of hoods: Johnny, 2-Bit, Steve and Dally. They are in a battle against the Socs, who are spoiled and very rich. The Socs always jump the hoods (Greasers) when they are alone. They all have parts to play: Dally is the tough guy, 2-Bit is known for his switchblade, Steve is known to mess around a lot, Sodapop comforts people, Johnny is the pet of the gang, and Ponyboy is the youngest at the age of fourteen. There are two other gangs of greasers.I really enjoyed this story because it is very graphic - there is a lot of violence and blood, and also it is very sad at points. It makes it so you cling to the book with excitement, and it also lets you understand it better because it has more detail. It also has a great plot and storyline. It is very well written and the author, S.E. Hinton, was only 16 when she started this great book.

I started the book, and just coudn't put it down. It was irresistable, it made me laugh, cry, and want to be there with the characters. It was a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to let go of all of their emotions. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is the best book I've ever read. I've read it eight times and seen the movie twenty-three times. It is a very emotional book. I feel sorry for the greasers because they are good people but everyone looks on the outside and judges them. The characters portray that it is very hard to live on that side of the tracks.

Many of you complain that it is childish. I don't know if you know this or not, but S.E. Hinton wrote this book when she was 16. I'd like to see you write something this good at 16. Also, you said it was unrealistic. I've never read a book more realistic than this. If you think that killing and gangs are unrealistic then you certainly live in a sheltered world."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is full of emotianal things.

The first time i read it, i was in 5th grade. It is a great book"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I had to read The Outsiders in English. I loved it from the very 1st page, and so did everyone else in my book group. It's about 2 &quot;gangs&quot;, The Greasers and the Socs. Ponyboy, the main character, acts tough, but is really a sensitive guy who likes to read and go to school. But when his friend Johnny murders a Soc, they need to get away and fast. The murder completely changes his opinon on all this fighting. I like this book because its not like the books for teens that are out there. They're all about teen love, the prom or the popular kids. This book shows another side of our lives, the side thats not always preppy, and happy. Teens today can relate to this book because its going on everyday around us. I love this book, and recommend it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When Hinton wrote this book in 1967 I bet she didnt think that 30 years later it would still be so close to the way the world is. The relationships between the &quot;socs&quot; and &quot;greasers&quot; are still alot like the relationships between groups today. The characters sound like people you would meet normally. This is such a touching book, and so close to home for alot of teens today. I highly recommend this book! I'm so glad I had to read this book for my English class."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I was really little I loved to read but now I only read when I have to. I had to read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; for English class and immediately discovered it was an excellent book. I just finished it today! If I hadn't been in class I probably would have been crying because it really touches you. Not to mention my favorite charachter was Johnny. I could also relate to Ponyboy because I have the same qualities. You can really see people you know in each character! Many people classify this book as young adult, which I am, but I really think anyone of any age could learn a lot from &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; S. E. Hinton must be a incredible author to write a book like this when she was just 16! I plan on reading more of her books and I hope you read &quot;The Outsiders&quot; because it is more than a book, it touches your heart like nothing else. My class will also be showing the movie, but I don't even know how a movie could be this good."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book in English class and it was very good! When we would stop reading a voice in my head said, \\"PLEASE KEEP ON!!!\\" This book was very good and I really love it. I'm kind of like Ponyboy because sometimes I forget things.

Hinton shows the difficult coming of age events one boy has to face. The Socs were the rich kids, who had it all. They were never satisfied with their lives, and always wanted more. The Greasers from the other side of tracks are stereotypical bad boys. Ponyboy a Greaser lives with his brothers. One day Ponyboy and his friend Johnny decide to talk to the Socs girlfriends. The Socs disapprove and beat them up, just for socializing with the girls. A Soc boy tries drowning Ponyboy, but Johnny grabs him off and kills him. The Greasers know immediately that they must run away in order to escape being caught by the police. Ponyboy and Johnny hide in a church. After a few days, Johnny wants to return home and confess their crime. Before they leave, one of their cigarettes lights the church on fire and a few little children get trapped inside. Johnny and Ponyboy get the kids out in the nick of time to save their lives, but Johnny gets seriously hurt. The town calls them heroes. Johnny is rushed to the hospital on the verge of death. This suspenseful book fills readers with excitement, tragedy, and many emotions. \\"The Outsiders\\" was an amazing book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good cry."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders is a good book that has to do with conflicts between two groups, the socs and the greasers. It is kind of violent because the two groups are often fighting. The book is sometimes difficult to follow because there are a lot if different charicters in the book, other than that it is a great book. It is full of action and suspense and I would recomened it to anyone who likes those types of books."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is about a fourteen year old boy named Ponyboy. Ponyboy has grown up in tough surroundings. When his best friend, Johnny, killed a rival gang member, called the Socs, it forced Ponyboy and Johnny to go into hiding. That was only the beginning of Ponyboy's wild adventure. This is the only book that I'm willing to read more than once. It's hard to compare this to another book, when this is the best book I've ever read. It's so different than a lot of other books I've read. It gets straight to the point and it affects you emotionally of all the hard times each character goes through. I feel that I identify with Darry the most. He stayed strong, and kept his family together. He had to raise a family all by himself. This book is great for all ages. I read back in seventh grade. And I also read it now in twelth grade. The only draw back is the circumstances of Johnny and Dally. My two favorite characters of the book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a very interesting book told in first person by Ponyboy Curtis, a gang member of the 'Greasers'. He is fourteen years old and lives with his older brothers Darrel and Sodapop. His best friend and also gang member,Johnny Cade, kills a member of the rival gang (for self-defense) and Ponyboy and Johnny go into hiding with the help of the toughest member of the 'Greasers', Dallas Winston. They're hiding in the country when they see a church burning down. They hear that there are some kids in the church so Ponyboy and Johnny go in to save them. They manage to save all the kids but while Johnny was trying to jump out the window the roof colapsed and hit Johnny on the back leaving him paralized and with a third degree burn. Ponyboy managed to get out safely. Days later Johnny dies. Dallas can't take the pain since Johnny was the only person he's ever loved. He decided to rob a grocery store. He was being chased by the cops when he turns around and pulls out an unloaded gun. The police don't hesitate to shot and leave Dallas dead on the ground. Ponyboy witnesse all this and becomes sick. Weeks passed and he is still depressed but decided he can't stop living because someone else did. He continues school but has bad grades. His English teacher tells him to write a composition on anything he wants. Ponyboy decides to write about his events with Johnny and the whole gang.There is more to this story.

I am 14 (the same age as Ponyboy) and by reading it in one day it gave me an over dose of what it must of felt like. The book portrays the absolute love needed by Pony's brothers to survive. The book does not glorify evil like my teacher seems to think, however it shows the pain and agony felt by the greasers. The book begins with an up beat, intense, and irresistable intro. However I was almost brought to tears in the end. I was there spurring Ponyboy on all the way. This is a definite must read for all young adults"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"First of all,I would like to say I live in a neighborhood like ponyboy.You can say it's ghetto,I'm Latino and no hoodlum just pretty much like ponyboy.

The book showed good freindship and bravery, for Ponyboy, the main character of the book, had many freinds and many acts of showing his little sense of courage. This book has many seens that are not realistic but you must learn to look beyond that and see the true value of each scene. Do you want to read a sad, happy kind of book? If you do read The Outsiders it is filled with sarcasism and sad emotions."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I never used to read all that much. That is until I discovered S.E Hinton books. I love all of her books that I've read, but without a doubt,my favorite of all time was The Outsiders. A short time after I finished reading the book, I saw the movie. To me, the book was MUCH better than the movie,Seeing that I liked the characters better as I imagined them, than as how they were portrayed. I would recommend this book to anybody,but especialy people around my age. Although I think anybody would enjoy this book just as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I thought that it was a very good book, and I would recommend it to every one. This book doses a good job telling the other side of the story. The Outsiders is very descriptive book, S.E. Hinton dose a good job giving you all the kids backgrounds. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the greasers fight the soc'es and they finely prove to them that they are just as important as anyone else. This book dose a good job of putting things into your eyes. Jonny finely found the meaning of it is rough all over. This book also is good at pointing out the good and the bad on both sides of town.

It was written very well and you could picture in your head what you are reading. The story about the Greasers and the Socials was a good idea because that is close to the truth in the real world. When the writer wrote about Johnny being jumped that was a good idea on her part because it to was close to the real world in some places. I would have to say that my favorite part of the book would have to be the rumble at the end because it had a lot of drama and it made you picture the rumble in your head as you were reading along. I think that the writer should have made the socials put up more of a fight than they did.This book has everything that you would want to read about, violence and close to real live situations. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read or even don't like to read, it is a very good book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I just picked up this book that way I looked like I was reading, but when I read what it was about I decided to give it a shot.

I kept thinking about it, wondering what happenened to the characters. About six months later I saw it at a yard sale, bought it for 50 cents, and read it cover to cover without stopping. It turned out to be one of the greatest books I've ever read. I cried lots, which I rarely do when reading books. It made me think a lot about how I treat people- I'm one of the rich, spoiled kids who would be a Soc if they were still around today, and I don't think I've always been incredibly kind to gang members and kids who aren't as incredibly lucky as I am. After reading this book I changed a lot, and I think I'm a better person now.

I'ld recamend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Well, this is, hands down, one of the most touching books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Hinton had a wonderful way of showing you the real people behind all of those masks that they put up to protect themselves for getting hurt, and all the masks society puts up as well. It gave you insight about how bad it is all around, and opened your heart to people that you probably would not usually relate to. People that you can't usually relate to, but who are regular kids. Soda and Two-Bit, the fun loving guys that'll never grow up. Darry, the one who grew up too fast, too much trouble put on his shoulders at one time. Johnny, caught between two abusive parents and the need to be loved, everyone's little brother. Ponyboy, trying to figure out where he's going in life. Where all of them will be going. Ponyboy who watches the sunset and reads poetry. And finally, Dallas, the hood. Dallas the one who didn't know how to love, and the one thing that he did love was ripped away from him. Dallas who didn't care what people though, and who didn't even remember what it was like to cry. All these characters give you a taste of what it's like on the other side of town, but not to farfetching to be unbelievable. The Outsiders is a truely touching tale of friendships, and hardships, and the fight to be understood. It's about loosing the fight, and winning it as well. But mainly it's about life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"A glimpse in the life of a young man growing up tough in a world few of us ever know.

The way The &quot;Outsiders&quot; described how they feel about parents and the way they hang around with there friends was very close to how I do so I was really surprized. I liked the way it ends too, it ends by showing the whole book was the assignment that Ponyboy's english teacher gave him.

The Outsiders was rather violent and gory at times, but it showed what life was like for the main character. The book moved along quickly and kept the reader intrigued. Although the character's situation was hard to relate to, his feelings were ones we have all felt at one time or another.

Six years on, its still, without a shadow of a doubt, my favourite novel. I can't particulary relate to any of the main characters situations but they are so craftily developed that you end up feeling strangely atteched to some of them. Dally and Johnny are particularly enrapturing and as the novel unfolds you discover insights into their personalities that have been cleverly woven in. Loyalty, frienship and the lengths some people will go to maintain these bonds are the main issues examined in this book. Some of the reasons for the divide between the social classes are also carefully examined and S. E. Hinton gives this complicated issue a realistic conclusion-people from different social classes don't always get along and that will never change. The main character, Ponyboy, is the narrator and the book follows his inward struggle to accept who he is and shows how he deals with three particularly difficult situations which can either be the breaking or making of his life. The fact that the author was sixteen when she wrote this book perhaps explains how accurately she managed to capture the teenage characters intensity, arrogance, innocence and vunerability.

It relates to the &quot;real world,&quot; and how people live it. The plot of the book was really interesting.

I believe that this book was the best she wrote. There was even a movie made after it. I would give this book 5 stars, but you have to be able to understand what she is writing about. This type of stuff really does happen. Two friends Johnny and Ponyboy find themselves in some tight situations throughout this story until the major conflict that ends up making the story what it really is. If you are a person who gets into mischief then this is defiantly is a book that you want to read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton because my English teacher recommended it as an engaging novel. In the beginning, it was difficult to understand what was going on because S.E Hinton uses a lot of old slang. Also I don't know much about the American teenagers, especially from the 1960's. During the first two pages, I was opening the dictionary all the time, but by the third chapter, I felt as if I learnt a new language. I also realized that I really related to the characters. Ponyboy and his friends had the same problems as we have as teenagers now-a-days everywhere in the world. The book is honest because the author is a teenager who knows what the life is like. It's more truthful than when an adult writes about their teenage life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I liked this book alot. It had alot to say about how people treat each other and what people go through that you never really think about. I heard that S.E. Hinton was fifteen when she wrote this book. Man thats crazy. I'd never think someone that young could write a book this deep, and how she could make up some of these really vivid characters like Ponyboy, Johnny, Darry, Soda, and Dally. How Hinton made the characters come alive and how she made me think I actually knew Pony, that was just.... I can't really explain it. The characters and plot developement were instilled with a sense of pride that was almost inspiring."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book in yr 9 english, and i loved it!

You just get so wrapped up in their lives and what's going on with them that you can't put the book down. It's my favorite book of all time and probably still will be my number one favorite when I am 102. I still get a thrill when I hear the name Ponyboy or Dally or Two-bit.

It's touching story is inspiring and riviting. It shows that there is always a ray of hope in any situation that a young person(or anyone in this case)can face in the harsh world of reality. It explains how words can either touch or hurt any person, no matter what race, religion, or social statis. The Outsiders is extremely moving with it's tale of brother hood and togetherness.

I didn't know if I'd like it at first, but by the end of the year, I had read it three times. The writing is superb. You feel like you are right there with Ponyboy. There is a sense of understanding that you can gain from this book that is very real. Some may say the situations are inappropriate for children; I don't believe they are teaching violence, but rather how important friendship is and that it is possible to make good out of a bad situation. If violence is a large concern for you, you may desire to stay away from this book. Personally, I will never forget this book; the characters are practically part of my life now.

In the book, The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, you can see exactly what that would feel like.In the Outsiders Pony Boy and Johnny are in a bad gang, But, they also do good things. For example, one time they rescued little kids from a burning church. The church was on fire because they left a burning cigarette in it. This book is also about people getting jumped and gang rumbles. When you read this book, you learn about life in a gang where some of the rules are, don't go on an other gangs block, never walk alone at night if you're in a gang, and always carry a switchblade.This is my favorite book! I would recommend this book to 5th graders through adults. I would also recommend this book to people who like books about gangs. This book talks about drugs and drinking so little kids shouldn't read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"\\"Stay gold, Ponyboy.\\" These were Johnny's last words.

Long time enemies find that they really aren't so different and things are \\"rough all over\\". When the unthinkable happens, Ponyboy learns that family matters and the hood is like one big family that sticks together no matter what.

Hinton, is a work of contemporary realistic fiction and is on the extreme edge of appropriateness for readers aged 7 to 12 years old.The plot of the book centers on the conflict between two groups of youths, the \\"Greasers\\" and the \\"Socs,\\" and is progressive in structure. \\"Ponyboy\\" is the main character and narrator of the story. He tells the story from a first-person point of view. He is fourteen years old and his parents are dead. His best friend is \\"Johnny.\\" The secondary characters include the various members of the gangs, several girls, and other characters used to develop the plot and characterizations. During a gang fight between the two main groups, Johnny kills a rival gang member to save Ponyboy's life. The murder, the circumstances surrounding the murder, and the responses of the characters to the murder, make up the plot of the story.The narrative of The Outsiders is presented primarily in chronological order, with significant events occurring as time passes. Several conflicts are presented in the book. Character versus character conflict is evident from the antagonism between the two groups (Greasers and Socs). Character versus society conflict is evident from the characters' experiences with class warfare, prejudice, family dynamics, child abuse, and inequitable treatment. Character versus self conflict is also developed as Ponyboy struggles with internal tension regarding decisions about doing the \\"right\\" thing after the murder. He also struggles with the realization that both groups have much in common, although they appear different on the surface. Furthermore, he struggles to maintain a tough exterior to cover his genuinely sensitive personality (he likes to read).I found S.E. Hinton's story of disenchanted youth and class conflict a surprisingly engaging and insightful book, and deserving of its many awards. I did not expect to enjoy it. Although it was written in the 1960's, its themes remain universal and contemporary. Today's young readers will connect with the story's characters, especially those readers who have experienced similar challenges.I would recommend this book to anyone trying to meet the needs of young readers."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"One of the things I love about this book is that S.E. Hinton wrote a simple, short book, but managed to make it great. I have read A Clockwork Orange and Slaughterhouse-five and am currently reading The Catcher in the Rye and Breakfast of Champrons, my point being that I really enjoyed/am enjoying these but can still appreciate The Outsiders for the great book it is. The story is told in first person by Ponyboy Curtis, a greaser growing up in the 1960's Midwest. He looks up to his brother Sodapop, feels rejected and unloved by his brother Darry and doesn't know what to think about the Socs, the rich kids in town who despise greasers.One night at the movies, Pony and his best friend Johnny meet two soc girls who aren't like any Socs they have ever met, they don't care that Pony and Johnny are poor, they just like them for who they are, something the two greasers had never thought a soc was capable of. However later that night Ponyboy and Johnny are attacked by the girl's boyfriends, one of whom is killed in self-defense by Johnny. Pony and Johnny then leave town to avoid punishment. After a tragic turn for the worst things eventually come down to a rumble beetween the greasers and socs, and the eventual breakdown of the gang's wildcard: Dally. The greasers are mearly looking for exceptance though they are labeled by almost everyone as the bad guys. The Outsiders is a magnificent book that shows the foolishness of sterotyping and follows a fourteen year old on a journey through the hardest part of his life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think this book was the best book I have read about teens and gangs.This is a good lecture were teens can read and think more about geting involved with gangs.It teachs you more about why teens get involve in gangs because they need love and they go and get it with his gang members.This story is about gangs and the love they have for each other they soppport every member of their gang on everything they do everybody follows along."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I first read the Outsiders when I was in the sixth grade. Back then I hated to read and thought books were stupid and pointless like many kids do. That all changed when I read The Outsiders.I never thought that I was actually going to like the book. The kid's name was Ponyboy for god's sake, but I did, and I have loved it ever sense.So don't be afraid, pick up this book. I have never read anything that has hit me so hard and has changed the way that I view people. I still read the book every so often becuase it was just such a great acheivment for it's time period, not to mention it was written in a way that I understood and could relate to.The charaters in this book made me feel that I knew them personaly. I wouldn't be so suprised to see one of them at the mall sometime or at McDonald's; they became that real.As I said before, don't overlook this classic tale of friendship and belonging becuase of the time period or the seemingly strage names. It still relates to kids today. Trust me, if a book has been around for almost 40 years, has won numerous awards and had a movie based after it, it's going to be a good read. So, take the chace, read this book and maybe you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book as a school assignment with an ambition to read it in three days. I suceeded and got so into the book that I would say it's one of the best books I've ever read! I don't see how anyone could not like S. E. Hinton's fabulous style and characterazation! She is, you must agree, an amazing author! Read this book! It will please you and make you beg for more stories from S. E. Hinton!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Good book. I do not read much, but this is up there with the Lord of The Ring series, and I love that. S.E. Hinton wrote somethin good here, and I reccomend this to everyone. Very detailed with decent characters, this is a really, really, good book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"S.E. Hinton's novel of class conflict, choice and determination, set in 1950s Oklahoma, creates empathy for characters that live on the periphery of society. Hinton's protagonist, Pony boy, along with his fellow \\"gang\\" members, including Two-bit, Dally, Darry and Johnny, are \\"greasers\\". Outwardly, they are an unsavory lot. They wear their hair long and greasy, wear jeans, t-shirts and, if they can eat chocolate cake and soda for breakfast, live in unfashionable homes in poor neighborhoods and are generally doomed to poor-paying blue-colored jobs. They do little to endure themselves to those who are not of their group. For instance, at the drive-in movie, they \\"introduce\\" themselves to some girls through uncouth behavior.The average greaser's nemesis is the \\"soc\\". The soc comes from a privileges background, wears fashionable clothing and often enjoys his or her parents' indulgence.Hinton, through a series of plot elements, presents the greasers as the misunderstood heroes of the book. For instance, Johnny, the least aggressive of the greasers, kills a soc. However, the killing is clearly presents as a case of self-defense. Further, we understand that Johnny had previously been savagely beaten by the very same soc who, on this occasion, without question, had intended to kill Johnny. Johnny later suffers fatal wounds when he rescues a group of children from a burning church- the same building in which he and Pony boy had been hiding out subsequent to the killing of Bob.The toughest greaser also is portrayed sympathetically. Even when Dally ends up being shot by the police after he attempted armed robbery, Dally seems more a tragic than a threatening figure. Pony boy reveals that Dally's gun did not hold and bullets; Dally desperate act is attributed to his inability to cope with Johnny's death.Throughout the book, the greasers are portrayed as loyal and misunderstood, imbued with an anger and despair that has been etched upon their psyches through years of abuse and neglect.Despite this, Johnny and Pony boy are able to maintain a grasp upon their humanity. Johnny pays with his life. Pony boy's fate is more promising. His nervous collapse at the end of the novel galvanizes the resolve of the rest of the greasers. They vow to break the cycle wherein their fate seems pre-determined if not for their own sake, then for Pony boy's. \\"Don't get tough,\\" Two-Bit urges Pony, \\"You're not like the rest of us and don't try to be (Hinton 1989, p. 152).&qout; Soda reminds him, \\"I you don't have anything, you end up like Dallas... and I don't mean dead, eather (Hinton 1989, p. 152).\\"Where Hinton's vision lacks courage is in her portrayal of the greasers as societal victims who lack genuine flaws. Certainly the greasers keep irregular hours, watch too much television, smoke and have poor diets, but they do not have serious faults. Any faults can be readily attributes to their circumstances and to the inequitable political and social systems that subjugate them. Hinton's novel would have been more of an achievement had she been able to generate empathy for the members of an underclass who are not simply \\"noble savages\\". It is easy to accept the romantic portrayal of a marginalized class of people; it is difficult to accept a cold, accurate rendering of the same group, especially when the group's attitudes, values and behaviors are profoundly different from those of the reader.Still, Hinton's work, while it is often sentimental, is also also sensitive and even poetic. We can hear Hinton herself speaking through Pony boy when he laments, \\"I could picture hundreds and hundreds of boys living on the wrong sides of cities, boys with blink eyes who jump at their own shadows. Hundreds of boys who maybe watch sunsets and looked at stars and ached for something better (Hinton 1989, P. 155)."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After reading this, I am amazed. To think S.E. Hinton wrote this when she was 16 is inspiring. It makes me think of what I could do if I put my mind to it. The characters are people everyone can relate to.

I am not actually done with The Outsiders yet, but I feel motivated to comment on it. I really was very interested in this book from the beginning. I literally couldn't put it down because of the exciting events that are happening throughout the book. The characters also made it exciting because of their personalities and the interesting background of their lives. The author's style of writing is a little different because the chapters of the book don't seem to end so having chapters seems pointless. I don't want to give anything away at this point but it seems to me that the theme is that people are often misjudged because of their appearence, amount of money,and who they hang around with. Ponyboy looks like a tough kid but we find that he is actually sensitive and caring. This book is different than any book I have read. I am discovering a part of society that I know exists but I know little about."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I was getting ready to go on vacation and realized I had nothing to read, I looked at my older sister's bookshelf for something.

He was a smart, outgoing kind of guy that could have had more in life if he didn't live a hard life. The Outsiders was another story taken from the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;west side story&quot; plays. Teenage kids growing up into a world that was full of hat and violence. Many reviews I have read feel that it has no outlook on how life is, If people feel this way, then, man, they live in a isolated world.

The characters names are Ponyboy, Sodapop, Two-bit, Johny, and Dallas. Yes the names of the characters are Ponyboy, and Sodapop.

The Socs,(also called the Socials) are the higher class of boys in the city. They bully and beat-up the greasers just because they are poorer than they are. I enjoyed this book due to the characters, how they act, and how humorous they are. My favorite characters are Darry and Ponyboy. I like Darry because he is smart and strong. I also like Darry because he likes to show off his muscles. I like Ponyboy because he enjoys movies and he always sticks to his gut feeling.

Nothing could change that. Well, something could.On a fateful night, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny do something beyond just a fight. Now, they must skip town and seek refuge in another town with the help of a rambunctious hoodlum and friend.

Hinton after she heard about her friend being jumped. This story shows bold heroism and friendship. You can relate to any one of the characters and feel obliged to hear what will happen in the lives of the characters next. Full of twists and turns and expressions of anger and confusion and most definitely frustration, this book takes you on an unforgettable journey into the life of a \\"greaser\\", and how one night can alter the very fate of a city.This book contains more mature content and should be read by those of us who are 13 and over.The book is 5 starred, though it deserves more.

Darry, being the oldest and in charge of the house, is very serious and needs to take a chill pill and that puts stress on Pony. At first Pony's life is pretty typical (aside from occasional friend fights and family blunders), but then he saves children from a burning church and gets into rumbles with the Socs (socials) who are your typical spoiled rich kids.

A couple of years ago Ponyboy's parents got into a devastating car accident and died instantly. Now Darry the oldest in the family has to take care of Soda and Ponyboy. Ponyboy is in a gang called greasers with some of his friends Johnny, Dallas, Two-Bit, and his brothers. Ponyboy can count on his brothers and on his friends, but not on much else besides trouble with the Socs. The Socs are a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers. Ponyboy knows what to expect, until Johnny goes a little out of hand and kills one of the Socs. Now they have to hide out in an abandoned church. Something really bad happens to Johnny and all his friends wish that it never happened.I think that this is a really good book. I like this book because I like to read about gangs and how they live their lives. S.E. Hinton wrote the book so well that you can sometimes feel what is going on in the story and know exactly how the characters are feeling. She describes how people are different and how they are the same. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books about gangs and getting into fights with people that you barely even know. I would recommend this book to 13-18 year olds because I don't think that people over 18 would want to read a book about kids. I think you if they read this book then you will want to read this book over and over again and you won't want to put the book down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders Puffin Books 1997, 180 pps., $6.99S.E.

Then just because that happens it takes you to a different side of all the gang members on both sides of town.I would recommend this book to kids that like to read books that have, kids in them and then change because of a dramatic scene in the book. The age range that would be good for this book would be around the teen ages because kids are sometimes in gangs at this age and in the book, Ponyboy and Johnny are 14 and 16 years old.I think that this is a very good book to read about because it tell how two different groups of people have a little bit in common, but just because they react to each other before they know each other then it makes a big deal.

Living in constant fear that you might get caught and killed? What an experience that would be... and it's described perfectly in S.E. Hinton's book THE OUTSIDERS. So, sit back and listen to what I have to say!In the beginning, the main character, Ponyboy, is explaining and setting up the story. He mentions an important part of the book. He was telling us how there were three social groups. The greasers were a poor, wild group, and they were the lowest class (he was in this class), middle class, and the &quot;socs&quot; (short for socials) who were spoiled, rich, people who like to jump &quot;greasers&quot; as a hobby.Ponyboy had two brothers, Sodapop and Darry. Ponyboy's parents had passed away and Darry was taking care of them. THey had to be good or Sodapop and Ponyboy could be taken away from Darry. If they weren't extra careful they could be sent to foster homes.One night when Johnny (another member of the &quot;greaser&quot; gang) and Ponyboy were under the stars, Ponyboy got home very late and his brother Darry got VERY angry. Darry was SO angry he slapped him! Ponyboy ran to find Johnny and then ran away to the park. Just their luck, a group of drunken &quot;socs,&quot; pulled up. As they tried to drown Ponyboy, Johnny pulled out a knife in self-defense and stabbed one of them!What will happen? Will Johnny and Ponyboy be able to escape and stay away from the police? If you want to hear the answer to these questions, read this book, and you'll get quite a thrill. It will also teach you a great and important lesson."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"As a high school student myself, 'The Outsiders' is a compelling novel with much lessons to offer. With a new twist in every chapter, 'The Outsiders' provides problems and solutions for the everyday teen. While violence is a reoccuring event in the novel, the lessons come with the solutions to those acts, many which pertain to self-discovery. The book clearly illistrates that there is no difference between our parents generations to ours because even then high school violence did occur. Having just completed this book at my age, I find it all the more compelling. We as teens see violence on television but it is more national, as compared to 'The Outsiders' which pertains to high school students everywehre, even close to home. The characters in the novel are very much like those of which I can relate to because they mention such defined groups. There is the \\"greasers\\" and the socs\\". While the generations have changed, we do not classify people as \\"greasers\\" or \\"socs\\", but groups exist and they exist in large numbers. I see these groups in our school, and the tension does exist. As much as we are told to be individuals and go our own ways, we are still all groups of people and 'The Outsiders' offers help and guidence in braking down the social walls. 'The Outsiders' is truely worthy of five stars and should be read for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After I read the first sentence I thought it would be about a boy who likes to watch movies.

The book tells about how gang life can be and the effects of death on someone.The story is also about ponyboy and his brother darrel who fight alot.

Like when he and the rest of the gang start doing acrobatics of the porch a bunch of people fall down. This story is also serious at the same time like when Johnny goes to the hospital the whole gang is sad. Also at the same time it can be poetic when the fuzz, police, is after Ponyboy &amp; Johnny they go to an abandoned church and the story slows down and Ponyboy recites some poetry about life.

This book also showed a lot of friendship and loyalty. The Greasers showed a lot of loyalty to each other because they are all like brothers. Also in this book there were a lot of differences.

Hinton to all the 13 year olders and up in America.This book is full of many realistic events in it.For example, all the fights between the Greasers and the Socs and the family problems with both Ponyboy's family and Johnny's family.Another reason I recommend this book is because you can relate.For instance, you have to deal with other gang members just as spoiled and rude as the Socs everyday. Another reason I recommend this book is because it deals with friendships and my friends and I have always enjoyed books that involve friendships.Ror example when Ponyboy and JJohnny ran away together because one of them was in trouble. I recommend this book to anyone who can read because everybody will like it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"At first it was pretty boring.But in the second chapter it became more exciting.There were parts of the book that were very depressing.But this is the type of book that is not afraid of telling it how it is.It talks about some real life situations.I recommend this book to anyone, and especially young people who don't know what some people go through."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really got interested in all of the characters and I was captivated by each character's fun and unique personality.

I read this book for a school project and the rest of my group wanted to read this book. You know the saying, the majority wins. I'm glad it's that way. I loved every part of theis book. The Outsiders was one- excuse me, the best book I've ever read. It's amazing that a young 16 year old would be able to write such a great book. The outsiders is about a young boy named Ponyboy who tries to survive int he cruel world of ours. His parents are dead. He depends on his two older brothers for support and love."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"It amazes me how a 16 year-old can produce such a great work. I thought it was pretty realistic, not like everything ends well. It seems absolutely real to me. Too real, as if S.E. Hinton was really Ponyboy. I liked the way the things happened, not too ridiculous, but like the everyday life of a greaser. It touched me. She saw clearly the bitterness of life and the way a 14 year old sees things, not understanding that Darry actually cared, but was too worried. She weaved all these things into a fascinating story. I liked the names 'Ponyboy' and 'sodapop' too. They added a special touch to the book. The names were unique and there was this aura spun around the names that set them aside in a nice and funny sorta way. Everything about the book had a deep sense of reality in it. I guess it was too real. One could get upset when Dally fell dead or Johnny died. You could literally see everything forming in your mind with every word put across. It is definitely worth the money."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I first read this book in 1968 and it was the first &quot;adult&quot; book I read. It introduced me to a world outside of dick and jane and the cartoon characters I had known so well up to that point.It was through this book that I learned that I was not alone in how I was feeling and what was happening in the world around me. The characters seemed so real and the story made me feel sad, yet , happy at the same time.I can honestly say that I've read the book at least 30 times and, still as an adult, like to pick it up a re-read it.

The book took place in the city. The main idea of the book was a bunch of kids fighting because some are wealthier than others. Then one of them died, and because of that another one killed himself, then one got sick and almost died but got better and didn't. The kids in the book realize what life is and why it's important.

I read it in about three days and plan on reading it several more times in the future.I'd reccomend it to young junior high students because some may be able to relate to a lot of things that happen in it. I think that some of the sad parts really made me think about how rough some kids have got it like the &quot;greasers&quot;, and how some kids have got everything &quot;socs&quot;. This book was very well written, and the author uses great sensory language to make you feel like you were actually taking a part in the book. I wish the book would've been longer or there'd be a sequel because I'm sure that I'd enjoy it just as much as The Outsiders.

This book led me to discover the poetry of Robert Frost and to this day I can recite &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay.&quot; I was hugely disappointed by the movie as I had my own ideas of what the characters looked like (and only Patrick Swayze as Darry came close), but the book never fails to remind me now of the intensity and purity of my feelings as a young teenager or how far I have come from my old neighborhood which was a great deal like Ponyboy's."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

The \\"Socs\\" (pronounced So-chez) are the kids who seem to have it all.

Fighting and being considered 'tuff' are the main worries of the Greasers while the Soc's don't have much to worry about, except to give the Greasers a hard time whether that means physical or verbal abuse. Ponyboy on the other hand has an education on his hands and seems to think more than a lot of the other boys. When the life of a Soc is taken by a Greaser all hell breaks loose as the two social groups decide to fight each other. Who will win and get the bragging rights? The story itself is one of self discovery in many of the characters, but mainly in Ponyboy who learns that sometimes, social stereotypes don't always brand a person correctly.I really liked this book first off because I thought Hinton truly capture the mind of a fourteen year old. Unsure of why adults do certain things and always making decisions without thinking are exactly the characterize a fourteen year old boy. The storyline itself was fast pace and was constantly on the move, which I also enjoyed. The brotherly bond between Ponyboy and his older brothers is evident as they are constantly on the lookout for him and joking around in the way that family does. Without their parents, it's surprising to find that they are a strong family unit and incorporate that with all their childhood friends. I could remember reading the outsiders when I was younger but reading it now is a completely different experience as I understand how their bond with one another and uprising affected their decisions throughout the novel. All in all, I really did enjoy the book the second time around, probably more than the first."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I just finished teaching this book to my 7th grade Language Arts Class.

He has two other brothers and he is part of a gang who are all Greasers and don't have much money. They are rivals with the Socs who are the rich kids in town. The Socs are always jumping and beating up the Greasers and making fun of them. There are used to being the scum of the city when something big happens and changes the whole way people look at them.This novel has a plot that kicks off the whole book from the beginning. The climax changes the whole story around right when it's about to bore you. The conflict the novel illuminates makes you want to get right in there and join the rumble and help the characters. The setting in the novel brings you right there with its resourceful descriptions and scenery. The author has such good voice and she makes you feel like you're right there beside her. She plants you right in the plot and gets you excited.Some of the bad aspects of this book are that it has foul language. They say a lot cuss words and foul language in many parts. This book also has a ton of gang related aspects. This shows the conflict between the richer and poorer gangs in the area. There is violence galore in this novel. There are rumbles, pushes, slaps and more, all in this violence-filled book. Fire guns and broken bottles take up a large part of this novel.I would recommend this book for teens and up. The profanity in this novel is a limitation that may not be appropriate to children under thirteen.If you keep yourself on the inside, you should try a book from the outside!Review #2The book The Outsiders is a great book. It is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. This takes place in the 1950s. This book is about greasers and Socs. This book is mainly about a guy named Ponyboy and the day by day struggles he goes through. Ponyboy lives with his brother Darry and Sodapop. They all are greasers. Ponyboy narrates the story and he tells it from his prospective. Some of the good things are the setting. For example, if you read the book, you will see how detailed Hinton makes the plot when they are talking about the story's events. Also it shows a lot of mood because one second it is happy, then next second could be sad. Ponyboy doesn't like to fight because he wants to make peace but his brothers are the opposite. Some of the bad things in this novel are violence in a knifing; also they call cigarettes \\"cancer sticks.\\" Also there is domestic violence among the brothers. All of these things are inappropriate for little kids. More mature readers could handle this. I think that anyone that can handle people getting killed and little kids doing inappropriate stuff can handle this. Don't be an outsider, be a insider by reading the book.Review #3The Outsiders, a novel by S.E. Hinton, involves a Greaser by the name of Ponyboy. In this novel Ponyboy and his two brothers Darry and Soda-pop have lost their parents in a car accident. He is living with Darry, his brother, as a guest. There is this other gang in this novel called the Socials or \\"The Socs,\\" and the greasers are rivals with their gang. In the beginning of this novel Ponyboy was walking back from the movies when Ponyboy was alone, \\"The Socs\\" started to threaten him by saying they would kill him and cut off all his hair. They held up a switchblade to his neck, but then his friends saw him over there and they saved him.In this novel there are some of what I think is graphic content and that's one of the reasons I think this book is \\"Bad\\". In this novel there are a lot of knives and fighting which could be not so good for younger kids to learn from. Towards the end of this book, Darry, one of the characters, was killed. I consider the content pretty graphic to kids under the age of eleven because of the violence and gang related theme.I think this book has been banned because kids could think it's ok to get in fights and smoke. A younger kid could think it's ok to bring a switchblade around and get in a knife fight when life isn't like a novel. If you're a parent, I wouldn't let this kid read this until you consider him/her mature.This novel isn't all bad. This novel is told from the main character's point of view throughout the novel which I consider pretty cool. The novel's gang situations could teach younger kids not to get in fights. This book isn't all bad. This book has some great learning lessons like watching out for messing with the wrong people. \\"They grew up on the outside of society. They weren't looking for a fight. They were looking to belong.\\"Review #4If you love action books, then The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton is for you. This book is action-packed with both conflict and compassion. I know that I loved this book. So, if you can't decide if you want to read it then I would suggest that you do because I know you will like it. Out of 5 stars I would give it a 4 . The reason it is not a 5 is because it might encourage a younger reader to do some bad things.The main character, Ponyboy, thinks that there are two types of people, the Greasers and the Soc (socials). He is a Greaser and is proud to be one. The Greasers are rough and aren't scared of anything. While the Soc gets everything they want, from cars to a good education. Pony has had some fights and rumbles before but what happens to him in this book is life changing. He will give up everything to save his friend from jail.We also learn about the rich side of town where the Soc live in comfort and safety and the regular side of town where the Greaser live not knowing if they will live another day without safety.Some good things about this book are the focus on camaraderie, characters, and setting. The camaraderie is carried throughout the book and in the end shows that it does not matter if you are a Greaser or a Soc, you all have to stick together and help each other, especially your friends.The best characters, I would say, are Dally and Soda Pop. Dally is good because he can be compassionate for one second and turn on you in another, much like a typical teenager. He shows great bravery and wits, which makes him the ideal Greaser. Soda Pop is Ponyboy's older brother. He works most of the time because he dropped out of school to earn money for the family since their parents died. Soda Pop is also very protective of his younger brother, Ponyboy.The story takes place in a classic mid-west town in Oklahoma in the late 1950's. The author's descriptions of the surroundings, especially the sunsets, with all the colors you can imagine, are exhilarating. The rich side of town is described as clean and nice, while the regular side of town is described as more dirty and run down. The book goes into great details about the setting, which paints a picture in your mind. It is these aspects of the book that make this book a thoughtful and well-written book.I would recommend this book to 6th grade and up because it has violence and questionable behavior that might not be appropriate for younger children. There are many aspects of this book that make it a thoughtful and well-written book. You can find this book at Amazon.com, and most libraries."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really liked the book &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; It helped me realize how much I really have, and how good I have it.

The book also explains more to you."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was published in 1967 by S.E&gt; Hinton and is about the life of the kids without any money the greasers and the rich kids the socs.

Hinton provides the reader with a warm, realistic and captivating view into the world of a young adolescent boy named Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy is forced to meet the normal struggles of a fourteen year old young man while in a disadvantaged situation. Ponyboy's parents' recent death in a car accident leaves him to be raised by his two older brothers, twenty year old Darry and sixteen year old Soda Pop. The older brothers work and maintain a home while Ponyboy attends high school. All of the brothers belong to a gang of friends nicknamed the \\"Greasers\\". The Greasers are considered the lower class members of their community. United with four other close \\"Greaser\\" friends, the brothers must navigate the ups and downs of everyday life while also encountering opposition from their rivals, the Socialites or \\"Socs\\". The continual tension between the Greasers and the Socs culminates in a violent situation that changes the lives of the boys drastically.S.E. Hinton skillfully guides the reader through the story from the perspective of Pony Boy. Hinton's use of a conversational tone and casual language makes one feel as if they are walking with Ponyboy through each and every encounter. His experiences include everything from a temporal trip to the drive - in movie, to the intensity of a street fight or \\"rumble\\" in the park with the opposing street gang. Hinton's descriptive narrative enables the reader to not only picture the story as it unfolds, but it also allows the reader to endure the emotion of the characters. Ponyboy reveals his innermost thoughts regarding his feelings about his friends, his brothers and his status in society. He also divulges his thoughts about girls, revealing his affection for the beautiful Socialite Cherry Valance. Cherry is a young lady with whom Ponyboy has a chance encounter. This situation gives Ponyboy the opportunity to see the Soc's in a different light, thus allowing him to gaze upon the reality that everyone shares the same basic joys and struggles despite their socioeconomic background.While S. E. Hinton's , The Outsider's is an excellent engaging novel a few negative aspects of the book need mention. The story includes description of the young men drinking alcohol, smoking and committing acts of violence and other crimes. Hinton's descriptions of these activities are necessary to the storyline. However, it would need to be reinforced with the young reader that while the illegal and otherwise negative activities described appear intriguing, they are still inappropriate ways to cope with the struggles of day to day life at any age. In addition, Hinton's use of slang, while skillful, may prove confusing for today's reader. The reader would best approach this book with some knowledge of the slang and colloquialisms of the era described (1950's). Overall, The Outsider's is an excellent read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My daughter, who absolutely hates to read, watched the movie and asked for the book. She has read it two or three times and says the movie doesn't do the book justice."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I could not put the book down all day it never closed.

If you like action that never stops this is a book for you. The Outsiders has alot of turns and twists and it keeps you guesing about what it going to happen next.

So if you like this kind of action then you should either buy,rent,or even if you can find it watch the movie."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a classic tale of the struggles between two gangs in Oklahoma. The gang known as the \\"Greasers\\" are characterized by their long, silky, and greasy hair. This group is the lower class, but yet much smarter than the upper class. The upper class gang is the \\"Socs\\" or Socials. This story shows the life and tensions between these two gangs. After Johnny, a member of the Greasers kills a member of the Socs even greater tensions rise. This leads Johnny and Ponyboy, whom the story revolves around, to hide out and try to stay away from the police. While in hiding something tragic happens to Johnny, leaving an unthinkable fate. As the gangs are furious with the losses, they declare a rumble. After this rumble, a miraculous thing occurs in the story. Something that is so thrilling you will have to read it to find out!I really enjoyed this book, although it seemed to be almost an exact replica of West Side Story. That factor in a way took the fun out of reading parts of it, as you could almost guess what was going to happen next. Though for readers not familiar with West Side Story, this book is a fantastic tale of love, hate, and tension. Though I felt it was repetitive, it was very compelling and kept you turning the pages. It also left you wanting more at the end, though the ending was purely fabulous. I recommend this book to young adults and teens who enjoy enticing stories and stories with many genres. This book is a good purchase, and you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders is a heroic book about the troubles of growing up as a greaser in town also full of Socs. Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny need to make difficult decisions after several accidents leading to them becoming heroes and juvenile delinquents. I would reccomend this book to people that enjoy stories with suprising twists and thrills along the way."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Author S.E. Hinton writes with a keen sense of teenage fears, emotions, and alienation from the world of adults. The story concerns the divide between the richer Socs and the lower-income Greasers in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The main character is Ponyboy Curtis, an orphan who is likeable, tough, fearful, and into his Greaser gang. Ponyboy and his peers must deal with a confusing mix of school, friends, the socs, the law, and problems at home. Ponyboy gets jumped by a group of Socs (increasing his coolness), and later finds himself mixed in when his friend Johnny kills a Soc in a confrontation. The two flee, but more trouble follows. This story has nearly all the elements; teenage alienation, machismo, broken homes, alcohol, violence and tragedy.A couple friends and I read this book in 7th grade in the 1970's, and despite our stable, gang-free existence, we identified strongly with Ponyboy and his Greasers. Readers today may develop a similiar identification, although the story seems a bit tame by today's gang realities of drug dealing and violence."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I have no idea why this book resonated so deeply with me. I was not raised in Oklahoma, I was not a teenage boy when I read it. My parents were alive and well and I didn't run with a gang...I liked the Beatles, and didn't care about Elvis, but I identified so much with Ponyboy that it might have been me telling the story. I've read this book at least a dozen times, and enjoyed it just as much each time as I did the first time. Maybe it's because this book taps into the angst of our teenage years. Even if you aren't in a gang, aren't a greaser or a soc, most teenagers go through a period where they feel like they just don't belong. Like they are on the outside looking in. Like they are different from the crowd. I think the book appeals to the masses for that reason alone. Although Ponyboy is unique, he's sensitive, he's smart, he is acutely aware of his differences...he is still the 'everyteen', easy to relate to. I recommend it to young readers, ages 12-17.- C.A.Wulff, www.yelodoggie.com"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This was an awesome book.....my son read it for school, and my two beagle's really enjoyed the school's copy, so I had to buy another one! :)"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Unlike most of the books we have to read in Language Arts, I actually LOVED this one.

When I started this book I couldn't put it down. It's an easy read and I'm sure everyone could read it.

I feel like I know each charactor personally because each one is so well described and had such a significant part in the book. I can relate each charactor so well, but especially Dally. I can read this book five times through and still cry. This book reaches out to me, and sooo many of my friends have gotten hooket on it, too. The Outsiders is an example how boys can be sensitive, but still be tough. And it gives a great example of how friends can be closer to you than family. If I had to choose one book to read over and over again, this would be it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"That's what I thought when I saw my daughter reading this classic for an English assignment. I've read this book too many times to remember so, I read it yet again the minute she left the house! An all time classic which will always be a part of a schools reading list in my opinion. This tale is about a group of teenagers who are growing up in less than perfect conditions. The story is narrated by 'Ponyboy' who feels there are only two groups of people in the world. Soc's and Greasers which he is. He tells a tale that leaves you teary eyed. Mum's, if you kids bring this book home from school and you've never read it, grab it!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a book that I think everyone has to read in their life.

Over all, I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was the second book I read by S.E. Hinton. The first was Rumble Fish, which I hated. I had to read the Outsiders for school, and I dreaded having to read another S.E. Hinton novel. I read it not expecting any enjoyment. Well, I was wrong. I read it in one day because I couldn't stop. The story was engaging, and I cared about the characters. I kept telling myself that I would stop at the end of the chapter I was reading, but I would just keep reading. I wanted to slow down to savor the moments and give them some thought, but I was too caught up in the story. The book has some very emotional moments that I didn't realize until I felt the tears on my own face. I rarely cry at movies or reading a book. I thought Titanic belonged in the comedy genre. Usually I would just sit back and think, 'well that was touching', and go back reading dry-eyed.My favorite character was Dallas Winston. He was one of the greasers. Strangely, he was the one I understood the most. His actions in the book made sense to me.The Outsiders was a great book, and I loved it. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is ok it has kind of wild out of this world names like ponyboy and sodapop.

Unlike Dally who you think might not care as much, but really does. This book was outstanding, its on the top of my list. I have never read anything like it. My favorite character besides Ponyboy must be Sodapop. He is just so great, he is always there and careing. He is also always trying to help Ponyboy in anyway that is possible. Soda really looks out for Ponyboy and I think that is great to have someone like that. Who is always helping you and asking whats wrong when you seem down, and just loving him more then anything and showing that he actually cares.

The way the author was able to have the readers relate to the story kept the readers reading, which is great! I'm not someone who cries a lot, and it takes a lot to make me cry. I cried while i was reading this book. I felt it was so real. i pity the greasers. after this book i swear i'll never in my life look at people poorer then me in a negative way. If they act mean i swear it on my heart that i'll try and befriend them. I do not pity Ponyboy, Johnny, Dallas, Sodapop, or Darry. Instead, i feel for them, not out of pity but because when the great characters died in the book i felt the same exact pain the characters felt. i know i'm rambling, but there's just so much thought about this book in my mind to put it in good words so I'll stop here. To tell you the truth, no words can say how great this book really is."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"\\"Things are tough all over\\" If you think that all the rich kid got it made, so you can think again. The book The Outsiders will make you understand this. You will soon realize that even if you have a lot of money and get all the breaks challenges will always come. Soces and greasers really do have it tough all over. Even though this book is a historical fiction, it is also an adventure book.The greasers are the normal lower class citizens, but are always loyal to their friends.the7y get their name from the large amounts of grease in their hair, also because most of them don't have a lot of money. Soces are the town bullies, in the upper class of the society. The soces get their name because of how rich hand snobby they are. Their idea of a good time is Jumping (beating up) greasers.In the outsiders Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, is tough and yet sensitive. Dallas Winstein is not sensitive at all he is mean and as hard as nails. Johnny is the quieter of the bunch but he is tough when he needs to be. In this book Johnny and ponyboy go on an amazing adventure from murder the saving the lives of little children.It all starts when Ponyboy Johnny and their friend two-bit walk Cherri and Marcia (two girls they met at the drive-in movies) home, when they get jumped by their boyfriends. Later that night Johnny and Ponyboy fall asleep in an open lot, watching the stars. When they wake up they realize what they did so Ponyboy runs home and gets in a fight with his older brother Darry. Darry accidentally hits pony so pony runs away and met Johnny. They decided to walk to the park when they met the boyfriends of Cherri and Marcia. As they try to drown Pony, Johnny comes from behind with a knife. Johnny stabs one of the boyfriends. That is how they start their exciting adventure.The outsiders are a very exciting book about adventure, family, friendship, courage, and bravery. The author shows great word choice, background, good voice, fluency, sense of adventure, and much more. MY opinion about this book is that it was intriguing to read and told a good story about life that every person should be aware of. In conclusion this book is an excellent reader for all ages. Also it is especially good for class room or family education."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Outsiders: a novel about a young boy and his gang the greasers.

But you will soon realize it's a heartfelt story. It gives emotion and shows love and the power of friendship.Ponyboy, a 14 year-old hoodlum, is growing up with his controlling older brother Darry, and his softer brother sodapop who's the only one Pony can relate to. He's a good kid, and does great in school, and is just like every other boy his age, but the only problem is that he's a greaser. As a greaser, Pony and his gang are constantly fighting the Soc; the upper class.All the conflicts start when Johnny, Pony's best buddy, end up going to a movie together one night. They meet two Soc girls and when their boyfriends find out later that night, and a conflict erupts, Pony and Johnny are forced to run away.As the boys are hiding away there, they teach each other different things about life. They learn importance in things that didn't mean so much to them before then. But when tragedy strikes the boys are there to become heroes. After risking their lives, a bigger problem arises and Pony fears the loss of someone close to him.Throughout the story Pony has faced many problems but he wasn't ready for what happens later.

This looks SO dumb! Ponyboy? What kind of name is THAT?? But after the first three or so chapters, I couldn't put it down! I was supposed to read to Chapter three, but I finished it! This book comes from such a different point of view that I have ever known, and I could still relate to the character.Ponyboy is sensitive, but tries to hide it, because they're greasers, and have got to be tough, like the other kids in his gang. They smoke, cuss, and are still great friends with one another. The socs are mean, meaner than the greasers, even. One night, though, something awful happends, and the book just keeps getting better and better.I would reccomend this book to ALL kids over eleven or twelve, because some of the material might not be that great for kids under that age. This book teaches us that no matter what a person looks like, they have a heart and feelings too, and we should always consider that before we judge a person."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I first started reading this book it kept my attention, it is an all around great book.

Some things that make him intellgent are reading Gone With The Wind . Ponyboy also wrote a them about his life . He used big words that most normal teens wouldn't use . Ponyboy does very well in school and makes all A's . I wonder what adventure he will go threw next!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"There are many events in The Outsiders that are believable. In the book, the Greasers and the Socs are against each other and sometimes get into fights. Like the Greasers and the Socs, some teens are like that today, as teens, in our generation. Some teenagers smoke and drink, just like in The Outsiders. Most teens drink and smoke, etc. because they are pressured, having problems at school or home, or just because they want to be cool and fit in. Like Sodapop in The Outsiders, alot of teenagers drop out of school because &quot;they have better things to do&quot;. Some kids drop out for family problems, etc. There are many things you could compare The Outsiders to a teenager's everyday life. THE END!

The Second thing he did is that he made good grades in school. The Third thing he did is he saved the kids from the burning church.

It really took Johnny a lot of courage to kill Bob because if that was me, I would of just ran away. I took tons of courage for Ponyboy and Johnny to go into the church to save the children because if it wasn't for them the children would of died. It also took Dally a lot of courage to show up to the rumble in the condition that he was in. It took a lot of courage for Ponyboy to bluff the Socs with the broken bottle. Courage is a good thing to help you stick by your friends."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy does the right thing. He does the right thing when he jumps in the church and saves the kids. He also tries to do all his assignments and keeping up his grades. He does the right thing by being a friend to Jonny. The final thing he does right is when he bleaches his hair and cuts it off so Pony and Jonny wont get caught by the cops. These are the four things we think Ponyboy did right."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"There are many bad things that happen in the story.

As you can see the Outsiders has bad events."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Johnny and Ponyboy do good when they save the kids from the burning church.On the other hand, Johnny killed Bob even though it wasnt a very good thing, he thought it was at the time becuase he saved his best friend. Johnny also did good when he had to turn himself in to the cops. How ever he also does the right thing when his parents are beating him and he does not hit his parents back.There for thats why Johnny gets upset when his mom comes down to the hospital, he figured that she would just beat him some more and tell him how much trouble he has caused.Little Johnny has changed from being scared to a brave young man."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After reading this book, it left me with a feeling I've never felt before. I've never read a more powerful or memorable book for teens then &quot;The Outsiders.&quot; S. E. Hinton is a wonderful author. If you are one of those people who isn't big on reading, give this story a try, and I'm sure it'll change your mind. S. E. Hinton's other books are also excellent. I've read them as well."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I personally think this book is a great book. I picked it up and just couldn't put it down. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next. It shows us how different but alike the social classes are. The book has two main classes, Greasers and the Socs. It also shows us the lives of a gang of Greasers. Three of them are brothers whose parents died in an automobile accident and are left to fend for themselves. But they have friends to help. All six of them are different in many ways but also are the same. In the end it's different than the beginning but they will work through it together."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"&quot;The Outsiders&quot;The Outsiders, a book which I was assigned to read, was surprisingly good. When it was first given to the class I had doubted that it would have an in-depth plot. However, to my chagrin, the story turned into an involving tale about teenage gangs in the 60's. In the story, a few members of the &quot;Greasers&quot; get into rather serious trouble when they kill a &quot;Social&quot;. In order to avoid being caught two of the murderers flee to country where they hide out for a week. When they return, their lives had changed like they never imagined they would.I believe that this book represents the results of gang activity. It has changed slightly over the years, but the general result remains. This book's real-life plot was enjoyable and informative. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read a book with a true-story resemblance and a few interesting surprises."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think the Outsiders was a good book. It's about a little gang called the Greasers and they always fight another gang called the Soc's. It's a good book for ages 12-15 cause kids at that age always act like little Thugs and Homie G's. Well when I read the book I got interested in it and I don't even read books that much. I think everyone should read this book. It's all about a gangs life and how they live in a city. Next time you go to the library check this book out sometime."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is a good book about two different ways of living between the Socs and the Greasers. The narrator is a boy Greaser who shows us the good and hard times about being a greaser. However, if you do not like violence, I don't think you should read this book. There are a lot of situations in this book that contains violence. Overall, I really liked this book, because most books we read in school aren't very good. If you like stories with some violence and a lot of thoughts and emotions going on between the characters then you should read &quot;The Outsiders.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think The Outsiders is a very good book.

Hinton, is a great book to read. It has some adventure in it, a good plot, and it tells some hard times of it. Ponyboy and his friends, or the Greasers, are always fighting against the richer kids called Socs. The Greasers are friends that always stick together no matter what happens to them. Some of the Socs on the other hand, don't really care themselves. Those Socs only care about getting drunk and jumping the Greasers. Ponyboy and Johnny are on the run from the fuzz, or police, for awhile because Johnny had killed one of the Socs. Now there's going to be a big rumble, or fight, against the Greasers and the Socs.

This is a must read book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ithink that the outsiders is a wonderful book for kids ages 12-16. I think this because the characters in the outsiders go through a lot of the problems that teenagers face today. They go through problems like stereotyping, fights and clashes between social groups. The problems that ponyboy and Johnny(the main characters of the book)go htrough trying to solve there problems show kids that the problems they face arent the end of the world. Another good thing about this book is that something exciting is always going on and there is a lot of action. The people in the book seem to always be in trouble they face things like fights saving lifes and even coming close to death. This makes it a lot easier to pay attention and focus on the book.

We just finished reading in our English class. I think it describes what happens in high school. Very good book!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a book that is mainly about five guys. Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darrel are brothers. Dally and Johnny are close friends. Johnny and Ponyboy are complete opposite of Dally. Johnny and Ponyboy are shy and hate getting into trouble. Dally loves making trouble. The book is about two sides that hate each other. There's your &quot;Socials&quot; and your &quot;Greasers&quot;. When someone trespasses on the other side trouble begins.I highly recommend this book to everybody. It really tells you what happens when two sets of rivals come face to face. S.E Henton did a great job on this book. It had its funny parts and it had its emotional parts. It starts out so happy and everything is going great then as it narrows it self to the end trouble starts to happen.

It's so touching and very well written. Fair warning: This book is not for the faint of heart. It's extremely sad in some parts. I usually am pretty unemotional when reading a book, but this really touched me and I had tears in my eyes. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, young or old. The characters are very well developed. By the end of the story, I felt as though I had made some new friends. I esepecially felt for Johnny, a character who is emotionally traumatized and who you can't help but feel sorry for. Once again, I highly recommend the Outiders. It teaches you that there is a lot more to the common &quot;hoodlum&quot; than what meets the eye."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really liked this book because it really shows how gangs are dangerous and how they could end up.

Ponyboy Curtis is a nice-looking boy who learns about life. It is taking place in a town in the USA. Ponyboy has a conflict where his friend Johnny kills a Soc named Bob.

When my English teacher announced that we would be reading it, my face fell and I told my friends that it was awful and they would hate it. I braced myself and convinced myself that it was an awful book. Then I caught myself sneaking peeks inside of it outside of class, and reacting to it as I would one of my favorite books. Finally I let it sink in and it will never leave me again. I will add that it gets violent and portrays some negative views of teenagers, but also shows that even troubled kids have feelings and feel the need to be loved and respected. I had to talk to someone about the book and so I had to stop talking to my friends for a couple of days. They didn't get it, and didn't want to. I was the only girl in my class that liked it. Even the boys thought I was crazy. But since then I have found several girls like myself who loved the book and wouldn't admit it because of what it was about.

My parents were both killed, in a car wreck, and the only thing I can depend on is my sisters and our &quot;gang&quot;. You know, our friends. It's a hard life, and this is the first book I've found that comes from someone that has a terrific understanding of the pain and fun of living &quot;on the wrong side of the tracks&quot; People think I'm crazy, thinking it's fun. But it is. The other side doesn't get to wonder what was gonna happen tonight, except for what's for dinner. I get to wonder about how am I gonna get dinner, or who I'm gonna fight for it, or for my life. I'm in about 2 fights a week. it seems like everyone is out to beat me up, just because I'm not as rich as they are. My life is hard, just like Ponyboy's, but I couldn't live any other way.

Also, I liked how it teaches interdependece to those who may be self reliant.

One more thing...after completing the book and turning in a book report, we viewed the movie &quot;The Outsiders&quot; in class, and guess what...most liked the book better! If you see the movie, you'll know why. I was impressed that the students liked to imagine the characters the way they saw them, not how Hollywood portrayed them.

They all reminded me of people I knew in some way or another and I felt that I knew the characters personally in my own real life.I loved the plot in the story as well.

It got better. The first few chapters aren't that great but the rest is kinda good. There are 2 gangs who oppose each other in this book. The greasers and the Socs. {That is short for \\"socials\\"}. Not \\"socks\\". The whole book just revolves around the members of the greasers and one member who is a part of the gang, but doesn't claim himself one. Near the end of the book, {you probably guessed it} the 2 gangs face off and fight. Before that, the greasers aren't sure about everything since things are screwed plus the main character is an orphan to begin with. He's afraid he might be put in a boys' home as said in chapter 6. I have seen quite a few films which were books beforehand. They are all very close to each other and some are cool such as HOLES and/or TUCK EVERLASTING. The setting of \\"The Outsiders\\" is in Tulsa, Oklahoma in a very bad neighborhood where many of the Socs usually beat the living CRAP out of each other...litterally. There's not much the greasers can do about it because they're rebels and still only wait until the end because they occasionally talk about what they need to do about things like that and not procrastinate. Perhaps it sort of sends out an important message...besides, there IS a good poem that represents one of the situations they get into.

Second, I think that this book deserves a 4 star award because it has some good qualities and some null qualities. Por la audience: This is a pretty good book because it speaks somewhat truthfully. It starts well enough because it has gangs and the usual troubles that come with it. It also has some qualities that other books lack. Such as the old-fashioned version of speaking. It also has things that don't make sense. For instance, it has the characters that think they are unbeatable. It has people that die, and it has people that are more of quantity than others. The Socials or Socs are a pretty decent members of society besides the fact that they jump poor people and treat anyone who can't afford their own clothes rudely and with extreme prejudice. I think however, that some people can be pretty odd at times. For instance, it has a gang called Greasers that are completely the opposite and aren't prejudiced in the least bit. They act accordingly to their own laws, and mostly they don't like fighting unless they absolutely have to. The Greasers dress poorly, wearing jeans and sleevless t-shirts or just normal shirts. While on the other hand, the Socs dress in Expensive clothing, drive expensive cars, and pretty much get a kick out of fighting with other gangs, such as the Greasers. Overall, this book is pretty well built, whether its the problems happening throughout the story, or the scenes depicted, it is an above average book altogether.

The story and characters were and still are so powerful that I named my son after the character &quot;Dallas&quot;. I am glad it is still being read in schools today. I know most kids identify with it and can learn something about themselves through it.Taking this further into the music industry, I recommend listening to early Bruce Springsteen, who himself was a greaser.

I walk in that house, and nobody says anything. I stay away all night, and nobody notices. At least you got Soda. I ain't got nobody.\\" This is a fraction of all the trouble dealt with by the \\"Greasers.\\" They are an outside group that is mistreated and wrongly judged.As you might be able to tell, I am telling of the book called The Outsiders. The writer of this excellent book is S.E. Hinton. S.E. Hinton was only sixteen years of age when she wrote The Outsiders. I think the most amazing thing about it was not only the fact that it was her first book but that it was written from her own experiences. S.E. Hinton lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with her husband and son. I am a big fan of her work including, Rumble Fish, Tex, Taming the Star Runner, That Was Then This is Now, and many more.This book had a huge effect on my life and might for yours. I put myself right in the story and thought about what I read each chapter.It all starts out with Ponyboy, Two-Bit, Steve, Darry, Johnny, Sodapop, and Dally. Darry however, is not in the gang, \\"Greasers,\\" but still looks out for each one of them. They are enemies to the, \\"Socs,\\" who are the rich and vicious group from the West Side. Their idea of a good time is to jump, \\"Greasers.\\" So you can imagine how much conflict arises. I think this is a story based on survival and adventure along with friendship and belonging. I don't really know how to clearly reason without giving away most of the parts in the book.I give this book, \\"Two thumbs up!\\" I recommend this book to people ages 12 and older."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"the book was very good.

I did inform them in advance that Hinton was from Oklahoma, so she probably wrote the characters to be in a city in that state, so they would have southern/western accents.

No matter--at first, the voice on the cd didn't seem to fit the character I had in my mind. I agree with one of the other reviews; the twang was too much. But, after you listen to it for awhile, it's not so bad. Over half of my students enjoyed it as much, or more, as listening to me read it, and it's about them so it was worth the money. Still, if it was re-recorded with a different voice, I'd spend the money again for my own satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is often considered S.E Hintons' best book and I'd have to agree. It is a first person book with the main Character Ponyboy narrating it. Ponyboy is a 14 year old kid who is raised by his two older brothers because both his Parents had died. He, his brothers, and his friends are members of the Greasers, a gang consisting of lower to middle class guys who rival the Socs, the more wealthy people. The gangs have several fights so there is no shortage of action in this book.One of the things that makes this book great is the ups and downs that Ponyboy has to go through. A big down moment occurred to when his best friend Johnny severely injured his back in an attempt to rescue others from being harmed. The emotional impact this made on Ponyboy was very well described and the whole situation made you want to read on.Overall, I think this is a very good book, certainly worth taking the time to read. The Characters are all well drawn out with their distinct personalities. Some of the things that prevented me from giving this book a 5 star rating were that the history of the gangs and why they were formed were never described. Also, I have read better books before, but this is a very good book, and I would recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"After watching the movie, I had decided to purchase the book.

I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Although its hard not to notice minor similarities with this and Westside Story I would have to consider this Hintons best book. Whereas Westside Story is \\"ethnic\\" and urban The Outsiders is seen from the white working class viewpoint (which is rare)in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Outsiders is also a great story on top of that. Just talk to a few old timers and you can also find out that things like what went on in this book were far from a rare occurence. Big rumbles happened quite a bit back in the day. But there is a lot more to this book than the big fight towards the end of this book.You basicly have a sensitive kid whose parents are dead and his late teen brothers are forced to drop out of school to make ends meet and their group of friends who are all tough working class white teens who look out for each other and operate like a surrogate family. There are constant conflicts between them and the kids from the other side of the tracks whose families have more money. One of their group kills one of the rich kids in self defense and two of them go on the run. The whole thinng culminates in a big rumble. I can't give too much more away without ruining the story but its well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Why should you stay golden?Because it's so easy to lose yourself when things get out of control.

This book is a book that teens should read. I believe this because it offers another teen's point of view on current teen issues.

Then the leader on the opposing side, the soc's, is bob a big mean prep that terrorizes the greasers.This book is a very quick read, if I had not been kept at the same pace as the class I would've finished this book in a single setting. This book is also a very good piece of literature. The author uses the same language that teens of the time period would've. This book is a book written to appeal to people of all ages and genders.

Well that's what Pony boy lives through.In \\"Outsiders\\" written by S.E. Hinton, Ponyboy lives with his two brothers Sodapop, and Darry. Ponyboy is always running from Mustangs and Stingray Corvettes carrying loads of SOCs or a gang of rich kids who prey on kids of their age that have a financial status lower than their own. Ponyboy isn't willing to beat down a SOC at any time. He doesn't carry weapons, he is polite to girls, and he actually cares about people, Ponyboy and his friends Steve, Johnny, Dally, and Two-Bit are all together with some other allied gangs waging war against SOCs. One day when Darry slaps Ponyboy for being late home, Pony runs away with Johnny. They get attacked by some SOCs that accuse them of \\"hanging with their girls\\". That night Pony and Johnny have to run away to an old abandoned church after one SOC takes things to far!I recommend this book of historical fiction, action and unexpected twists to sixth graders and above because that's what I liked!

It is a story narrated by the protagonist and main character, Ponyboy. It follows the lives of Ponyboy and his gang, explaining the hardships they must go through as lower-class \\"greasers\\" versus their rivals the \\"Socs\\", who are the West-side rich kids. They live hard lives as it is, but when Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are involved in a murder things take a turn for the worse. Not only does Ponyboy have to run away, but he also has to deal with the struggle between him and his brothers remaining a family. Ponyboy has a journey of self-discovery throughout the novel. S.E. Hinton does a great job at writing the story through Ponyboy's eyes in a way that the reader can relate to him. This is because she was only 15 years old when she started writing it.I remember reading this book in elementary school and falling in love with it. It is a great book for young adults to read because of the themes they can relate to. It is a heartwarming story about fitting in and friendship that makes me tear up each time I read it. Even more than 10 years later, reading it again, it was still as wonderful as I remembered. I would recommend reading this book at least once in your life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton is an emotional story about a group of \\"greasers\\". Greasers are poor boys who drink, smoke and get into trouble, they wear a lot of grease in their hair, hence the name \\"greasers\\". The main character, Ponyboy, tells the story of his experiences living in rough neighborhoods in Oklahoma in the 1950s with his gang and his brothers. Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny get into a lot of trouble and have to skip town. The story gives great examples of cause and effect and reminds us of consequences to our actions. It uses plenty of characterization and completely draws in the reader. I read the whole book in one day because I couldn't put it down. In my opinion, the plot and difficult situations throughout the book wouldn't be appropriate for anyone under the age of thirteen. It is a tragic story at times, but truly shows the close and loving friendships and brotherhood between characters. The theme of the book explains the conflict between the rich and poor boys in town and how, at the end of the day, they're not as different as they seem. It's a great read, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"My 13 year old son does not love to read, so when he was assigned this book in English class this year, he was not super excited.

This book is a quick read. It left me wanting more from these characters. There is lots of conflict in this story too: Ponyboy vs his big brother, Johnny vs his parents, greasers vs socs, Dallas vs himself.

My 8th-grade son was reading it for one of his classes and I made the effort to follow along. I am an avid reader with most of the books being nonfiction works. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a wonderful view of the illogical nature of class warfare between young adults. Perceptions reenforce actions and expectations in the different groups. The characters seem very authentic and, despite it being published in 1967, extremely relevant to kid culture even in present day. Ms. Hinton's book may be about almost exclusively male characters, but she certainly knew her subject matter. A great, touching, exciting, insightful story that not only young adults should read but there are plenty of American adults that should crack open this baby and learn something.

When I first read it I liked it so much that i read it every day. I even took it to school to read in my reading period. I liked this book because to me it was very touching. The thing I liked about it was when Ponyboy was at the hospital and his brothers came to visit him. He thought that Darry really didn't care but he saw him sort of crying and they gave each other hugs. That was sweet. I also like it because there was some action and hattred that made me read more. Like when they were having a rumble.Another thing that made me like this book was the fact that there was real close friendships and caring going around. Everyone cared about Jonny and always respected him. The sadest part in this book was when Jonny was dead. I thought that was sad because to me he was like an innocent. He had no brothers or sisters, and had parents that didnt care about him. The only people that cared about him was the gang. Also when Dally kills himself because Jonny was dead. That was sad because Dally lost the only person he really cared about. I liked this book because there was courage, for ex. when they ran in the burning church, there was friendship like gang had for Jonny and many more. I really liked this book because it has inspired me to read more exciting books like this one. S.E.

It was very accurate on portraing what happens in the streets on a city. Another good thing about this book is that you can relate to atleast one of the characters because there are so many of them and they are all different in many ways. I think think that sometimes we all think about what we would do if we saw are friend being beaten up and a lot of us would do the same to save his life.I recamend this book mainly for younger poeple because it deals with a lot of situations that could or may have already came along. I think that YOU should read this book"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"While reading the reveiws I saw many people that loved the book but some that hated it. It showed me that many people have it better than they think. Like me, a middle class teen that read this book in the 6th grade and since read it atleast 20 more times. When I think I have a rough life this book always helps me to see how lucky I'm to have parents and to live in a nice house and neighborhood. I mean, that, even if I don't have a perfect life and all, I still am pretty good off. This book is very emotional and brings me to tears at the end. It is wonderfully written by s.e. hilton and should stay on everyones summer reading list. For those who hate the book, I can't say how much that surpises me. I've recommend this book to all my friends that didn't read it over the summer. Like I siad this book helps you see from three points of view, you, greasers and socs. The differences between them are't much but ho important are differences when its the people that causes the problems and/or having to see them. To find out if what I say is true, READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I found this book too old to connect to real life these days. It may give a look into what your parents had done in the past, but for a modern day teenager, leather jackets and tons of grease are no more than a mere figment of their imaginations to see in real life.Quite similar to the themes in Go Ask Alice, where drugs and friends make all the difference in the world. Not an especially thourough deep look into each character's well being and thoughts, but emotions are well played out. This is more of a TEEN classic, not a classic that will last for centuries to come."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was a great book for me to read. I like the way it was written in first person, also becuase Ponyboy was a good narrator. It was a very desciptive, juicy, well written story that drew you in from the beginning. Usually a book soesn't start off, \\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.\\" That, to me gets everyone's attention and makes them want to read more until tis gone. Kind of like a glass of your favorite beverage, if you like the first taste, you drink it until it's all gone.The best part of the book was the ending when the teacher gave Ponyboy the theme assignment and he started it the same as the first sentence in the novel. So it was interesting to see that we were reading what he wrote. Instead of really writing a theme he wrote a novel. There wasn't really a bad part, everything was picture making. S.E. Hinton wrote with such grace the words all came together to create a visual.S.E. Hinton was a great writer all around throughout this whole book. I was especially fond of how she went through and explained each individual greaser, named them and what they looked like. It was great to be able to create your own picture but yet also have a common base for their features. Mrs. Hinton also did a wonderful job describing the setting in full fledged detail. The chapter when Bob was stabbed in the park, the first page had all the details about how it looked. She stated that the pool was empty but the fountain was running, the tall elm trees and how they shadowed the park. S.E. Hinton did a great job and I can definately say \\"The Outsiders\\" was a great book for me to read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I really liked the outsiders book for various reasons. One reasonis because when Iread the outsiders I was imagining every single thing that happened and it made me winder what it would be like if stuff like that was still goin on in modern days. The book also made me wonderwhat al the characters thought about being in a social group and if they all wanted to be friends.I think the best part of the bok was the rumble between the socs and the greasers. The rumble was the only thing that seperated the greasers from the socs because if the greasers won the socs would probaly leave the greasersalone for awhile. The worst part of the book ,in my opinion,was when johnny died. But when he was saving those kids at the church from the fire, he was smiling because he was doing something that would make him proud of himself. I thought that was pretty cool even though he died.The most vivid story elements I thought were when S.E. Hinton was describing how all the characters looked because it made me imagine how they relly looked. Ireally liked the detail she used when she was describing them like when she was describing the socs with their mustangs and madras shirts and how they were rich westside kids. Overall I think it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is a book that can relate to anyone.

Hinton because I have heard a lot of good things about it and the storyline was appealing to me. It is about the rival of two gangs through the eyes of a young teenager named Ponyboy. He has two brothers, Darry, who is always working and is always serious, and Sodapop, the ever-loved handsome brother who works at a gas station. Soda is a fun-going, loving brother who wouldn't ever do anything to hurt Ponyboy. While Darry is always yelling at Ponyboy and once he even hit him. He does not have any parents because they died so it is just Ponyboy and his brothers. He lives in a hard knock town with two rivalry gangs, the Greasers and the Socialists, or Socs. The Greasers and the poor, raggedy-looking gang. Ponyboy is in the Greasers. The Socs are just the opposite. They are rich and high class and they drive Mustangs and Corvairs while most of the greasers don't even own a car.Many things happen to Ponyboy throughout the book. His best friend in the gang is Johnny. They have known each other for a long time and in the book they go through a very big event. I will not tell you what but they are a run for their lives and only Dally, the rugged hardcore gang member who always got into trouble, was there to help them. Dally was the one who told them to run and he was the only one who know where they were. If I was on the run for my life I would cry every time I thought about what I had done and not being able to tell my brothers would eat me up inside.There are many other events and details that occur during this book. I thought it was very good and I am looking forward to reading the sequel, That was Then, This is Now. I have always liked plots with action and suspense and the part with the gangs was great too. I am waiting for more books like this one to come in my path so I won't stop reading.I am really thirteen but this was the only way it worked."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The minute you gaze into the eyes of the guys on the cover of The Outsiders, you know you're going to love this book. S.E. Hinton may have been only 16 when she wrote this, but she knew how to write and that's all that matters. Her use of slang in both dialog and in the way Ponyboy tells the story, pull you into it and make you feel like a greaser (a member of a gang of poor teens) yourself. Her book is full of suspense and drama, and each chapter leaves you hanging and makes you want to keep on reading nonstop. I was really sad when the book ended.The Outsiders is about Ponyboy, 14 years old, whose parents died and lives with his two brothers Darry and Sodapop. He lives in a poor neighborhood and he and his brothers are part of a gang called the greasers. The book centers around the rivalry between the greasers and a gang of rich kids from the other side of town who are called the Socs. Hinton gives every character their own special personality, and she makes you feel like you are there in the book.There isn't any word that can describe just how good this book is, and I recommend this book of \\"friendship and belonging\\" to everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S.E.

Ponyboy is a greaser who lives with his two older brothers Darry who is 20, and Soda Pop who is 17.The Outsiders follows Ponyboy and his neighborhood gang with an array of colorful characters. The Socs and the Greasers get into rumbles with eachother. Many times a group of Socs will jump a lone greaser for fun until one Soc pays for it and the two groups really go at it.This book is a great read. There are lessons to be learned in the end as Ponyboy learns that people can not be classified into groups. He has to look at things for the other person's point of view, lessons that more people today should know."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is the BEST! I've never read a book that I've wanted to read again and again except this one. It is amazing. S. E> Hinton really knew what she was doing. This book has some humor, drama, romance(very, very, very little), and some nice family traits. It really helps you see how real people are. The boys in this book all act tough but almost all of them cry at some point in time in the book. It helps you see that you don't have to be tough all the time. It was extremely well written. I've never read a book that is even half as good as this one. It is so great. S. E. Hinton is the greatest author. Plus, if you're not into books, they have a movie, too. I suggest you read this book, though. They leave some things out that you might be disappointed with but if you just see the movie, you need to read the book for those parts they leave out.

This book never let me put it down and the funny part is I started reading it one day because our teacher made us read for a half hour. I didn't expect to be sucked in and end up reading the whole thing but that's what happened.

Hinton."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersBy: Hinton, S. E.Reviewed By: S. ChangPeriod: 5This book is about the lives of gangs and the change in many peoples lives after a murder. Ponyboy is a greaser, a gang member. His parents died so he lives with his bothers, Soda, a drop-out, and Darry, who grew up too fast to take care of the family. The greasers are enemies with the Socs, another gang made up with rich kids. Ponyboy and Johnny, a buddy of Ponyboy, run into some Socs and get in a fight. They nearly get killed by the Socs. In self-defense, Johnny kills a Soc, Bob. Ponyboy and Johnny run away from the police to a church. There, they save some lives and lose some.I like this book because it let me see things in 2 point-of-views and it helped me realize a life is very, very valuable and can change many people&iexcl;s lives forever. I also learned that losing one life can lead to many more losses. When I was half way through reading this book, I thought all Socs as &iexcl;bad&iexcl;. But I relize that that isn&iexcl;t true. If another book was based on the same story, but it was a Soc&iexcl;s point of view, I would have thought of all greasers as &iexcl;bad&iexcl;. But when I got to a certain point of the book, there was a part when Bob&iexcl;s friend, Randy was telling Ponyboy his feelings, I really felt sorry for him and changed my opinion on the Socs. Especially when the book tells me randy&iexcl;s expression by saying, &iexcl;Randy tried to grin, but I could tell he was close to tears.&iexcl;When Johnny and Ponyboy is at the church hiding, they save some lives. To save lives, they get injured and it leads to a person&iexcl;s death. Because a person died, Dally gets so sad he wants to suicide and he purposely threathen the police and got shot by the police. This was weird thing to happen because Dally was a very cold, tough, manly, and &iexcl;bad&iexcl;. I guess that&iexcl;s why it touched me more when Ponyboy said, &iexcl;he ran out like the devil was after him. He&iexcl;s gonna blow up. He couldn&iexcl;t take it.&iexcl;My favorite part of the book is when Jjohnny, Ponyboy, and Dally saved the little kids from the church. It would&iexcl;ve taken a lot of courage to do that because they could die saving those kids, and most of all, they didn&iexcl;t even know they kids and they risked their lives for them. I thought that all gang members were bad, but I guess there&iexcl;s a goodness in everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book was amazing!

It is all about my favorite stuff as a teenager: fights, alcohol street gangs, friendship and love. The story is about the group of teenagers living on the street. They are Ponyboy, Sodapops, Darry, Dally, Two bits and Johnny. They are \\"Greasers\\", which is the name of the group's gang. The reason they call themselves greasers is because of their greasy long hair. They are always together like family because they have to have friends to back each other up when they get into fights with the Socs, who are their greatest enemy. One night when Ponyboy gets into a fight with his brother, he leaves the house and decides to spend a night on the street with Johnny, his best friend. Unfortunately, they meet five drunken Socs and get into a fight with them. The fight ends when Johnny stabs one of the Socs who is about to kill Ponyboy. They are afraid of the murder rap and going to jail, even though they are juveniles, so they run away from the city and with Dally's help hide in a church. But one night, there is a fire at the church...This novel is mainly about the friendship, and teamwork between Ponyboy, Sodapopls, Darry, Dally and Johnny for being in one crew. I really admire these characters because I think their lives are extremely tough as they have no parents and have to fend for themselves. I also like the ending of the book because of how the poem \\"Stay Gold\\" kind of sums up what's important in life. Johnny wants Ponyboy to \\"Stay Gold\\" which means to stay young inside, and not to get old and bitter in life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book 2 years ago when I was in the 8th grade.

He lives with his brothers, one older Darry (who is raising Ponyboy)who works hard to keep the family together and SodaPop, who wants to hang out on the streets all day long. He talks about the many adventures that both he and his family go through. You also meet two of my favorite characters, Johnny and Dallas ( a true street kid). I'm telling you!!! Once you read this book you won't put it down because you want to find out what is going to happen next. There are some memorable parts such as the big street fight between the greasers and the socs and the \\"act of heroism\\" that Ponyboy and Johnny do.I will say that this book does not have a \\"happy\\" ending but you learn from the book is that friendships are forever no matter if you are a \\"greaser\\" or a \\"soc\\" and that you can make a difference in anybody's life."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Well, i did not read the book because i would have like to read it in english... cos i'm French ;)But i saw the movie.

But one of her books stands out to me out of the rest, by far best book ever The Outsider. It could also easily be the Realistic Fiction book written. It's funny because it was the first she had ever written at the age of sixteen. I think that is purely amazing, the fact that she was only 16 when she wrote it. Probably because she might have been going through a similar situation.This book is mainly about a boy named Ponyboy that is in a gang with his brothers and a few other kids called the \\"Greasers.\\" There is this other gang full of rich people that are like jocks; they're called the \\"Socs.\\" The Greasers and Socs have constantly been fighting with each other but usually the Socs picked the fight. One night the socs took it too far and Johnny, a greaser, killed Bob, a Soc, and the sotyr goes on from there.But basically this is a great book, it keeps you in suspense, and there are surprises here and there that spice up the story. So if you like Realistic Fiction or even if you hate books you should try this one. You won't be sorry, believe me. It's not like a novel, it's actually quite short fewer than 200 pages, so it should go quick and it's a great book.[...]"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Wayne Barnes-Bak Middle School of the ArtsThis excellent book gives you a sense of war in a way.

Hinton, is a book about a boy growing up without his parents, having to depend on his brothers and his gang to get him through life's many obstacles. Ponyboy is the main character and the narrator of the story. He lives with his two brothers Darry and Sodapop on the east side. Darry is Ponyboy's oldest brother. He didn't finish college. After their parents died in a car accident, Darry had to get a full time job to support Sodapop and Ponyboy so that the three of them could remain together. Sodapop was the second oldest. He dropped out of high school but he was still Ponyboy's favorite brother. Then there was the gang, the greasers. Steve was Sodapop's best friend. Ponyboy didn't like Steve very much but he respected him because Sodapop would have wanted him to. Two-Bit was the oldest of the gang. He kept everyone smiling because he was always cracking jokes. Dallas was meaner then the rest of the gang. He spent a few years on the streets of New York. That's how he became so tough. Johnny was the second youngest. He was the gang's pet. Everyone considered Johnny to be their younger brother and everyone was always looking out for him. Johnny is the main reason that the Greasers hated the Socs. The Socs are a gang from the West Side. They are richer then the greasers. They drive nicer cars and wear nicer cloths. When Johnny got badly beaten by the Socs, The gang became was more protective of Johnny and the Greasers always held that grudge on the Socs. The Greasers ran into problems with the Socs throughout the entire book.My favorite character in the book is Johnny. He was forced to grow up faster then he should have. His mother didn't care about him and his father beat him, but he was still a good person and a dedicated friend to the gang. He seemed to have everything all together. It was almost like he'd seen it all and was a walking testimony to everyone else. Towards the end of the book Johnny was more open then he had ever been, and I got a chance to see the real Johnny.I mostly related to Darry in this book. He was a hard worker and he was very responsible. He cared a lot about his siblings, and he held things together. I care a lot about my sisters and I would help them out if they were ever in a sticky situation. I am a responsible person and I could hold a job to support my family if they needed me to. Darry was very worried about Ponyboy when Ponyboy ran away. He was scared to death that Ponyboy would be hurt or get into trouble. He didn't sleep well while Ponyboy was gone. I was really worried about my sister when she went into labor and was rushed into the hospital. I always heard about women who had trouble with their pregnancies and I couldn't sleep the entire night that she was gone. I worried that my nephew wouldn't be healthy and that my sister wouldn't get through it okay.I really enjoyed this book. It is my favorite book and I am currently reading it again. My favorite part of this book was when Ponyboy hugged Darry. It was my favorite part because in the beginning of the book, Ponyboy doesn't think that Darry cares about him. They were almost always fighting and Ponyboy never felt close to Darry like he did to Sodapop. Ponyboy finally understood that Darry loved him. He finally realized that Darry cared about him and that he worried about him all the time. When Ponyboy and Darry hugged, it was the first time that they ever showed affection towards each other.I have never read a book as fast as I read this one. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I couldn't get enough of it. The way the book was written and my imagination helped me to actually live on the East Side and I was able to get into the book after only a couple pages of reading it. The book was fantastic and I wouldn't have changed a thing.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventures. The Outsiders would be perfect for anyone that is growing up or has grown up around gangs. This book is filled with nowadays situations and confrontations. Gangs fought over the same things then that gangs fight about now. This book was exciting and suspenseful. It kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading it. I recommend this book to everyone that can read. This book was easy to follow, and I guarantee that when you finish it, it will be one of your favorites."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"David...The Outsiders by S.E.

Ponyboy and his two brothers, Darry and Soda, are greasers. A greaser is a slang term for a poor person who lives on the east side of town. Ponyboy and his brothers are part of a gang. Everyone in the gang are almost like brothers, because most of the members don't have a real family. The rich kids, known as the Socs, also have a gang. The greasers and Socs are enemies. One night, when Ponyboy is talking to Johnny, a member of the greaser gang, the drunken Socs try to kill Ponyboy. In his defense, Johnny kills one of the Socs. Like fugitives, the two run away from home.I could relate to some of the characters in this book. Like Ponyboy, sometimes I feel like a tag-along too. I have also felt some of the things that the characters had felt before. When a good friend or family member was ill, I would be unhappy. Just like Darry and Soda. When I would be in a bad situation, I would try to avoid it. Like Johnny and Ponyboy.I thought that this book was fantastic. The way the author described every thing was incredible.

I could not relate to them in any other way because they were \\"greasers\\" and I cannot compare myself to someone similar to a hood.In my opinion, the book was and excellent book. The author, S.E.

But, he knows what to expect, until the night his best friend Johnny is forced to kill a Soc who attacks them, so they decide to run away to the country.Unfortunately, I cannot relate to any of the characters in The Outsiders.

However, when I went on a vacation to Alaska, I shared the same feeling of amazement as Ponyboy when he arrived in the country.

Greasers do illegal things, such as robbing stores, and some of them have police records miles long. All Greasers are poor, and are constantly getting physically harassed by Socs, the richwho live on the other side of town. Members of the Greasers are Sodapop and Darryl Curtis, Ponyboy's brothers, Two-Bit Matthews, who is constantly getting drunk and has a reputation for a tough switchknife, Johnny Cade, the groups pet, Dallas Winston the tough guy who is constantly getting put into jail and getting into serious trouble, and Steve Randle, Sodapop's best friend.In this book, Ponyboy and Johnny are attacked by Socs, and Ponyboy is nearly drowned to death. Ponyboy and Johnny end up running into the country, where excitement quickly brews in ways you wouldn't expect.Although I can't relate to any of the characters who carry switch knives, smoke, and bust the ends of bottles, I feel as if I have a relationship with each of the Greasers. I feel as if I know them like a person knows him or herself. Sometimes, I feel the way Ponyboy feels about him and Darry in the beginning, like he would never understand him. However, in my case, it's usually concerning more than one person. I really enjoyed this book, and would highly recommend it for anyone who is not squeamish, and loves adventure, but is over the age of eleven. My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy was at the movies with Johnny, andhe meets Cherry Valance. I disliked the ending, and think that if any part of the book should be changed, that is it. I didn't like the fact that the author stressed the fact that Ponyboy's entire life was changed by his experience.

Hinton's \\"can't we all just get along\\" youth-targeted novel can certainly come across as a bit dated, especially in the wake of events like Columbine. However, one has to bear in mind that she (yes, it was written by a woman) was 16 when she wrote it, and its message is a timeless one, regardless of how cynical and knowing we have all become. The story is fairly straightforward, in a small town in Ohio, there are the \\"greasers\\" (lower-class teenagers from broken up households who are a step below being \\"hoods,\\" that is to say, actual criminals) and the \\"socs\\" (middle-class teenagers with nice clothes and cars who are headed for college). The two literally live on different sides of the tracks and are locked in a long-standing running battle against each other. Their background and the story of what happens when a greaser kills a soc in self-defense is narrated by Ponyboy, a bookwormy, head in the clouds greaser who slowly comes to realize that while there are bad elements on both sides, greasers and socs are more alike than they both think. There's a dishy and awfully wise cheerleader girl thrown in the mix, and you can see the Romeo & Juliet and West Side Story influences shining through at times. And while it's a plea for peace and \\"we are the world\\" type of message, it's still a valid one, and one worth trying to expose kids to. Some have disparaged the book for portraying youth violence and drug use, which is kind of ridiculous because while the levels of violence and drugs (drinking and smoking) might have been shocking (although probably not) in 1967, they are fairly tame by today's real life standards. Others criticize the book for glorifying or excusing criminal behavior and violence, which seems to be missing the main point of the book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I am 15 years old.

Unlike the typical fun loving 14-year-old babysitter, the main character is a complex and fragile being, while being likeable and tough. The story is told from his point of view, and in a world where everyone is divided into two clashing social groups: The lower-class, hair-slicking greasers and the upper-class socs, donning madras shirts and expensive cars. Ponyboy regards the constant spars between the two as normal teenage life, until one day his friend Johnny does something terrible.The book itself is well written, with a healthy balance of poetic adjectives and easy to read content, and the author does an excellent job of portraying the various characters through words. The story itself tends to have grim undertones without being too dismal, and keeps the plot fresh and exciting. I read the book in about a week, both the facts that it is a page-turner from the beginning and the relatively small length of the book both contributing to my brief yet satisfying trip to the end. The finale is very peaceful, and the whole book is written from what seems to be much experience.The only negative feedback I could possibly draw from this book is that the main characters might possibly be a bad influence on small children, as they smoke, drink, curse and fight regularly.I definitely would recommend this book to those who enjoy Lois Lowry's The Giver or are interested in reading on previous pop culture in general, as both The Giver and The Outsiders focus on characters raised in harsh environments, then grow up to realize their own perspectives on the land. Action-filled and ripe with emotion, The Outsiders is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton was written in the 1960's. I enjoyed reading this book because I can relate to the characters in the story. It is about a 14 year-old boy named Ponyboy Curtis who grows-up in a poor, Texas neighborhood. His parents died in a car accident, this left him and his two brothers, Soda-Pop and Darry orphaned. His brothers and his friends, \\"the Greasers\\" where now his only family, they were a gang. This gang was made-up of Ponyboy and his brothers and these other characters; Dally, Steve, Two-Bit and Ponyboy's best friend, Johnny. These kids were always together and took care of each other as a family would..With gangs, there were always rivalries between groups. The \\"Socs\\" or socials were rich and didn't like Greasers because they were poor. The Socs were terrible. They drank and smoked too much and when they were drunk they took it out on innocent people. The Greasers could never go out alone because they could get jumped by the Socs. One of the big events in this book is when Johnny, one of the younger Greasers, got jumped and almost killed by nasty group of Socs. Johnny was Ponyboy's best friend and he was almost killed by Bob, the leader of the Socs.Johnny is one of the most important characters in this book. Johnny's parents were not the greatest. They didn't like him at all. He usually needs to leave his house at night and sleep in a vacant lot. Johnny never leaves his house without a switch-blade because of his run-in with the Socs. One night, Ponyboy and Johnny doze-off in the parking lot of the movie theater. They were supposed to be home by 12:00. Pony knew he would be in trouble with his older brother, Darry for being out too late so, he went home. Ponyboy was now in serious trouble with Darry. Ponyboy and Johnny decided to run away from home. The two boys met up in the park. What they didn't know was that night things were going to change drastically for the two boys.I recommend this book to every reader that likes a good story. It is a classic book. It was written in the 1960's and still ties in with real life today after all the years, troubled teenagers forming groups and picking fights. When I read it I was amazed by how much this group of friends can do together. Nothing got in their way. Even though there are some sad parts in the story, it just made it more addicting to read.

He is smart and was the only member that went to school out of his gang and brothers. He is Johnny's best friend and he has two brothers who are Darry and Soda and are in the gang. Darry is 20. He works at construction to take care of his brothers. Soda is 16. . He works at a gas station. These two gangs hate each other and are always fighting. It all starts when a greaser comes out of the movies and the socs get him and start to beat him up.S.E Hinton was only 15 when she started writing The Outsiders. She was inspired to write The Outsiders because one of her friends got jumped by a group of \\"nice\\" kids. She said that a lot of Ponyboy's thoughts were her thoughts. S.E Hinton was a tomboy. She played football and her closer friends were guys. She had friends from both sides. She didn't know that the guys she hung out with were greasers until one day they were walking down the street and the socs screamed at them, \\"Greasers.\\"The Outsiders is a great book. It explains the lives that the teenagers had and the two different gangs that don't get along with each other. It is also a great book because the teenagers that would read this book they would know how life was and would know how life is now and the gangs that they are on. I think that they would learn a lot of good things if they read this book. Even though this book is old you would be able to relate the teenagers with the gangs. After reading The Outsiders, I felt sad because is a life cycle that teenagers pass through and suffer just for being in a gang. It also touched my heart because three brothers fight against life to be together. I started with the poem because it says it all. The thing that the poem is trying to say is that at first life is great and it holds everything. Everything is a new but it only can last for an hour. Then everything goes away and nothing could stay forever."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Have you ever read a book that was so good you could not put it down? A book where you could relate to some of the characters and the problems they had? Have you ever thought that your brothers/sisters don't understand anything that you are going through in life and you just want them to get out of your business? Well that has happened to me and it happens in this book, The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. It is a great book that all teenagers can relate to and understand very well.The story takes place in Oklahoma in the 1950's. It is about a group of poor friends that are in a gang called the \\"greasers.\\" They face a lot of problems with the rich kid's called \\"socs.\\" But throughout the story Ponyboy, the youngest from the gang, finds out that even the socs have their own share of problems.Ponyboy Curtis is the smartest and the youngest of the gang. He has two brothers. One is named Sodapop and he is 16 years old and another one is named Darry and he is 20 years old. Their parents died a couple years before in a car accident. So Darry, the oldest, takes care of Ponyboy and Sodapop. Darry is considered their guardian but if they get in trouble with the police they could be sent to a boy's home. Darry and Sodapop are also greasers. The greasers' lives are going great until someone takes things too far and changes their lives forever.I think that this is a very good book. While I was reading a summary of the book I saw a quote that immediately told me it was a drama and maybe a gang relative book. It was, \\"Nobody in this neighborhood's going to call the fuzz.\\" I think people who like teen drama would love this book. When I started reading this book I could not put it down. It got my attention so much. I could really relate to it because almost all the situations in the book are true ones that some teenagers go through. It talks about issues like the \\"in group,\\" the \\"out group,\\" gangs, and friends.The one thing that really got my attention in this book was that the author S.E. Hinton she wrote this book when she was fifteen. Then it got published when she was sixteen. She was a tomboy and she had friends that were greasers and socs. She found out that socs had their own share of problems too. She said that all of Ponyboy's thoughts were her thoughts too. Her inspiration to write this book was when one of her friends got jumped by these \\"nice kids\\" because they didn't like his being a greaser. She was very mad so she started pounding out a story of a boy who was beaten up while he was walking home from the movies. That was the beginning of The Outsiders. She also wrote other books like That was Then This is Now, Rumble Fish, and Tex. These books all have one thing in common, and that is that they all are teen related books that teenagers can understand. And even if the book was written a long time ago, teenagers today can still relate to it very well. I truly recommend this book to you and you will see that this book is filled with drama and action. Once you start reading this book, you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"many people think this book is bad because it talks about gangs, smoking, ect. and many children read it. 1st of all THERE IS VIOLENCE IN THE WORLD. im not saying i like it, im just saying it is reality. 2nd, the meaning of the book isnt to hurt childrens minds, it is to teach kids not to judge people because pony and johnny and the rest were good kids, they just lived harsh lives. privaleged people shouldnt insult the way the characters live because many people live like this and they are still GOOD KIDS"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I recently finished reading the outsiders by S.E. Hinton. It was a short, but sometimes less is more. The book, although set in the '60s, contains timeless themes such as brotherly love, violence, and rivalry that are still very much relevant today. The book was very entertaining to read and it was hard to put it down."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy is a gresser and all he wants is for and socks and greassers to get along. but when Johnny (his best friend) kills a sock they have to flee town. this Novel is so beautifully written. i love this book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, takes place in Middle America in the 1960's, and discusses an on going struggle between two gangs, The Socs and The Greasers. The Socs live in the nicer part of town and think they are better than everybody else because they have many materialistic items. The Greasers on the other hand live in the poorer part of town, and seem to always have trouble with the Socs. The main character and narrator, Ponyboy Curtis, was walking home alone one night from the movies and is attacked by the Socs. Darry, who is the oldest brother, comes to his aid because the responsibility he has of raising Ponyboy since their mother and father were killed in a car accident a few years before. Darry is very tough on Ponyboy because he does not want him to be a Greaser all his life, so he is constantly making sure he is doing well in school. After many more conflicts between the Greasers and Socs, a big brawl is created. The suspense that S.E. Hinton uses in this novel adds to the book because while reading you can tell there is a fight about to occur, but the reader is not sure what is exactly going to happen.S.E. Hinton does a great job with this novel because the mixture of action and suspense. She also throws a little love in the book which I think relates to any women reading the book. I could really relate to this novel because of both the way the gangs have to protect each other, and the closeness that the Curtis brother's share. S.E. Hinton really lets the reader into what exactly Ponyboy Curtis is thinking. She allows the readers mind to wonder because the reader can never really know what is next while at the same time captivating the reader. The dialect S.E. Hinton chose to use when the brothers were talking to one another was also great. She uses Darry as a parental figure being the one who punishes and also the one who makes sure Ponybody stays on the straight and narrow. Also, the wording she uses is great because the reader can tell which gang is talking because the proper words that the Soc's use or the improper words the Greaser's. Also, the Soc's use more vulgar language, and in general are more cocky. The book overall was an easy read because the events were easy to comprehend as well as easy to connect to. She really molds this book into a great novel because it felt like the reader was actually in one of the gang members shoes. As the Greaser's struggle to survive, and as the book carries out, you can see the brother-like relationships carry them through the situations. With all the action S.E. Hinton includes, she also includes comedy, which is a great change. The comedy is not real obvious, although when the reader thinks about the events, the \\"smack talking\\" the gangs do to one another is comical. The friendship the Greaser's develop, and the overall way they learn to depend on one another can connect some readers with real life events. Though some of the fights, some readers may wonder if the two gangs really should be fighting or should they quit acting immature. I think this is a great point that S.E. Hinton makes because young gang members do not necessarily fight over mature things, they fight to prove who has the alpha male status. If you like fighting in a real life situation format, I highly advise you to read this book, although, if you do not like fighting and violence, this book may not be for you."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book I am reviewing is written by S.E. Hinton. The book's name is The Outsiders. I think this book deserves five stars because it's a mystery and it had a lot of gang fights which I liked. This book is realistic fiction. This book is about gangs called the Socs and the Greasers. They beat up on each other for fun. A problem that occurs in this story is that the Socs beat up Pony boy, the main character. Then Ponyboy and Johnny, his best friend, run away because Ponyboy gets mad at his brothers. Then Johnny murders someone to protect Ponyboy. So they are on the run with a murder on the case.

Pony lives with his brothers because his parents died, and Jonny lives with his parents, but they could care less weather he was dead or not. They go through many adventures with eachother, beating up the \\"Socs,\\" and getting beaten up, until someone crosses the line.My favorithe part of this story is the brawl. They describe it in such a way that you could picture it in your mind. Another part i liked about the book was when Dally got blown away by the cops.I have read many books in the past and i would have to say, this is one of my favorites. It makes me think that just because you hear that someone is doing somethin bad, doesnt mean they are a bad person. This book also helps me look at people in a different way. These kids get into trouble, but they are not bad kids. There are deaths in this book, but they have to pull together and go on with their lives."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I bought this book for my son - it is about peer pressure. Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The OutsidersMy son had to read this book for summer reading before entering 7th grade. I read it out of curiousity and enjoyed it. With my son just entering manhood it seems timely to read such a novel. The story teaches young people what happens when you make bad choices and that sometimes unfortunately the consequences of some poor choices last a lifetime. This type of message is so necessary in our culture today. I especially appreciated the fact that no one excused them because they were teen-agers. Too many guilt-ridden parents today excuse too much unacceptable and inappropriate behavior because their kids are teen-agers. They are young men and women. If they are excused now when does it end?"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When I read this book in High School it was still new.

It doesn't show the 50's maltshop culture where everyone was polite and should be placed in the 'Andy Griffith' show. It shows the real fifties the ones my dad grew up in with gangs and fights. The ones he tells about how notorius he was for the 'tuff kid' because he could take down 3 boys at a time. Personally, I think it sheds a light for America ~it shows even in our glory days, we had problems, and we always will. Yes, I wouldn't let a kid prone to having tantrums and fits read this book because the characters arn't GREAT romodles, but they do learn, and they do show mistakes like the average person~ a step up from 'Nancy Drew' and those 'Fun with Dick and Jane' books."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders by S.E.

During the time they ran away from the situation, they stay at an abandoned church and form that bond, that friendship, and unity.

I gave it 4 stars, but not 5 because it doesn't quite reach that bar to be a 5 star book-but it still is very good. I'm an avid reader, and of all of the books we were requiered to read back in Middle School; the Outsiders was my favorite. I know I'm probably in the minority, but I would personally like to see more scenes of the Curtis brothers interacting. I'm pretty sure that SE Hinton has no desire to write a sequel, but I personally wished she would. I also wish we got to learn a little more about Sandy(Soda's girlfriend who gets pregnant, but the kid isn't his) The lessons learned in THe Outsiders can be related to real life. There are still strugles between different groups, there is still a social pecking order. You can look at the Outsiders as story, or look at it from a deeper contex. In the 60s, when this book was first published violence seemed limited to the inner city. Many midddle class kids probably couldn't relate to the gangs. But now in the 90s with all of the shootings, and deaths this book has even more meaning."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"at first, when my english teacher assigned this book for us to read i thought it was going to be boring. woah! was i wrong! i totally love to read books, and of all the ones i have read this one by far is one of the best! it was just interesting, and i really could relate to it. and i must admit that johnny was by far my favorite character. maybe this was because i could just picture him so well. but i almost cried myself when i finished it. im already starting to read it again, and i just finished it on the 19! i really recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"When a glance is given to the book The Outsiders, the cover might not catch the eye.

He's not the only one that has this problem though. His brothers Darry and Sodapop and his friends Steve, Two-Bit, Dally and Johnny deal with the same people over and over again. Living on the eastside of Oklahoma, these boys are considered greasers, J.D.'s and hoods.

I recommend it to ya'll because it deals with issues almost every teenager will face. It is by far the best fiction book for teenagers ever"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Reading a novel is one thing but listening whilst reading adds a new dimension to it. The Outsiders is written by an American author and it's set in the 1960s. I am Australian and the language in the novel is not. It makes sense to listen to a trained actor deliver the novel with the correct intonation, dramatic intensity and charaterisation that simply reading cannot provide. The themes in The Outsiders are relevant to today's teenagers who deal with peer pressure, dysfunctional families and the all too human need to belong somewhere....anywhere. Conflict is sustained throughout and there is the final resolution. This is good to play on a car trip to keep teenagers engaged instead of hearing \\"are we there yet?\\"or to improve reading skills by listening whilst reading. This is one way to help improve word recognition. Especially suitable for people with vision difficulties who may find it easier to listen to, rather than read a book. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read The Outsiders written by S.E. Hinton. I enjoyed this book a lot. This is my favorite book. I've read it 6 times and I still want to read it again and again and again because it has adventure and excitement, and you really learn to like the characters. It has so much anticipation. For instance, when Ponyboy is walking home from the movies, he notices a car following him. Socs get out of the car and jump Ponyboy.The Outsiders is about a boy named PonyBoy Curtis who grew up on the wrong side of town and is part of a gang, which one of the members is Johnny Cade, Ponyboy's best friend. One night, they were walking in the park around 2 in the morning and some \\"socs\\" try to jump them (socs is a short name for the socials) and try to drown Ponyboy. Johnny gets up and stabs one the socs, Bob, who dies. So they decide that they need a hide out so they hear about this place from Dallas Winston, another member of the gang. There's a hideout in a abandoned church where Ponyboy and Johnny end up hiding for 5 days. Dallas comes to visit and takes them to a place for some food. While they're eating, Johnny explains to Dallas that he wants to go back home and turn themselves in. On their way back, they realize that some kids were playing around in the church which is on fire. Ponyboy and Johnny run in to save the kids. When all the kids are out, they try to escape but when Ponyboy is out, Johnny trys to get out but the ceiling starts to collapse. It falls on Johnny. Will Johnny die? Will Ponyboy and Johnny get jailed for killing that soc? Read this book and you will soon find out.I would recommend this book to some one who likes adventure, tragedy and some one who likes to read about gangs and rumbles."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Even though S.E. Hinton's young adult novel, The Outsiders, was first published 35 years ago, it is timeless. Just like Romeo and Juliet, or West Side Story, it is a story of rivaling groups and the emotional and physical scars that the rivalry plays on the individuals of both sides. There is no love story, but the relationships among three recently orphaned brothers and their gang of greaser friends tells of deep attachments, love and hate.The story is told by fourteen year old Ponyboy who is the youngest of the Curtis boys. He reveals his opinions, insights and feelings towards the people and events going on around him. Throughout the story Ponyboy's sensitivity to the complexities of peoples thoughts, motivations, and actions, including his own, increases dramatically. As Ponyboy develops an understanding of his world, so does the reader develop an understanding of how a teenage mind works and grows.Hinton's greasers and socs (socialites) represent the cliques that forever seem to reign in middle and high schools. For this reason most readers will find it easy to relate to one or more of the characters. If the reader is an adult, like me, Ponyboy's revelations will shed some light on who some of those other kids in school were, and why they did what they did. For the teen reading the book for the first time,Ponyboy offers insights that might make the road they're travelling easier to understand now.If you have a teen in your home, don't show them the movie. Give them this book to read. They are sure to appreciate the gift."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book pretty much changed my life. It tells the story of a young boy, the brothers he loves, and the friends he hangs with who are almost like brothers, and all the adventures they get into. I don't know how many times I've read it - but it touched something inside of me so much, like S.E. Hinton knew what I was feeling as a teen. I wanted to be Ponyboy (a neat trick for a girl!), and eventually I was, at least for a while.If you're a teen who dreams of danger and adventures and friendships that you can count on no matter what, then I recommend this book to you! An absolute classic."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"\\"Help, help, help us please, someone!\\" The children cry as the hot, red burning flames tempt the children to scream as the flames lick ferociously at the frightened children's feet. Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dallas are just driving up as they see the old church (where Ponyboy and Johnny have been staying) burning. Ponyboy and Johnny run in because they can tell that there are children trapped in the burning church. The Outsiders is a book of courage and friendships and how friends stick by you when it matters the most.Just because people have more money or better, and more stylish clothes than someone else, doesn't mean that they should treat people any different or with less respect. You should try and make them feel better about themselves instead. The Socs looked down on the Greasers because the Socs are richer than them and the Greasers don't have the fancy cars or the Madras shirts like the Socs.I think that friends should stick together through good, bad, and sad times When Johnny killed a Soc, he did it out of friendship to Ponyboy. If it wasn't for him, Ponyboy would've drowned. When Ponyboy woke up and saw the Soc just lying there in a puddle of blood, he didn't try and run away from Johnny.Just because someone else does drugs or drinks and fights at a young age, doesn't mean that they are a bad person. Ponyboy and Johnny smoked, drank, and also fought, but they had to protect themselves from the Socs because they would go around town trying to find Greasers like Ponyboy and Johnny to jump (beat u.) They ran into the burning, old church when the school had taken the children on a field trip, the children had gone in there and gotten scared and trapped. They put their own lives in danger in order to save someone else. He and Ponyboy still managed to get all of the kids out of the old, burning, church.When two people are different, for example Greasers and Socs, that doesn't mean that you can't be that person's friend. Cherry Valance, a Soc, and Ponyboy, a Greaser, were friends and they could both talk to each other, and they understood one another about sunsets.In conclusion, The Outsiders was a very good book. It teaches you that just because people have more money or better clothes, doesn't mean that they should treat people any different; friends should stick together through good times and bad; just because someone does drugs or drinks and fights at a young age, doesn't mean that they are a bad person; and when two people are different that doesn't mean that you can't be friends with that person. Therefore, I believe that The Outsiders is a great book. I hope that in times of need my friends and family will be there for me and can give me the strength to carry on and be brave. I think that middle and high school students should read this book. You can hope to get out of the book lessons to use in life like not to smoke, drink, and do drugs; to have family and friends that care for you and will help you through anything."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is downright nasty and retarded.

He's in a gang called the Greasers. The Greasers enemies are the Socs. He's walking along and a gang of Socs surround him. They pin him down and threaten to beat him up. Ponyboy's friends run up and save him. In this book the Greasers have a lot of fights with the Socs. One night Ponyboy and Johnny were sitting watching the stars when some drunk Socs came up. They started drowning Ponyboy and Johnny got scared. He didn't want Ponyboy to die so he took out his six-inch switchblade and killed the Soc name Bob. There are little fights between the gangs throughout the book but there is one big one in particular. It's called the Rumble. Since the Socs are really mad a Greaser killed a good friend of theirs they want revenge. Bob knew a lot of people and he was a good guy. All the Socs and all the Greasers meet and have a big fight. They fight for awhile and the Greasers finally win. I think it's good that they win because the Socs have all the money, clothes, cars, and everything else better than the Greasers. Three people die in this book. Johnny dies from severe burns. Dally dies from being shot by the police. Dally is a Greaser too. This book is really good and I think anyone could read it. It pulls you in and you wonder what's going to happen next.

We had to answer these questions, which were like, \\"Are you surprised that a high schooler wrote this?\\" Well, NO! The writing is immature, an adult with higher education has far superior text. This book is pointless, stupid, and violent, and I see no benefit in reading it. Maybe they want us to not join a gang or you'll end up a smoking 14-year-old wanted for murder in the hospital. Or maybe it's just don't grease your hair. Honestly, who would write a book about greasers and rich kids? Not all kids then belonged to one of those groups! There is no plot.

The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts, namely the one where Dally &quot;kills himself&quot;. Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially. The characters also set horrible examples for today's youth with their inexcusable and absurd behavior.

He told me that yeah well now its cliche but back then it was new and on the edge.I thought of South America at that time, and of Marquiez.I though of Existensilism a few decades earlierI thought of Faulkner, Bellew, Ellison, and othersI even though of another book in which the narrator is writing down thier life story the Tin Drum by Gunther Grass.This is as best as I can sum it up.

At 14, he is already wise to the ways of the world. Pony knows the \\"Socs\\" - the town's upper crust - can get away with everything because of their money, while \\"Greasers\\" like himself will always be behind, no matter how smart or determined they are.Still - unlike his brothers and friends - Pony's got a softer side. He's an A student who enjoys reading poetry, and dreams of a better life. The smart-mouthed, gum-cracking girls the other Greasers date aren't for him, or the crappy dead-end jobs.Then one horrible night, Ponyboy's best friend Johnny kills a Soc to save Pony's life. Although it was self-defense, the two boys know too well how such a situation will end for them. They flee into the countryside, while the city erupts into full-out warfare over the crime.As if they hadn't been through enough, tragedy again strikes...this time nearly claiming Johnny's life.

This is one of those books that provides you with some new details, some nuance of story, that you didn't pick up the last time you read it.

It's not like a book that has action every 100 pages or action every page that you can't understand the character well. This book is about how there are two groups, the socs and greasers, who hate each other. Many big and fun things happen and you have got to read this!

It was, however, the last day where they show movies but everyone's too busy talking with friends, and loudly planning out there summer to even bother with paying attention. I didn't think much of it until a month ago when I was at my aunt's, and noticed a copy of it on her bookshelf. I asked to borrow the book, not thinking of anything but that it only that it would be some nice summer reading material.But, the moment I read the first page of that book, I couldn't put it down! I'll bet you that if my house had caught fire, I would have waited to the end of the chapter before I bothered to do anything about it. The Characters, setting, plot, and even the 60's lingo was compelling.I read that whole darn thing in one night and the moment I got to the end, I simply thought, \\"Well heck, might as well read it again\\". And so I read it again and again and again. By the end of the week I could tell you the entire story without evening cracking the book open. (I' must've read it 20 or 25 times!)The story tells of rough yet dreamy Ponyboy. He's surrounded by a world of the tough (or \\"T-U-F-F) boys from the east-side. The Greasers. While in a constant battle with the rich and preppy west-side Soc's (Short for Socials). With his parents gone, Ponyboy only has his two brothers Darry and Soda, and a couple of close friends, who together create a gang that's tighter than friendship but not related by blood.Ponyboy, Johnny, Dallas a.k.a Dally, Two-Bit (real name is Keith Matthews but nobody bothers to remember), Darrel a.k.a Darry, Sodapop, and Steve are inseparable. But on one dark night. Fast-occurring events throw Ponyboy and Johnny in a murder rap and hiding in a small-town church. They there until more occurring events (It'll ruin the surprise if I say more!! :D) bring them back home.After a victorious rumble, the night turns cold. At the end, Ponyboy turns what began as innocent English paper, into a work of art when he explains the week that took away the lives of some, who didn't make it to the end of the book. The Childhood, of those who immediately grew up. And the Life that the gang was so used to. There will still be soc's, and there will still be greasers, but there was definitely something that had changed.If you didn't love the book then you have no right to be near books at all. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a timeless classic written by a wonderful author who has inspired me to become a writer myself. Thank You Ms. Hinton, for this heart filled book, thank you Mr. Coppola for turning it into an awesome film. In the end, you've SO got to read this!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"THE OUTSIDERSMain CharactersPony Curtis - the narrator and protagonist of the story. His elder brother, Darry, brings him up after the death of his parents in a car accident. Though Pony resents him, he is also in awe of him. He also idolizes his middle brother, Soda. All three brothers belong to a gang of poor teenagers called the Greasers, named for their long, oily hair. Their bitter rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town. Pony is involved in the murder of a Soc named Bob. After the killing, he runs away with his friend Johnny to Windrixville. There they hide in an abandoned church. When the church catches on fire, they bravely rescue some children trapped in it. Johnny is badly injured and has to be hospitalized. When he dies, Pony is completely shattered. He cannot reconcile himself to his friend's death until he reads a letter Johnny has left for him telling him to 'stay gold' and to continue appreciating sunsets. He finally understands that with hard work he can overcome his circumstances and not remain an outsider all his life. Pony then adopts a mission for himself to tell the rest of the world about the odds that under-privileged children have to face. He also realizes and appreciates how much Darry loves and cares for him.Johnny Cade - a member of the Greasers whom the other gang members try to protect. His father constantly beats him up, and his mother either ignores his presence or screams at him. He becomes a nervous wreck after he is terribly beaten up by the Socs. He starts carrying a switchblade in his pocket; when he and Pony are attacked by the Socs, he uses the knife to kill Bob in self-defense. He hides with Pony in an abandoned church in Windrixville and heroically rescues children who are trapped in the church after it catches fire. During the rescue, a burning beam falls on his back, and he later dies in a hospital. Before dying, he tells Dally that 'fighting's no good' and asks Pony to 'stay gold.' Even after death, his spirit reaches out to Pony in the form of a letter which he leaves for him, exhorting him to remain pure and rise above being an outsider. The letter motivates Pony to tell the rest of the world that it is wrong to judge children by the amount of hair oil they wear.Dallas Winston (Dally) - the toughest, coldest, and meanest of the Greasers. He has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. He gives Pony and Johnny a gun and some money when they come to him after Bob's death. He also tells them where to hide. During the rescue, Dally plunges into the burning church to rescue Johnny, who is trapped under a beam. Upset by Johnny's death, he threatens the police with an unloaded gun after robbing a store. He dies without the world knowing about his qualities or the reasons for his delinquency.SETTINGThe Outsiders is set in a large, unnamed town in the United States. It is about a gang of teenage boys who are called the Greasers. They live on the east side of the town, also known as the wrong side of town; the eastside neighborhood is described in graphic detail. The story is set in the 1960's and relates the incidents that take place over a few days. After killing Bob, Pony and Johnny take shelter in an abandoned church in Windrixville. After it catches fire and burns down, they return to their hometown, where Johnny dies in a hospital.CONFLICTProtagonistPony Curtis is the teenage narrator and protagonist of the novel. When his parents were killed in a car accident, Darry, his twenty- year-old brother, began to provide for him. He resents Darry's bullying manner, not realizing that he does so because he loves him and wants him to make something of himself. Pony belongs to an eastside gang of poor teenagers, called the Greasers; their rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town.AntagonistPony's antagonist is his status in life. Poor and from the wrong side of town, he gets no breaks in life, even though he is a good student and studies hard. He joins the Greasers because it is the thing to do if you live on the east side of town. Their rivals are the Socs, a gang of rich, spoiled kids living on the west side of town. The Socs constantly pick fights with the Greasers, and Bob, one of the Socs, attacks Johnny and Pony because they have been friendly with Cherry. Johnny kills Bob in self-defense, and he and Pony go into hiding in a church in Windrixville. When the church catches on fire, Johnny and Pony try to save the children trapped inside. Johnny is serious injured during the rescue and dies a few days later in a hospital. Dally, who was Johnny's best friend, is completely shattered by his death. Crazy with grief, he robs a store and then threatens the police with an unloaded gun. As a result, he is killed. Now Pony has lost two friends. He falls sick, becomes delirious, tries to deny Johnny's death, and begins to fail in school.ClimaxThe climax occurs when Pony reads the letter that Johnny has written to him before his death. Johnny encourages his friend to \\"stay gold\\" - to look for the sunsets and good things in life. He tells Pony that if he tries, he will be able to make something worthwhile out of his life. Reading the letter is the turning point in Pony's life.OutcomeThe novel ends as a tragic comedy. Even though Bob, Johnny, and Dally have needlessly perished, Pony overcomes his problems, largely due to Johnny's letter of encouragement. He reconciles with Darry, finally understanding how much his older brother loves and cares for him. He also accepts that he does not have to be an outsider or a Greaser for the rest of his life. In order to seek help and understanding for underprivileged children like himself, Pony's mission becomes to tell others about the immense obstacles that stand in the way of success for teenagers from the wrong side of town. The novel, therefore, ends on a note of hope and optimism.PLOTPony Curtis is a member of the Greasers, a gang of poor teenagers with long, oily hair and from the wrong side of town. While returning home from the movies one night, Pony is attacked by the Socs, a gang of rich kids from the west side of town. Pony is afraid that they are going to kill him and starts shouting for help. His brothers (Darry and Soda), along with Steve Randle, Two Bit Matthews, Dally Winston, and Johnny Cade, rush to his rescue. After ascertaining that Pony is relatively unharmed, Darry shouts at him for walking alone and tells him that he should use a bit of common sense. Darry is Pony's oldest brother who has provided for him since his parents were killed in a car accident. Darry knows that Pony is smart and wants him to do well in life. As a result, he constantly nags Pony about doing well in school and making good grades. Pony resents his brother's intrusion in his life and his unemotional ways. In contrast, Pony adores Soda, his middle brother. He is a high school dropout, who works at a gas station with his best friend Steve Randal. Two-Bit Matthews is a member of the Greasers who always tries to have the last word on things. Johnny Cade is another gang member whom everyone tries to protect, because his father constantly tries to beat him up. The toughest character of the Greaser's gang is Dally, who has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. Pony, Johnny, and Dally decide to go to the drive-in the next evening. There they meet Cherry and Marcia, friends of the Socs. Dally is rude and obnoxious. When Cherry throws a coke in his face, he stalks off in anger. Pony and Johnny are left to watch the movie with the girls, but they are soon joined by Two Bits. After the movie they decide to walk to Two Bits' house to pick up his car in order to take the girls home. Along the way, Pony and Cherry find that they have a lot in common; they are both are idealistic dreamers, who love sunsets. Suddenly a blue Mustang pulls up near them. Two members of the Socs, Bob and Randy, emerge from the car to confront them. A fight almost takes place between the boys, but Cherry prevents it by getting into the Mustang.Two-Bit goes off to play snooker, and Pony and Johnny go to the vacant lot where they often hang out. At about two-thirty in the morning, Pony gets up with a start, for he has fallen asleep in the vacant lot. He rushes home to find Darry awake and frantic with worry. He shouts at Pony, which results in an argument. When Darry slaps his younger brother, Pony rushes out of the house and finds Johnny. As they walk in the park, Bob, Randy, and several other Socs attack them for being with their girls earlier. In the fight that follows, Johnny, in self-defense, kills Bob with his switchblade.In a panic, Johnny and Pony go to Dally for help. He gives them a loaded gun, money, and directions to reach an abandoned church in Windrixville, where they can hide out. They change their appearance by cutting off their long hair and pass the time by reading Gone with the Wind and discussing life. Once Pony recites one of Robert Frost's poems, \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\\" Johnny understands that \\"gold\\" in the poem stands for freshness, innocence, and purity.On the fifth day of their hiding, Dally comes to visit Pony and Johnny. He takes them out to eat and informs them that the tension between the Socs and the Greasers has increased. A rumble between the two gangs is supposedly to take place the following evening. Dally says that he has started carrying an unloaded gun to serve as a deterrent to any serious trouble. Johnny announces his decision to turn himself in to the police, for he does not want to be on the run for the rest of his life. He believes that he will get a light sentence since he has killed Bob in self-defense. Dally tries to dissuade him; he knows first-hand that any prison time is miserable.THEMESMajorThe major theme of the novel revolves around the purposelessness of any gang of teenagers. The book centers on the foolish gang rivalry existing between the Socs, the rich kids from the west side of town, and the Greasers, the poor kids from the east side.Pony, the protagonist of the story, is bitter about the fact that the wealthy Socs have nice cars, fancy clothes, and girlfriends; things are simply easier for them than for the Greasers. Because the Socs are convinced that they are better, they constantly pick on members of the Greasers, who fight back. During one squabble, Bob, one of the Socs, is murdered by Johnny in self-defense. Then Johnny, while hiding out in a church, is killed while trying to rescue children from the burning building. In reaction to Johnny's death, Dally, his best friend, goes on a rampage. He robs a store and points an unloaded gun at the police; as a result, he is shot and killed. Because of the needless gang fighting, three teenagers are killed in the novel, clearly pointing out the negative aspect of belonging to a gang. Hinton is obviously trying to warn the reader against participation in any gang.MinorRelated to the major theme of the book is the theme that a teenager can rise above his circumstances through hard work, patience, and determination. Pony is the proof of this theme. Even though he is born into poverty, loses his parents in a car accident at an early age, and participates in the Greasers, by the end of the book, he is determined to better his plight in life, largely due to the encouragement he receives from the deceased Johnny in a letter. At the close of the novel, Pony wants to tell the world that underprivileged children need to have some breaks in order to get ahead and need to be judged for who they are, not by how they look or how they dress. Hinton definitely convinces the reader that Pony, because of his intelligence and determination, will rise above the poverty and gang life that he was born into.MOODWhen the story opens, the mood is bitter and rebellious. Pony and the other Greasers resent the fact that the Socs have lots of money, nice cars, fancy clothes, and many girlfriends. In contrast, they are poor and must work extremely hard for everything they have. In addition, society is prejudiced against them because of their clothes, long hair, and greasy appearance. In the middle of the novel, the mood becomes increasingly angry. The Greasers are tired of the Socs always picking on them, and the Socs are furious about the Greasers hanging out with some of \\"their girls.\\" As a result, the Socs jump Pony and Johnny. In self-defense Johnny kills Bob, one of the Socs. The mood then becomes one of terror. Pony and Johnny are scared for their own safety and fear the police. Upon Dally's advice, they hide in an abandoned church and worry about being found. The mood then switches to great sadness, for Johnny, in trying to rescue the children when the church catches on fire, is killed himself. Dally then gets himself foolishly shot by the police, leaving Pony with two less friends. By the end of the novel, however, the mood has some degree of hope. Pony is determined to rise above his past. He adopts a new mission in life, to tell the world about the problems and deprivations of underprivileged children, like himself. It is obvious that in the end, Hinton is very sympathetic towards the plight of Pony and the Greasers."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"WOW! I cannot imagine how such a young girl can write such a good book! I first saw it in my school library a few years ago and I thought it was going to be one of those stupid gang-violence books. I was required to buy it for Lit. class 'cause we had to write notes in it and stuff and letme tell you this me and my fellow classmates LOVED it ( thanks Miss Cassels! ). Now I take my copy w/ me everywhere and read it 20+ times and still I can't seem to get enough! I know Ms. Hinton always says she'll never write a sequel, but I'm praying she'll change her mind. After we read it we watched the movie in school, and not so long after that I bought the video, and watching it as I speak ( type? Oh well ). So to make a long story short ( although I think its a little too late for my case )I'll sum up my review in three words: READ THE BOOK! -GabbieXena (Kym) oxxx|------&gt;"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is one of the best. Trust me... unlike the person who says, &#34;OMG LOL the actors are like sooo hawwt!!!&#34; Don't listen to attention whores. This book is great."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be in a gang, and the only thing that keeps you going is the love and friendship of the gang? _The Outsiders_ is a realistic fiction book written by S.E Hinton. If this book were made into a movie, it would be rated PG 13. This book was one of the best books I have read, and I would give it 5 stars. It's a story about a gang, or more like a band of brothers, who'd give their lives for each other. Their rivalry gang is the Socs. Hate is the word I would use to describe their relationship. The Socs have their own name for their rivals. They call them \\"Greasers'\\" because they believe that they are better then them. Also because they're a rough, dirty group of kids who have long hair that they always keep greased. The Greasers gang is their way of life and their brotherhood means a lot to them. The Socs gang does not have this same bond. Throughout the book they fight, attack, and jump each other. Some people even get killed. That's where one of the main conflicts comes in. The three best things about this book are that it's action packed, it's a very deep story that makes you keep reading, and has a ton of life lessons. I would recommend this book to someone who feel lost or out of place and also to someone who loves books full of action and adventure. The author's writing style is first person because it is the main character telling the story. An example of this is \\"I shook my head wordlessly.\\" This book was great and was perfectly written. I highly recommend reading this book. The reader won't be disappointed. Review by Lucas L."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"S.E. Hilton's novel, \\"The Outsides,\\" is among my favorite novels that follows the tradition of Realism. The novel seeks to portray a group of young people (a gang) called the Greasers, who are often viewed by others in their community as little more than white trash. However, through Ponyboy Curtis' narration, S.E. Hilton complicates the notion that the poor are stupid losers rather than people who have had a hard life. For instance, both of Ponyboy's parents are dead as a result of a tragic accident, and Ponyboy's 20 year old brother, Darry, has forgone college to work in order to support Ponyboy, so Ponyboy and Sodapop (other brother) would not end up in a boy's home.Even Ponyboy's narration of the text is communicated in such a way that Ponyboy's intelligence shines through, which, of course, would be realistic, because, in the United States, there are many intelligent young people who are never given the opportunity to show how intelligent they really are by a school system that fails to provide students with a rigorous education, for any of a number of reasons including a lack of funding or even a desire to perpetuate an underclass.Johnny Cade's character is also well developed. In addition to being Ponyboy's friend, S.E. Hilton's portrayal of 16 year old Johnny (through Ponyboy's narration) is one of deep, emotional depth. Johnny is not a bad kid. He murders a Soc, but only because the Socs, in their state of drunkenness, might have murdered Ponyboy. In addition, Johnny feels very badly after committing the murder, and the scenes in the abandoned church (as well as the fire scene) further convey Johnny's humanity. [My Note: In my opinion, Johnny's character is important in dispelling modern notions that wish to place people in boxes of either GOOD or BAD, as though people are either saint-like or demonic, and as though economic circumstances and other environmental factors exert no influence over a person's life or actions.]Of course, S.E. Hilton's novel is not about portraying Greasers as good and Socs as bad. That would defeat the entire purpose of her novel. The Socs are also products of their environment, an environment of total entitlement, lack of discipline by wealthy parents, and a police department that turns the other way when children of the wealthy engage in drunkenness, sexual promiscuity, etc. Worded differently, the Socs cannot imagine a world in which are not the kings of the hill - the rulers of the scum of the earth (i.e. the Greasers) because that is how their parents view young people of 'the ghetto.'In short, this novel can be read as a call for humanism - to acknowledge that people are products of their environment and backgrounds (economic and social) - and a call for all human beings to treat one another with greater dignity and respect."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders is the mandatory book on my 11-year-old step-son's summer reading list. When ordering it for him, I told him enthusiastically how much I had enjoyed reading it, at his age. He was skeptical, so I assured him it's not a girly book; it's about boys. My husband piped up, \\"It's a book about boys, written for girls!\\" I opened my mouth to argue, but had to close it. What my husband said is true.I'm sure other reviewers have summarized the plot details, so I won't. It is a manipulatively emotional story of the inner tenderness of \\"tough guys\\"; and the sad truth that even when kids get in trouble because they live in harsh circumstances, unfairly deprived of appropriate guidance from adults, THEY - and not the parents or society who have failed them - ultimately will be held responsible for their own actions and suffer whatever consequences arise. It is also the story of the inspiring self-sacrifice of a father, working to see that his son's life will be better than his own (although the \\"parent\\" and \\"child\\" in the story are actually brothers).I was touched by this book, as a kid. It never occurred to me then, that it might have been written only to please my adolescent, female sensibilities and have no relation to the inner lives of real boys. Although it's not the kind of thing I read now, I still suspect my husband's dismissal of it stems from the fact that, as a kid, he hated reading raw, tear-jerky accounts of the ties between men; and NOT that, once he was forced to read it, he found it phony and unbelievable.We'll see what my step-son thinks..."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This enduring classic is the story of the Curtis brothers - Daryl, Sodapop, and Ponyboy, who are struggling to keep what's left of their family together in 1960's Oklahoma.

The best character in this book would be Johnny because on the inside he is a good person even though he is a member of the gang known as &quot;Greasers.&quot; The best most exciting part (other than the rumble) is when Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally save the children from a fire in a old church.

It is full of suspense and action. There is never a moment when the book is boring. It tells of a boy by the name of Ponyboy who belongs to a gang along with his brothers Darry and SodaPop.

The two groups this book relates to are the &quot;Greasers&quot; and the &quot;Socs&quot;. The greasers being the &quot;lower&quot; class and the Socs being the higher.

Every page, the further you read, the more you understand, all the more your lust grows- the more you wish you were the one to be apart of this. I know it's been a long time, and call me crazy...but don't you wish you could go back in time and become a greaser and see what it's like for a while?? I do; very much so. This book changed my life. Their language, how they lived and dealt with things. Aside from Dally and Johnny dying, I loved every nanosecond of it. I love it so much it's the only book I've read in 3 months. Whenever I finish it, I flip to the beginning and start again.I really wish she'd made a sequel about the Curtis gang, but either way it's my favorite book ever.

Hinton for the first time when I was eleven years old, and have reread it several times since, including twice more during my time in prison. It remains just as relevant, affecting, and impressively written as when it first captured my imagination as a still-skinny prepubescent who was still mostly scared of girls. Intrigued, curious, and attracted, but still largely scared. I suppose it's only fitting then that it was a female, the author S.E. Hinton, who shocked me from the delusion that I was going to be a professional athlete. After reading The Outsiders I knew I wanted to be a writer. Once I found out that S.E. Hinton was only 16 years old when she wrote The Outsiders, I thought that it just might be possible for me to be a writer. With its plethora of memorable and entirely accessible characters who all inhabit a world that was so far removed from my own upbringing, yet somehow managed to feel so very much like my own, this is an excellent novel that makes me laugh, cheer, and cry each time I read it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"the book i read was called the outsiders by: S.E Hinton. the reason that i liked this book was that it was easy to read and easy to understand.i would recommend this book to people that like reading action books."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think that this book was very easy to read. I found it quiteinteresting and I was surprised when I finished it. I was so caughtup in the novel that I had no idea that I was almost done with it! I think that the main character, Ponyboy, is someone that I can relate to. He has a tough as nails exterior because he wants to fit in with his friends, but throughout the novel, you find out that he is very soft on the inside. Ponyboy and Johnny, his best friend, accidentally kill a rival gang member. They have to go hide out in an abandoned church. Johnny is injured while trying to save some small children from the burning church. Ponyboy goes through many mental and physical traumas that keep you glued to the book until it is finished.

I was enthralled for the first half and cried for the entire second half of the book. This book is incredibly insightful into Ponyboy's mind and the motivations behind everything. The author was 16 when she wrote this. the writing style is really sophisticated though, and when I read that she was just 16, i was shocked. But at the same time, it made sense, because this book really understands firsthand what it means to be a teen, and it still rings true even after 30 years. this is one of the best books I have ever read.

It told of problems that teenagers don't think about, things like how people in a different social class get treated. I know from experience the way different groups get treated. I used to hang with what we call the preps (Socs) then somthing came over me one day and I didn't like to hange with them anymore so I started to hang with the black jackets (greasers) I know how the cops treat each group different, how people in the school even treate you different. The preps are liked and the black jackets are not. Younger students are afraid of us and we don't do anything to them. The teachers even treat us different, as if we are no good for anything. I use to think that the black jackets where a terrible group to be with, but that was before I knew them and they have feelings as well maybe just don't like to show how they feel sometimes. This book expresses things that some people can relate to and I am one of them. It makes you think about how you treat people that are in different groups. Sure the group I hang with now likes to drink and party abd the preps go home and study but at least I am having fun and the preps use to judge people because they didn't do good at school and stuff like that but black jakets don't do that. Thats why I hang with them and the book lets us see things about different groups and things like that"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think that this book is alright.

Well, it's now years later and I just read the book, and now I have my answer. S.E. Hinton sheds light upon differences not only in classes at school but social classes as well with her well written story. Even though I am in my thirties now I can still relate to it all as if I was young again. A major thing I learned as I've become older is no matter what kind of clothes we wear, songs we sing, or crowd we run with, we're not that different from one another even if we do appear to be. If you're young and want to give this book a try, please do and read it with an open mind and heart.

Reading the book and later watching the movie... Oh my God it was awesome. The book written by S. E. Hinton was a piece of art anyone would like to read, as well as the movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. This last week I just watch the movie of the outsiders, and I really think it was awesome. The actors from the movie acted really well, they were \`tuff,' as the S.E. Hinton described them in the book. Each character acted in his/her own way, as the book described them. I loved the way Dally, Johnny and Ponyboy acted, they were very in with their personalities. I think Francis Ford Coppola, chose the correct people to act in his movie. The setting and plot of the movie really matched with the book. I imagined the scenes just as S.E. Hinton described them; but some things I think that didn't match a lot were Darry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy's home. It was different as I thought it was. I thought their house would be smaller, and more humble. Things went OK with the characters personalities, but I though they could match better. For example, I imagined Two-Bit \`tuff' and so different as he really is.The book and the movie matched a lot; just for little details it didn't. At the beginning and at the end of the movie, we can see that Ponyboy is writing an essay; for the other part, this happens just at the end. When Darry is angry with Ponyboy, in the book Darry slaps him, but in the movie Darry pushes Ponyboy. In the movie Ponyboy becomes blond because they needed to change their way of looking for the cops not to find them. In the book it says that Ponyboy sleeps while they were in the train, while in the movie he didn't. Also, when Johnny and Ponyboy are going to the church, Ponyboy asks a man that were is the church located; in the movie he doesn't. Another thing was when Dally wanted to rob the store. In the Movie he goes to a normal store with magazines and other stuff; while in the book he goes to a grocery store.I think that the book is better. This is because characters were really well described and the book gave you a much clear idea of how things are in the world of Greasers vs. Socs. I give this movie a rating of 3, I thought things were going to be better and that the movie would be better described. This activity helped me a lot to have a clear idea of how both things were.*Carolina Cant&uacute; Rosales"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"this is the best book and you have to readit and see the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you dont youll miss out on so much! i so highly recomend it. it portrays the life3 of a teen so perfectly its scary!11 btw my email is [...]if thers any Q's about the book!!!!!!!!1"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The outsiders is a really good book for reluctant readers, especially boys.

I suppose I've always been more likely to see a film based upon a book I've read than the other way around.The good news for me with this read is that the images I held from the film didn't haunt my reading at all, the book doing all the work on that score.The Outsiders is a great title. It has roots in the way I felt when I saw the film and, strangely, the way I feel about myself now.It's the story of gangs polarised by economic and social divides told from the point of view of one of the poorer kids (ie Ponyboy the Greaser).Ponyboy's a great character. He's immersed in the culture of the gang and its codes, yet he's open-minded enough to be able to rise above it and see the bigger picture. As he eventually discovers, everyone has it tough in some way or another.Through a logical progression of experiences, Ponyboy finds himself in the hands of the Socs (the rich gang), hands which force his head underwater at a fountain until his friend saves him by killing the aggressor.Ponyboy and Johnny (the knifer) go on the run and there follows an exploration of their values and the vulnerability of their situation in life.I won't go any further regarding the plot. All I'd like to say is that it opens up beautifully and even when it closes down it still leaves space for thought and reflection.You'll probably know that the author was only a teenager herself when she wrote the book. Sometimes it shows through and I wonder if I made any allowances for that fact. I think the book's also written for a young audience of readers ready to explore the world and who want to suck up life's experience - I also wonder if I made allowances on that score.I think that, in the end, it's such a great read that I did forgive it for any flaws or cracks in the way it's written. It does force me to ask a lot of questions about writing, too.There are passages in The Outsiders that I'd want to be editing or changing or taking out and there are rules broken here that I try to stick to in my own work. And then again, who the hell am I to be suggesting changes to this modern classic? The best thing to do with this book is too leave it exactly as it is.SE Hinton has done something very right in this tale. I was completely engrossed to the point of me stir-frying vegetables with one hand and holding the book in the other because I didn't have it in me to stop reading when I should have.I found myself fully engaged emotionally and loved the characters and the setting. There's often a tension as the story moves forward that means that getting to the next page or next chapter is essential.There are questions that are asked and left hanging, there's style and cool, there's the exploration of what it means to be part of friendship groups and of why teenage boys sometimes do the things they do (even more impressive in a sense that the author wasn't one herself).Above all, it's the voice of the book that is utterly captivation.It's consistent and full of wonder and bewilderment as a teenager's might be.When I was half way through the book, I was so happy in my reading that I went to the computer and ordered a copy of Rumble Fish. By the end, I'd placed an order for That Was Then, This Is Now. I think that says a lot about the way I feel about the Outsiders, as it does that I can't wait for those books to arrive through the post.A fabulous read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is a truly inspirational book it really is my favorite book and made me think a lot and i honestly think it changed the way i look at things."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Great storryy amazing i would suggest it for any one that loves clique s book i loved it i had to read it for a school reading assignment but ended up loving it !!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"my 8th grader needed it for school,but wasnt allowed to bring it home,then we had to take a unplanned trip to florida.not only did she enjoy the story she loved the fact that if we werent at the hotel she could continue her reading on my iphone kindle app.so great story great electronic delivery"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I love this book! I'm usually not into the books about gangs and all that, but I got this book at the library because I've heard about it so much and it was supposed to be really good. I am so glad I did!The Greasers were the &quot;bad boys&quot; from the tough neighborhood, but they acted very loose and they seemed so much more human than the Socs because they actually had emotion. I loved how Ponyboy and his brothers were very affectionate toward each other.Ponyboy himself was a very likable character. He tried to act tough and cool, but at times he was so vulnerable that I wanted someone to give him a big hug.Well, I can't talk about the whole book, but I'll just say that everyone should read this!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"With a slightly romaticized view of an era long gone S.E.Hinton attempts to take the reader into a world without rules, parents, and authority.Young kids left to their own join forces on oposing sides but they face similair situations in life.Each group, the Soc's and the Greasers, have their own version of reality. When these realities collide life altering circumstances ensue.From Johnny, the punch scared runaway to Dally Winston you get the feeling that everyone is running. Chasing Ponyboy's golden dreams of youth. Dallas choose his way out of the facade in a violent suddeness but Cherry chooses her own way out as well.You will love this book and the movie. You will revisit it a time or two down the road.The book with time, does remain golden. Dallas winston, maybe a little less golden. perhaps silver. Having a death wish is less than noble."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ok, I am 13 and I usually do not read books that often, but I have read the Outsiders for the 4th time now. It is my all time favorite book and i recomend everyone to read it, it shows gang life in the 60's and is a must read."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I read this book, I must say I don't enjoy reading much, but this book kept me reading it. A very good book to read, about life and how to deal with it."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"What can I say about the best book I've ever read! This story is a real tradgedy, but makes good pionts. I suggest it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book shows how even in high class white neighboorhoods there is gang life and the reasons why some people are involved in this kind of life and the consequences of it. When you watch the movie then read the book you'll have a better idea of the characters. I rate this book 5 starts."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I think that this book is a must for anyone living in a society were they feel like there lost. Whats amazing about this book it that it was made when gangs were still trying to thrive in america today. I find it fascinating and quite entertaining of the &quot;bad boy&quot; imagery used in most of S.E. Hinton, is verry spectacular sieng as she is at that a she. A must for anyone who likes the ideas of gangs."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"the outsiders had a neat twist that I really liked. The author S.E. Hinton is an exelent writer. Her use of words is superb. I sum it up with one word SMASHING"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The book &quot; Outsiders &quot; was a classroom novel in my 7th grade. A week ago I finished this book and I just want to say it was kind of interesting. S.E. Hinton did a good job explaining the characters exept at the end. At the end Johnny Curtis dieing was not a good ending. Even though the story took place between 1950-1960 it was still a good book to read. Because I enjoyed this book (SO,SO MUCH) I highly recommend it . I hope you will like it too."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I was assigned to read this book last year in school. Usually I don't like the books I am required to read, but this was excellent. It was writted by a teenager and really shows what it's like to be growing up. Although the book was published over 30 years ago, it still captures young audiences and I would recommend this to any teenager."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"Ponyboy. Darry. Sodapop. Steve. Dally. Johnny. Two-Bit. They're best friends. But they're also Greasers. Where they live, there are two types of people: Socs, if you're from the high-class part of town, and Greasers, if you're in the low-class part of town. For these seven friends, they only really want one thing. To be noticed as human, not a name applied to everyone where they live. But then one night, everything changes."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"What can I say? I had to read this for my Language Arts class. The whole eighth grade had to. Well, the book was, well, extremely interesting. It really hit home for some of the us. When we got to english class, and my teacher, Mr. Richards, would pass out the books, everybody would be itching to read this book. Mr. Richards said, &quot;If there is a book that you just can't wait to finish, unlike most district required novels, it definitely is good literature and writing.&quot; He also told us that S.E. Hinton was still in high school when she wrote this. Now Mr. Richards encourages us to write better and with &quot;sumptuous details&quot;."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"An assignment I read in my 10th grade English class that describes the life of Ponyboy and his friend's who are the Greasers a group of lower class teen's with long greasy hair who steel thing's because they do not have much and so they struggle to live their life on the East side against the Socials a group of rich teen's from the West side who drive mustang's and wear fancy clothes and have many thing's. This book strongly portray's the element of gang rivalry within different place's. In my mind this book deserve's 10 stars! A must have book for anyone who likes reading!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"The Outsiders was absolutely a great book. Hinton did a fantastic job of describing the characters, scenery, and feelings. A must read, and when your done, read it again! And again!"},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I thought the outsiders was very fast paced but it wasn't the best I have seen. When I first read the book I didn't know that there was a movie. my english teacher let the class watch the movie and we pretty much enjoyed it. I was able to understand and follow the movie but for someone who had never read the book it might be hard because the movie moves so fast that if you don't have a general understanding of the book than it might be a waste of time for the viewer."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"I had to read The Outsiders for my 8th grade reading class. I love to read anything from Louisa May Alcott to L.J.Smith. I believe this is one of the best books I've ever read. I only wish Johnny and Dally hadn't dyed and that there was a sequel."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This is the second time I have read this book and I will probably read it again. I think this book has a great story and it is relatively true. I was reading through some of the other reviews and I would like to argue the fact that the story was giving false information. At the time the book took place there really was Socs and Greasers. The book did a good job on educating you on how they didn't get along. Back then it was important that youths belong to something and the book shows that very well. Now days gangs are very popular. Where I live we don't have gangs, but there are people that belong to different groups. For example we've got Stoners, preppies, dorks' jocks, and &quot;just the good old boys&quot; (logger type) Maybe I can relate to this book more because we don't do our fighting with guns or knives, just good old fashioned fist fighting. Just like in the book. It's not that I don't have guns, I have lots of guns, more than most. But were I come from people know that when the bullet leaves the gun you can't stop it. I recommend this book to somebody who wants to know what it was like back in the time when this book took place, because it gives you a good real life example."},{"Title":"The Outsiders (Adapted for the Stage)","review":"This book is a wonderful, sad, gutwrenching story of gangs and friendship and brotherhood in the fifties and sixties. It is about a boy named Ponyboy, and his two brothers, Darry and Sodapop. Their parents died, and Darry has to take care of his brothers. This is a story about gangfights, friendship, hippies, and has a much deeper meaning.
