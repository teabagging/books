It is a good supplement for taking care of your health and sometimes you'll find that this is all that you need.There were times when I helped friends with long-standing and annoying health problem accompanied by intense pain - get rid of it using just the techniques as they are described in this book.Some other similar books you may check are the ones that deal with Pranic healing. It will enrich your repertoire.As a hypnotist I have been using the similar method, but instead of directing the flow of healing energy through the hands, using only mind. I did at times have clients who had scoliosis and to whom I also recommended to check out this book and who have experienced noticeable improvements where their medical doctors told them nothing more could be done.Techniques in this book are very simple, straighforward and very well explained and sooner or later you may find it really handy to know them."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"&quot;Quantum-Touch&quot; is a powerful book. I have used energy healing techniques for over 23 years, and after applying the easy and accessible techniques in this book I have increased my capacity dramatically in just the first few weeks. The book is written in easy to understand language that demystifies healing energy work. I cannot say enough good things about this book and the author. I was fortunate enough, after reading the book, to attend a workshop presented by Richard Gordon. I found him to be sincere and dedicated to the idea that we all possess the power to heal and if given the chance we will use it. I encourage anyone interested in life and health to read this book. It not only contains wonderful and simple techniques, it also contains invaluable information for general health and well-being all presented with humor and love. Buy it, read it, use it and spread the word, we are ALL healers."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"Quantum Touch as developed by Richard Gordon is a healing modality where the practitioner establishes, amplifies, and maintains an energy field with a unique frequency signature. The patient's job is to deeply relax, and develop a resonate sensitivity to that field and eventually entrain to it on a cellular level. The patient's &quot;dis-eased&quot; area changes its energy pattern to cohere and configure to the stronger pattern in the practitioner's field until the patient's pattern has stabilized and she is &quot;healed.&quot;Anyone can learn this and I've seen some amazing results without side effects. I'm glad to see that we are getting more and more alternatives to traditional medicine. With some research at the Stanford University School of Medicine on Mr. Gordon, its interesting that science is beginning to get out of its box to take a look."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"This is exciting stuff:Alternative Medicine Magazine in the July 2001 issue calls Quantum-Touch, &quot;... a significant breakthrough in hands-on healing.&quot; They go on to say that &quot;...for professionals and lay people alike, Quantum-Touch is an essential and invaluable tool.&quot;Dr. C. Norman Shealy, Founding President of the American Holistic Medical Association calls Quantum-Touch, &quot;... the first technique that may truly allow us all to become healers.&quot; He also wrote the foreword to this book after he became impressed that Quantum-Touch provided dramatic and lasting pain relief to his patients with 20 to 30 years of chronic pain, who had not been helped by any traditional or alternative modality.This is the only book I know of on hands-on healing that is praised by physicians, chiropractors, acupuncturists, physical therapists, nurses, Reiki masters, chi gung instructors, and a host of other health care professionals.Dr. Darla Parr, D.C. wrote, &quot;You actually have to see this work to know how good it is. Bones move into alignment with just a light touch, and it speeds up the healing process.&quot;Amazingly, you can actually learn to use Quantum-Touch from just reading the book, but if you get the chance, I highly recommend attending a Quantum-Touch workshop."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"Over the years I have read many books on healing. I have been trained in KOFUTU Touch Healing and KOFUTU Absent Healing and have had some success with each but nothing compares to Quantum Touch. The book is very clear with simple exercises. After completing the first exercise, I felt so much energy in my hands that I decided to try it out on myself. At the time, my left knee and hip were so stiff and painful that I was afraid I was going to have to cancel a shopping trip that I had been planning. When I placed my hands on my knee, I immediately felt 3 small, sharp pains as I felt my knee cap actually shift, although I was applying no pressure. The pain migrated to my hip but it went away when I placed my hands on my hip. The stiffness and pain were completely gone and I spent the next day shopping. The pain and stiffness have not returned, nor have I felt any pain or stiffness in any other joints.My background in yoga was a definite help because breath control was not new to me; my KOFUTU and meditation experience also contributed to my first success. I believe that it takes practice and dedication to truly master QT but with this book and the author's technique, anyone can have immediate success on some level. I recommend it highly to anyone who feels the need to heal themselves or others."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"Richard Gordon talks about a &quot;new&quot;, though really very old, way of working with energy that is so simple I was able to learn and actually use it in one day. He explains why he thinks it works in very clear, modern, scientific language -- thus the &quot;quantum&quot; in the touch. He relates it to the most recent studies in physics.What can you do with Quantum Touch? Raise your own energy vibration so the person you touch can use your higher energy level to heal themselves! Marvelous! The healer is the one receiving the energy. A fantastically simple and wonderful technique.

To those that do stick with it the breathing can be a bit uphill to start with but you get used to it."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"If you are interested in developing and utilizing your innate healing abilities, then Quantum Touch by Richard Gordon is for you. This book is well written and very easy to follow. The techniques described in this book emphasizes on the importance of proper breathing and the principle of entrainment. According to this principle, if two items are vibrating side by side at different frequencies, then the lower frequency item which in this case is the patient will be adjusted itself to the higher healing frequency of the healer.

I picked this up on a whim, curious to see if it really offered a break through in energy healing.There is nothing innovative about this book. You can find the concepts the author discusses in books on taoism and tantra that are better written and have a better explanation.I tried his exercises out and found them to be not nearly as effective as he promised. If anything it seemed this was more like a diet lite soda than anything that promised a break through. I wouldn't really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"Checked out the Quantum Touch web site...and found a BEFORE and AFTER image that had very obviously been digitally manipulated to give the appearance of a disfigured leg, her companions leg is even worse if you look closely! Also the Xray of the cranium has been taken at two slightly different angles to give the illusion of after 'realignment' Xray, this is harder to spot and had me fooled for a moment...until that is I came upon the 'Photoshop' image further down the page which shouldn't fool anyone.Well Mr Gordon when you 'stretch' the truthtoo far...out of desperation to sell a concept, not to mention books, tapes and lectures...people start to doubt every single claim that has been made.What a pity. I was actually going to buy this book.Why don't you just tell it like it is. I thought the claims were a little far fetched but I believed there may be some elements that were enlightening and informative...and maybe there are, but now I wouldn't buy it on principle.Check out HOW WE HEAL by Douglas Morrison."},{"Title":"The adventures of Ulysses","review":"I like how quickly this book downloaded to my computer and am looking forward to reading it and using it in home schooling my 9th grader in Honors English. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"In twelve short stories, Garcia Marquez proves that he is not only capable of writing deeply, he is capable of writing concisely. The stories in this book are extremely thought provoking, relating to the human spirit and little oddities about people.There is one story in particular that I will not forget. It is about a woman who gets stranded with a flat tire, and hitches a ride with a bus to a mental institution. The story unfolds from there, and I don't think I have ever felt so deeply troubled by a single story like I was in this case. Of the twelve stories, I liked 8 or 9, the others were a little boring (or maybe I did not get them). I highly recommend it, especially for those who do not have the patience to read GM's &quot;One Hundred Years of SOlitude&quot; and would like an intro to the author."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"As I read &quot;Strange Pilgrims,&quot; the collection of short stories by Colombian-born Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I was reminded of the classic television series &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot; Like some of the best episodes in that series, many of the stories in &quot;Strange Pilgrims&quot; are rich in irony and psychological intrigue, and incorporate elements of the macabre and the fantastic. And many of the stories have twist endings. This collection has been translated into English by Edith Grossman.These stories deal with Latin Americans on voyages, for various reasons, to Europe. The book thus has a trans-Atlantic, international feel. Highlights of the collection include &quot;Bon Voyage, Mr. President,&quot; about a deposed head of state seeking medical attention in Switzerland; &quot;The Saint,&quot; a supernatural tale of a father seeking canonization of his daughter from the Pope; the creepy &quot;The Ghosts of August&quot;; and the grotesque &quot;Seventeen Poisoned Englishmen.&quot;Throughout the book Garcia Marquez presents many images that are beautiful or disturbing, but often memorable: a drowned man floating with &quot;a fresh gardenia in his lapel,&quot; a moray eel nailed to a door, a bedspread stiff with the dried blood from a murder. An added bonus is the appearance of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda as a fictional character in one of the tales. &quot;Strange Pilgrims&quot; is a varied collection of weird treats from a master storyteller."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"I wonder if Garcia-Marquez is capable of writing a bad story. Certainly this selection of twelve are like polished gemstones. They might not be shiny or scintillating, but they are so solid, so satisfying. Each of them centers around Latin Americans, mostly Colombians, and their strange experiences in Europe. Back in South America, they move in familiar patterns, they feel at home, but in Europe, unknown and unseen forces affect them, they are prey to the pitfalls of strangeness, they can't see anything coming until it runs them over. While the gigantic geography, turbulent history, and luxuriant and untamed nature of South America fosters magical realism in authors, at least in Garcia-Marquez and some of the other greats, they also produce characters very much larger than life. Europe has always seemed to me a much tamer place, having reduced uncertainty over centuries--- more set in its ways, with fewer surprises, established, sedate. Garcia-Marquez perhaps sees it in a similar way and it unnerves his Latin American protagonists. An ex-dictator lives in a student garret, sells his jewels, and undergoes a useless operation. A woman disappears \\"by accident\\" into a mental institution and a playboy dithers in a cheap Paris hotel, not knowing a word of French, while his young wife dies in a hospital. A postal clerk spends years trying to see the Pope to convince him of his daughter's saintly qualities. He lugs the deceased but uncorrupted daughter around in a huge case. An aged ex-prostitute feels death is at her door, but actually it is something else. Nobody really feels at home, nobody can trust their feelings, because everything works differently. Europe isn't exactly an alien place for them, but they are, each time, unwitting victims of the unexpected.Garcia-Marquez is one of those authors who seem to write about ordinary people whose lives take strange twists. But the worlds they inhabit, the people around them, the very fabric of their existence seem to me utterly fantastic. His talent lies not in presenting ordinary life, but extraordinary life. You accept a little more, a little more until suddenly you find yourself believing in the unbelievable. In the great warrens of Western civilization, but also in the daily grinds of Asia, Africa, or Latin America, life may take interesting paths, or curious twists, but for the most part, it is very predictable. These stories all have only the veneer of predictability; underneath the realism is full of spooky holes. Yet, that is not only due to a magical tone as in novels like \\"The Autumn of the Patriarch\\" or \\"One Hundred Years of Misunderstanding\\", it is due to the author's constant combination of known daily life with near-fantasy. You can hardly draw the line between them, so closely does he knit. Great stories by a truly great talent. Read them."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"\\"Strange Pilgrims\\" is a wonderful, but sometimes overlooked, collection of 12 short stories from the Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The stories that compose the collection vary in length and quality, but even the less successful among them are worthy of the reader's attention. The stand-out stories include \\"The Saint\\", \\"Maria dos Prazeres\\", \\"Miss Forbes's Summer of Happiness\\" and \\"I Only Came to Use the Phone\\" -- a bizarre and haunting tale of a young woman whose car breaks down in a Spanish desert, on a rainy afternoon. She is unwittingly picked up as a hitchhiker and mistaken for a mental patient who is taken to an asylum. This theme, of the familiar merging with the nightmarish is explored again in \\"The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow.\\"In \\"I Sell My Dreams\\", the protagonist meets Pablo Neruda (\\"He moved through the crowd like an invalid elephant, with a child's curiosity in the inner workings of each thing he saw, for the world appeared to him as an immense wind-up toy with which life invented itself\\") and discusses the labyrinths of Borges, among other things. \\"Light is Like Water\\", a charming ode to the power of a child's imagination, is a story brimming with surreal imagery.These 12 tales perfectly define the genre of 'magical realism'. The collection also seems like a fine place to start for those seeking to familiarize themselves with the work of Garcia Marquez, before tackling epic novels like \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" and \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\". These are the kinds of stories that seem to stick in the reader's memory and welcome repeated readings."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"An incredibly inventive and thought-provoking collection, &quot;Strange Pilgrims&quot; is reminiscent of Milan Kundera's &quot;Book Of Laughter and Forgetting&quot;, as well as Tim O'Brien's &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;. Constructed as interweaving short stories, these twelve misfit pieces all deal with moving themes: loneliness, death, travel, the otherworldly nostalgia that these phenomena provoke, and ultimately the sadness of being lost in your own experiences. Like Kundera's &quot;Laughter and Forgetting&quot;, &quot;Strange Pilgrims&quot; does not attempt to draw lucid conclusions between its seemingly unrelated characters. Instead, Garcia-Marquez simply allows the reader to develop his own relationship to the text. At times, &quot;Strange Pilgrims&quot; achieves what Garcia-Marquez so eloquently refers to when speaking of writing in the book's introduction-&quot;the closest a human can get to the experirence of levitation.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"I will be brief in praising this book. Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is the most celebrated and BELOVED novelist in the Spanish language since Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote. If you have not read him before, YOU SHOULD! But enough of the &quot;good medicine&quot; talk. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is entertaining. In these stories you will be witness to strange events told with a straight face, and in achingly beautiful prose. A woman's hand trailing blood in the snow, a lovely, sleeping beauty on board a plane, a man in Rome with a small coffin containing his daughter's body... These stories have a light touch-- they get your interest and entertain you! No need for me to go on... check it out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"First book I ever read by GGM, and it packed a whallop!Here are stories that seem to prove that to be human is to be in touch with magic. His voice is like no one else's, like some kind of rebel or radical, free of the constraints of society. I was refreshed by his individuality, his rather sweetly humorous take on the tragic foibles of man.After this, I read almost everything else he authored. I encourage all readers to get this book and read it now!"},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"True to form, Marquez writes beautifully. He is blunt with his words in such a way that ties them together purely. You feel as though you are in the stories, not simply imagining them. In a way, these stories are like a good mystery or even horror film; you know something isn't quite clear, yet you continue to watch because it all comes together in the right way. These stories leave you with a just a bit more insight into people and human nature. They leave you satisfied, which, in my opinion, is the sure sign of great writing."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"What an ideal book for my Garcia Marquez collection. Some stories appear to have no point--but that's a North American viewpoint. South Americans: \\"It is what It Is.\\" My favorite story about children turning on the lights in their apartment and being magically realistic is in this collection. Short story books serve two purposes for me: One, when I can't sleep and need a boost toward dreamland, and Two, the paperback is easy to cart around while I'm in waiting rooms for appointments. The book can also serve as a \\"test run\\" for a new reader who wants to sample his style, characters, sentences ending in ways you'd never expect but can appreciate, and plots (some, \\"sort of\\")."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"This is truly a book for all people of all ages, there are magical aspects of every story, which are great for childrens imaginations. Marquez combines this with realism that makes anyone question what is real and what is not"},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"While they are a wee bit on the light side, these stories are extremely powerful.

There is a former President who is proud to have been long forgotten. Margarito Duarte with his desperate quest to meet the Pope so that he can show him the corpse of his holy daughter. A passenger desperately wanting to talk to a dazzling but sleeping woman on a flight from Paris to New York. Frau Frieda whose profession it is to dream. The Venezuelan writer who owns a haunted castle near Arezzo. Maria dos Prazeres wishes to be buried in a place high above water level. Prudencia Linero has sworn to God to wear a bizarre costume till her death if she is given the opportunity to speak to the Pope. A porter driven crazy by the Tramontane wind in Cadaques.

And finally the sinister trip of Nena Daconte and Billy Sanchez from Madrid to Paris."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"I have read and re-read these stories, back to back. I had to force myself to stop as there are other books. These are among the best short stories I have ever read. Creating worlds is probably more about what to leave out and Marquez does this with precision, and dare I say, with the hand of god."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"This bundle of short stories contains some of the greatest highlights of G.G.

Kawabata's \`The House of the Sleeping Beauties' (\`Sleeping Beauty and the Airplaine'), which continues to fascinate the author. He even wrote a short novel about this theme (\`Memories of My Melancholic Whores').There are also outspoken political stories, ingredients or comments in it: (South-America) \`A continent conceived by the scum of the earth without a moment of love: the children of abductions, rape, violations, infamous dealings, deceptions, the union of enemies with enemies.' (\`Bon Voyage, Mr. President') or, like the Spanish Franco scene in \`Maria dos Prazeres.'Of course, there are also the sex histrionics and the \`miracles' (\`The Saint').These stories shine through their \`surrealist shocks' (\`The Ghosts in August'), the evocation of the unpredictability of human fate, the meditations on the fugacity of human life and the possibility of a sudden death, or the melancholic memories of crucial personal confrontations and happenings.They constitute a perfect introduction to the author's major and larger novels, like \`One Hundred Years of Solitude' or \`Living to Tell the Tale'.A must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"As with all of the Marquez works, this grouping of short stories is like walking through the thoughts of a creative genius."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"as always, gabriel garcia marquez weaves many wonderful characters into a rich tapestry that seems to envelope you and leave you with that feeling of warmth expected from one of his novels. twelve stories is a wonderful trip through time with the author that you will look forward taking again in the future."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"As usual, the work was beautiful.

He has managed to write stories about things that people go through in life but in a way that no one could describe. I thought that the story &quot;Sleeping Beauty and the Airplane&quot; was wonderful and it seemed so different from most stories. I loved this book and if you like stories that have a little bit of a twist to them read this book."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"Although these stories were at time confusing, I kept feeling like I needed to read them again. Each time I finished a story, I felt like the characters needed to be heard over and over, that if I closed the book, their individual fears would take over them. It is rare that books can convince you of a fictional character's reality. I read this book for a summer reading project going into 12th grade and wondered after finishing it 'why did they wait so long to assign this? Why didn't I read it on my own?' Awesome book, definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Strange Pilgrims","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez has mastered the form of the short story. I'm not even finished with the book and I'm in love with it. I read One Hundred Years of Solitude and wanted another taste, but didn't want to commit to another full novel in such quick succession. Now I can't wait to dive into Love in the Time of Cholera. These stories are so unique and filled with the same beautiful magical language as in OYOS.

Neither an Agatha Christie nor a Julia Childs, Ms Davidson creates a pedestrian work of fiction overly loaded with kitchen trivia and out of context recipies that lack most of the ingredients for a solid &quot;who done it.&quot; Indeed, my reaction at the end was more like who cares who done it. Perhaps there are some useful hints for the budding chef but for me, I'll not bother with another of her books."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I picked up this book in a used booked store in Powell River, British Columbia, while waiting for a ferry to Vancouver. I didn't know that culinary murder mysteries was a genre and this book was part of a series of similar mishaps. Where was the warning label?The author sets up her heroine as a gourmet-wannabe Nancy Drew running after inept murderers while strewing recipe cards along her trail. She dishes out food descriptions ad nauseam and then raves over them until you want to gag her with a kitchen towel. All the while, she insults her readers' intelligence by serving up as novelty that age old recipe of suspecting the evil looking guy first, and then making her model character the evil culprit!If you're a fan of this author's work you'll probably enjoy it. But if this is your first time try, be aware that it is definitely an acquired taste. I'll pass on seconds."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"This is the first book I have read by D. Mott and most likely the last. Unless a book is absolutely awful, I always make an attempt to finish it. I was determined to read Tough Cookie based on the positive reviews I had read. And I did finish it. But it took me more than 6 weeks! I think the reason why it took so long was because the book just rambled; in a nutshell, it was boring. For those of you who have run into the same problem, just hand in there. Around chapter 20 things start getting better. And by chapter 23, you can close the book and congratulate yourself for your perseverance."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"The \\"detective\\" character, Goldy, is terribly annoying and way too cute for words. The books could easily be shortened by 100+ pages. Every detail however small and unimportant is described in excrutiating detail. Bad writing + bad character development = frustration. Don't waste your time and money with this crap. If you are looking for a non-professionsal female \\"detective\\" story try Murder on Martha's Vineyard by David Osborn."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have always found Diane Mott Davidson's \`heroine', the caterer Goldy Schultz to be willfully dysfunctional - putting herself in harm's way constantly, dealing foolishly with her abusive ex-husband and tolerating and encouraging the sullen and rude behavior of her adolescent son. This book is set at a ski area. Among all of those acknowledgements at the beginning of the book, wouldn't you think that Ms. Davidson could find one person who knows enough about skiing to correct at least the most egregious errors about the sport?Her sneaky underhanded ways of gathering \`evidence' with no respect for the law or individual rights are beyond tolerating. Perhaps the smarmy references to churchgoing are supposed to encourage forgiveness for these lapses. We are further treated to recipes with ground beef and Velveeta. Maybe hamburger helper is gourmet food where she comes from and it is a nice change from the heart stopping cream and butter laden recipes of her past books, but really - don't bother with this book if you eat or if you ski, it is too annoying."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"The recipies are better than the plot. Chocolate Coma Cookies are wonderful, good as a muffin batter too... does anyone miss the shrimp currry recipe? It sounds awesome!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Although a recipe for successful cookies is a good act to follow, a recipe for a cookie cutter mystery is no mystery at all. I have enjoyed Ms. Davidson's previous novels with a healthy appetite, always looking to return to her good cooking. But neither her recipes (my, goodness, Velveta! I'd rather have her recipe for meatballs.) nor her writing are at all tasty in this hastily thrown together goulash. Characters pop in and out (Marla, Julian, Tom) with no explanation and no reason except some nod to her loyal readers. A newcomer to this venue would be baffled by their ties to this self-centered caterer.And you know, this COULD have been a killer recipe -- good villain, multiple suspects, a friend in trouble, good setting, and good descriptions. But the book is much too insubstantial and the characters mere meringue.I hope that next time the author goes for more solid fare with much improved character development and motivation, better dialogue, and some stick to your ribs recipes."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I loved that Goldy had to do a cooking show at the top of a mountain to earn money to finish her kitchen renovations (carried forward from thePrime Cut (Goldy Culinary Mysteries, Book 8)book) and the story in Tough Cookie was unpredictable and the ending more nail biting than Diane Mott Davidson's other books. I love the Goldy series as it's humorous, enjoyable reading that has made me enjoy cooking more and I've yet to try a recipe despite how incredible they all look to be!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"While not the first book of the series, this is the first one I read. And it stood pretty much on its own, though I'm sure reading the series in order would give you better context as far as some of the character's actions are concerned. And I admit, I picked this one because it had a picture of a \\"cutesy\\" chef (but with a scowl) cookie jar holding a gun on the cover. And, unlike choosing Nerd in Shining Armour by its title, this gamble wasn't half bad. It was an enjoyable story with some decent characters, and every time you thought you really, really had it figured out there was a twist. It really kept you guessing, which is a pleasant surprise in a mystery novel these days. Though the characters weren't the greatest, the mystery portion was well written and the overall story drew you in - enough that I'll probably read another in the series."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"No, Diane Mott Davidson's books are not great literary works of art. They ARE tremendously fun to read. The main character, Goldy the caterer (a little plump, a little clumsy, a little goofy, drinks too much coffee) may be you or someone you know! You will laugh out loud at her some of her predicaments, and feel her pain with the ex and troubles with raising a son. I've read a few of her books so far and really enjoy the characters, the somewhat simple mysteries and the really great recipes!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I love these murder mystery cooking books. The stories are good & the recipes are great. Diane Mott Davidson is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"In the ninth of her Goldy Bear Schulz culinary mystery series, Davidson serves up a delicious concotion of murder, Colorado skiing, marvelous recipes (don't neglect to try them!) and plucky detective work on the part of her main character, caterer Goldy.She's appearing on a PBS cooking show, broadcast from high in the Rockies, which doesn't always go well. Someone wants her dead, as she discovers when her van is forced off the road. A wealthy man she has dated briefly is found dead on a ski run.Fueled by expresso coffee, comforted and nourished by chocolate cookies, Goldy gets to the heart of the matter. This winter's tale is best read next to a glowing fireplace with a tray of her chocolate cookies at hand! Recommended."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"In the 9th Little Goldy Book, Diane Mott Davidson whips up yet another delicious tale of murder, mayhem and dessert. With some very fresh ingredients (and no substitutions!) the recipe comes together for a very palatable mystery. Set at the Christmas season, Goldy is dealing with business troubles (again), a Testy Teen (folks, Arch isn&#65533;t going to be human again for about 6 or 8 more years - DMD raised boys, and I did too, and this is The Way It Is), the incomparable and incredible cooking cop Tom, as well as Marla, Julian, the Jerk, and some of the regulars. With her skillful whisk, Goldy whips in some wine lore, skiing and snowboarding, and survival as a wife, mom, cook, friend and TV star. It&#65533;s an exciting trip to Aspen Meadows, an action packed picnic on the slopes. The author really outdid herself this time, and delivered a deliciously unique cozy, that deserves 5 stars in the cozy category. Once again, Goldy gets it just right."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"This is the book that started my interest and since reading it I have purchased and read the entire series. Goldy is a great self taught cook. She is easy to relate to, except for the courage and determination to find the killer thing...i would run the other way. But, that is why I like the books, i can pretend. It is not a hard, complicated, make you think book. it IS an easy, enjoyable, quick read. i loved it."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"However, I tend to feel that too many bad things happen all at once, she finds a body, gets in an accident, her son is snotty and she has to cook for a meal. After a while, I feel that this author gets bogged down in rough times. I would like to see her son grow up a bit and be a bit more enjoyable. In the end everything seems to even out, although they are not always happy endings with everything all wrapped up in a neat bow.However, having said that- if you want an easy to read book with yummy recipes this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I love this whole series. I just wish Julian would come back."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"My mom & I love this author & her tasty recipes hidden in plain sight as part of an intiguing mystery. this book I gave to a friend to start her on a culinary mystery journey of her own."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I read this book on the airplane and didn't want to put it down. Goldy is always trying to figure out the latest crime, and ends up putting herself in danger. This is my second Diane Mott Davidson book and I am officially addicted.Money can't buy love was repeated in this book and it couldn't be truer. One person after another dies, and Goldy is all caught up in it, but it isn't clear at all who is the true killer. Could it be Authur who killed his mother and wants to get her will changed to receive all her money? Could it be Barton Reed? There are a few that it could be. You will have to read and find out. But I agree, don't read this book on an empty stomach or you will be cooking up the first one! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"This latest in the Colorado Caterer series is exactly what we'd expect--another reviewer called it a 'cookie cutter' of a novel. And that's true...except that I like the Goldie mystery series, and I don't mind another delicious little bite.It's not a novel for the first-time reader of this series, however: you will wonder about Julian and The Creep, who are never really explained and who seem to appear in the novel for no good reason except to provide a car, a loaf of bread, or a convenient scapegoat. If you're perplexed about them, read the other mysteries in this series. And use the recipes--they are delectable."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I couldn't put this one down! Diane Mott Davidson keeps cooking up great stories and ideas. This book is the best yet! The recipes included were to die for. Goldy is a great character, who always finds herself in the greatest messes. I look foward to many more stories in the continuing saga . . ."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Diane Mott Davidson has never met an adjective for which she couldn't find a use. Steaming, fragrant, sweet, soft...they're all here, and more. Despite likable, well-drawn characters, detailed cooking descriptions drag down a plot that's already on the edge of not-so-interesting. I did finish this novel -- all 319 paperback pages -- and am not particularly sorry I did, but never was I gripped. Near the end, a predictable self-induced crisis puts the heroine in mortal danger, from which she improbably escapes to see a neatly-wrapped conclusion in the last page or two."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"A faithful reader and re-reader of DMD's books, I eagerly awaited &quot;Tough Cookie&quot;, as I have all of her &quot;Goldy the Caterer&quot; series. This one, though, failed to deliver.Many of her recipes seemed uninspired, the plot boring and the new characters very one-dimensional. This book seemed like it was written in a hurry, to meet a publisher's deadline, and with little imagination.I did enjoy the setting of a ski resort; I've never been to Colorado but DMD's descriptions are always wonderful and vivid. I feel like I would recognize that part of the country if I visited, just from reading her books.Normally I try to buy her books for the recipes; with this one, I wouldn't bother."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Whenever Goldy does not follow her detective husband's advise about not going places and or doing things by herself; she ends up in DEEP trouble! This happens so many times (in almost every book) that I certainly have no sympathy for her. She is just plain hell-bent on doing her own thing. She has been hit over the head so many times when she doesn't respect her husband's advise--perhaps that is why she does such stupid things."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I've read several of Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy Schultz mysteries, and find that they run along the same trail--someone gets murdered, and Goldy divides her time between investigating the murder and whipping up delicious food. &quot;Tough Cookie&quot; is no great departure from the formula. Everyone has their roles to play, and play them they do--from Goldy's brassy friend Marla to Goldy's abusive ex-husband (whose menacing appearances often jarringly distract from the rest of the story, which despite the murders and other goings-on tend to be quite fluffy). Why anyone would want to live in Aspen Meadows, which must have the highest per-capita murder rate in America judging by the books, is beyond me! Still, a pleasant read for those who like their murder mysteries on the lighter side. Good recipes, too."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I am a faithful fan of Ms. Davidson, but this one I was glad that I got from the library instead of buying. The end was very abrupt and rushed like a high school paper with a great beginning and then it was time to turn in so she slapped an ending on it.Goldy is beginning to be unrealistic the more I read. She doesn't even skip a beat when she is seriously hurt in an auto accident just goes into her kitchen to whip up some food. I would really ditch this woman if she were in my life...too many bad things happen to those in her life. There was no big thing that she killed a man and noses into things that are none of her business. How many times has she been told to keep her nose out? Most people would start to think that her obstruction of justice and her many brushes with trouble would make her guilty by association.It was a nice easy read just very frustrating that the book seems to tries to end everything in the last 5 pages. It did however like most of her books make me want to go into the kitchen and cook. She does need to learn to deal with her son. Her cleaning up his botched experiement and Arch in general is just off. Although it has been awhile since I was around 14 year olds."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I, too, wish that Goldie's life were not in perpetual crisis. As a series progresses, it's nice to have the characters learn from experience. I get very impatient with Goldie for making the same mistakes from book to book even though, as a former victim of abuse [child, not spouse], I find her attitude believable. I was already middle-aged when I filed four EEO complaints in 14 months [those complaints are all public record in Arizona]. I kept making the same mistake in trusting the wrong persons, being nice and hoping that would help, and being ridiculously shocked at the next level of harassment escalation. Luckily, it was the same years of therapy that gave me the courage to fight back that enabled me to switch tactics and end the harassment. I recommend more therapy for Goldie, for Arch, and definitely for this book's overly-suspicious pregnant widow (or I fear for that baby's emotional health). That aside, I enjoyed the book. The disasters on the cooking show, the art gallery scene, the descriptions of people and places, that Marla is once again permitted to be stylish though fat and that Goldie is permitted to find her fat husband sexy, and the chilling chase scene at the climax. Speaking of Arch, it's rather a pity that Marla doesn't give Goldie a complete set of &quot;Calvin &amp; Hobbes&quot; books. Reading them might enable Goldie to count her blessings. I'm not at all happy with the dust jacket, though. Yes, it's a cute visual pun on the title. However, I grew up with the covers of Nancy Drew, Judy Bolton; and science fiction and fantasy paperbacks. I got my parents to buy me my first Dana Girls book, *The Winking Ruby Mystery*, just because I loved the cover. I pulled the book out and looked at it again not so long ago, and it had the same power to compel my gaze as it did over 30 years ago. When I think of what a marvelous opportunity for a knockout cover this book's climax is, with Goldie's terrified run through that breathtaking scenery, a ruthless armed killer coming ever closer -- and we get a chef-shaped cookie jar with a gun. If I were my cat, I'd hiss!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I actually started the series with this book, and I enjoyed it so much I bought the entire series. I just finished re-reading &quot;Tough Cookie&quot; (after reading all the books in order) and it's the best book in the series by far.I like Diane Mott Davidson a lot, but her previous books lacked a tight focus of characters and plot (besides Goldy and Arch). This book really held everything together- the people in the book were presented in such a way that you were interested in their motives from the first page. Goldy gains a lot of self-confidence in this book- It was nice to see her out of the kitchen and not having to worry about her security system and keeping the doors locked all the time. I know it's been a major plot issue in other books, but when Goldy was able to stop worrying about her ex-husband, John Richard, showing up and beating the hell out of her, she was actually able to come out of her shell and have fun. I can only hope that &quot;The Jerk&quot; stays in prison for the rest of the series because I am getting sick of the constant abuse he dolls out to her and how even her policeman husband can't seem to stop it.I sincerely hope that DMD continues letting Goldy shine the way she does in this book. I normally advise people to read series in order, but if you have a chance to read &quot;Tough Cookie&quot;, go ahead. It's a fun read that really will keep you guessing. Viva la Goldy!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Tough Cookie finds Goldy in the thick of some serious drama, but she gets through with smarts, determination and wit. I love the Goldy character because she's brave, funny and nurturing. Finally - a wife and mother who loves her job (and sex) too!I put this as my favorite of the Goldy mysteries because of the end - which you have to read to believe. It'll leave you breathless, thinking \`How's Goldy gonna get out of this one?' Sure, the likelihood of so many murders going on in one town is ridiculous. And would Goldy really be so front-and-center in these people's lives? I doubt it, but since Ms. Davidson tells such ripping good yarns, I don't care.That being said, somebody please smack Arch. PLEASE! Sure he's a teenager, but until the kid's paying his own bills in his own house, he needs a kick in the pants. Still, my extreme annoyance with him is just what the author wanted - when you experience real emotion toward a fictional character, that's good writing.And who knew recipes could add so much flavor to a plotline? I've gotten to the point where I'm looking forward to a page or two of cookery. Davidson's food passages are so well-written they don't slow the pace one bit. Characters, storyline, occupational details, humor and heartstrings come together wonderfully in Davidson's mysteries. I hope she writes a mystery with Goldy on her dream trip to Italy."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Caterer Goldy Schulz's kitchen has been shut down because it did not pass inspection after a remodeling job by her husband. Fortunately, Goldy is offered the job of a cooking show on PBS and she has decided to pursue a job as a personal chef, where she can cook in her clients' kitchens. Things are still tight financially, so Goldy decides to sell some valuable skis to her old boyfriend, Doug Portman. Before they can complete the transaction, Portman dies and Goldy becomes a suspect. Added to this, Goldy is almost pushed off the road by another vehicle. There have been several deaths near the place where Portman died, and Goldy suspects that they are somehow linked. As she begins her investigation, she discovers no shortage of suspects. Several people have motives for murdering Portman, and it's up to Goldy to find the killer. Before she does, she is nearly killed herself. This is a good addition to the series and has interesting characters and plot."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"This is the second book I've read in this series. This one is faster paced than Dying for Chocolate. Mrs. Davidson does a better job of conveying the passage of time in this novel also. It is quite evident that this is a later installment. The quality of the writing is better. Mrs. Davidson does a marvelous job of giving the reader the feeling of being in Colorado. The book is full of interesting characters. Loved &quot;Marla&quot; and &quot;Arthur.&quot; The plot will keep you guess for some time. The story line wraps up quickly at the end, but I did like the way the criminal was caught. I wouldn't mind reading this one again. There are a few things that I found unbelieveable about this novel as did other readers (I read the previous reviews), but none of them ruined the novel for me."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"How Goldie does not weigh three hundred or more pounds is beyond me. If I consumed the amount of cookies, cakes and &quot;drippingly lushus&quot; buttered stuff she consumes, I would be an avalanche waiting to happen. Oh, well, it's fiction.I read some of her other books and found them amusing, and this one is O.K. but not, in my opinion, among the best. Still, she's an upscale ski resort caterer with a Jersey attitude, and that's kind of cute. And I personally like her dysfunctional life. It's actually quite real. It keeps me listening, with half an ear, as I prepare simple but healthy meals for my family."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I loved this book. what an original concept! I couldn't put it down. I would sneak into the bathroom at work and read a few pages. I hide Tough Cookie among our many law books and pretend to be busy reading a certain case and would actually be reading about Goldy and her cooking/snooping or her relationship with her son Arch.The only problem I had was when she had that terrible car accident and went home and COOKED A WHOLE MEAL AND BAKED COOKIES...PLEEEEEESE. Otherwise the book was fantastic, especially all those wonderful recipes.I just ordered all DMD books (except Stones &amp; Scones) and plan to have a great summer reading all of DMD books and trying out recipes."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have read this entire series and have enjoyed them all. They need to be read in order so that you can become aquainted with the characters and events. Other reviewers have talked about &quot;reality&quot; etc. If you think one person is always involved with every murder in their town, then you must not get out all that much. To me the recipes are only the side bar to the story. The relationship with Goldie and Arch is a very real one. &quot; The Jerk &quot; is a very believeable character and I cheered when he got his due. This latest entry into the series had me guessing right up to the end. I enjoyed it and so will you, if you keep in mind what it really is. A work of fiction and not a biography."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I look forward to reading Diane Mott Davidson with great gusto. Tough Cookie once again meets up to her high standard. Her books are generally a casual read but not predictable and the villian is not easily determined. This is not a cookbook and I am not looking for Einstein receipes but good entertainment about a loving family sticking together thru it all. I wish there was another book by her now and anxiously await her next."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have read all the books in this series and have enjoyed each one. Tough Cookie was no exception. It had great character development, and I didn't figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; was until the end. Her recipes always sound good too."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Ms. Davis kept to her recipe. She developed her characters with a dash of suspicion and a pinch of intrique. The ending turned out to be predictable but I moved through every word wondering if I was correct. I hope she keeps them coming."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have already weighed in (pardon the pun, Goldie) re. the &quot;corpulent caterer&quot; as the main character is referred to in a news article in &quot;Tough Cookie,&quot; but felt I must clear up a reviewer's previous criticism.Goldie's husband Tom fixed her drain. He took the whole thing apart and put it back together for her, good as new, so they wouldn't have to hire a plumber to do the work. Don't people read the book before they make a negative comment? Seems irresponsible to me."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"This is the first goldie book I've read, and I'm hooked! She's a great character, surrounded by interesteing supporting characters. Plus, she has interesting hobbies, like skiing, sports and those delicous food concotions she comes up with. I read some of the other reviews and have only one thing to say. For all of you who wish Goldie was not inperetual crisis-Do you know what a series means? Would you have preferred that Hercule Poirot did not always stumble into mysteries everywhere he went, too? I think Ms Davison has done what any great series writer has done-kept her character getting into more and more interesting trouble!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"There was a book fair at work and this book was 50% off, so I bought it and read it in less than three days. I admit, this wasn't a real thriller type mystery, but it was very easy to read and I enjoyed it. So much, in fact, that I ordered all eight of her previous books. I plan to start with the first and read straight through to this one. It should be quite a trip!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I was very pleased with this book. I put off buying it, based on my disappointment with some of her recent books and on the early lackluster reviews. This book was back to what I expect from DMD. A good story, characters that I care about, and great recipes, particularly the chocolate chunk/tart-cherry cookies! True, her son is a bit sullen, but I don't find it to be out of character for a 16 year old boy."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"As an avid fan of D.M.D. and Goldy Bear Korman Schultz, I have waited for this book since September when I first learned of it's pending release. Unfortuately, my excitement upon receiving htis newest offering was short-lived. Why has Kathleen Druckman changed her nanme to Eileen? Did the editor miss this sudden change? Perhaps they were confused with &quot;The Main Corpse&quot;'s Eileen Tobey? Actually, re-reading the books in this, one of my favorite, series has brought to light multiple discrepancies between books. Next, they will try to tell us that Keely is Marla's maiden name. Sheesh! How much bad Karma can one person have? Goldy has to be one of the unluckiest people. What did she do in her past life? Just once, I wish they would be financially solvent and out from under the Jerk's menacing shadow. Julian was distressingly absent, for the majority of the book. Apparently, Maguire has fallen off the face of the earth as well, after such an enthusiastic foray into the world of crime-fighting. Why introduce so many new people, when old relationships are still unresolved. And just for the record, the Earring King gentleman in the health store in &quot;The Grilling Season&quot; was named Edgar. He also decided to change his name to Barton Reed with no explanation. Here's hoping the next offering will &quot;measure up&quot;."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have loved this series - from characters to plots to recipes (especially recipes!) But I felt this book was not her best. First of all, the same themes repeat themselves over and over again - Goldie's life is falling apart. In this case, the improbable issue of not being able to use her home kitchen for catering because of inadequate drains is just absurd. It's painted as a financial problem and then, miraculously, with no new influx of cash, husband Tom takes a couple of days off from work and fixes the problem! Why did he take so long - was he enjoying washing the dishes in the bathtub? And if Goldie is so short of cash, why not take out a loan from her best friend, Marla, who is loaded? Then, protective police husband Tom is not concerned that Goldie drives around Colorado in snow storms with bald tires - ? And then, after an accident, just says &quot;be careful&quot; when she goes out again? This is so unrealistic and unbelievable that I laughed out loud. The plot was silly and contrived - more than usual, and there is nothing new with Arch - same old stuff - and Goldie has no new ways of handling him either - and I'm confused about the time frame - they act like it's years since Arch's dad &quot;The Jerk&quot; got incarcerated but has Arch gotten any older in this time? Even the recipes didn't excite me as much. Come on, Diane, you can do better!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"What can I say? Typical Diane Mott Davidson, WONDERFUL! I love all her books and this one ranks up there as one of my favorites. The price is worth the recipies alone! Don't delay, buy this book today!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have to say that I loved the beginning books of the Goldie series, but have found the last few completely lacking. The one thing that bothers me the most is that althought it has been over ten years since her first book, &quot;Catering to No One&quot;, no one in Goldie's books has aged. In this particular book,she seems to have forgotten traits of the major characters. For example Marla (who is the best part of this series) a woman who has previously eschewed anytime of exercise is found skiing like an expert. Within the book she seems to forget the story line. For the first half of the book Goldie bemoans the closing of her kitchen because she can't afford the drains. Yet later, with no appparent influx of cash, the drain miraculously appear.I suspect Ms. Davidson is working with a publisher who cares more about churning out the books then the quality of them. I hope that Ms. Davidson returns to the quality of her earlier books. Until then, I will be taking them out of the library rather than paying for them."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I would just like to say that this is a very good book. I have read all of the authors books and this is just one more great one. I thought the ending was very good and the book well planned, thought out and very descriptive. The other reviewers who don't like it simply don't know a good book when they read one, or a good recipe for that matter, her recipies in the book are just as good as the others!! (The cookies are to die for!)"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this, the latest in the adventures of Goldy the caterer. I had a little trouble keeping all the characters straight in the beginning, but they soon sorted themselves out. Several mysteries are expertly woven together and culminate in a smashing ending. The recipes, as always, sound wonderful. I haven't tried them yet but plan to do so soon. The Orange Marmalade Muffins sound especially good. I can hardly wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Goldie is truly a tough cookie. These stories are exciting and true mysteries. It's not hard to get caught up in the storyline and not wanting to stories to end so quickly.I would definitely recommend every one of the Goldy Bear Culinary Mysteries!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Really enjoyed the book ! Would recommend this book to all my friends and my Daughters ! I have read 8 of Diana Mott Davidson's books so for and enjoyed ever one of them and I attend to read all of her books !"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Good Story...kept me guessing who. But she repeats herself a lot. When you are a regular reader of her you do not need to hear Goldy's background history every chapter."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I still plan on trying a few of the recipes always included in Diane Mott Davidson's mystery books. Goldy is quite amazing - I know I couldn't prepare as many recipes in what appears such a short time. This is what makes the book enjoyable and, of course, a piece of fiction."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"arrived in timely manner, good condition, just as advertised. Hopefully mom will enjoy it after Christmas. She has read several in the series."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I feel like I'm transported to Colorado because of the wonderful descriptions of the hills, trees, weather, etc. I can smell the pine trees and hear the icy wind sweeping off the mountains. I'm inspired to get back in the kitchen and try come new recipies! The characters are believable, although I'd like to kick several of them. The twists and turns of the plot remind me of those mountains roads...very tricky."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I loved the concept of Goldy hosting a cooking show. I also loved the idea of her getting some distance from Aspen Meadow. The cooking show didn't play as well as I had hoped, but the distance and exposure to new people seemed to breath some much needed life into Goldy. The mystery kept me guessing and the recipes were mouth-watering (mmm, Mexican Egg Rolls with Spicy Guacamole Dipping Sauce.) The last, inevitable, fleeing from the killer scene has stuck with me and seemed painfully realistic, but was written in a way that would have been better suited for screen than print. So much action is such a short period of time combined with the inner emotional turmoil took a lot of visualization to understand. I'd have to rate Touch Cookie a high three, not quite a four."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I discovered Diane Mott Davidson with this book and was so glad I did. I immediately went backward and read the rest of the series, and I'm still reading forward, moving toward her latest PB release Dark Tort. I highly recommend this series. Goldy is a caterer and a sleuth. Each mystery tale comes with a delicious list of recipes (prepared by Goldy during the course of the story). In Tough Cookie, Goldy is temporarily hosting a local TV cooking show when so much goes wrong! Cooking disasters on the set, a blizzard, and then a dead body. She finds it herself and unfortunately for her, it turns out to be her ex-boyfriend. Goldy begins to investigate to determine whether her ex was murdered or not. And it leads to real danger for her. Goldy is married to police investigator Tom in this outing, but in her earlier books, we get a nice build up of their relationship, starting with how they met in her first book, Catering to Nobody. I suggest you start with #1 Catering to Nobody and work your way up to this one and beyond. You'll be glad you did. Delicious!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I love this series of Goldie mysteries...a good combination of great receipes and a good mystery in each"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Love these books.

More important, Goldy has the love and respect of her husband, Police Detective Tom Schultz and her son Arch. On the negative side, Goldy remains upset that the health department closed her successful Goldilock's Catering business due to poor drainage.Tom frantically tries to fix the facility problem before Goldy's business is ruined. To raise some need liquid capital, Goldy plans to sell Tom's antique skis to her ex-boyfriend Doug Portmont, head of the state parole board. Before they complete the transaction, Goldy finds Doug's murdered body on a ski slope. An investigation proves Doug was on the take, making it seem as if Goldy was paying him with the valuable skis to keep her ex behind bars. Refusing to allow The Jerk to damage her, her family or her business Goldy begins her own investigation into the victim's affairs.Do not read this novel on an empty stomach because the mouth-watering recipes will leave readers raiding their refrigerator or traveling to the nearest restaurant. Goldy remains in tiptop fighting form as she confidently finds clues that lead her into more dangerous inquiries. Diane Mott Davidson is the Julia Child of culinary mysteries as she weaves a plot filled with red herrings and delightfully bakes them into her story line, making for a continuity that is shared in other Goldy tales. The audience feels they are sharing a gourmet meal with old friends, as TOUGH COOKIE is actually a victory layer cake.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Once again, the author delivers a delicious mystery entwined with mouth watering recipes!

As she tries to figure out who killed her old boyfriend, she will tempt you with recipes for crab cakes, ginger snaps, oatmeal and of course, chocolate cookies. I couldn't put the book down - except to grab a bite to eat! If you have enjoyed Diane Mott Davidson's other novels, you will certainly love this one. And if you are new to this author, you will want to read more! I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, and who loves to eat!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I have read and enjoyed all the books in the Goldy Schultz series. I find them quite entertaining and relatively easy reading when you don't feel like reading something that would be mind boggling. I also enjoy her recipes and have tried quite a few of them. As far as the story goes, I am amazed, however, at how Goldy can just wander into her kitchen (after just being almost killed by someone, somehow) and whip up a fabulous meal. Better yet, she has a hunk of a husband that is a gourment cooking policemen too!! What a life! But I do think these books are fun. The only comment I would make about this one, is that I would have liked to have seen more participation in the story by her best friend Marla and also more of Julian. I think Tom (the husband) should have had more to do besides cook and work on the plumbing. I am hoping that in her next book her son starts to mature and not be so sullen all the time. If you are looking for a real serious novel, this isn't it. But if you enjoy a fun mystery and some recipes, this is your book! Enjoy! and I am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"After waiting a whole year for this new entry on Davidson's menu, I found myself reading straight though and staying up until I finished Tough Cookie. I found myself relating to Goldy's funk over her teen son's 'growing pains' (Been there. Done that. survived!) and I found myself with heart in throat while reading the descriptions of maneuvering mountain passes in a blizzard.Davidson throws enough curve balls throughout the story to have kept me guessing about the identity of the culprit until the end.If there was one thing I would have liked more it's Tom Schultz. Lovable character, great hubby. And my only big disappointment is having to wait another year until the next entry is released."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"&quot;Tough Cookie&quot; is a great way to be distracted and entertained at the same time. Goldy once again manages to get herself into more trouble and sure she should know better, but if she did, then we wouldn't have a book, would we? Diane's characters again are interesting, complex and for the most part, believable. This time out Goldy is caught up in the murder of an old boyfriend (although they only had three dates) and the previous death of an old friend in an avalanche. The ski setting, Christmas background, and snow, snow, snow, are great assets in this mystery. I have to admit that the killer is easier to pick out in this one, but that's okay; she throws enough red herrings to make you think you're wrong. And the climax is a good one. This would do great on film. I ponder, though, one fellow customer's review who thought Tom Schulz was fat. Did I miss something way back in his introduction. I never got the impression he was fat? Just big---there is a difference! Oh, well, Davidson fans rejoice---it's a solid entry in this entertaining and mouthwatering series!"},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"Normally I'd start a review for a DMD book encouraging readers to read the series in order. After going through the reviews, there seems to be an unusual number of new readers who aren't bothered by a lack of background and many old readers who are bothered by a lack of new material. I still enjoy getting reacquainted with the gang in each book but would agree that there isn't much progress in their lives in this book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. However, it had much to do with the setting - Killdeer resort. We spend lots of time in Summit County and it was great fun identifying the bits and pieces of the various resorts that Davidson borrowed to create her fictional resort. For example, The Bistro restaurant is clearly based on one of my favorite restaurants in Keystone. And, yes, all of the skiing is fun for a skier to read about.The plot is probably more on the 3.5 star range. As usual, DMD assembles a reasonably interesting half dozen new folks and drops enough clues that any one of them could be the bad guy. I echo some of the other reviewers in our frustration with Goldy's underhanded investigative techniques and her inability to stop stupidly putting herself into peril. You'd think she'd learn to listen to Tom."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"This is one culinary mystery series that ages well. Diane Mott Davidson has always had the perfect recipe for mystery and mayhem, and this one is no exception. My growling stomach and scratched head are testaments that the menus will make you go &quot;mmmm, &quot; and the mystery will make you go &quot;hmmm.&quot;Goldy Schulz's catering business is temporarily out of service due to plumbing problems, and she is trying to find ways to make enough money to get it running again. She hosts a PBS cooking show and attempts to sell a rare pair of skies. When the buyer of the skies is found dead, the circumstances do not look good for Goldy, but with the PBS taping at Killdeer Ski Resort, Goldy is able to do a little skiing and a lot of snooping to solve who really wanted her ex-boyfriend, the art critic, dead and why. Goldy's other problem seems to be that everyone is getting wise to her other skill as an amateur sleuth so getting answers to her clues are a bit more difficult this time around.The plot is as cleverly laid out, as are the mouth-watering recipes. The twist and turns are as subtle as Goldy's secret ingredients - just when you've got it - you don't. This ninth episode in Goldy's mystery series shows she is one tough cookie, and &quot;Tough Cookie&quot; is one great read."},{"Title":"Tough Cookie","review":"I read the book and loved every minute of it. As usual, Goldie gets herself deep in trouble and has to work her way out. The book is a fun read.The best part are the recipes. I love to cook and today I made the Chocolate Coma Cookies.

Although, her catering business is at a standstill, Goldy's hosting a PBS cooking show at a posh ski resort in Colorado.As usual, Goldy gets involved with a murder when she finds the body of a skier and one thing leads to another as she puts herself in jeopardy by trying to find the killer. The usual supporting group of characters are also in this story; husband Tom who sounds like the perfect man, reliable best friend Marla, and Goldy's son, Arch who has turned into an annoying teenager.The author kindly provides the recipes for all of the delicious sounding foods that are mentioned in the book.

For once a heroine who is not tall and thin (well okay, she is blonde!) What fun this mystery was to read. A chef fallen on hard times, finding a new way to pursue her talents, and try to keep her real dream career from going down the drain (if only she had drains!) The recipes were so tempting, which is one reason our book club (Bunny's Book Club) selected this for our end of year book. We have a dinner and use recipes and/or foods from some of the books we've read as a theme, and this book was just too mouth watering not too give it a &quot;taste&quot;.

The Bridge of San Luis Rey is an equally lovely, mythologizing treatment of a place as exotic to him as to his readers - colonial Peru.

After one reading, I confess I have not grasped all the meanings and subtleties which I know are present (This book definitely goes no my re-reading or &quot;keeper&quot; shelf).

Wilder richly deserved the Pulitzer that this book earned. Short, at 133 pages in this edition, it is uniformly excellent. Wilder's sharp wit and turn of phrase are unmatched. The book's theme is powerful and resolved in an unexpected and profound way. Brother Juniper, a thoughtful friar, witnesses the collapse of a rope bridge over a gorge in rural Peru in 1714 and the death of the five people walking along it. He views this event as an opportunity to prove the existence of god and, finally, to elevate theology to the rank of the hard sciences. Juniper instinctively believes that there must be a divine reason for those five to have been chosen for death. He senses god's powerful, latent hand in the bridge's collapse and commits himself to learning all there is to know about the victims in order to discern the plan and prove god's existence. Who were the victims? What were their lives like? Why did they die?Juniper's conclusions are, of course, inconclusive. He never found the pattern, but remained convinced that it was there, just that he was too poor an intellect to see it. Such questions, naturally, were anathema to the church of the age and Juniper and his book were destroyed for heresy. Readers who focus on the same questions as Juniper are doomed to be just as frustrated. Wilder is far too insightful to let Juniper have the last word, for ultimately, it is not Juniper who stumbles upon the meaning of the five deaths, but the survivors -those who loved the victims- as well as the reader. What the five had in common was that they were human beings, with tender sides and flaws and significant unrequited loves. There is nothing remarkable here, we are all built that way. After their deaths, the Abbess whose orphanage was home to two of the victims realizes that the meaning lies in the lives themselves, in the love the victims shared with those near to them. That there is no immortality, not even memory or good works, so that what matters is the fleeting existence of goodness, and therein lies god's grace. Love is a powerful and immediate force, not a point for theological debate. \\"Many who have spent a lifetime in passion can tell us less of love than the child that lost a dog yesterday.\\"Wilder's prose is smooth and polished and yielding of aphorisms: the six attributes of the adventurer (a memory for names and faces, the gift of tongues, inexhaustible invention, secrecy, a talent for chatting with strangers, and a freedom from conscience); or an observation that \\"the public for which masterpieces are intended is not on this earth.\\" Every line is adept, every page a wonder.While Wilder wrote the book in 1927, it is perhaps a perfect inquiry into 17th century baroque worldviews and the rationalist philosophies they spawned. The baroque had reached Spain, if not Peru, by 1714. Its fascination with death and the brevity of life (\\"carpe diem\\" and countless reminders of the inevitabiity of death) resound her, as do its emphasis on vanity, and theater as a metaphor for life. Lima's theatre, its actresses and audiences, are central to the book. And it is only when the beautiful actress is struck by tragedies that she reaches her resolution in grace. Juniper himself embodies that strange blend of baroque scientific materialism and divine idealism of an age in which Descartes could prove the existence of god while Newton demonstrated god's machinery in motion.Wilder's solution is much more satisfying than Descartes' or Juniper's. Wilder may have been baroque in his cynicism, but he was decidedly 20th century american in his hopefulness. \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" is a stunning book."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"A short, sweet novel. Greater minds than mine awarded it a Pulitzer Prize, so I won't blabber on about its quality. Wilder wastes few words, inserts no extra padding, to tell his story. This lacks the action sequences and suspense of Tom Clancyish pulp, but does sneak up on the intellect, leaving the reader expectantly looking for the subtle connections that weave the characters together.The manifest story is simple. Five people have fallen to their death in Peru, and Brother Juniper seeks to prove the goodness of God by evaluating their lives to demonstrate exactly why bad things happen. Gently satirical, Wilder consigns poor Brother Juniper to a fitting end, for the chutzpah of attempting to decipher the mind of God with a moral calculus. Juniper has forgotten his Master's admonition, to \\"judge not.\\" Hidden from Juniper's attempt to make sense of tragedy lay connections that he could never imagine, longings, love unrequited, and loneliness unimaginable. In the end, we learn, not WHY bad things happen, but the power and beauty that can rise from the ashes of tragedy.Wilder tells snippets of stories, weaving lives together, in a way that goes unnoticed at first, then becomes subliminal, and finally explodes into consciousness at the end. While these lives and their interconnections are somewhat contrived, they effect a transformation, both of the story-line and the reader by the end of the book. Well worth reading a second time.&lt;P..."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel takes on the daunting task of exploring whether or not there is a plan behind why we live and die - and how. The debate rages around the incident of the Bridge of San Luis Rey snapping one day, sending five people plummeting to their deaths. Brother Juniper, a Franciscan missionary, witnesses the tragedy and determines to make it the test case in an experiment he has long sought to complete: to prove that the victims were either impious and therefore punished or pious and therefore being whisked away to Heaven to stand beside God. It is a radical study in his time, and its inherent questioning into the nature of the world will ultimately see Brother Juniper mislabeled as a heretic by the church.The character studies that make up the bulk of the novel (which is really more of a novella given its brevity) are uniformly intriguing, and it is there that \\"Bridge\\" truly shines, in addition to Wilder's superb use of language. His portrait of the Marquesa, her servant Pepita, Esteban and his twin brother Manuel, and the Perichole are awe-inspiring glimpses into lives that feel full and true to life - an even greater achievement considering the short amount of time Wilder spends on each of them in order to move the plot forward. If it is more difficult to get a handle on other characters like the Archbishop, the viceroy, Jaime, and the enigmatic Uncle Pio we can forgive Wilder because they still fit the larger scheme of the novel and add to its compelling plot. What emerges from their intertwining lives is the realization that human lives are often too complex to be accurately affixed with such extreme labels as \`good' or \`bad'. Each has marks for them and against them, making an experiment like Brother Juniper's impossible to complete. There are too many shades of grey to see things as black and white as the missionary would like them to be.In addition to this main theme, Wilder expertly weaves in questions regarding love, family, and faith. And while I greatly appreciate his refusal to come to any definite answer, one does wish that Wilder had put more into his presentation. In his exploration of this tragic event and its implications he does little more than present evidence for the reader to interpret as they see fit, and the problem there is that they will come away with whatever preconceived notions they may have had regarding the subject perfectly intact. Wilder brings no new insights to the central question and he makes no poignant arguments for either side. \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" is, then, essentially a test case for the reader to apply their own theories to. There will be no earth-shattering revelations to make them reconsider their position, and as good as the novel is in all other respects, I wish that the debate as Wilder presented it had more meat. It certainly isn't lacking in substance, but just a touch more flavor would have been greatly appreciated.Still, I would highly recommend this book to any lover of literature and anyone who is trying to find their own answers to the question it poses. Wilder's novel takes on additional significance in the wake of 9/11 that makes it even more relevant to modern readers. To read that \\"The bridge seemed to be among the things that last forever; it was unthinkable that it should break\\" is to revisit the stunned disbelief that has permeated the years since that tragedy.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The hardest books to review are your favorites. This is my fifth attempt on this one.The Bridge of San Luis Rey concerns one of the primary questions of human existance. Does God have a plan for our deaths and is there a reason we die? (Pretend that was only one question.) This novel is certainly the best to explore the topic. It is vastly insightful and gives its insight within a powerful narrative.The novel begins with the collapse of the bridge of San Luis Rey which kills the five people crossing it. Brother Juniper witnesses the catastrophe, and he decides to use this opportunity to study the reasons for death. What follows is the story of each of the persons' lives who died. In each story you find a connecting bond: love. Each had been touched by love. The stories together reaveal simply that. Everyones' life matters because of love, and the dead are still connected to the living by a bridge of love.What I've written about the novel is really too simplistic. The Bridge of San Luis Rey is only a very short novel, but within those pages is a multitude of insight which cannot be explained in a short review (especially without giving away too much of the book). I think that I'll just conclude this rambling review by saying that this is a beautiful little novel which deserves a place among the very top novels of last century. I also think that in wake of the Sept. 11 tragedy, The Bridge of San Luis Rey could gain importance by giving the people affected insight into the tragedy and comfort them."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"If you have ever wondered what would have happened had you left your house a few minutes earlier this is a book for you. Would the day have been different? Or would your life have been different? Maybe not, but in our minds we make connections about coincidences all the time. The beauty of this book is that it attempts to get at the heart of connections and why a particular group of people happen to all be on a bridge at the time it collapses. The best part of the book is the monk going in search of the people's past because -- being a man who believes in predetermination -- he wonders if indeed the people were fated to be on the bridge at that moment. Those who call this book boring simply don't get it. And those who call it unrealsitic don't have much of an imagination. This book is fiction at it's best because it has the ability to make us actively think about the connections in our lives. And amazingly for all that heady stuff it can be read in one day!"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Perhaps better known as a playwright (OUR TOWN and THE MATHCMAKER), Thornton Wilder presented a fast-paced world with a stately novella which proceeds at its own tempo--oblivious of modern demands for mindless action and soulless dialogue. Required high school reading as far back as the 60's, BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY still exerts its ingenuous literary charm upon thoughtful readers. Our throw-away society begrudges spending time to consider the deeper questions of life. The Why's of our existence--or mass disaster--prove too mentally stressful to validate such effort.Conscientious Brother Juniper undertakes an exhaustive examination of the lives of five persons. Although their curiously interrelated lives are not apparent at first, they all died simultaneously while crossing an ancient rope bridge in 18th century Peru. So why should we concern ourselves with the conicidence and obscure destiny of non English-speaking people 200 years ago? Determined to prove to himself (not to mention to atheists and skeptics) that a divine hand masterminded (or simply permitted) the sudden death of five travelers, the earnest friar struggles to juxtapose these ageless questions re the role of God in human life. Is fate merely indifferent to our petty struggles for fame, power and self-esteem? Were these five singled out because of the way they had lived? Were they being punished or rewaded for their earthly sojourns? Or was the fatal unraveling of the rope but a regretful mechanical catastrophe?Wilder's theatrical experience is revealed in several sections of this novella--where we discern true Scenes and Acts. In fact, he permits increasingly long dialogues between his prime characters in successive chapters. Even his secondary charaters possess remarkable qualities as supporting actors, who appear in several lives. If the bridge which spans the chasm (a metaphor for Life or perhaps Ignorance?) parts without warning, which two landmarks of mortal existence cease to be connected? Individual responses will vary, according to the reader's temperament and moral development.

For him, the accident is an opportunity to show that we are all part of God's intelligent plan, not victims of random, meaningless events. His study of these five lives takes many years to complete and fills volumes. In the end, of course, he falls short of his purpose. But his research shows something else. It shows how God's love is expressed in our world, sometimes through worthy and sometimes through what appear to be unworthy messengers. It also shows that no one is so alienated from God that he cannot be reached. Eventually, Brother Juniper suffers for his pretensions to expose the operations of God's will.Besides its deeply affecting exposition of the theme described above, The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a beautiful evocation of life in 18th century colonial Peru. Thornton Wilder's writing is just exquisite. In one scene, a selfish woman undergoes a transformation and spends the night composing an important letter to her daughter. Before dawn, she goes to the door upon her balcony and looks up \\"at the great tiers of stars that glittered above the Andes. Throughout the night, though there had been few to hear it, the whole sky had been loud with the singing of these constellations.\\"The 1975 Pocket Book (Washington Square Enriched Classics) edition I have includes an interesting reader's supplement with illustrations and notes."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"\\"On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travelers into the gulf below.\\" When Brother Juniper witnesses this tragedy first-hand, he resolves to find in it scientific evidence of God's plan. The randomness of this evident, in Juniper's mind, makes it the perfect laboratory for investigating this question. \\"Here at last one could surprise His intentions in a pure state.\\" Before the victims had even hit the ground, he already plans on investigating their lives. Short, beautiful, and nearly perfect, THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY earned Thornton Wilder the first of his three Pulitzer prizes.The lives of the five victims of the bridge are thoroughly recounted leading up to the moment they all came together to cross the bridge. Brother Juniper came up with his conclusions regarding the tragedy, but ultimately, he was not satisfied with his results. He did, however, realize that he learned least about the victims in question in speaking with those that were close to them. It was these very survivors, however, away from Juniper's questions and after the friar's execution who ultimately did find some answers.I was moved by the final conclusion of the book: that out lives are transient and unremarkable but to those whom we love and who love us, and our very existence dies with those that cared for us. \\"...almost no one remembers Esteban and Pepita but myself... But soon we shall die and all memory of those five will have left the earth, and we ourselves should be loved for awhile and forgotten.

Forstadt"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I came into this book expecting one thing. After the first part, Perhaps an Accident, my expectations had completely altered. As I read through the second part, Marquesa de Montemeyor, my expectations were slowly changing even more. By the beginning of the third part, Esteban, my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable.I came into it expecting a novel about a man of religion's struggle with faith. By the first few pages I came to realize it had much more of a non-fiction lean, at this point I was scared of being bored. As I started to read part two I began to realize it wasn't about this Brother Juniper at all but the people in the accident. Throughout parts of the first chapter I have to admit I did feel bored, but near the end it caught fire and I was wowed by the first part's finish. This reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it, for that's what each part was: a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge.The story of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winner is that a bridge (the finest bridge in all of Peru) snapped and five travelers fell to their death. Brother Jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was God's will. This man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen. Basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life.I would say the way The Bridge of San Luis Rey was written was, generally, not exceptionally appealing to me. It was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events. Using this method though, there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry.The book also seemed slightly tedious at times. Certain sections were difficult to get through but as I pressed on I felt a certain gratification, in knowing that I was being shown snapshots of life that were almost as real as they get.Despite these downfalls (which had their upshots as well), the meaning of the book made it for me. The characters were all taken on spiritual journeys and though each story ended in death, which was a death too early for all of them, there was a certain bittersweet happiness in their soulful accomplishments.In total I would suggest the Bridge of San Luis Rey but only if you're willing to fully concentrate whenever you pick this book up. It can be a beautiful book but only if first acknowledged as a tough book."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"There is not much to The Bridge at San Luis Rey. In the opening chapter the entire premise is undone, telling of one Brother Juniper and his quest to prove God's motive in a terrible accident that claimed five diverse lives. The narration of this part goes on to tell us that Brother Juniper was unsuccessful in his quest and was eventually charged with heresy for this undertaking and burned at the stake. We then go back in time and learn about the distinctive lives of these five victims, both of their lives and their affect on those around them. It is a quite beautiful story, sweet and hopeful at the end, an enduring picture of lives having meaning and, regardless of the abandonment of the story's initial premise, really quite effective and engaging. Four and a half, rounded down because the book a read immediately prior to it was something held very special in my heart."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"'The Bridge of San Luis Rey' is a deceptively simple set of inter-related stories about a handful of people who perish when a primitive bridge collapses in eighteenth century Peru. Sounds dull? Well,.. wrong. Thornton Wilder does a fine job in describing personal angst and hardship of these people; their plight can easily be told in a modern setting. I was especially moved by the one story of a older woman trying to come to terms with the decaying relationship between herself and her daughter. Yet, unsurprisingly, not all the stories affected me personally. Sort of hit-and-miss. But in the end I felt moved by it all; this short book does leave you with the feeling you've read something significant.Bottom line: an uneven but ultimately very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I, as with some of the following reviewers, am a little surprised this beautifully wrought little treasure left some readers cold.

Brother Juniper, a monk who witnesses the disaster and is also fascinated with the idea of scientifically proving God's existence, collects and analyzes the evidence of these victims' lives, hoping to witness God's plan.We then are taken into the lives of the individuals who died on the bridge - who they were, how they lived, and what forces drew them to cross that bridge at that fateful moment. Though seemingly unrelated at first, they are in fact indirectly related to Camila Perichole, a former Peruvian actress.Upon reading, I had initial fears that TBOSLR would depict the predictable 20th century existentialist world, where \\"God's plan\\" is synonymous with \\"panacea\\" and that each of our lives is purposeless. Though I will not reveal the ending, Wilder steeres clear of this conclusion.Wilder's masterful accomplishment rests upon his proficiency in theatre. Limiting himself to only a few short scenes for each character, he perfectly encapsulates their motivations, dreams, fears, and essences. Readers will enjoy the depth of characters enclosed in such a brief novel."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I first encountered this book over 50 years ago when required to read and review it for an advanced high school English class.

Thornton Wilder addresses this question in this short but pungent novel about five victims of a Peruvian bridge collapse in 1714.Whatever the point, it's something Wilder admits is difficult to discern. That stays just as true for those who read \\"The Bridge Of San Luis Rey\\" as for those who don't. Wilder writes from a perspective of faith, but at the same time doesn't try to offer any firm conclusions. He even disparages the efforts of a priest in the novel who tries. I think it's this gentle give-and-take in the undergirding philosophy that gives \\"Bridge\\" the right amount of play for readers today to handle - a sense of being directed without ever being led.The novel breaks down into three short stories, each dealing with one or two of the five victims, along with a brief prelude and postscript concerned with the efforts of Brother Juniper to answer the question: Why them? The stories don't make clear until their endings who are the victims and who are the survivors, except that the latter are often victims of the bridge's collapse in their own longer-lasting way, left as they are with memories of people they loved and didn't value enough when alive. It's all more than a bit depressing and sobering in much the same way as Wilder's famous play \\"Our Town.\\"Two of the stories, of an aging widow who is the subject of much mockery in her own time but proves a legend for generations to come, and of a court operator who comes to grief from the one person he comes to love, are quite affecting, more so for the way Wilder writes of them, in a kind of inexact way that has the quality of a hazy myth. The third story, about two twins and their own separate grief at the hands of love, feels less essential to me. Maybe this was Wilder's way of injecting himself into the story, as Wikipedia indicates his own story was much like that of the twins.For me, the weakness of \\"Bridge\\" is the feeling at times of plowing through a field of worthy epigrams stitched together by characters and plots that are by themselves not especially engaging. \\"Time keeps going by,\\" one character says, ironically just before it is about to end for him. \\"You'll be surprised at the way time passes.\\" Wilder's gift for capturing deep insights in a sentence or two is never in doubt; I just found myself not caring as much as I wished.But the novel does work its way to a point of sorts, a fittingly fuzzy one that nevertheless offers more of a sense of hope, and perhaps Hope, rather than doubt. That I liked and admired. It was no easy thing to write such a novel in the 20th century, that this one won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928 probably had something to do the way it pushes so bravely against the current of literary opinion of its time.Give it points also for getting across a deep story within a short number of pages. A longer novel that took more time fleshing out its characters and setting might have made it better but more easily could have spoiled its lasting interest. You come to this book with your own ideas of life and the destination you end up reaching has more to do with you than him. Wilder seemed to have been comfortable with that result, and there's a sense of grace in that if nothing else."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"We all have a worldview (don't we?) which influences just about everything we encounter. Literature is no exception. Perhaps that is why I thought the main point of Thornton Wilder's outstanding The Bridge of San Luis Rey was so obvious.In many of the reviews I've read, people have stated that Wilder leaves the main conclusion up to the reader. I must disagree. The final line, so quoted by many of the reviewers, makes it all very clear to me. \\"All those impulses of love return to the love that made them.\\" Perhaps, had Wilder capitalized the second \\"love\\" more would have drawn the same conclusion as I. That love is, of course, the love of the Father.This short book is rooted in Christian realism -- summed up in that final page. Life and God's ways as they pertain to life, are a mystery to the believer. Seemingly saintly people die far too early in inexplicable circumstances-- a bridge that has lasted for centuries one day breaks under the weight of an old woman, a cripple, an old man, a young girl, and a young man. But the \\"why\\" is not for us to know. We all must live in the comfort that it is His will that reigns, not ours, and that the love which sustained us in this life will see us to the next.Perhaps Brother Juniper found his answer. I know I recognized mine."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The book has not suffered from time or from an idiot technicolor movie with a cast of excellent actors and directors who felt it necessary to revise the novel.The book is a stylistic masterpiece. The pacing is perfect and the point of view is instructive.The introduction and after-word are useful as well.Read the book; skip the movie."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This novel, perhaps more than any other in the history of American literature, asks \\"Can bad things really happen to good people?\\" On one day in 1714, the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, sending five people falling to their deaths. Brother Juniper, one of the witnesses to the tragedy, seeks to explain how and why this could have happened. The bulk of the novel, a concerted effort on the part of Juniper to justify the ways of God to man, is a carefully woven portrait of their interconnecting and overlapping lives, loves, successes and failures leading up to the day of the bridge collapsing.The Marquesa de Montemayor, whose daughter treats her with supreme indifference, has just seen her move away to marry her husband, a Spanish Viceroy. She copes mainly by writing beautiful, elaborate letters to her daughter and son-in-law. The Marquesa becomes reclusive and introspective, and asks the local Abbess and proprietress of an orphanage for the company of one of her girls. Pepita comes to live with her and provide much-needed companionship. On learning that her daughter is pregnant, the Marquesa makes a visit to the shrine at Santa Maria de Cluxambuqua. On her return to Lima, accompanied by Pepita, we learn that they are killed on the bridge. We later learn through Brother Juniper that the letters she wrote are gems of the Spanish language and are canonized and anthologized for schoolchildren to learn ages and ages hence.Another story revolves around two twins named Manuel and Esteban (Wilder himself was a twin whose brother died in childbirth) who, also under the protection of the same local Abbess, grow up to become scribes. Soon Manuel is taken in to compose letters for the extraordinarily talented stage talent who goes by only \\"the Perichole,\\" who is in romantic cahoots with both the Spanish Viceroy and a local bullfighter (see Offenbach's eponymous opera, as well as the short story by Prosper Merimee). After Manuel dies of an infection, Esteban is enlisted to assist one Captain Alvarado on a long voyage, partially in order to pay for a present for the Abbess. On the way to buy the present, Esteban crosses the Bridge of San Luis Rey and his fate befalls him.Uncle Pio, the Perichole's assistant, maid, and general counselor, has an interesting life of his own. Growing up as a diplomat, theater impresario, and Catholic shill during the Inquisition, he finds Micaela Villegas (see the historical personage of the same name, whom Wilder has only slightly fictionalized here), whom he trains and refashions in his own image, turning her into the best-known Peruvian actress of her time. After having become thoroughly disillusioned with the theatre and her success, she wishes to enter into proper society and wishes to never talk to Uncle Pio again. After some hesitation, the Perichole allows Pio to take her son and give the curious boy the proper education that he deserves. Leaving the next morning, they are the last two victims of the bridge.Looking for one common thread to tie all of these disparate lives together, the reader is drawn over and over again to fact that they all see confounded by their personal searches for love and meaning. As much money or success they attain, we see lives beguiled by angst and beset by circumstance. By no means, and Brother Juniper would certainly have noted this in his book, do we find people who \\"deserved\\" to die.But the Bridge of San Luis Rey has a sixth victim, one who didn't fall hundreds of feet into the ravine below: Brother Juniper himself. Having written his book full of the most diligent and ingenuous research in an attempt to find out why God would let this happen (was it punishment for evil? Or was God just indifferent to human suffering?), the Catholic Church finds his book heresy and they burn him for it. What was so heretical? Perhaps that he would be so presumptuous as to explain God's plan for the world.As far as the form and structure of the novel are concerned, the first and last chapters, the only places where Wilder allows himself philosophical divulgence, are a little too cordoned-off for my taste, rendering the deeply resounding questions of theology and meaning merely peripheral. I feel that interlarding them into the lives of the five characters would probably have better achieved what was most likely one of his goals in the first place - to meditate on questions of fate, free will, chance, and mortality. Finally, while to pen, at the age of thirty, a novel this succinct and full of impact is an accomplishment in itself, I feel that tripling or even quadrupling the size of the book would have made the characters more realistic. But if that were the case, of course, it would not have the wonderful quality of being told to you as a griot would tell it, as the scintillating moral fable it is."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is Thornton Wilder's most famous novel and rivals his play Our Town as his most famous work. It is certainly his prose masterpiece and, though it does not belong with the truly greatest novels, is excellent overall and exemplary in many respects.The central idea is brilliant, perhaps the best out of the hundreds or thousands of books I have read in terms of plot and otherwise - a bridge collapses, killing everyone on it and leading an onlooker to investigate their lives for some kind of divine meaning behind it. The book is thus not a novel in the usual sense so much as a series of interlocking short stories. The stories are very good in themselves - interesting and extremely readable; they could stand alone with slightly altered endings. Characterization is strong, but some may be dismayed by how the stories end just as we begin to make a truly emotional connection - but this is after all the point. The characters were all at an important point in their lives when the bridge fell, perhaps even life-changing ones, but their plans were cut unexpectedly and tragically short. Perhaps they would have succeeded; perhaps not. The point is that they - and hence we - will never know; the transition is deliberately jerky in order to let us feel the magnitude of this, the sadness of what could have been.However, Wilder's artistry truly comes into play when he makes them all mesh in the central conceit; his execution is seamlessly deft. It is a remarkable technical feat and interesting enough in itself to carry a book, but its highly thought-provoking nature is the real strength. One can only wonder why such tragedies happen; is it simply chance - bad luck, if you will - the inevitable statistical result of a universe without a benevolent god or any other controlling force sympathetic to humanity? This might be the expected conclusion of a twentieth century novel, but Wilder - dubbed an unfashionable optimist by one critic - is significantly more ambiguous. He cleverly makes the observer a religious figure understandably determined to see God's Providence. Despite diligent striving and sincere faith, he cannot do so to his satisfaction, and he is to a large extent a figure of ridicule. However, Brother Juniper is also sympathetic in being truly genuine and honestly searching, and he certainly does not deserve his punishment; his narrow-minded and unfair execution is another shot at religion, but it would be wrong to put the novel with the great agnostic/atheist works. Wilder deliberately leaves the question open; Juniper may have been nave, but there is no proof that he was wrong. Other characters in any case take solace in love's redemptive power, which is depicted as stronger than death - sufficient for meaning in life and continued optimism regardless of Providence's existence or non-existence. This common secular conclusion may disappoint the religious but has rarely, if ever, been put forth so movingly and powerfully. The book's final paragraph is one of the most beautifully lyrical and sublimely poignant ever written - so great that the book is worth reading for it alone and would be worth the wait even if one liked nothing before it. Whether we agree or disagree with the conclusion, its thought-provoking nature is notable, and the final paragraph will stay with us for a long time - likely forever.This brings up another of the book's great strengths - remarkable prose. Wilder writes with incredible beauty and precision, somehow managing to reach great poetic heights and infuse considerable meaning in under two hundred pages. This has some of the loveliest writing to be found anywhere as well as vivid characterization, detailed historical narration that makes an unfamiliar world seem truly alive, and even strong, well-done elements of diverse styles such as satire.All told, while missing the indefinable something characteristic of the greatest novels, this is an excellent one with wide appeal, and anyone who likes classic literature should check it out."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The story takes place in South America in the 1700s, as five people die when a rope bridge fails and they fall to their deaths.

I believe people just feel they have to love and praise the \\"classics\\" no matter what. I found the book dull and unsatisfying. I'm so glad it was a short book.

There seemed to be no real conclusion, which I thought was the goal of the monk's research into these people's lives. While it was certainly a good book, I don't think it was &quot;pulitzer prize, e.g. the best book of the year (but then I wasn't reading back then)&quot;. The characters were only partly developed, I kept wondering what each of them was like."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The premise is frequently discussed in the other reviews. The execution on this premise is so-so. The characters he chooses are all very depressed people with calamitous lives that touch upon one another. The book is seriously depressing. In addition, the pace is at times glacially slow. It was difficult to finish. The one saving grace is that here and there Wilder writes an utterly brilliant passage. But invariably these passages are set in such dark and uninteresting contexts that you wonder if they weren't penned separately and sort of forced into the story at specific junctures.But even for these passages the dullness and moroseness of the characters' stories hardly makes reading this book worthwhile. I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This book is a 1928 Pulitzer Prize winning novel that may have been a breakthrough for its time. As I read it I could not help but wonder how this content would have fared in the hands of \\"Boom\\" writers such as Octavio Paz or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Had I read this before I read the South American Boom writers I might have had more appreciation for it.I checked Wilder's bio and could not find any time spent in Peru or South America prior to (or after) writing the book unless it was during his Coast Guard service. Perhaps its weakness is fundamental: that it is an impression of rather than the actual experience of Latin America. At the time it was written, it may be the closest English speaking readers could get to this type of cross-cultural literary experience. Now readers have a variety of authentic voices to chose from.Wilder has created a good book, but is not a great book. I understand that it is on some lists as a great American classic. I recommend that those who compile these lists try some of the late twentieth century Latin American writers."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This book was way overrated.

It must have been a slow year for writing if this won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Overall a nicely written, and easily read book, of the type that is good to take on a plane trip: could be finished in one 5-hour flight. The plot is given by other reviews here, but the conclusions are uncertain - and what do you expect? These are the questions we grapple with for most of our lives - usually without an answer. Apparently, brother Juniper concluded that the five people who died on the bridge did so by coincidence - but was it, really? For three out of five, death coincided with either lost love, or a determination to reacquire one. The two poor children got there somehow; their stories are not completely developed. The most beautiful short passage is in the end of the book: the people are dead, and soon even the memory of them will be gone - but they have loved, and this was enough. It sounds romantic, but I don't think it is - the love was fraternal or parental - including Uncle Pio's, although he was not Camella's \\"biological\\" father. There are better books to read, but this one is fairly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I had not read this book in 20 years and really enjoyed reading it again."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"One of the great spiritual conundrums we all face is why one person dies while another lives.

For while we may not be able to explain why these lives ended so abruptly, or whether God even played a role in their fate, we see that each led a unique, special existence. In the end, the moral of this story is abundantly clear - that life is short and must be cherished."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books. I remember after first reading the book that it did not strike me as a particularly good book. It just seemed okay. but after putting it down I found that it stayed with me much more than any other book I've read.And that's the subtle beauty of this work. Like most of Wilder's early material, this is not a plot-driven book at all, but rather is a philosophical exploration veiled in story. Now there is enough plot to keep people turning the pages if they are being forced to read the book, but the story is never the point.The novel begins with a bridge collapsing in Lima, Peru in 1714. Five people die in this collapse and a monk goes about collecting all the information he can about these people so that he can prove definitively that this apparent tragedy actually furthered God's plan for the world. The bulk of the novel is taken from his studies and allows the readers to glimpse several very memorable characters and their lives.Now the characters are not particularly likable, at least at first, but the majority of the time, we see a transformation in their characters.Wilder once commented that this novel was about the \\"sufficiency of love\\" and that certainly shows through. His writing exhibits something of a dispassionate beauty that is truly his own, and the novel's form itself is enough to attract interest. All that being said, this novel would not be a bestseller today and will most likely not appeal to the average reader. But for those who are looking for a particularly heady novel (balanced by its brevity) should definitely pick up this book. And those who have to read it? Just give it time: it gets better with age."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I sense that Thornton Wilder's THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY is no longer fashionable in literary circles. The literati of today are too hip, edgy, jaded, and ironic - too self-conscious -- to acknowledge the merits of a novella that lyrically poses profound questions of human existence and ends up with a homily about love. Have we as a culture or a species moved beyond THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY? I fear that we have, but hope that we haven't.The novella begins: \\"On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travellers into the gulf below.\\" A Franciscan, Brother Juniper, becomes obsessed with the question, \\"Why those five?\\" He reasons, \\"Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we live by plan and die by plan.\\" His faith predisposes him to the latter, but imbued with the hubris of rationalism he also believes the question \\"Why those five?\\" surely must have a mathematical, scientific, sensible answer. So he resolves to study the private lives of the five who were plunged into the gorge in order to \\"surprise the reason of their taking off\\", to ascertain why them. After six years of research Brother Juniper published an enormous book, but it was pronounced heretical and the Inquisition ordered that both it and its author be burned in the Square. It is left to Madre Mar&iacute;a del Pilar, the Abbess of the Convent of Santa Mar&iacute;a de las Rosas, to divine, at the novella's end, \\"the only survival, the only meaning\\" of life.THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY is an extended parable. Regardless of whether or not it ends up communicating a lesson a reader can take to heart, the book is worth reading for the intricate way the tale is constructed and for Wilder's rich prose, which is both aloof and intimate in its intellectual sensuousity. It is quite an achievement by an author who was then only thirty.* * * * *I once met Thornton Wilder, briefly, when I was a laborer doing work at his house. He was a consummate gentleman.

It begins with the collapse of the eponymous bridge (an Incan relic); five individuals fell to their death as a result and a local priest who witnessed the event subsequently investigates the lives of these five individuals in an attempt to make sense of the tragedy. The life stories of these five people are described in artful and artistic prose; many a line or description begs to be read aloud, some simply for their musicality and lyric qualities and some for the magnitude of the seemingly-simple truths they espouse.A few of my favorite examples:- \\"Like all the cultivated he believed that only the widely read could be said to know that they were unhappy.\\"- \\"Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we live by plan and die by plan. Some say that we shall never know and that to the gods we are like the flies that the boys kill on a summer day, and some say, on the contrary, that the very sparrows do not lose a feather that has not been brushed away by the finger of God.\\"- \\"Now he discovered that secret from which one never quite recovers, that even in the most perfect love one person loves less profoundly than the other.

A Catholic Friar named Brother Juniper witnesses the tragedy as he was about to cross the 100-year old bridge when it collapsed, killing all that were aboard. Brother Juniper then sets out to learn all he can about the lives of the five victims. He also seeks to determine whether their tragic end derived from luck, fate, or devine ordination. Together with Brother Juniper we come to know and care about the five victims (Dona Maria & Pepita, Estaban, Uncle Pio & Jaime). Clearly there are parallels in these pages to the tragic hand of fate that sometimes strikes people we know, leading so many of us to ask why? Ironically, Brother Juniper's six-year quest about the tragic causation leads to his own demise as a heretic.We read this book as high school freshman and liked it's easy-reading style. I remember enjoying the book's presentation of life in Colonial South America, but as a teen not entirely understanding its examination of those dark questions about fate, luck and tragedy. Some readers praise this novel as masterful; others find it more worthy than outstanding. Whatever your view, the author never quite answers the central question with iron-clad certainly. But then, what human ever has?"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"A classic novella, written with exemplary simplicity and grace. An Inca footbridge suspended over a canyon in Peru collapses in 1714, killing five people who were crossing at the time: an elderly Marquesa, her sweetly unassuming orphan maid, a young man of many skills mourning the recent death of his twin brother, an aging Svengali with his fingers in every pie, and the illegitimate son of the Viceroy. A contemporary monk investigates their lives in an attempt to discern the hand of God in the event, whether as a punishment for wrongdoing or an early welcome into heaven. Following in his footsteps, Wilder emphasizes rather the interconnectedness of their lives and their effect on those they leave behind: the Marquesa's daughter (recipient of her beautiful letters), the famous actress Perichole, the Viceroy, a swashbuckling sea captain, and the self-sacrificing Abbess of the convent in Lima. His conclusion: \\"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.\\"Wilder won the Pulitzer Prize for this brief novel in 1928; it is still worth reading today, for its gentle wisdom, which is timeless, and for its style, which combines classic balance with Midwestern common sense. Here he is at his more formal, describing the Marquesa's letters: \\"The Conde delighted in her letters, but he thought that when he had enjoyed the style he had extracted all their richness and intention, missing (as most readers do) the whole purport of literature, which is the notation of the heart. Style is but the faintly contemptible vessel in which the bitter liquid is recommended to the world.\\" And here he is speaking the thoughts of the youngest of the five people killed in the accident, the Viceroy's little boy: \\"Uncle Pio had just overtaken a friend of his, a sea-captain. And just as they got to the bridge he spoke to an old lady who was traveling with a little girl. Uncle Pio said that when they had crossed the bridge they would sit down and rest, but it turned out not to be necessary.\\"Although most of the novel is imaginary, the Perichole and the Viceroy are real people, given their real names. But in fact they lived a half-century later than when Wilder places them. And their son survived, to become one of the signers of the Peruvian Declaration of Independence in 1821."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Ever since man conceptualized the idea of a god, he has been wondering why this god has acted in a certain way, often times in a way that was detrimental to the lives of the god's most ardent believers. Trying to explain why man has to suffer needlessly because of the capriciousness of a deity has been the pursuit of eons of poets, philosophers and theologians - an effort that usually results in either platitudes or the literal and/or figurative throwing up of hands. Perhaps A.E. Housman might have had a clearer vision when he remarked that \\"Malt does more than Milton can to justify God's ways to man.\\" That Thornton Wilder's consideration of this age old question could have been published right in the middle of the debauched 1920s might seen a bit odd, but the overwhelmingly positive reception that The Bridge of San Luis Rey enjoyed (as well as winning the Pulitizer Prize for 1927) clearly shows that the question is truly a timeless one.Given the complexity of the question being considered, Wilder's book is audaciously simple: a short parable that interweaves case histories of the five individuals killed, when the bridge of San Luis Rey fails, with the flawed ruminations of Brother Juniper's scholastic attempt to prove theology an exact science. By setting his novel in 17th century Peru, Wilder gives his story both an exotic background and a historical context, a decision that allows him to create a unique setting, almost medieval in atmosphere, in which the powers of state and church (through the Inquisition) hold complete sway over his characters. Wilder is as careful with his prose as he is with his setting. The three case studies are written as simple parables in a style that is reserved and graceful; these are in contrast to the generally ironic tone of the commentary.Although Brother Juniper tackles his study with the zeal of a PhD sociology student he is not to be trusted: he thinks he sees \\"in the same accident, the wicked visited by destruction and the good called early to Heaven,\\" hardly an earth shattering conclusion. But what the good Brother lacks in scholarly traits, he does make up for it by his descriptions of the three case studies of the Marquesa de Montmayor; the twin, Esteban; and the self styled sophisticate, Uncle Pio. What each of these characters have in common is that all are endowed with the admirable gift of love, although it is the form of love that proves to be their downfall. The Marquesa has an oppressive love for her daughter; Esteban is tormented by the death of his beloved twin, Manuel; and Uncle Pio confuses love for beautiful women and language with a dictatorial control of his ward, the beautiful Camila Perichole. In each case the love that they exhibit is selfish and controlling, not the loving generosity that is required to love humanity truly. It is the Abbess Madre Maria del Pilar who sums up Wilder's thesis - \\"love is the only survial, the only meaning.\\"Despite the artistic strenghts of the novel and the seriousness of the subject, I just could not get into the book, no matter how hard I tried. Perhaps it was Wilder's use of parable to tell his story or perhaps it was the palpable sense of detachment that pervades the novel (the reader gets the feeling that he is looking at a painting rather than reading a novel) that bothered me. Regardless, I finished the novel without much of the positve feelings that many other readers experienced."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder's 1927 masterpiece is a contemplative and delicately mournful work, brilliant in the simple power of its prose. Battling with God, fate, or destiny- particularly the God of the Catholic faith - is a facet that has preoccupied many authors, including Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, and Wilder brings his own unique vision to that individual struggle, viewing it with a mixture of bitterness and faith. He approaches it through the lens of a very human but very haunting question: Why did those people - those people in particular - die? So often throughout the novel it seems that someone else should have died - the close friend or relative or mentor of one of those who fell to their deaths, rather than one of the actual victims. Each of them - a brilliantly intellectual but half-mad matriarch, an intelligent, lonely orphan with a future, a sailor with nothing left to live for, and a old, multi-talented man with the crippled son of a great actress in tow - has reached some sort of turning point in their lives, and is going to make a new beginning. Why then should they die? The book does not provide an answer - not in that way. Rather, Wilder's answer to death, and perhaps in a way to the sacrifices exacted by death or God or whatever he considers the dominant force - is love. \\"Love...the only meaning.\\"The characters are brilliantly drawn and sketched, particularly The Marquesa de Montemayor, a woman risen from peasant stock to become a noblewoman, but whose life is wasted in hungry, desperate longings for a daughter who despises her. From this hunger springs a series of brilliantly witty and profound letters which will be the wonder of every generation after her, while in between the writing of them the Marquesa plunges into drunkenness with the regularity of clockwork. Uncle Pio, similarly, a man born with a knack for life and success and the even rarer knack of loving beauty and talent without hungering for the woman who possesses them, is a character who burns with originality and pathos. These two, along with Esteban, the twin who is inwardly dead, are the three around whom the book is centered, with the other two, the young Pepita and Jaime, acting as supplements to them; the more obscure pair among the quartet of victims. The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a hauntingly beautiful exploration into the meaning of life and of death, full of tenderness and subtle ironies, and reminiscent of both Brideshead Revisited and The Bridges of Madison County in its gentle pathos. Not a book to be missed."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"i have read this book several times over the years. it is a classic. i gave this copy as a gift. book arrived promptly, in good condition."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"An early gift from Thornton Wilder in 1927. Five vignettes. Interconnected biographies. External appearances, internal echoes and guiding questions from the narrator. What makes a life meaningful? The flow through time? Communication? Success? Personal evolution? Character? Giving? Love?? The stories take place in Lima, Peru and reflect the Spanish culture and shadow of the Catholic church. The characters are unusual in their details, but they reflect everyman type experiences. The roles of chance, choice, God and fate are portrayed vividly. This is a quick read, but it leaves a trail of characters, memories, flavors and questions."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Five people are killed when a small bridge breaks in Peru.A priest investigates the lives of the five people to try to understand why these five were killed.Each person has a story and each story is beautifully unexpected.Brilliant."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"An Inca bridge suddenly collapses for no apparent reason, and five people plunge to their deaths. A monk thinks to investigate with the goal of determining whether the deaths of these particular people (out of all the people who had crossed the bridge) were a part of the divine plan or merely random events. And in the end, he is unable to decipher any reason for what has occurred, and winds up being burned to death by the Church for heresy (the rationale for this is not explained) along with his book (there was another copy, however, which survived).Sounds a bit contrived, doesn't it? Especially as Thornton Wilder had never visited Peru where the action is centered, he only did so years later, and is therefore talking about a setting and culture of which he has a second hand understanding at best.As a work of imagination, however, the stories are first rate. The characters' motivations are highly imaginative, a mixture of strength and weakness, and they are dissected in clinical detail. The writing is lovely, not a word wasted, allowing a 100-page narrative to convey more substance than many far longer books. The Pulitzer Prize seems well deserved.What is the conclusion on the divine plan vs. random events question? The closing comment - likening the bridge to the love that connects the lands of the living and the dead - suggests this may be the wrong question. Perhaps the striving and caring in life is more important than the specifics of what human beings do or don't achieve."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Although I am familiar with Thornton Wilder's plays, this is the first novel of his that I have read. I will be reading more! \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" has been turning over and over in my mind since I finished it a few days ago. I still don't know what to fully say about it. Essentially the novel is asking if there is a divine providence in our lives, or is it merely the acts of our own will. I have read reviews that argue vehemently that the book comes decisively down in one camp or the other. I am not sure I agree. I think Mr. Wilder is saying that regardless of whether it is human or divine, love is the central theme that makes life bearable, important, and worth toiling through. Whether the love is divinely or humanly inspired is beside the point. I have to say, I find that idea very uplifting.The style of the text is a little difficult for the casual reader to get into, but once you have read four or so pages you adapt to the manner in which Wilder composed this piece, and it flows very nicely. I read that Wilder worked very hard to make the narrator of the text a detached persona, one not emotionally involved in the story. This works wonderfully for the novel, because the fate that befalls five characters when a bridge collapses and sends them all plummeting to their deaths is delivered with a very dry, matter of fact, and objective sense of the event. The details of their personal lives are revealed to the reader in much the same manner, and a big theme of the novel comes through as a result. The emotions that we feel towards these characters as we get to know more and more about them are constructs of our own personal reactions to them, and they are varied reader to reader because of what we bring to the book ourselves. \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" seems to be saying that human life is valued in the eyes of the individuals who have some emotional connection to it, and that is much more important than trying to place an individual life in the great cosmic scheme of things. The greatest value in our lives is in how we are loved by others seems to be what Wilder is saying in the very ambiguous, and very brilliant, final ten lines of the novel.Or he could be saying something completely different. That is the goal. What we as individual readers bring to this text is what gives it meaning. To that point, this novel is a favorite of two friends of mine, one an avid atheist and hater of religion, and one as devout and evangelical as they come. Again, what we bring to this work seems to define it, and Wilder wanted that to happen.The current edition has a lovely forward by Russell Banks, and some great information about Wilder and his work on the text. Both are helpful in making the experience of reading this novel even richer.\\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" has shoved its way into my top five list. It is perfect for discussion and book clubs. The Pulitzer Prize it won in 1928 was well deserved."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Beautifully written and magically told.

A priest decides this is the perfect opportunity to prove the existence of God, and he begins collecting stories of these five, in order to show that God was involved in their deaths for some reason.This book is a beautiful portrait of a handful of regular people, with moments of shining glory as well as many not-so-shining moments of normalcy as human beings. The descriptions of these people, their thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which they live their lives are clear and carefully layered, and I grew to like all of them very much.

My review:A humble Peruvian friar witnesses a bridge collapse in which five people die. He accomplishes an exhaustive investigation into the lives of the victims, searching for a pattern which would reveal who and why God selects to die. The short novel then takes the reader into the life stories of the five. I don't give away endings, but I will take you to the final \\"moral of the story\\", which is, \\"Love bridges life and death. There are no other bridges.\\" These are deep waters (no pun intended).You can get a detailed recap of the book by reading either of the very nicely done Amazon Spotlight reviews above. There's no point in me retelling it again.Thornton Wilder created beautiful phrases and they are a pleasure to read. The book is thought provoking and I found myself frequently looking for hints of patterns and connections among the victims in the story. Wilder makes his point about love, but it is not a blinding revelation for most of us. (Sadly, I note the presence of that old sure-fire combination . . . boldly proclaim the power of \\"love\\" while decorously diminishing the power and plan of the Living God, and the critics will treat you exceedingly well).So in spite of the window dressing, this book is not about God at all. Rather, it is a humanistic piece.This book contains NO action. That can be ok if there is some element of suspense, heartbreak, comedy (even subtle wit), or other emotional stimulus to make up for it. There isn't. You can read this book in one sitting and your pulse will never move off of a pleasant 70 (unless you fall asleep). The \\"connections\\" among the five victims are cleverly contrived, but I noticed an error in chronology that became a fly in the ointment for me.Wilder's use of words, and his character development and consistency, is pristine.

I am almost halfway through the list and I have read novels I consider masterpieces, great, good, fair, disliked and downright hated.So, just because someone says it is a masterpiece does not mean you have to think it is. I take this approach each and everytime when reading a classic. After all, it is only their opinion versus mine. I am no Yale graduate, but I have read hundreds of novels and would like to think of myself as a well read individual, qualified to give a valid opinion. Try as I might, despite the intriguing story line, Pulitzer prize, and rave reviews, The Bridge of San Luis Rey was a huge disappointment for me.One reason, to be honest, is that I am not huge fan of most stream of conscious novels because I don't they just don't captivate or enthrall or produce sufficient enough emotions inside of me for them to be interesting or memorable. Faulkner is the only author I would consider amazing at the stream of conscious style. I get restless with the jumbled words and fragmented story (mostly lack thereof) because this style of a novel isn't about stories it is about a person's thoughts and sometimes a person's inner thinking is just not that riveting as is the case here.I love great description, moving and fleshed out characters, power, intrigue and solid story lines. This novel has none of those qualities. Perhaps I should be more open and celebrate stories I don't and can't get immersed in but I want to remember a novel to consider it great no matter how fancy and flowery the language might be. The story is about a bridge that collapses in Peru without warning sending five random people to their deaths. It is an accident of corrosion and nature and not of anything done by man. It all happens by pure coincidence. A man from a distant witness this event and becomes obsessed with the lives of those who died in order to determine whether or not they died by chance or divine intervention.Sounds interesting I know. I thought the idea seemed fascinating but it is not. There are chapters dedicated to three of the five characters and a preachy afterwards that spins itself around in circles. It is slightly confusing but that isn't the issue here. My favorite novel, The Sound and the Fury is very confusing and rewarding but this novel is only the former. I found it hard to focus and in the end I felt I knew very little about the people who died and I certainly didn't care about them. And shouldn't I have with such a searching plot line?There were no solid arguments for chance or divine intervention. Just a lot of words and a lot of needless fluff. For me, to consider a novel a masterpiece I at least need to remember it when I am done reading and with this last sentence The Bridge of the San Luis Rey has already faded away from my mind which is busily anticipating the next novel up on the top 100 list which has a better chance than not then being better than this one is.Grade: C-"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The bridge of san luis rey was a great book.

Astonishingly modern, it is hard to believe it was published in 1927! Ideal for any lover of historical novels (or of history itself), Wilder's beautifully crafted tale interweaves the lives and fates of diverse characters and speaks eloquently to the universal human themes of grief, loss, love, friendship, compassion, and man's quest for the secrets of eternity.

Like many readers, I was more acquainted with Thorton Wilder's plays, i.e. The Matchmaker and Our Town, etc... This novel is equally good as his plays. The core question that the book asks is why? Why did the bridge collapse with the specific five people on it? Were their lives conducted in a fashion that warrented death? Or, was death a blessing? Were these five people being rewarded and their souls/spirits being elevated to a godly netherworld? There are so many questions that can be posed as a result of this remarkable novel/novella.It is true that the prose is difficult to read, but if the reader takes his/her time, it is a book that is definately worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a marvelous book, which leaves a ton of room for interpretation and discussion. It is a fictional story about a bridge between Lima and Cuzco, Peru that breaks while five people are traveling across it. The plot focuses on the lives of the five people who die due to the bridge.Some of the book gets a little tedious at times; the lives of several of the people are uneventful and uninteresting. With most of the characters, though, the reader really creates a bond. Many of the protagonists also have common qualities with the reader. To be able to understand and sympathize with the characters really makes the story come alive. As for me, I know what it was like to act, to love, to have a loss, to feel anger or happiness. I had experienced many of the events that took place in the characters lives. This really made me unite with the characters.Thorton Wilder made this book very philosophical; after reading it I got a very good look at life. The question is posed at the beginning- did these five people deserve to die? Did they die merely because they were \\"bad\\" people and the iron hand of G-d came down and punished them? After looking into the character lives, the reader can decide weather by accident they died, or by intention. This question applies to all deaths. Car accidents, plane crashes, or any number of ways that people die; did they deserve it? The unsolvable mystery is discussed in The Bridge of San Luis Rey. And although the topic seems depressing (and it is sort of depressing), it is really satisfactory to be presented the topic in such a remarkable book.Whether I found myself crying or smiling, I enjoyed the book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a quick read and a stir of the mind."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This is a great book, and I have enjoyed reading the reviews also.

The novel explores the lives of the five, which touch each other in subtle ways. The ultimate question asked is whether God \\"planned\\" that this particular five be on the bridge that day to meet their fate. I don't think that question is answered, but a more profound one--whether each person's life is unique and meaningful--is answered with a resounding YES. The unabridged audio version of this book is excellent. Sam Waterston reads clearly and simply, and conveys a tone of respect for each of these diverse lives. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Literary pundits have remarked that the definitive 9-11 novel has yet to be written that captures all of the human experience and themes that day delivered. I'd like to suggest that the novel, in fact, has already been published--in 1927--and that most Americans have actually read it in high school but with the usual Teflon affection that deletes it from memory. This would be Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, which conceives an event that marks just 5 deaths but reverberates through its characters and their land much as 9-11 scars contemporary Americans.The book opens with a fictional event: on the 20th of July 1714, in Peru, a high rope bridge over a gorge, originally constructed by the Incas and used daily with confidence by generations of Spanish settlers, collapses. Those killed while crossing at that moment were a lonely noblewoman, her young servant, a young man about to go out into the world as a seaman, a little boy and his mother's avuncular mentor. In the wake, a Catholic churchman, Brother Juniper, seeks to make religious sense by examining the lives of the dead to ferret out why they were either punished by or called to God. The anonymous 20th century narrator states that what is known of the event, those who died and those they left behind, is known because of Brother Juniper's meticulous records, even if his intentions compare to blaming the tragedies of 9-11 and Katrina on the victims for having been sinners attracting the wrath of God. Between the records of those lives and the narrator's completion of the story, this becomes a powerful statement of what it is to be human, and to restlessly seek love and meaning.To read this now is to be struck by the silky clarity of the prose, the anonymous narrator's ironic distance, and the profundity and universality of its vision."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This book brings together the stories of seemingly unrelated people who all perish on a bridge collapse.

I'm buying it for my high school kids to read and enjoy. And, as it is short, there is a good chance I can get them to read it!"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Set in a mythical, post-medieval Peru, Wilder's novella is one of the simplest, least presumptive stories ever told. It attempts to address the time-worn dilemma: Why do bad things happen to good (or, perhaps, not so good) people? Five travelers plunge to their deaths in a tragic accident, and a local Franciscan, Brother Juniper, seeks to use rationally based methods to resolve this unanswerable question.At the outset, Wilder makes clear that the good brother's investigation is misguided, and his conclusions are ridiculous. \\"He thought he saw in the same accident, the wicked visited by destruction and the good called early to heaven.\\" Nevertheless, we are treated to a trilogy of stories examining the lives of the five victims and those who love them.Each of three stories differs in its portrait of the characters, but all are epigrammatic in style and elegant in tone. My favorite of the three is the first, about the mortifyingly ugly and emotionally distant Marquessa de Montemayor (modeled after the historical Madame de Sevigne, a famous writer), who sends beautiful letters to a daughter who has fled the nest and who will never return a mother's love. A young helper, Pepita, is an orphan placed with the Marquessa to acquire \\"worldly experience\\"; she feels abandoned by the abbess who raised her and longs \\"for the dear presence, the only real thing in her life.\\" Both the Marquessa and her helper are so preoccupied with what they don't have that they recognize all too late the joy of each other's presence.Readers who think Wilder is going to help us discover the solution to the randomness of deaths are trying to find depth in the shallow waters under a collapsed bridge. The \\"point\\" is as simple (and, in some ways, as frustrating) as the book itself: \\"It seemed to be sufficient for Heaven that for a while in Peru a disinterested love had flowered and faded.\\" That is, instead of focusing on the reasons for their deaths, Wilder celebrates their lives--and especially the love that each of the five experienced, however briefly, while they were on earth."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This was the first time I ever read Thornton Wilder. He is master of the written word. While reading the novel I felt as if I could be reading a dramatic play (rather watching one unfold before my eyes).

I won't go on to say how much I loved the ending, I'd have to give a spoiler and I don;t want to ruin this great read for anyone! Let's just say that I could feel the threat of tears at the back and corners of my eyes. The last 3 sentences, I think, are wonderful and leave the reader thinking. It did for me anyway.

I guess i disagree with others who state that it is not the conclusion the book reaches, but rather the stories of the five people before the conclusion. For me, the stories of these people at times did drag, however, Wilder does an excellent job tying it in at the conclusion of the novel. Throughout the book you wonder how Wilder will finish off the novel, proof that it was God's plan to take these five, and until the last 5 pages, you are left wondering. However, i believe if you look back at all five characters and the people they left behind, God's plan is definetly revealed.

It was 1714. It had been made by the Incas with thin slats. A little red-haried Franciscan, Brother Juniper, from Italy did something about the rent in the bridge of San Luis Rey. Brother Juniper wanted to determine why the five people who died had been fated to lose their lives on that bridge. He wanted to experiment, to explain the ways of God to men. He spent six years investigating the lives of the victims.The Marquesa de Montemayor was separated from her daughter, the Condesa, who lived in Spain. She learned her daughter was expecting a child.

It tells of a monk who, after the collapsing of an historic bridge hurtles five people to their deaths, researches the personal lives of the dead and tries to discover if the tragedy was a coincidence or a sheer act of God. The next three, absolutely horrendous chapters, go on to describe the lives of the deceased.

At this point I completely lost interest. Why proceed? Anyone with any life experience already knows what he'll find. NOTHING! No logic,no hidden meaning, no consistant thread! Why did the bridge collapse when they were on it? BECAUSE S--T HAPPENS, THAT'S WHY! No other reason! Who didn't already know this? Why wade through the rest of the book to read a conclusion you can easily predict?Nevertheless, wade through I did. What was revealed was that each person was a typical human being who loved, was loved, had flaws, etc. But didn't we already know this would be the case? His final conclusions about the connections between people and \\"love being the only survival, the only meaning\\" are basically the same inadequate, ultimately unsatisfying conclusions I've heard repeated before in casual discussions. Implied is that nothing is permanent, there is no forever, no certainty of any existence beyond this one. We live, die, are briefly remembered by our loved ones who eventually die themselves, and then it's as if we never existed. Can anyone sing \\"Dust in the Wind\\"?Everyone I've ever talked to who had given much thought to the purpose of life, unless they had strong religious convictions, essentially reached this same conclusion.

The book goes into the lives of the different people and the theories behind their dying.I had to read this book for school, and I had a hard time reading it. The reason why is probably because I am a hard-core action/scifi/fantasy lover. This book had absolutely no excitement. I guess the book is made to make you think, but it seemed awfully boring to me, but HEY, if you like theoretics and classics, this book is definitely for you."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"While I do think that the ideas of fate and divine intervention are interesting and worth investigation, this book failed to harness my curiosity on the subjects. A very basic outline of the book is this; 5 people die when a bridge collapses, and in the following chapters, their lives are picked apart and analyzed in a confusing and boring mess of nonsense. The conclusion in no way ties the book together, and leaves you wondering what the author was trying to prove. Did God play a part in this catastrophe?

I am still trying to understand it now. I thought the book was confusing but still interesting when I did get pulled into the stories of the 5 victims. I think it is a book that should be taught and not just read. You need to have an appreciation for this book, that I obviously have not aquired yet. This book would be better for middle age adults, but kids could give it a try if they are prepared to be thoroughly lost in a novel.

Though I knew what was coming at the end of each chapter, I still was saddened each time the end of the life was reached. The end of the book was unsatisfying, but I think it's meant to be. The question of why lives end when they do isn't exactly an easy one to answer, especially in a book as short as this one.I would recommend this book to anyone. As for the comments made by early reviewers who believe that is a classic 'for adults only', you're very wrong. Teenagers understand more than you give us credit for."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Bridge of San Luis Rey is a most elegantly written short novel, completed before the author was thirty but imbued with a surfeit of word pictures indicative of artistic maturity. Having said that, the characterization is to me nonsensical. All of us know a someone whose objects are difficult to fathom or who lives on the cusp of reality; but in this story we're introduced to a half dozen such, lives that supposedly interact with one another and whose self-understanding is all too suddenly transformed before or after the tragedy. That \\"love\\" is the only human survival may satisfy during sunlit hours, but it is cold comfort in the midnight of the soul."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder is perhaps best known for his play, \\"Our Town,\\" which is the staple of high school drama groups and this book, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. I first read the book in high school, now more than 40 years ago and sadly chose it for its length - a short assignment! Some of the negative reviews of the book seem to be from these young, first time readers - I would have been among them on my first reading. Almost certainly you need some maturity (read: life experiences) to fully appreciate Wilder's wonderful, dense, evocative prose.The year was 1714, the \\"Sun King,\\" Louis XIV was still on the throne in France, and Peru was an established colony of Spain, when the bridge collapsed. One of the sub-themes of the book is the relationship of the colony with the mother country, Spain, and Peru's efforts to mature, in terms of the cultural and social life available. The central strength of the novel is Wilder's incisive portraits of four individuals: the physically ugly, lonely noveaux-riche, the Marquesa de Montemayor; Estaban, the sole survivor of twin orphans; and Uncle Pio, the wheeler-dealer who \\"trained\\" the actress Perichole. The first three fell to their deaths when the bridge collapsed, along with two others, Pepita, the assistant of the Marquesa, and Jaime, the son of Perichole. These two are not characterized in detail, and thus might be considered so much \\"collateral damage.\\"Examples of Wilder's succinct and meaningful prose are, in terms of the Archbishop: \\"A curious and eager soul was imprisoned in all this lard, but by dint of never refusing himself a pheasant or a goose or his daily procession of Roman wines, he was his own bitter jailer.\\" Has schadenfreude ever been better defined that the reaction of the population to the knowledge that the glamorous actress Perichole had become disfigured by smallpox: \\"...henceforth any attention paid to her must spring from a pity full of condescension and faintly perfumed with satisfaction at so complete a reversal.\\"?The overall framework of the novel is the search for meaning in this accident, faithfully pursued by a Brother Juniper who investigated each of the characters and their connections with their relations and friends. For his efforts, the Catholic Church burned him at the stake for \\"heresy\\" since his conclusion was that it was \\"God's will\\" that they were chosen to be called \\"home.\\" Wilder's own conclusion is equally unsatisfying: \\"There is a land of the living, and a land of the dead, and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.\\"It was humbling to realize that Wilder wrote this book, with its intense character sketches when he was still under 30. The weakness, despite the Pulitzer, was the overall framework and his facile, trite conclusions as to meaning, in a universe devoid of same, despite our best efforts. Overall, a much better book to read in one's 60's than when one is 16."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Wilder's slender masterpiece is one of those delicious books that takes a central philosophic question and evenly divides the answer: Perhaps yes, perhaps no. But if it were only that, it would be pretty boring. Luckily, in telling the intertwining tales of the people who fell with the bridge on that fateful day, Wilder shows an exquisite delicacy of touch, very close to poetic, and a fine sense of where to elaborate in a story and where to simply summarize (would that many of our best authors today show that sense and not just churn out the pages). Also remarkable is Wilder's ability to be evocative. One gets a real sense of Lima, Peru, in the early 18th Century, the clear mornings, the quiet nights, and without all the unattractive bedbugs of an author like Saramago.No matter what your predilection is for fiction, you will not fail to be touched by \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey.\\""},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thorton Wilder explores chance and destiny in his classic novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey.

This book is only superficially about the ordinary aspects of a few barely intersecting lives. It really speaks more deeply of love and personal agony and human commitment and the powerful bonds/struggles within relationships. Every word rings true... and I often wanted to rewind the cassette and hear a sentence over again. This beautiful book needs to be read, slowly. However, listening to Waterston's gentle, compassionate voice really brings the characters and their tragedy to life. What a hauntingly gorgeous book!"},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"Thornton Wilder won the first of three Pulitzer Prizes with this lyrically written tale of five people who fall, with a broken rope bridge, into a chasm in 1700's Peru. The language is beautiful, and Waterston brings to the reading of it a surprising, effortless range of voices, from an aging, tentative prima donna to a gruff sea captain to a rich, spoiled contessa. But it's Wilder's ideas, his musings on the butterfly-wing-fragility of life, which make this book a classic. The last couple of pages are as gentle, timeless and moving as anything ever put on paper (thus the title of my review above)."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"This short, brilliant novel attempts to answer the question \\"Do we live by accident and die by accident, or live by plan and die by plan.\\" A well-traveled, primitive bridge in Peru collapses one day in the early 1700s, sending five people to their deaths. Brother Juniper, a Spanish friar, is sent to investigate; he reveals to us the life stories of the five victims. The five people represent a mixture of the proud, the contrite, the sick at heart. Brother Juniper is convinced their deaths are a just act of God, for which he is condemned by the Church and burned at the stake. Countering Brother Juniper's view is Wilder, who believes that the answer to the question is not decidedly accident or plan, but an ambiguous combination of the two. Above all, he claims, is the love that was involved in each person's life: this love \\"will have been enough; all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. There is a land of living and a land of dead and the bridge is love.\\"Wilder develops his theme and characters superbly; the characters whose lives are lost at the bridge are beautifully fleshed out. In fact, \\"beautiful\\" might be the best word to use to describe the book - it's almost poetic, especially in its concerns with love. Wilder won a Pulitzer for this, his second novel. It's a memorable work by a master craftsman and wordsmith."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The spare, lucid prose in this remarkable little book, offers a lyricism and richness of character and story that I have rarely come across. This is one that tugs at one's heart and mind. The beauty of this book is really something to cherish."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"A couple of weeks back I rented Robert DeNiro's movie adaptation of The Bridge at San Luis Rey. The movie was so completely worthless that I felt obliged to read for myself Thornton Wilder's book on which the movie was based.This is the conceit of the novella: five people die when a rotten footbridge over a Peruvian gorge collapses, and a naive priest searches for a thread of divine meaning in the five deaths. Wilder's theme is \\"learn at last that anywhere you may expect grace.\\" This message is is proved not only in the lives of the characters, who bless each other in unusual and unexpected ways, but also in Wilder's intimate prose. The style is remarkably similar to that of Marquez and the other poetical latin novelists - and very effective for tranforming colonial Peru into a mythical dream.The Bridge at San Luis Rey is too lovely and restrained - too lacking in tension and tragedy - to be a great novel. But for me it was a refreshing interlude between larger novels that are more challenging and more deceptive."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"i think that this novel by Thorton Wilder is a specticle within itself! i am a student at Hawker college, and normally i hate reading novels. this one looked boring, but i had to read it for english. i have read it 4 times and i have bought it for myself. I find Wilder one of the best author's in the world!

Thank heavens I didn't read it when I was young."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"While I enjoyed the Bridge of San Luis Rey, I do have a good deal of questions concerning it. For instance, many people have come to the exact opposite conclusion I came to by the end of the book. These people state that Wilder states that there is no plan from God that determines the fate of people and it is ridiculous to think such. However, that is drawn solely from Brother Juniper's findings, and Juniper is not given the knowledge we are given in the novel and therefore comes, in my mind to an incorrect assumption. For instance, no one but God can know anything about the conversions that each character has before his or her death- these are very important to the story. Nor could Juniper see the effect the deaths would have upon the survivors (some say this is Wilder inserting hope into the ending of the novel- I think it is proving part of God's divine plan). Thus my conclusion was that God does have a divine plan for the world- it is not just hopeless chaos- however, humans, no matter how driven to prove it can and will never be privied to God's guiding hand. I obviously do not know if I read to far into it, and in doing missed the point- because I can see relevance in the other theory, though I don't like the message."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a short, exquisite meditation on life and the meaning of our existence. This winner of the 1928 Pulitzer Prize centers on the collapse of a bridge in 18th-century Peru that takes the lives of five people. A priest who witnesses the event wonders about the five who die. Why were they chosen? Was there a master plan or did the event occur simply at the whim of God. Being a religious man with a desire to place theology amongst the sciences, he sets out to empirically prove why the event happened by learning about the lives of those who perished.Wilder's prose is a wonder to read, near perfect in its pace and pitch. But this is a moral fable, with the conclusion that love is the meaning of it all. And with the novel consisting of almost exclusively characterization, this novel has almost no chance of finding appreciation among the masses today, who need a fast-paced plot and don't liked to be preached to. This probably explains why Wilder, a courageous writer who pushed the boundaries of literature, is under-appreciated these days. That's a shame; we could all learn something from his books. And if nothing else, if we're insistent upon learning nothing from our literature, we could sit back and enjoy the beautiful writing."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey takes place during the early 1700's.

I don't believe this book attempted to say anything, in and of itself. One is tempted to read the last line of the novel and attempt to extract its meaning. Don't do that. Although it reads like a declarative, it is not. When one writes, one likes to wrap up with a beautiful line, and Thorton Wilder has done just that; but it is not THE statement. How could it be? It contradicts so many things that have come before.Okay, so if you haven't read the novel, you're totally confused. Simply put, however, this novel is beautiful, insightful, and has a depth that is uncanny considering the leaness of the work. If you've read it once, and it took you 5 hours or so (which is reasonable), I assure you, you have missed a great deal. Read it again. It is that kind of book. One can, and perhaps should, read this novel sporadically over the course of a lifetime and be surprised by what is new within it every time. Certain songs are like that, and movies too. Art of course. Anything with depth. That being said, however, don't be scared off if you only wish to spend 5 hours and nothing more. The characters will stay with you, and you will be glad to have taken the time.

Or when you drive by a car accident on the highway, does it occur to you that if you had been only a few minutes earlier, you might have been involved in the wreck? &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; is a novel that wonders about these things -- whether our lives are governed by the randomness of fate or whether we &quot;deserve&quot; what happens to us.It is the story of five people in Peru who, one day, are crossing a rope-and-plank bridge which suddenly collapses, spilling them into a chasm. A studious monk named Brother Juniper witnesses the catastrophe and determines to learn about the lives of the victims and find out whether they were &quot;chosen&quot; for this fate or whether it was just a matter of innocently being in the wrong place at the wrong time.The victims are a noblewoman named the Marquesa de Montemayor, who was returning from a shrine where she was praying for her pregnant daughter; the Marquesa's orphaned and loyal maid Pepita; Esteban, a suicidal young man who was despondent over the recent death of his twin brother; a man called Uncle Pio, who liked to nurture his interest in women, Spanish literature, and drama; and a little boy in Uncle Pio's care named Don Jaime. All these people's lives were connected in some way to a vampish actress named Camila Perichole, whose presence in the novel provides links between the characters and events.Brother Juniper tries but fails to correlate the lives these people led with their deaths.

I thought the stories in the book were extremely tedious, especially the Spanish woman's and her daughter. The amount of detail is overwhelming and for what? What's the point of all that rambling about their relationship? It might have been useful to the reader if there was a tie in with the ultimate fate (i.e. the death) of this or any other character in the book. But there isn't! Wilder fails to connect anything in any kind of meaningful way, which leaves the reader with a terribly hollow feeling about the long slog he has made with the author. The concept is a good one: do we live and die by accident or by plan? That's the 64 dollar question that Wilder asks. But neither he nor Brother Juniper is in any kind of a position to deal with it. The book only ends with some tiresome platitudes about love and so forth. The year this novel was published must have been a very lean year indeed to warrant a Pulitzer Prize for this tedious, tiresome and very overrated piece of literature."},{"Title":"The bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in 1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, &quot;Why did this happen to those five?&quot; Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers &amp; we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't.

Public transportation was non-existent, pupils were frequently absent, and the remote area was among the poorest in the Outer Hebrides. As the story hits its stride, the island slowly begins to cast its spell upon Rea, and we sense his constant wonder at its regional oddities - the curious customs and superstitions, the quirky characters, the horizontal rain and ferocious, face-searing snowstorms. The prose often delivers strong sensory experience: the 'child-lifting' wind, his barefoot servant, who pokes her head around the corner, then magically vanishes, the wonderful description of 'lifting the peats'. When Rea is forced to leave for England, part of his heart remains in South Uist.

Gray. Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married. Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional. So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt. In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction? Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented. Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die. That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause. What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero. Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of \\"Confessions.\\" But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia. Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself. His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The book I ordered came quickly, and it was not expensive.

The fact that many Confederate apologists want the names of Turners \\"victims\\" put onto a memorial monument sails close to this joke of a book. A memorial with the names of very black man, woman child killed during slavery in the US would be closer to the truth. Under the guise of \\"brutal honesty\\" the author just creates another stereotype and uplifts the white man's burden in bad prose."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather. Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting. I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union! As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife. William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity. Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I came of political age during the civil rights struggle here in America in the early 1960's. Part and parcel with that awakening struggle came an increased interest in the roots of the black struggle, especially in slavery times. Such intellectuals as Herbert Apteker, the Genoveses, the Foners, Harold Cruise, James Baldwin, John Hope Franklin and others, black and white, were very interested in exploring or discovering a black resistance to the conditions of slavery not apparent on any then general reading of the black experience in America. This is the place where the recently deceased William Styron and his novelistic interpretation of one aspect of that struggle- Nat Turner's Virginia slave rebellion enters the fray.No Styron is not politically correct in his appreciation of Turner or his followers. Nor are latter day Southern whites and their sympathizers who have recoiled in horror at what expansion of Turner's rebellion might have meant for the \`peculiar institution'. But being politically correct, etc. now or historically is beside the point. Slavery was brutal. Slavery brutalized whole generations of black people for a very long time. If one expects nature's noblemen and women to come out of such a process, one will be very sadly mistaken. That the white benificaries of this system were brutalized is a given. Human progress has come about through fits and starts not a seamless curve onward and upward. Nevertheless all our sympathies are with Nat and his fellow rebels.Moreover, here are some things to think about if you are not worried about your political correctness status. Outside of John Brown at Harper's Ferry Turner's rebellion represented the highest achievement of resistance to the white slaveholders in the early 19th century. Although the fight was not pretty on either side every progressive today should stand in historical solidarity with that fight. Then one will understand not only that oppression oppresses but also that the military conditions for a successful rebellion for isolated blacks in pre- Civil War American were slim. The later incorporation of 200,000 black soldiers and sailors among the Northern forces in the Civil War are a very, very profound argument that once off the plantation blacks were as capable of bravery, courage and honor as an other American. As difficult as it is, if you do not have access to the original chronicles of the Turner uprising, read this book to get a flavor of how hard the struggle for the abolition of slavery in this country was going to be."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron sheds an interesting light on the motivations of one of American history's most intriguing figures. His fictional biography of Turner seems entirely plausible, all while raising interesting questions about slave life in the early 1800s. (For instance--does Nat's unusual level of education contribute to his dissatisfaction? Nat is treated better than most slaves--what caused him to revolt?) Styron never explicitly answers these questions, but paints a broad and detailed enough portrait of the famous slave so that the reader may come to his or her own conclusions. However, what makes this book one of my favorites is the writing, plain and simple. There are some passages in this book you will read over and over (such as when Nat kills his only victim of the whole revolt--and when he watches the sun rise from his jail cell the day of his execution). The only thing detracting from this captivating effect is Styron's constant forays into explicit sexual scenes. Grrr! One or two would have been sufficient! (Otherwise, though, a wonderful book, and very deserving of the Pulitzer)."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Styron establishes himself as one of America's premier writers with this book. He skillfully develops the psychological despair of Nat Turner; a bright and intelligent man driven to madness and murder in the South of the early 19th century. Stryon's style is refreshing and engaging; he invokes empathy for our antagonist yet the reader is left with a sense of tragedy for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; and the price we have all paid for its' legacy. This is a must read for those interested in understanding our terrible past and the enduring psychological scars slavery has inflicted upon our nation."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This fictional account of Nat Turner is absolutely wonderful. He makes a wonderful protaganist and throughout the story you want him to be successful and to find happiness. I was unaware that at the time the book was released, it was panned as racist by some black writers as racist. I wish they would read it again; it is a phenomenal story. Although Nat Turner is represented as a little mentally off-balanced, he is also represented as extremely smart, extremely kind, extremely strong and talented. I am reminded of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protaganist was also a little disturbed - driven by racism and the oppression of white society. Although her protaganist isn't as thoughtful and spiritual as Nat Turner, the idea that racism and oppression inflicted such pain is there. Add to that the absolute spiritual nature and soul-searching of Styron's Nat Turner and you have the makings a one truely great novel."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This book is fiction. There are very little accounts of what actually transpire in 1831 in Southern Virginia. What the book does, is present a fairly decent account of what slave life was like in those times. Despite it being fiction, it is well researched by William Styron and is written from the perspective of Nat Turner, who lead the greatest slave rebellion in America. It was orginally praised by black leaders in this country when first released, then with underlying theme of homosexuality by slave masters, the commentary turned nasty. This is a book that is always going to generate controversy in a similar manner that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" did. Both books should be read for what they are, insights into the human condition during inhumane times."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I too, am going to have to say that many recent reviewers have said what I would say if I could express myself so eloquently. This is a powerful and beautifully written book. I had heard about it and was curious, but had no idea the impact it would have on me.

Slavery and daily life in pre-Civil War times as it surely must have been. Telling his life story as he spends his final days in a Virginia prison waiting to be hanged, Nat Turner reveals to us his secrets and the nature of his mission from God, to free the black race and punish the sins of the white man. Because its violence is kept contained until one final moment at the book's end, it seemed more shocking and visceral to me than tales of mega-death and mayhem so common in other books that chronicle bloodshed and uprising. This novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and it earned it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner was a great book to read. It helped relate to the history of slavery and the many horrible things that went with it. I liked Styron's use of description in this book also. One of the best points of this book is that is contains all different aspects of life including love (between Nat and Margaret) also hate between Nat and Margaret and Nat's first owner Sam Turner, it contains peace and war. Some of the events in this book are very hard to read and seem to be confusing and weird at times but as the book progresses the reader begi to see how all the connections are coming to together. The ending is also good and very touching since the reader has been with Nat his whole life. I reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This work is a must-read if you are interested in the South, slavery, and race relations. Styron's fiction is compelling. It's fiction, not history, and critics wrongly pan the work because they perceive that Styron's imagination unjustly molds &quot;facts.&quot; The novel provides readers a look at slavery through the eyes of a slave - a wonderful, mad, erudite slave. With very little historical evidence and documents to use, the author uses his vision to create a fascinating portrait of the uprising's leader, who led the only successful slave revolt in the U.S. The implications of religion and the failure of Turner's troops to take Jerusalem can be extended to today's predicament. I found the author's afterword, in this 25th Anniversary edition, particulary insightful on the reaction the book received from various critics. Styron's disappointment with critics' inabilities to distance their own personal agendas when looking at literature concurs with my own feelings about the politics of academia."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This work, steeped in accurate historical settings and moving religious allegories, takes the reader into the very core of a southern slave"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I think that this book was very well written, the author kept you in supence the entire story.

I thought the book well written. It showed another facet of possible antebellum history. Styron threw in the old chestnut of a black man lusting after a white woman which made my head ache. The book opened up a complex set of moral issues for me. Who would condone murder but then who in their right mind would own another person? To juxtapose this book I'm also reading Stephen Oates' \\"Fires of Jubilee\\" which is an historical account of this same time and incident and it's helping me separate fact and fiction. I also have a copy of \\"Ten Black Writers Respond\\" on it's way. If nothing else Styron's book promotes a need to know and understand. Even if it hadn't done this for me I'd still read it because of it's literary value."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I didn't give this three stars because of the controversy around racism. It's historical fiction, fiction being the key word. And I didn't really pick up that tone from it at all. I thought it was an innovative retelling using what information we do know and filling in the blanks from there. The reason I gave it three stars is because it contained all sorts of things that I felt could have been cut from the book and it wouldn't have mattered. I almost gave up on it in the second section. I'm glad I finished it, but it was a little tough to keep interest in it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"For me, William Styron has written the standard from which to draw the historical novel. I say draw because an historical novel is just that; a novel. But even while the reader knows this, historical novels always seem to provoke some response framed by the light of a current outlook. This is ironic because the main attraction of historical novels (at least for me) is the escapist type pleasure that is found by immersing oneself in another world and time. This is the writer's accomplishment. William Styron does this in language and in pace so artfully that his book remains on my shelf. I keep 'The Confessions of Nat Turner' for its enjoyment and inspiration."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Before I read Styron's &quot;Lie Down In Darkness&quot;, I couldn't understand the charges of racism regarding one of my favorite books, &quot;Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;. Even so, this story is great and I can't imagine how anyone could not want Nat to succeed or understand his position. The &quot;white woman infatuation&quot; charge is ridiculous in my opinion. Nat lived in the house and was treated as an equal, the woman was kind and beautiful, it would be racist to think that Nat shouldn't be attracted to her or worthy of her love. That said, the story is much greater than that side note and wonderfully written."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"It is November of 1931 and Nat Turner awaits his death in a Virginia jail cell. Nat Turner is a black slave and a preacher. He is also the only black slave to lead a group of men against their masters and accomplish what they wanted, white terror and blood shed throughout most of America.Nat Turner's confession is made under the vision he receives from God. The confession leads the jury to decide to have him hung until death. As Nat waits in his cell with his trusty sidekick Hark he begins to recall his life and of how such a truly good man went bad and the truly cruel world of slavery.Nat turner had a wonderful childhood at Turner's Mill where Samuel Turner brought Nat into his home. After realizing how bright Nat was he started to teach him to read and write. Mr. turner was a very thoughtful man who wanted to train Nat well enough that one day he could walk free. But when things change for the worse Mr. turner is forced to send Nat to Reverend Eppes's to learn more about religion.Reverend Eppes worked Nat very hard and taught him precious little about religion. Reverend Eppes did not acknowledge that Nat could do other things then work a farm but Nat still learned about the bible from the one that Turner had given him. When Reverend Eppes went back on his word and did not set Nat free he was sold to Mr. Evens and Mr. Blanding.Mr. Evens and Mr. Blanding owned a company called Evens & Blanding. This company was based on slave auctions which at once Nat was sold at to Mr. Thomas Moore. Thomas Moore recognized Nat's traits as a carpenter and often traded him out to other people. Nat usually got Sunday's off and so he would retreat to the woods where he had a sanctuary. There he had a vision from God to kill all white people. This is where the story truly begins.&lt;P... The confessions of Nat turner is a magnificent book which tells the side that we do not often see, the side of the murderer."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Good read. Can understand why some readers consider this contraversial. Trust we never go back to &#34;slave owners&#34; or their likes."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by William Styron (the author of Sophie&#8217;s Choice). It is based on a slave revolt in Virginia in 1831, lead by Nate Turner. Turner&#8217;s capture and confession is the basis of this book.The novel is told in a 1st person narrative and is largely the work of Styron&#8217;s imagination. While it is brilliantly written Styron does include graphic scenes of highly erotic obsessions with various white women and one of the most vivid homosexual encounters in modern literature. Probably because of these scenes Styron was savaged by many of the leading black artists of the day but the book has endured the criticism and is, in many ways, an American Classic.Slavery is an indelible stain on the fabric of American culture. It will never be washed away. Turner is an aesthetic, a religious fanatic, a brilliant, tormented misanthropic, homicidal nihilist. His band of followers slaughters 52 men, women, and children. In retribution the white slaughter 200 blacks. Turner is captured, interrogated, and executed. Instead of inspiring a region wide uprising, he is brought down by his fellow blacks fighting alongside the plantation owners.It is a difficult book to read but it is a book that really should be read."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"not in great shape but readable- the age of the paperback added to its charmIt was a gift to my son who was born the year the book won the pulitzer 1968"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"If William Styron has done us a disservice it's that he's unleashed upon America the concept of political correctness. The backlash against this book, to a large extent, is what started it all. Some of the criticism is on-target, but much is unfair.Slaves typically have been depicted in one of two ways: as the simple-minded shuffling watermelon-eating darkie, or as the noble African struggling valiantly against the tyrannical white plantation.One depiction is overtly racist, and the secondly is unrealistically romantic (and in it's own way demeaning).What Styron gives us is \\"none of the above\\". What he tries to depict is a reality that is often overlooked or not acknowledged: that chattel slavery in the American South was a ruthlessly and crushingly effective system; so effective that throughout its history (from the 1600's through the Emancipation Proclamation) there were only two armed rebellions.Slavery was obviously a great evil; it is equally obvious that as a mechanism for suppressing the enslaved it was remarkably effective. It follows that this mechanism will have an effect on the suppressed. Chattel slavery was, in many cases, a \\"breaker of spirits\\".The depiction of the slaves in this book is not always positive. What Styron tries to show (sometimes successfully) is that slavery was a heavy weight, and that the slaves who bore this weight were not always noble. This is what many readers have found offensive, and why the book has been labeled \\"racist\\". This was not my impression (my background: I'm an African American raised in Texas.)This is a novel full of ugliness and negative characters. There is not a single fully sympathetic character in the entire book, black or white. In this way, it is an exploration of the evil of slavery.This novel is not a history lesson; and in that many readers accept the fiction as fact Styron might have done us an additional disservice. Styron himself acknowledges this in the forward of the recent addition. The controversy surrounding Confessions is not what it once was, but I'd encourage anyone who has deliberately avoided the book because they've been told it is racist to read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I have always admired Styron's bravery in handling difficult subjects. Styron is a novelist in the classic tradition, and is concerned with depth of theme and pyschological motivation--two things that are sneered at in todays academic climate. Yes, it is a problem straying into the political arena--but Styron achieves the important task of humanising Nat Turner--making him real, and not some dusty abstract fictional personage--consigned to the footnotes of History. Racism has many faces, and as I read Styron's novel, I became angrier and angrier, as the palpable, grinding and dehumanising aspects of America's slave legacy was unfolded in Nat's story. The ending was incredibly powerful. I urge people, of all creeds and colours, to read this book and keep an open mind. Styron is NOT a racist, but a HUMANIST.The story he tells has eternal relevance, and is told with integrity and great literary skill. A book should stand alone, but I hope some day that this novel is made into a film. Its story is too important to remain locked within the literary arena."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron had the misfortune to publish &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; in the late 1960s. The timing was such that Styron had the odd experience of a) being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the book and b) being shunned by many, black and white, for having had the temerity to put himself in the mind of a black slave when he himself was a white Southerner.The color of Styron's skin doesn't matter anymore than it should for anyone else. &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a brutal accounting, from Nat Turner's point of view, of the events that led up to the only long-term revolt in the disgraceful history of American slavery. We see the beginnings of Turner's musings when, as a young and extraordinarily intelligent slave, he fights mentally against his enslavement. It's when the dam bursts and he decides to fight physically that his downfall begins. There is a suggestion of perhaps not mental illness, but a messianic complex here in Styron's rendering of Turner. It works, for a character in a novel, but some readers will be taken aback by the fact that Styron makes Turner somehow mentally unstable.As with all books, the uninitiated reader wants to know: is it a good read? It is. It's propulsive and majestic and the kind of book you don't want to end. Styron handles the ending with great delicacy and restraint. &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a sustained and detailed portrait of a compelling figure in early American history. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is one of the most moving, intense novels I've ever read. It is a fictional account of the 1830's uprising led by the slave Nat Turner in Southampton, Virginia, which culminated in the deaths of nearly seventy white men, women, and children, and Turner's own execution.The ethics of this novel are the only thing which keeps me from giving it a full five stars. I do not fully understand the controversy surrounding it. Apparently African Americans of the 60's objected to the work not simply because it was written by a white southern man, but because of the frank depictions of Nat's secret sexual desire for a white female in the story. It has been pointed out to me that many feel that this is a case of a folk hero being (deliberately?) maligned in some way by one who cannot possibly empathize with Turner (Styron being white), and while there is some merit in that arguement, I myself found the sexual aspect justified in terms of the character's development - as a fictional interpretation (although I felt it detracted somewhat from his character -and seemed a little...easy). I can see how without any empirical evidence to support the notion that Turner held this desire, it might anger some people. Yet, this is only a fictional work. If some Frenchman were to write a novel about George Washington and portray him as lusting after little boys, I could see how an American might be angered, and yet I have faith that the majority of people would shrug it off as a simple piece of fiction. Which is what this is. A brilliant, engrossing work of fiction. People seeking facts about the insurrection should not look to fiction, though admittedly there is a lot less in the way of source material beyond the actual Confessions as they exist in historical record when compared to this novel. I still feel Styron did an excellent job of extrapolating a story from a dictated (and probably heavily interpreted) confession. Sadly, no one in this world will ever know the truth of Nat Turner's early days. His history begins and ends with his Confession.Taken alone, this novel is still a very interesting read, though I'm not exactly sure if it deserved a Pulitzer Prize. If there was any book written by a white man of the sixties which DID deserve this prestigious award, it must be \`Black Like Me.' I was not around in the sixties, but I can see that this novel might have gone a long way towards fostering an understanding (at least for white people) of the horrors of chattel slavery in America.Styron's portrayal of the day to day hardships of Nat Turner's life both external and internal are extremely vivid. The characters that populate the story, both slave, free, and master, are all very human, never degenerating to the lazy stereotypes of the shiftless and abasing Stepin Fetchit or the entirely brutal Simon LeGree (though these extremes are shown to exist). No one is entirely evil and no one is entirely good, just as in reality. The internal struggles of Nat's personality are also quite well realized, as he wrestles with the question of God, and his own self-worth (and those of his people). All in all, a striking novel by a talented writer."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is a stunningly intense and powerful novel. The novel is written as the final confession of Nat Turner following his brutally violent slave revolt of 1831. The account is fictionalized though relies heavily on historical facts for its basis.The novel is painfully tragic as Styron masterfully portrays Turner's existence within the deep south during slavery. Styron's novel is filled with many tragic ironies that mirror the strange logic of slavery and oppression. Turner is initially uplifted by the power of religion, but eventually uses the Bible and bizarre visions to justify his brutal revolt. Throughout the novel, Styron is even-keeled, never passing judgment on Turner, ultimately allowing the reader to come to his/her own conclusions. The novel is vivid and necessarily graphic in places as Styron depicts the harsh slave world where violence leads to more violence.This is an important novel to read, for it gives important insight into how history shaped American race relations. Styron caught a lot of flak for writing this book (he is Caucasian), but ultimately, I believe his detractors are closed minded. His portrayal is simply stunning, and you needn't be white or black to understand Nat Turner's plight, but merely be a human."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"It's a shame that this book has been shrouded in accusations of racism and bigotry, because it detracts from the simple fact that &quot;Nat Turner&quot; is a beautifully written, impressively narrated and horribly affecting novel. Styron's Nat is a fully realized, memorable and finely-drawn character, whose insights into slavery and human nature in general, linger long after the closing words. In the end he emerges, not so much as a hero, but as a human pushed to the brink by circumstances beyond his control. An essential read for anyone who enjoys novels which plumb the depths of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Written in 1968, Styron's &quot;Confessions&quot; delves deep intothe psychology behind Nat Turner's 1831 slave revolt. Almostunbearable in its graphic violence and Biblically-dimensionedheartbreak, the novel (for it *is* fictional) has Turnertelling the whole story in painfully honest detail. Styronneither defends Turner nor paints him as crazy; he is lessinterested in pointing out right or wrong than in trying tounderstand the broad ironies of the system of slavery and itseffects on the people who ran it and were subject to it.Styron's Nat Turner is a man who is both educated and destroyedby his masters; he is both uplifted and misled by the Bible.His hatred is not fueled by the hatred of whites, but by thepity of whites. And when he kills, he is only able to commitone physical murder, though he takes responsibility for 60.The book is often painful to read, especially for one whomight think that race relations today have little to do with19th-century slavery. But in its wealth of detail and itsability to enter into the mind of a complex and criminal mind,it is unique, and should be required reading for everyself-termed patriotic American."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"There is much to be said about this novel apart from the wrongly alleged &quot;subtle&quot; or &quot;open&quot; racism of its author, William Styron, a rare writer with the dark-red conscience necessary to firmly seat himself in the civil uneasy chair of revisionist sensitive-history. A brief overview of his work in both fiction and memoir shows civil rights to be a cornerstone of his thematic untertaking; thematic material that, for the most part, anglo writers either ignore or address tentatively with small equanimity. One senses, not only in Styron's work, but in his selection of narrative, a deep, vengeful need to understand a psychology and a violence that seems humanly irreconcilable. And of course it is not; Styron's, like any useful imagination, is boundless and capable of understanding all human action, no matter how sinister. Styron must have known many decades ago that what we are for any reason afraid to address satisfactorily will continue in a more destructive form in time. What better hero then, than Nat Turner? It is clear that Styron had as little choice whether or not to address this subject as Nat Turner had to address his situation all those years ago, and for precisely the same reason, to change it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I just finished this profound, beautiful, satisfying novel by William Styron, which won the 1968 Pulitzer Prize. In 1831 Nat Turner, a Virginia slave and preacher, led the only sustained, effective slave revolt in American history, yet few records of the event offer much detail. The only one! After years of solemn, secret planning, into which the reader is methodically and eagerly enlisted, over the course of two days Nat and some 75 followers rampaged the countryside, laying waste to 55 white souls of all ages, including women and babies, before they were caught and, of course, hanged. Fifty-five cold-blooded murders plus dozens of wounded makes Charles Manson look like Martha Stewart. Styron attempts to penetrate the mind of Turner to uncover his motive and psychology and succeeds to a considerable degree, in my opinion.The book is told in first person, most of it directly by the chained Nat awaiting execution in his cold, dank cell, the rest of it summarized in dialogue with his lawyer, a neat way to get across a lot of plot points in a hurry while maintaining scene and drama. Story begins with a vision Nat has of an inscrutable, white building high on a sea cliff -- his version of freedom and glory (he has never seen the sea). Then back to the cell, and we get what happened in dialogue with his lawyer, a befuddled white man assigned to the case. The second part of the book retraces Nat's remarkable life story in recollections, slowly, gorgeously laying the groundwork for his religious convictions that lead to his plan to plunder the countryside that has served as the backdrop for the unspeakable horrors endured by his fellow slaves. Particularly effective is Styron's use of Old Testament martyrs and prophets who rose up against the Egyptians and whose fiery rhetoric lights a blaze in Nat's mind that cannot be put out. This leads right up to the climax, which the reader has been prepared for and can't wait to read, and the scene where he storms his master's bedroom does not disappoint. The deneoument brings us back to Nat's final meeting with his lawyer on the morning of his execution and his bidding goodbye to his last living comrade, led past Nat's cell, crying out that it will be all right, that it's \\"nuthin'!\\" The hangmen's call from behind the door to \\"Come!\\" becomes in Nat's mind the voice of the Lord at last, the Lord who has, for years, abandoned him and tested his will by His silence. Nat's vision of the mysterious white building on the hill becomes a metaphor for the peace of the finally imminent Afterlife.Interesting how Nat's retrospective first-person prose is simply scrumptious, lavish, almost insanely wonderful, but when he speaks, his words come out in the same impoverished dialect as the other slave characters. No excuse or explanation is given for this discrepancy -- a reminder of just how much you can get away with provided you set the standard from the get-go and never look back. Styron's prose, which I had only encountered once before, in his terrific novella The Long March, is what I would call transparent. Clear, perfect, to be devoured compulsively as you think \\"he can't possibly keep this up\\" and he does. When I read Styron's natural kinsmen such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Cheever, Richard Yates, I think as I read, \\"Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he clearly knows it,\\" but when reading this book, I found myself thinking, \\"Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he's sparing the reader the hint of his own swaggering ego to boot.\\" Hence, tranparency. The lily rendered as it is, no gilding required. Hence, my excitement upon emerging from this book is partly the prospect of his other novels, waiting for me in used bookstores and eBay auctions and garage sales.Styron took a lot of heat for his matter-of-fact treatment of Nat's character, mainly from black leaders who denounced it as perpetuating the stereotype of the sex-obsessed, violent black man. Maybe they had a point. It was 1968 after all. Then again, Nat's natural development, morally and sexually, was so warped and twisted by even the mundane practical restraints of slavery, as to supply reason enough for me. And the man presided over such unprecedented and widespread carnage -- it must be remembered that he was a mass murderer, no matter his skin color. Yet, amazingly, and probably significantly, Nat himself committed just a single murder -- that of a white girl whose beauty and sincere kindness toward him somehow overboiled his frustrated rage more than all the cruelty of his various masters and their surrogates. Finally, though, and most important to a writer, Nat is written with such humanity and compassion and courage and honesty and wit that, in the usual sense, it hardly matters what he did -- the reader is with him till the end. \\"Write unlikeable characters,\\" my writing teacher Ethan Canin told us. \\"The reader will always like them.\\" James Baldwin had his own take on the book when it came out: \\"He [Styron] has begun the common history -- ours.\\" Achieving a common history is something another writing teacher of mine, James Alan McPherson, often said should be the goal: \\"We must develop what Ralph Ellison called the omni-American sensibility.\\" Jim also once said, \\"There should be no limits whatever to the writer's imagination.\\" Amen!"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Have you ever wanted to say something and then discovered that someone else has said it first and better than you would have? Well, that was my experience upon reading the review written by Christopher Smith at the top of the readers' reviews section.So, rather than re-hash what has already been ably stated, I will add a few more thoughts of my own.The controversy over Styron's portrayal of Nat Turner would not be nearly as furious if not for the sheer power of Styron's writing. He drags you into Turner's tortured mind and you can feel Turner's anger, rage and lust. In my case, it pulled me in so tightly during some scenes that the rest of the world was lost to me. All was a breathless rush until that little piece of this tragedy was over and I was able to breathe again. Although I am not entirely pleased with some of the liberties that were taken with the real history of Nat Turner, the writing displayed in this book is really quite exceptional and it merits the 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"My objection to this book is that it takes a real person who lived and breathed, and began the U.S.'s only &quot;successful&quot; slave revolt, and turns him into a fictional character. People read this book and figure it IS the history of Nat Turner, and THAT is damaging to our common perception of history. Styron says repeatedly in interviews on the subject that he used all the historical information available, and only invented the parts of Turner's life that he couldn't find in history. And that's just not true. He didn't look at the trial record at all. He dismissed newspaper accounts as unbelievable, and he even veers far from the &quot;Confessions of Nat Turner,&quot; as told to Thomas Gray by the real person Nat Turner. In those &quot;Confessions,&quot; Nat doesn't repent for what he's done. He says he doesn't feel guilty at all. This is a far cry from the basis for Styron's character Nat, who feels estranged from God for some sin he has committed. The whole idea that he killed Margaret Whitehead because he lusted after her is ludicrous. It ignores the relationship that Nat had with his real-life wife -- and it perpetuates the old racist idea that we have to protect our white women from black men who want to rape them. When all along, it's Styron and other white guys who have those fantasies. They merely project them onto black men in order to justify their own behavior which is supposed to protect women and children. Of all the hundreds of lynchings that occurred after the Civil War, only 2 involved a white woman being even threatened by a black man, yet that charge of rape was the pretext for so many outright murders of black men.Nat Turner was a hero for leading that revolt. Slavery was abominable, and I'm glad some slaves finally rose up to deplore it. The murders they committed were harsh, but nowhere nearly as harsh as what African-Americans, as a whole, endured day after day as slaves. Styron tries to make Nat Turner into a quivering would-be rapist, who has killed the only person he loved, when Turner was really a man who rose up against the heinous tyranny of slavery. Every time someone reads this book and buys it as the real story, Styron succeeds in keeping the myth alive that what Turner did was wrong -- conveniently forgetting how wrong slavery was, and how much it took to stop it, and then forgetting that it took another hundred years to end segregation in the South, and even now, we don't have equal rights for all. Styron tries to turn Turner's success into failure. It's racism at its noxious core."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Why does Amazon *do* this?On the various listings of this famous novel--as well, I am sure, of hundreds of thousands of other books--the publication date is shown as ... whenever that edition was published, hello--with no mention of the real publication date of the actual novel.Very confusing, I should think, to prospective buyers. As well as false, misleading and uninformative. \\"Confessions,' for example, was published in 1967, amidst controversy and social ferment. I was at Merritt College with some of the Black Panthers, and the novel was a famous part of our Poli Sci curriculum.Mind you, no one had ever written, especially in such a frank and graphic manner, about this famously violent slave uprising--and from the slave's imagined point of view. That was the heart of the scandal .... never mind that Styron was white.Of course, this was back when a novel could and did have this kind of social impact.Back when we Read Books."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I was fascinated by William Styron's book;it is undoubtedly a great book by a great writer. I agree with Styron that Nat Turner suffered from a delusion. He went through the four steps described in \\"The Psychology of Delusion\\" written by the Zuks and published in 2005. Styron's book is an application of art to history.Although criticized by some as \\"racist\\",it is essentially a psychological study fully in conformity with the theory of delusion espoused by the Zuks in their recent publication."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Then again, the whole subject of slavery is disturbing. This was a far more interesting read than I thought it would be. Styron's book is well paced and well written enough to keep you turning page after page. Wouldn't recommend it for young kids, though, for some subject matter. I'd wait until late high school or thereabouts to recommend it for reading."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Whilst I would not disagree with other reviewers who admire this novel, I would point out that there is a little-known collection of essays by black writers and black activists about Styron's novel.The theme of these essays is that Styron, a guilty white liberal, has &quot;stolen&quot; Nat Turner from the negroes, and, by perverting the historical facts for the sake of his Pulitzer prize-winner, has turned a great figure into an indecisive, vacillating and sexually ambivalent creation (as a Jew, I feel the same way when Anne Frank's diary is revised by those seeking to &quot;dilute&quot; the experience of the holocaust).Perhaps their greatest criticism of Styron's blacks is that they are portrayed as docile, imbecilic animals, a comforting fiction for guilty liberals who cannot understand why or how the slaves revolted.In the final analysis, it may be the case that only blacks have access to the authentic slave experience - and therefore, as some of the critics state, Nat Turner is still waiting for one of his brothers to write his biography.&quot;What is the price of experience? Can men buy it for a song, or wisdom for a dance in the streets? No! It is bought with the price of all that man has. His house, his wife, his children.&quot; (Blake)"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I have not read Styron's novel yet, but I plan to. It has got to be interesting. It has got to be interesting to read the point of view of someone that has experienced mental illness describing a historic figure that reveals all the signs of psychosis. If you investigate the history of Nat Turner you will note that it is limited, but that he is described as a man having scars on multiple parts of his body. So his life in slavery was not as wonderful as history would have you to believe. Yet most information I have read state that his life was \\"okay\\", I guess okay considering other slaves. Not to justify mass murder but considering what the life he lived and that he probably also had schizophrenia ..it is not too far to believe the story. So it has to be interesting to read Stryron's novel, only someone that has seen the isolation of mental illness would be able to interpret it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Most modern readers won't be taken in by Styron's subtle and sometimes open racism, but besides that this is a decent narrative. Styron said that he is not trying to make a &quot;historical novel&quot; but just a good read. And it is. Nat himself especially is well-developed and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Any experience can be colored by prior expectations - as was mine. I bought the book on a whim - without reading any reviews or talking to friends about it. And I suppose I was expecting a tale of hope and revolution, a story about a young man truly believing that only violent rebellion could help his people. What I got instead was a grossly pessimistic bit of story that turned a truly inspirational figure in black history into the largest \\"darky\\" hater around! (I'd like to note here that Nat Turner is not revered because he caused the deaths of so many people, but because he fought back. It's torture to sit through countless slave stories and watch black people endure terrible torture all the while screaming \\"Just shoot him and run!!\\" without any real hope for their relief.) Any heroic features that Nat Turner holds for the black community are swiftly wiped away in this book and replaced with an infuriating man who kinda sucks.I read another review on Amazon in which the reviewer felt that the story was moving and the fictional imaginings justified. I'd have to agree. Its a hard argument to say that an imagined story isn't enough like what you yourself had imagined. But I will say that the book deals a pretty low blow to a black icon. If it was The Confessions of [some random human] I would simply not like the character and move on. But to take an iconic black figure and imagine him as the crappy dude in this book speaks to the authors ideas about black masculinity, slave mentality and black community. And I don't get the impression that he thinks very highly of any of them.I'm throwing the book out."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Is there another book or novel about Nat Turner? I can see why many blacks were disturbed about this novel. Styron took many liberties with Turner's character - especially with his &quot;infatuation&quot; for a white woman. I'm not saying that there are black men who are attracted to white women and vice versa, but does he know for a fact that Turner was actually infatuation with one?"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"For me this was an unsatisfying read. Many pages might have been edited from this novel and very little would have been lost. It became a tedious read. The novel is an attempt by a mid 20th century white man to penetrate the psyche of a early 19th century black slave. Many times this didn't work. That fact challenged the story's credibility early on. I can understand why this novel infuriated much of the black community especially in the 1960's when it was first published. There seems to be a certain overreaching and perhaps unintended arrogance about it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The 1992 Vintage edition of \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" has an afterword by the author that could be called \\"The Confessions of William Styron.\\" Here, Styron responds to the criticisms that have plagued his novel about Nat Turner, the rebel slave who in 1831 instigated an insurrection that resulted in the murders of fifty-five white people, since its initial publication in 1967. Is Styron's novel the mature, scholarly work of a man who is genuinely fascinated with an ugly historical incident in his homeland (the Tidewater region of southeastern Virginia), or just an iconic relic of the Civil Rights era? Styron would insist on the former, but posterity may judge it to be the latter.Intentionally or not, the novel is certainly a magnet for controversy simply because so few facts are known about Nat Turner's life, which required Styron to fill in the blanks with as many fictional elements as he could imagine; and many readers, perhaps misunderstanding Styron's agenda, are liable to dispute and even attack the fictional material for various reasons. Since this is not a biography, Styron was violating no ethical taboos by employing artistic license where he saw fit.The novel begins with Turner sitting in a jail cell awaiting trial for his bloody crimes and delivering to his lawyer, Thomas Gray, what will be recorded in history as his \\"confessions.\\" Speaking his bilious, violent words with precision, insight, and erudition, Nat tells the story of his life in a series of flashbacks, beginning with his childhood at the plantation of a wealthy miller named Samuel Turner, where his mother was a cook and therefore enjoyed a few more privileges than did most of the other slaves. Nat was a bright boy who, when he demonstrated a desire to learn how to read, was taught the Bible by Samuel Turner's wife and daughter. When financial ruin befell the Turner family, Nat was sold to a variety of owners until he finally came into the possession of a wheelwright named Joseph Travis.As a sincerely devout man who strove to suppress his lust and remain celibate, and as probably the only literate black man in the county, Nat became a preacher to the other slaves, who were granted some liberties on Sundays but were not allowed to assemble. The hatred he had been nursing towards white people culminated on a day he received a divine vision to kill them all, to assume the role of a murderous Moses leading his people out of bondage to the promised land. While his friend and closest associate, Hark, enlisted as many slaves as possible for a revolt, he devised plans for the most merciless of massacres that succeeded to the extent that any white Southern sentiment for abolition was consequently cooled for the time being.Styron is a meticulous, highly disciplined prose artist who writes novels that are compellingly readable and filled with savory details but somehow fail to substantiate themselves beyond the surface. The compensation for this in \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" is the selection of a loaded and endlessly discussable topic: Is a man born in chains and consigned to die in chains to be blamed if he attacks his captor in anger? Turner, in Styron's eyes, would justify the murders as evil for evil, contending that the damage done to blacks by whites is irreparable and the only remaining option is destruction. Styron calls Nat Turner a psychopath, yet composes a portrait of him that is tense but controlled and, in its thematic denunciation of slavery, roundly empathic."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The thing about Styron I admire is his astonishing talent for prose and description. I don't get the sense that he is much appreciated for his technical prowess, but he should be. If only critics will realize that great art is first brilliant craftsmanship, I think the quality of literature, in general, would be much higher. The things I liked about this book are the vivid descriptions of plantation and rural life (you could almost smell the soap on Margaret Whitehead's skin), the often hilarious speech, the shocking violence, and the staggering hypocrisy of the people of the American South with regards to chattel slavery. The biggest thing I did not like about this book (also with Sophie's Choice) is the clipped, elliptical narrative. It was often confusing to follow. I believe &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; would have been a more powerful book if its storyline had been linear. But in the end, this is a great book. Much better than Sophie's Choice in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"First, anyone coming to this book for the first time should not read it as an historical treatise, because it isn't. So far as is known, Nat Turner didn't display homosexual propensities, as he does in this book. The historical Turner was married; Styron's protagonist is not. Indeed, beyond his homosexual liaison with a fellow slave, he goes through life in Styron's historical novel as a celibate, lusting after nubile white girls when not plotting his apolcalyptic war against the white race. This was an issue that caused great controversy when the book first came out. It may still bother the historical purist. To others, this might be seen as a minor point. After all, Shakespeare wasn't above changing historical facts to make a more engrossing, dramatic play. There are those even today who assert the Bard unfairly maligned Richard the Third. For those wanting to read a Nat Turner biography, they should try Stephen Oates' \\"Fires of Jubilee.\\" Having said all this, Styron's book remains one of the great American historical novels. Writers at their very best perform a sort of alchemy and Styron has always been adept at this, evoking a time and place long gone with a vivid wizardry and authenticity that is wonderful, even though he often writes about the most tragic of events (for example, his novel \\"Sophie's Choice\\" deals with the Holocaust). And, despite Styron's artistic license with certain aspects of the 1831 slave rebellion, this is a powerful story, populated with unforgettable characters, and a part of our American history that I think everyone should study and be aware of. To some, Nat Turner was a hero. To others, he was a demented murderer. Whatever your viewpoint, Styron is one of America's great writers and this is a book that should be read by anyone who is interested in where we have been as a country and apprehensive about where we are headed. Some of the issues inherent in Turner's story, and the story of those who followed him to their bitter doom, are as germane today as they were in 1831."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"NAT TURNER This one moved me through the story of Nat Turner's life. Nat Turner led an unsuccessful revolt in southern Virginia in 1831. His confessions before hanging were recorded by his appointed attorney. So in writing NAT TURNER, Frazier uses this document as his blueprint to fill out the life of Nat Turner.I was deeply moved (and stirred) by the detail into the childhood (which I know is very freely created by the author, historical documents lacking). But the fact that at some point Nat Turner was taught to read by one of his owners and the fact that he could read and was set upon the Bible, which Nat (who had become a preacher among his fellow slaves) used as his own blueprint and justification for why the slaves must rise up and destroy their owners at all costs.The rebellion lead to the deaths of 50-some whites over the course of about three days. The rebellion was put down, fell apart, whatever. At its peak, Nat had enlisted approximately 75 slaves to his cause. His surprise came in how disorganized everything became as more slaves enlisted, and how at many of the attacks, the slaves of the houses instead of joining the rebellion, actually came to attack Nat's army and defend their owners.It's a powerful glimpse at an event which precedes the Civil War, and has been relegated to a quiet (and the book to a somewhat scorned) position in history, although its effects on slave owners everywhere as word spread about the uprising, must have had its own powerful undermining effect. How well could many slave owners sleep afterward, knowing that their slaves - once considered docile and subservient - might take them and cut them open in their sleep?I wonder..."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Many customers are saying this book helps you look at slavery differently. I agree. William Styron shows not only the pain and suffering of Nat Turner (more or less an average slave), but it also tells what kind of decisions a slave really made.You get paid pennies a week for the grueling work you are doing. In a few years you can buy your freedom and start a life for yourself, maybe a life in a humble cabin built by your own hands, a life full of racism, but a life non the less. At this point you would happy with whatever you could get. Or, there is the decision of revolting. With enough support you could overrun your owner and escape to the North. Unfortunately, that is a very dangerous proposition.William Styron tells the life of this religious slave in the early 19th centurey and why he did what he did. Many people would agree it is stupid to revolt. On the other hand, many say they would make the same decision, &quot;Give me Liberty or give me death.&quot; Nat Turner's revolt was debateably the only successful revolt. After Nat was made an example and hung, however, the revolt only caused a negative effect on slavery laws and caused other slave owners around the country to tighten their grip."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Any of us with a decent American History teacher first learned about Nat Turner in the 8th grade. If you're a part of the New York State Regents program you learned it again during the 12th grade. But so little is actually known about Nat Turner, short of the confession he \\"dictated\\" to attorney T.R. Gray on 5 November 1831 in his unheated, open to the elements jail cell. We also know of the personal witness accounts of his execution, including a posthumous article in The Southampton Insurrection by a writer named Drewry that said:\\"The bodies of those executed, with one exception, were buried in a decent and becoming manner. That of Nat Turner was delivered to the doctors, who skinned it and made grease of the flesh. Mr. R.S. Barham's father owned a money purse made of his hide. His skeleton was for many years in the possession of Dr. Massenberg, but has since been misplaced.\\"These are the facts we're given in William Styron's 1966 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\". There are so few books in print that have had the ability to bring water to my eyes. Perhaps no more than four in total. William Styron is responsible for two: this one and Sophie's Choice.Nat Turner's Confession is two fold. The first of course is literal and pertains to the God-driven war he executed against the dominant white man from his place of bondage. Mr. Styron's is very open about how he took remarkable license with actual facts, but the truth is that so many of the events he has given us in this book- all in first person and most in remembrance since the entire book takes place during the four days before Turner's execution at the gallows in the small town of Jerusalem, Virginia, but there's much here we haven't studied about, seen pictures of and certainly nothing here that is remotely worse than modern day treatment of our current sub-cultures (of which African Americans remain one.) It is not at all possible that in the some 8 million slaves who lived and died in America, that every single event of this book didn't happen somewhere to some0one. And as survivors of the Holocaust have said about Spielberg's shocking film, \\"Schindler's List\\" it isn't even 10% of how awful it really was.Perhaps the greatest injustice to Nat Turner was for his first Master to teach him to read , write and do math. Then, the Master's neice gave Nat his own Bible and began to teach him the word of the Lord. As a young \\"pickani**y\\" he was brought out for company and made to perform: \\"Go ahead. Ask \`im to spell somethin'. Nothin' easy neither- give \`im a hard word.\\" The boy grew up knowing that he was special because he was the only slave on that plantation- or any after it- who could read write and reason. Turner was a man and one of his greatest sins was that of Pride, a sin for which he went to his death carrying fear and doubt. Each of his visits from God could be explained biophysically- one after a five day fast, awakening to a full eclipse of the sun, the vision of the morning star on the day of his execution. These were enough for Turner- or just enough - because in addition, he heard the voice of God telling him that like the Jews out of Egypt the Blacks needed to be freed from the whites. Indeed, even the kindest abolitionists brought about hatred inside Nat Turner- a man who (at least in this book) chose to die chaste. Styron is very subtle about this but he manages to suggest that Nat Turner is a prophet as was Christ and Moses. The similarities are small, but they're everywhere. But Styron's Nat Turner is also sickened and embarrassed by the \\"nigg#rs\\" (as Turner calls them) who play dumb for the Massah, who ARE dumb, ignorant, foolishly chasing sex and apple wine or brandy. This, despite the fact that Turner himself modifies his speech patterns and accent around the white people but we gather that Nat Turner believes that the others are not in fact performing as they behave and speak in this way even when nary a white man is around, whose eyes he never meets, It is just such an act of indignation (a white slave owner forces to black slaves to fight each other and a crowd of black men- bond and free - cheer) that first causes Turner to stand up and admonish these men to take pride. He thus becomes known as the Reverend.Still, between the foolish bumbling of the slaves and the white skin of all others, Nat Turner feels hatred: Another sin.Perhaps the greatest element is the sin of doubt, since Turner was very sure of his mission until the very day it began. A wide-spread mass murder that would cost the lives of nearly two hundred people that began with Nat freezing up- out of fasting exhaustion or of doubt. Nat Turner was the very last execution to occur so he was, fiction and non-fiction, more than aware of the price that some sixty odd black men involved in this mass execution paid, to say nothing of the more than one hundred white deaths, some of them children from infancy to age thirteen, were to suffer at his hand.The strongest element of Styron's book is that upon careful thought we are forced to look upon the bottom line: birthright. As it has always been. In 1966, Styron's book won the Pulitzer in the midst of the National Civil Rights Movement (the first). As we think of the white two year old who died by the hatchet blow of one of Turner's men and think anything other than his death was caused by a miracle of birth? And Nat himself, as a very young boy, was forced to watch his mother raped by a white visitor at the plantation simply because of how he was born? The mind can continue on thinking: A white man in America is, by birth, the luckiest person on the planet, a white woman in America is second- though only slightly higher than a black man in America. A Jewish child born in Poland in 1930 was no more lucky than a Jewish Child born in 4145BC. A black man born in the Congo from any time in history right up to this writing is incredibly unlucky.Birthright. Birthwrong. And a million stories that exist as a result. It is hard to draw the line between fiction and non-fiction. If you want to live through reading in the time period here through non-fiction, then read Elizabeth Dowling Taylor's recently published A Slave In The White House which not only outlines the same domesticity for both skin colors but even touches upon Nat Turner. The difference is that a story that is told well is remarkably rare. And William Styron, the generation between Faulkner, Hemingway, Steinbeck and Irving, Lamb and Kingsolver has written a book well worthy of study. Do not read it fast. Treat yourself to some self- education. Rest in between sections and when you find yourself breathless, put the book down instead of turning pages ahead to see how long before there is a break of some kind- a literary park bench on which to rest- because writers like Styron are rare and books like The Confessions of Nat Turner even more rare.Rarer still is a reader who does the book justice. This book is just as relevant today as it was in 1966. A pity? Yes. At the same time, it was just as relevant in 4145BC and that too is a pity. Things aren't better. Yes, we have a black person, but I've heard him called a \\"nig#er\\" by more than a half dozen people- one in writing. My daughter is a white woman who is married to a black man and not only do the whites in her town brandish them with words of hate but so do the blacks.My first submission of this review was returned as \\"unpublishable\\" because it did not make the computer scan for obscenities. To me, the act of hatred is far more obscene than the word nig#ger in quotation marks.There are many reasons for all of you to read this book. Joy. Appreciation of art. Responsibility. There but for the Grace of God. History. Thinking. Future. Many more reasons. And if that isn't enough, simply because this is one of the four most powerful books ever written. Even if you read this back in the 70's, it's well worth picking up again. Aftrer all, you're 45 years older now."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is an extremely controversial book. Before one comments on racism, it seems best to explain who you are. I am a caucasian male who would be classified as liberal. I acknowledge that, from my perspective, I don't always see racism or feel it in the same way as many minorities do. As with anyone, I can only view things from my perspective.I found this book to be beautifully written, heartbreaking and with many layers.As a previous reviewer wrote, this was a book where no character was portrayed as fully good or fully bad.Nat Turner was highly intelligent and his rage and actions were understandable given the horrific injustice of slavery. I think his portrayal was complex and sympathetic. I felt I understood why a man exposed to what he had been exposed to and treated as chattel would act as he did. I was horrified by some of the choices to kill children but again I can't say how I would act in his situation.This is a very hard hitting, disturbing work and I admire it tremendously. A point that is made very clearly is that slaveowners were different. Some were sympathetic and some were abusive. In the end, their characteristics did not save them. They were all slaveowners and were targets of the uprising. There were no good slaveowners and I like that this point was made.There is a segment where Turner lusts for a young white girl and some believe that this is a demonstration of racism in that it propagates the idea that all black men want white women. I think it is a lot more complex than that. As Styron writes in his afterword, Turner only killed one person personally and it was a young girl who he likely knew. Styron invented a story to connect the two and it made for a very powerful scene when Turner kills her.Whether you think this is racist or not, I'd encourage you to read it.I think it's an absolute masterpiece and viewing it as racist seems a very twisted interpretation."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Upon it's publication, William Styron's \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" was hailed by The New York Times as \\"a triumph\\", and described as \\"the most profound fictional treatment of slavery in our literature\\" by The New Republic. Despite these and other glowing reviews, the book was also denounced as racist garbage which perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about African-Americans - particularly the stereotype of the sexual aggressive black male.I will talk more about this in a moment, but first I would like to say that I did not find anything racist about this novel. I found it instead to be a raw, brutal, yet strangely beautiful, work about the horror and injustice of slavery. While there are several scenes of physical brutality and deprivation between masters and slaves in this novel, Styron, through the voice of Nat, focuses more on the grinding psychological and emotional toll of slavery. Even in Virginia, the setting of the novel, where the condition of the average slave was considered \\"not that bad\\" by the standards of the time, the soul-crushing, mind-annihilating condition of being human chattel was an overwhelming burden. Nat's description of this sort of \\"life\\", and his fiery rage at the white characters of this novel are truly terrifying and unforgettable.Nat himself is portrayed as a complex and (usually) sympathetic character. He is neither a zealot or a mad-man or a one-dimensional symbol. Styron notably leaves out some of the known biographic details of Turner in his narrative - Turner's wife and child, for example - perhaps in order to develop (the fictional) Nat's inner-conflicts regarding love, hate, sexuality and sanctity, all of which are central to the novel. To return to the above-mentioned allegations of racism, it will not give too much away to reveal that Nat at one point fantasizes about raping a white woman after she reveals her own vulnerability to him and several other slaves. I saw this, and similar scenes, not as a stereotypical portrayal of uncontrollable, animal lust (a la \\"Gone with the Wind\\") but rather as a symptom of mental and emotional confusion/frustration stemming from a cruel lifetime of hatred, betrayal and deprivation. Other, perhaps less \\"self aware\\", black characters I believe are similarly meant to be viewed as products of their environments. This was my interpretation of the more controversial aspects of the novel, and I hope that other readers will not have their views towards an entire race of people diminished or altered by scenes which, I believe, are meant to shock the reader into a deeper understanding of the iniquities of human bondage.This is a deeply haunting work of fiction (and I emphasize the word fiction, as other reviewers before me have) and one that will be hard to forget. Read this with an open mind (and a copy of the historical accounts of Turner's revolt near at hand) and hopefully you were be brought to a deeper understanding not only of slavery and early American history, but also the strength and frailty of the human soul."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I read this book for my book club and I thought it was beautifully written. It has stayed with me for weeks now. I love when a book does that. I'm glad I wasn't swayed by controversy. I had no problem with the fact that the author was white and using a black voice(maybe because I'm white - but I do like when an author gets the voice right and I thought Styron did that). I didn't understand the charges of racism after reading the book. Sometimes I wonder if, what some people find uncomfortable, they label as racist or sexist or whatever. Anyway, I would encourage everyone to read this book because it gave me a fresh awareness of a huge part of U.S. history, it reminded me that there are always gray areas to consider and it was a great novel. You might think so too."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This book is captivating. Its reflection on a history that too many people have forgotten (or at the very least pretend happened longer ago than it did) is something that people should be required to recollect. The perspective that Styron gives through the eyes of slave revolt leader Nat Turner is chilling- regardless of to what degree it reflects the &quot;real&quot; perspective of Turner. The truth is that we have no idea how closely it resembles Turner's perspective. But to have perhaps been given a glimpse of such an interesting piece of American history is something to not be missed.If you do nothing else, pick up this book and read the first two paragraphs of Part III (Study War). Not only is it an excellent example of Styron's ability to write gracefully, but the content left me speechless. It is beautiful and frightening and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron, a gifted writer outdid himself with this book. His concise detail gives us an inside view on the depth of feeling employed by the subject of this book. The book while concise and tender pulls us in as these events take place. As Mailer delves deeper into the mind of Nat Turner, we cannot help but feel a sense of the suffering this man endured and this is what gives us perspective into this tragedy as it unfolds. A compelling masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"When I got the book I thought is was a true diary of Nat Turner, then when I got to the end it wrote about speculation of whether or not even his confession was true. However the book was interesting and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The maxim in writing is to write about a topic which you know: this author violated that principle when he chose to write in the first person singular the view of a black man who lived in the south (Virginia) about 100 years prior to the white author's experience in North Carolina.Yet, knowledge can be gathered. A Davidson/Duke-educated liberal arts major made a great, if not titanic-sized, effort to be \\"real\\" when delivering to us what Nat would have seen in the early 19th century. And, that effort was well received with a Pulitzer Prize - probably the highest acclamation this author perceived in recognition of his craft.But, sometimes the well educated writer cannot leave the typewritten page and his vocabulary transcends into the dialogue or thought passages of the uneducated but bright eponymous protagonist. For instance, would a slave of the 1830's use these words in everyday language?: sedulous, caparisoned, bruited, analphabetic, empyrean, and many others. I know he read the Bible front to back. I know he memorized many passages of the Bible. And, this education occurred later in life, without much help, and probably with a very limited access to a dictionary - thereby making many passages of the Bible readable for phonetic fun - but not necessarily understood prose.What is important is that we know this murderer is a good man. What led to the revolt which is the focus of the book is more important than the revolt itself. By the time you have followed his 20th birthday, you realize he is the victim of not only slavery--but of capitalistic greed and false representation which make acceptance of future white person's promises everything false.Only one person in the book speaks to him as an equal and ultimately as a mentor. A young pretty girl says about black people , \\"I happen to know that where I live n Southampton my mother hires a darky slave who is almost as intelligent and refined and clean and religious and profoundly understanding of the Bible as Doctor Simpson (the local preacher) .\\" That was her description of Nat Turner.In the end that girl dies, as does Nat. And, about 50 white and 50 black people - most of them innocents. A bad stewing insensitively ordained lifestyle centering upon slavery was the cause of the horrible result. That was well delivered by this author. Very well delivered."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Employing one of the ugliest chapters in American history, William Styron created something in \\"The Confessions Of Nat Turner\\" that transcends racial and political boundaries even as it defines them. It is a haunting rumination on the sadness of the human condition.Nat Turner is a slave in Virginia in the early 1830s. All his life he has been better off than most slaves, sometimes even comfortable, to the point where he once looked down on his fellow blacks. But slowly he changes, a moment crystallized when a master promises Nat his freedom while a coffle of slaves en route to Georgia pass by. Nat's reading of the Bible enforces a calling he hears to serve God by freeing his fellow men. It's a calling that will leave hundreds dead, and Nat a broken, self-questioning man in his cell awaiting execution.A magnet for controversy since its 1967 publication, \\"Confessions\\" is a white secular liberal's take on a black religious zealot's life a century-and-change later. As many reviewers here point out, it's not meant as history but fiction. Turner himself is something of a mystery to historians, his only words come down to us through the writings of his oppressors. Styron wasn't writing here to fill a hole, however; he wants to employ Turner in a different cause than Turner's own, to examine how one might find meaning in a meaningless existence full of strife and injustice. Once you go with that, rather than fight it as a vision perhaps different from yours or the historic record, \\"Confessions\\" becomes a helluva ride.A central riddle of the story is why the rebellion happened where it did. Virginia in the 1830s was a far milder place for slaves than was the Deep South. Styron portrays Jerusalem, where Turner led the slaves to not just rise up but indiscriminately slay every white, as almost pleasant. The greatest harm done Nat by a white is by a well-meaning owner who simply doesn't follow through on his good intentions. Styron's point, I think, is this: It's not the individuals but the institution itself that brings the wrath of centuries down upon man, woman, and babe alike.\\"Does it seem a hopeless paradox that the less toilsome became the circumstances of my life the more I ached to escape it?\\" Turner asks us, his silent audience in his cell. \\"That the more tolerable and human white people became in their dealings with me the keener was my passion to destroy them?\\"Styron writes with an easy eloquence and a direct point of view that makes the pages whiz by. As his character of Nat is the narrator, we come to know him from the narration as much as by his actions. There are moments of uneasy levity, like some of the antics of Nat's various white masters, but overall the tone is serious. Even when action is sparse, you know it's coming, and when it does, the descriptions are ferocious.Styron spares no one's sensibilities. Nat has an explicitly rendered dalliance with another male slave, and sexually tangled feelings about white women, one in particular, which seems to influence his religious visions. His rebellion is presented as a take-no-prisoners escape attempt, rather than a suicide mission of retribution, which undercuts how many radicals prefer to see Turner today. White Southerners, which Styron was himself, are depicted in various shadings of damned and depraved.Styron struggles, as do the historians, with the concept of who Turner was and what he wanted, but I think where he succeeds, brilliantly, is in finding some principle for his existence. If there is any hope for man, it is in the passion to right wrongs against impossible odds. Alas, another brilliant aspect to Styron's book is its suggestion of ultimate hopelessness.Bleakness does not equal greatness, but when backed up by the depth of knowledge, of human feeling, of pure nerve and biting wit, that \\"Confessions\\" contains, you don't put it down, let alone argue with it. The arguments come after, which is where they should with works of art like this."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner, published in 1967 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, is one of the best known works by William Styron. Turner was the literate slave who plotted and led the rebellion against white families in southeast Virginia in 1831, \\"hastening 55 persons to their grave\\", as Styron phrases it from the mouth of Turner's court-appointed attorney. Styron bases his novel on the actual confessions of Turner, recorded by the same attorney during Turner's short incarceration before hanging. Styron offers up his intention \\"to try to re-create a man and his era, and to produce a work that is less an 'historical novel' in conventional terms than a meditation on history\\".Styron's powers of description are on considerable display. He pulls you into the story as surely as if he were there. He thoroughly captures the burning resentment and ultimate hatred produced by a lifetime of degradation under the institution of human slavery. Styron takes the time to portray several types of slaveholders, from Nat's first enlightened owner who helped to educate him and made extensive plans for his ultimate freedom, to a pair of surly and benighted men into whose hands he fell, and ultimately to the benign but traditional master who was the first victim of the uprising.Styron made me thoroughly identify with the slaves all the way up until the actual murders began. At that point he describes the brutality in such detail that my horror buttons all went off and I saw the perpetrators as ruthless criminals. It's clear that slavery was the original mortal sin of our country, and that one cannot sow the wind without reaping the whirlwind."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I found this book to be quite challenging. I wasn't sure of the message that it was sending. Nat Turner's &quot;owner&quot; by the account treated him well. Yet, Nat Turner killed him. Why? Is the very act of owning a slave justification for the killing of the owner? Was Nat Turner just a madman as the book seems to imply? Or, was he so mistreated that he was a product of his times?This is a very thought-provoking book. Regardless of what may think of the main character or even that terrible period of our history in which people were enslaved, you should read this book. It gives a different perspective of that time. It is excellent fodder for discussion of not only Nat Turner and what happened in that particular revolt, but the entire institution of slavery. I am not sure I really understand this issue and its long term implications on our society. This book, however, helped me understand that I don't understand."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"A most interesting book written by a very intropsective author. Much like the book &quot;A lesson Before Dying&quot; it's focus is on American slavery but it's message is global. when we oppress others our crimes destroy the fabric of society. Yet it is wrong to place Nat Turner in the pantheon of Revolutionary heroes as some would like to see him. Nat Turner was more than likely unbalanced, he had a non-existant plan of action or behavior and his primary victims were children and women: a true sign of cowardice in any culture."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I read this novel when it came out and was aware of the criticisms of it at the time. I would have preferred to read a novel about Nat Turner's rebellion written by an African-American man or woman because I think such a writer could more deeply understand and depict the pain, rage, hatred, and justified rebellion that a Black slave would feel. However, I had and have no objection to reading such a novel written by a Caucasian man or woman. It's the truth of the story that matters. But on this level -- the story -- I feel that Styron didn't write a compelling book. The book is 480 pages long and felt like 680 pages long. It goes on and on, repeating things over and over. It seems unfocused. And the Nat Turner who emerges isn't knowable in any way that I could discern. Styron was a great writer: this book was not his best."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I really liked this book.

It felt believable and engrossing. However, the book should have been half the length. Scenarios, thoughts, daily life details are repeated over and over. By halfway through the book, you will know all you need to know and can stop reading. I wish I had."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner is one of Styron's most powerful works, a fascinating exercise in imagination. Styron begins with a true historical event -- a slave rebellion that struck terror into the hearts of white southerners before ultimately being quelled. Styron sees in the psychological tinder box ignited by the rebellion, and in its leader, Nat Turner, a little-understood passion play. Critics who complain that Styron doesn't answer some historical questions: &quot;Gee, Nat's owner didn't treat him so bad, why'd he rebel?&quot; miss the point. What fascinates Styron, and a careful reader, is what the fact of rebellion does to the minds and emotions of those it touches. Besides, anyone who finishes Styron's novel without a sense of why Turner led the rebellion wasn't reading very carefully; the whole novel turns on Styron's hypothetical answer to this question. One of the central conceits of the book is Styron's imagination that Turner could have been fueled by his sense that he had been chosen by God to lead his fellow slaves in an uprising. Styron paints a powerful picture of one driven by the conviction -- whether divinely inspired or delusional -- that he is a vengeful avatar called upon by a higher power to wreak vengeance on the perceived enemies of God. There is an obvious parallel here to the Harper's Ferry uprising led by John Brown (whom Russell Banks, in Cloudsplitter, depicts as similarly driven by mania), as well as to figures like Joan D'Arc. Styron, who wrote a moving memoir discussing his own struggle with mentally illness, has a special fascination with, and sensitivity to, such issues."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"\\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" was written from a jail house confession that Nat Turner made and which William Styron turned into a novel. Like the other reviews here say, Nat Turner led the only somewhat successful slave rebellion in the South.William Styron was very brave to write this book. And he was much pilloried by Black intellectuals for having done so.The novel is beautiful written and the prose is lyric. We are drawn into Nat's life, the life of the slaves around him, and his masters. They taught Nat to read and treated him kindly. So it is with unexpected horror that we see him lead the blacks there in Virginia to rebel against and hack apart their masters with axes. According to Styron, Turner never butchered anyone. But he lost control of his rebel army and stood by as his owners and friends were hacked to pieces by the most violent slaves. That is the great irony depicted by the novel. On minute we have peaceful chariot rides with the mistress of the plantation. The next we have brutal decapitation. The reason that Turner rose up in rebellion is never clearly explained. The reader is left to draw his own conclusion. That men can turn to monsters is very much thematic here.I think what upset the black intellectuals so much was that William Styron broke two taboos. First he depicted the slave owners in this novel as benevolent-there is not supposed to be any possibility of that so say the revisionists. (Styron points out that slaves in the cotton fields of Missippi suffered more. Farming in Virginia was not so large-scale so the work was or a different nature.) But perhaps Styron's greater sin was describing in vivid detail Nat Turner's affection for a white female. That this part of the novel was made up and that is touched on an unmentionable taboo got Sytron into much trouble. A group of black intellectuals wrote essays that attacked Styron's novel. Sytron could not understand their dismay and was hurt by their assault. I cannot remember if James Baldwin was among the vengeful. I know that he and Styron were friends."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I initially purchased this book to read for two reasons: First, it was written by William Styron, who wrote the great \\"Sophie's Choice;\\" and second, it won a Pulitzer Prize. It was only after I was into the book that I learned that this vintage sixties' book was the subject of a major controversy over the depiction of the title character, Nat Turner.I learned that Styron openly acknowledged fictionalizing large portions of Turner's life, including his motivations for leading the slave revolt. I also learned that Styron's largely fictionalized portrait of Turner outraged many black leaders of the time. Rather than painting Turner (entirely) as a hero, called to action by the injustices of slavery, Styron created a darker picture of a man fixated on religion, a vision of himself as a prophet, and frustrated by lust and desire (particularly, for a young, blond haired white girl).As I read the book, I search my own feelings, and felt that if I were black, I would certainly have objected similarly. We all need our heroes, who become much larger as symbols than they could ever be as people. For the sake of those that come after, such icons are perhaps entitled to be treated with a greater level of sensitivity and care--even at the cost of literary restraint.It is here that the story gets fascinating. After I finished the novel, I read Styron's Afterword. Styron was truly stung by the criticism and in the Afterword, provided an elegant and persuasive defense of his writings. While I will not say that Styron entirely changed my position, he definitely made me see the other side of the argument. The dialogue between Styron and his critics not only allows the reader to consider one of the great social and political issues of our time, but permits the reader a unique insight into the thinking of a great writer--and suffices, in and of itself, as a reason for reading this novel. MAKE SURE YOUR VERSION OF THE NOVEL HAS THIS AFTERWORD.Putting the issue aside as to the real \\"Nat Turner,\\" the novel itself is beautifully written. The characters are fully developed and believable. The description of the system of slavery and the relationship between whites and blacks feel very real, and very accurate. Styron shows us good and bad of each race, and how all of them are bound by the system of slavery and their actions directly the product of it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"being or is this book written by a white guy about an entire ethnic group? I have to be able to talk to you all about slavery, the buying and selling of human beings in the United States of America, a peculiar institution abolished by law only a few generations ago. Styron's book was a fictional account dealing not peripherally with these issues and specifically with one man, a United States of America slave. If there is a problem with the scholarship, judge the book by whatever incoherent and misguided poor writing that is to be found. I was moved with sympathy, tears, anguish, anger and ultimately love by this sublime novel. I wonder what Nat Turner would have said about Styron's adaptation? It is preposterous for anyone now living to decide the man's opinion for him. Styron is an artist. He is a brilliant writer of fiction. Obviously an opinion of my own, I'm jublilant we may each agree or disagree with my analysis. What am I hearing from critics that proclaim Styron's, Confessions of Nat Turner, racist? Am I hearing the equivalent of, &quot;You can't write about that! You're the wrong shade of human!&quot;? Let's keep talking and agreeing and disagreeing. William Styron initiated another dialoge of magnificent proportions."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Styron's fictional account of Nat Turner offends because his man is neither the pitiless avenger of racial injustice nor the hapless victim of events completely beyond his control. If you're looking for the tale of a superman or mythic hero, look elsewhere. This is a novel of an ordinary man who just wanted to live as other men do: to make of his life what he chose. I was deeply moved by Styron's portrayal of Nat Turner as alternately inspired and defeated, honorable and cowardly. I'll always remember Nat's anger and pain as they carry his compatriot off to hang him - &quot;Leave him ALONE! You're hurting him. You've been hurting him all his life!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"In August 1831, in a remote region of south-eastern Virginia, took place the only effective and sustained revolt in the history of American Negro slavery. That year, a black man, Nat Turner, awaits death in a prison cell. He is a slave, a preacher and the leader of the revolt. Mr Styron based his novel on the single significant contemporary document concerning this insurrection, namely a brief pamphlet of twenty pages called &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, published in Richmond in 1831. The confession Turner made to his jailers under the duress of his God is a narrative describing a good man's transformation into an avenging angel even as it encompasses all the betrayals, cruelties and humiliations that made up slavery - and that is still present in the collective psyches of both races.This magnificent book brilliantly depicts the American past in a dazzling narrative."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner is an excellent historical rendition of Nat's psychological and physical rebellion. Although he was unsucessful from wiping the white race out of Jerusalum and off of the planet, during the antebellum his failure makes an informative read. Styron writes a chilling account of Turner's revolt, and insane biblical visions.As a boy Nat was well treated compared to the majority of the slaves and was even taught to read by his owners wife. Eventually his owner introduced him to carpentry, which became his successful trade. However it is obvious that Turner was mentally unstable due to whatever harsh circumstances he might have delt with as a child, young adult or even adult. This book, and the rebellion itself, really produces a picture of how disturbing America's actions were during that period. It also illustrates how slavery can kill a persons mental integerity, breaking them down to the point where they create such a heinous crime.The Confessions of Nat Turner by, William Styron, is an admirable piece. Styron lyrically produced a galvanizing, well written book, that is a great read for anyone, not just history buffs."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Nat Turner","review":"From the perspective of a 41 year old white woman, this is a book that will change your life.

The book is beautiful, horrific, unforgettable.What strikes me most about it is how Styron, years before he wrote Sophie's Choice, writes about another Holocaust in a way that forces readers to confront the history \\"we\\" (meaning the white wielders of power) have made for ourselves through our complicity in slavery.I've just begun to research African American readers' in the general public and academia responses to this work.

She outdoes herself here when Sophie spends the whole book doing one dumb thing after another until she makes a lollapalooza of a boneheaded decision at the end.Hart is not a great deal easier on her other characters. The women are, in varying degrees indecisive, spiteful, malicious, interfering, uncomprehending, neurotic and victimized. The men are contemptably weak, homicidal, suicidal, obtuse, generally incompetent and given to stalking.This formula seems to please a goodly section of the reading public, since Ms. Hart has published many books and sold a lot of copies, hence the perhaps overgenerous three-star rating.As for my own reaction, I must confess a certain guilty pleasure in reading page after page, speculating what imbecility will appear in the next chapter and then be topped in the one after that.

However much you may disagree with Maria's risky decision to cede custody of her three young children to her husband, I believe she deserves credit for great courage in sharing with us her unusual story, knowing that so many will find her actions indefensible. While some may accept her rationale for allowing her husband to retain the marital home while she moved to an inexpensive nearby apartment, her subsequent relocation to California for her lover's sake seriously distances her from her kids in NJ and raises many questions about her judgment. Nonetheless, we remember that this is a woman who had suffered the unimaginable loss of her 3-year old daughter to cancer; once freed post-divorce from housewife/mom burdens, Housden was, moreover, successful in turning her terrible tragedy into \\"Hannah's Gift\\", a best-seller that many regard as an inspirational gift to parents coping with a child's death. In short, this is a very complicated picture of a woman trapped between responsibilities to her children and a search for personal fulfillment that may require her leaving them. No doubt written as a rebuttal to those who insist that a Mom's only place is at home, I found Housden -- for all her new-agey soulfulness -- far too cursory in responding to the profound questions her story raises. For example, she describes her reaction when first hearing her husband's divorce proposal that he become primary custodian: \\"I felt as if life was being squeezed out of my heart. 'Are you crazy?' [she exclaimed]. I was willing to entertain a lot of new possibilities in my life, but I could never leave my kids.\\" Imagine then reading a mere two paragraphs later that --within less than a week -- reassurances from her lawyer convinced Maria \\"there was no need to panic\\" over loss of primary custody and \\"intellectually... I could see how [her husband's] proposal might make sense.\\"Another anecdote that eroded the author's credibility: living in California in her paramour's home and working on her book about Hannah's death, Maria tells of a call from her agent, urging her to fly to NY to meet with editors who had expressed interest in her manuscript. \\"I had only $700 left in my bank account, the final remnants of my divorce settlement. I had no job, no source of income, and in two weeks, my kids were scheduled to come spend the whole summer with me.\\" Round-trip plane fare of $400 reduced her funds to a pittance for the stay in NY, and the reaction, as described by Maria, of Roger, her lover? \\"'Are you crazy? You only have three hundred dollars left,' he said.\\" Forgive me if I find inexplicable that this is all that Maria recounts of her interchange with the dreamy man for whose sake she put 3000 miles between her and her three kids! When we learn a few sentences later that she received a $250,000 offer from Bantam, it almost comes across as much a smug rejoinder to Roger as a wondrous reward for her desperate gamble.Indeed, by the end of her book, I was confused about the nature of the author's relationship with Roger; a huge portion of the book is devoted to the single rapturous week that Maria spent at a silent retreat where, while still married to her first husband, she meets and beds Roger in an idyll she later tells a friend was right out of The Bridges of Madison County; at her wedding, \\"I looked into Roger's eyes and could think of nothing more to dream.\\" Romantic perfection appears to be her reward for risking all for the man she loves -- that is, until the second to last page of the book, when for the first time she mention's the challenge of dealing with Roger's dark side and continuing doubts about having given first husband Claude primary custody of their kids. In a very brief mystifying epilogue, she seems almost defensive in acknowledging that it is important for the reader to know that she and Roger, although still married and in love, have his and her homes in NY and NJ, respectively, and \\"live our lives separately and together.\\"Similarly, we are left with contradictory feelings about Claude, toward whom she had sufficiently positive feelings to be able to leave their two toddlers and young son for her new life 3000 miles away, but who, she reveals at book's end, is -- even years later -- still unwilling to utter or write a single word to her or even look at her when they crossed paths. In the book's final sentence, however, Housden concludes that her love for Claude -- mindful though she was of his setting a terrible example for the kids -- remained 'solid and unwavering'. Go figure!The riddles of the author's relationship with both Claude and Roger had me wondering about the real feelings that Housden and her children had for each other. By book's end, we have learned remarkably little from Housden about how the children truly adjusted to life without Mom.In sum, Housden has without doubt boldly journeyed where few other (healthy, sane) women would dare to go (much less tell the world about), but her travelogue is strangely disquieting in its superficial coverage of such an extraordinarily rare experience."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"There are times in life when it is best to quit while you are ahead and perhaps this author should have paid heed to that advice. While I loved 'Hannah's Gift', sadly I did not enjoy this book at all. I agree with the premise that there are times when givng the father primary custody is the best thing to do but........I am not sure this is one of those situations. She shows her ex-husband to be physically abusive, noncommunicative, unsupportive and seemingly unaware of the emotional needs of others and yet this is who she leaves her children with? I suspect the hired nanny ended up being the primary caregiver because I found it difficult to imagine her ex-husband stepping up to the plate.In my opinion, Maria seems to have a very cavalier attitude towards childbearing and I found this disturbing. She realizes early on that her marriage is troubled yet keeps having child after child, seemingly on the spur of the moment.Clearly, she is her children's main source of comfort and emotional support then she leaves them to 'find herself' as an artist. Anyway you slice it, this would have to be devastating for a very young child. I have to agree with her friend who called her 'selfish'.The part about hooking up with this guy while she is on a retreat that is supposed to help her heal after her daughter's death was just plain creepy. And it read like a Harlequin Romance novel. I can only imagine the complete and utter devastation the death of a child brings, and I kept trying to see her actions through the lens of a still grieving parent, but ended up just as puzzled by her choices.In the end I would have to say,\\" No Maria. It wasn't woth leaving your children to write this book\\"."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"There is simply no reason to buy \\"Unraveled\\" -- there is nothing inspiring, educational or even hopeful in this book. It is like reading a bad blog. The author is self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, and nothing in the book gave me any idea how to cope with the tragedy in my own life better or how to live the life I was meant to live. Losing your child is not an excuse to do whatever you want or to abandon your other children. I know this, because I too lost a 3 year old daughter to cancer, and am now going through a divorce. As for the reader who asked, in her review, why Maria wrote this book, the answer is obvious: the money from \\"Hannah's Gift\\" was running out, and she needed the income. The fact is, if she had nothing better to say, she would have been better off not writing any more books and going back to her old career in finance."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"The author's first book, \\"Hannah's Gift\\" has a wonderful natural flow to it, while this book seems to go overboad with her constant \\"insights\\". Her analogies are a bit overboard, \\"a little paper boat of hope on the river of the world\\". The thing that bothered me the most is her new aged \\"wisdom\\" of justifying all her selfish actions (committing adultery actually made her feel closer to God!). Every other sentance is \\"my life\\", \\"my wants\\", \\"my dreams\\", \\"my being\\". \\"Me, me, me\\" and \\"I, I, I\\" permeate the entire book. She simply can't be the \\"woman I know I was meant to be\\" and \\"the life I know I was meant to live\\" and all other sorts of nonsense without LEAVING HER CHILDREN to live 3,000 miles away from them to live in California (another one of HER dreams). Her youngest was only 3 years old! That is undeniably SELFISH and no amount of psycho-babble can excuse her behavior. When you have children, you raise them! She calls herself \\"brave\\" and has loads of \\"courage\\" for leaving to live her new life. She travels to Moracco for a spiritual walk. She moves to England. She basically does whatever the hell she wants & sugarcoats her behavior with her lame insights.....all the while, her kids have no mother! She does \\"visit\\" them every other weekend. Big deal! She also has the nerve to criticise her ex-husband for no longer wanting to speak or see her after their divorce. Well, I don't blame him! If you loved Hannah's Gift and feel you must read this book, get it from the library like I did. I'm glad I didn't fork out any money to encourage more books like this one from the author."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"I read Hannah's Gift, by the same author, and so I know she is capable of writing a very touching and well written book, and that she is a caring, loving mother. If I hadn't known that, I would have not found out from this book. I have no idea why she wrote it. So she is not the primary custodial parent after a divorce---I don't find that terribly unusual or shocking! She needed a retreat for a few weeks after going through the hardest thing a mother can go through---understandable, but not really worth a book. She found a new man and married him---okay. Maybe I am way off here, but I felt like the hidden reason for this book was to tell how mean her ex-husband was, in a way that says she is NOT doing that---she goes out of her way to be kind to him, but lets us know through facts that he never communicates with her, doesn't allow her in the house her children live in, doesn't let her even know when they are hurt or in special events...lots of things like that. It seems like the book is very defensive, and I don't think the author needed to be. She has done nothing wrong, and doesn't need to write a book to explain herself. In fact, I think not much will be served and a lot could be damaged by putting out in print the context and events leading up to her first intimate encounter with her current husband. Do her children really need a book like that to be written? I don't want to be critical or mean, but I really don't understand what this book was written for, and don't feel it taught me a lot or opened up any new insights for me."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"I started this book but I had to stop reading it.

It's not the major life changes she decided to make ten years after Hannah died at the age of three. The book HANNAH'S GIFT should have eased the sorrow she felt; the child lived a year after being diagnosed with cancer and knew she was dying (the way the mother prepared her for the final battle is a precursor to the way she set out on her own for self-preservation ten years later. Will was seven (the age I was when my mother died of cancer), and after some miscarriages, the mother has two more daughters, one before Hannah died.\\"Many of the bereaved moms I knew had spent weeks after their child's death refusing to get out of bed or hiding in the bottom of a dark closet. My life hadn't afforded the same possibility to me, and because of that, I felt that my children had suffered more than they needed to due to my shortcomings and exhaustion as a bereaved mother. I was anxious to go on my retreat, in order to rest and figure out what needed to happen next. I also longed for even simpler comforts -- being able to sleep late, not having to worry about making a meal, or about picking up after anyone else. Life without Hannah would be bearable only if I were able to integrate what she had taught me about being honest, about what mattered, and if I were able to be the mother my children needed and deserved.\\" At the retreat, another person enters her life, and she actually became 'unraveled', a good title for this odyssey which shows clearly that she had to escape the agony. 'Unraveled' in this case means mentally unstable (some might say, deranged) and unable to think about anyone but herself.Other women have endured worst marriage experiences; some even killed their children in the throes of insanity. It wasn't the child's death which sent her on a spiral into being an \\"independent woman, no matter who gets hurt.\\" Those other little girls, Margaret and Madelaine, didn't ask to be born. The youngest is now eight years old, a very impressionable age. This woman had it all, money, trips, cars, Las Vegas vacations, living on both coasts; you'd think she is Joan Crawford and Debbie Reynolds rolled into one. One thing for sure, her children (Will would be seventeen now.) will not respect her after this book.This is a disturbing in-depth (doesn't she know that some things are better left unsaid?) account of her unsettling 'take' on motherhood. She will find herself alone and abandoned in her old age, a bitter old woman maybe still writing about going off to Europe \\"to find herself.\\" But, who cares? When a woman has sex which results in the birth of a child, she is responsible to see that child gets emotional support through the many phases of growing up.This different kind of mother is totally irresponsible, and the day will come when she wakes up and realizes the gross harm she did to those children. What amazes me is her gawl in revealing what most families deem their 'dirty laundry.' It shows a total lack of morals and integrity, a female Truman Capote, caring only for self. She's living her dream now but, eventually, age will catch up with her -- and Roger and Claude will both find younger women. She's not so unusual. Many women have led secret lives fulfilling their fantasies while still able to care for and nurture the children they brought into this world. It's easy to become 'unraveled,' not so easy to become complete again. Her child's death is not an excuse to flaunt convention. Writing such 'confessional garbage' at her age is not adequate therapy. What goes around comes around; we pay for our sins sooner or later."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"Although I found this book interesting, the more I read, the less I liked or agreed with the choices the author made. I didn't read her first book, because as a mom myself, I guess I'm a coward, I can't read about dying children. The more I read this book, the more the author's selfishness came through. It's all about her, her choices, her this, her that. I tried not to be judgemental, she lost a child and how can that not change you? But to leave her three young children with a man she describes as emotionally abusive and in at least one incident, physically abusive, shows her consideration was not for her children but for herself. I wonder how the children will look at this when they are grown. I hope for her sake, her choices are worth the day to day loss of her children, and the possible loss of the respect of her children when they are grown."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"Don't read this book/don't buy this book, do not support psycho-spiritual bubble written to justify abandonment of 3 small kids. Camouflage - spiritual search, the banal reality - a man. Author lets down 3 kids to be with a man met during a \\"spiritual\\" retreat, where they become instant lovers. She experiences very spiritual awakenings , to quote an example: \\"in the light of the morning after, the place where he entered me still numb from his fullness, I knew that in that moment of ultimate vulnerability, I had become both his and mine\\".Maria, there are many prolific female writers, creative women who at the same time nourish their children, who do not find their children an obstacle to become spiritually rich human beings. Many of these women divorce their husbands but very few abondon their children as you did. Children are entitled to have mother around every moment of their small lives, to have every bruise kissed, to have books read at bedtime. They need their mother, not a live-in baby sitter. Do not fool yourself and your readers, you abandoned your kids. Kids who had already dramatic loss in their lives. Don't judge your husband as selfish when he refused any personal contact with you after you abandoned your kids. You have no right to judge him, he was not the selfish one.Maria Galus, MD, PhD, mother of two"},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"I read this book in one sitting, at least one sitting as allowed by three young children, and the words moved me more than any book I've read in recent history. The questions she deals with face every woman and mother. To follow her journey is to follow your own heart as her words resonate so deeply into the spaces we don't have time for or don't pay enough attention to. I would imagine that the first reaction to the book is one of eyebrows raised; a leap to immediate judgement about a mother who would give up primary custoday. That is the magic of this book - because when you read the beauty, love and committment of this mother and woman, it simply can't be taken away from her and her children. I learned a great deal about myself because this push and pull between judgement and recognition was palpable. We all have to challenge our assumptions and expectations of what a family or a mother is supposed to be - should be - or is expected to look like. Whether or not one believes in the \\"ideal\\" family unit or the \\"perfect\\" mother, that is simply not the truth or reality for the majority of us. Here is a woman and author who has the courage to face that, live with it, and be true to herself and her family. One may not agree with her choices and I suppose that is the point of the book. We don't have to agree or disagree with her choices, but should examine and make our own with the same kind of courage and insight. It is inspiring to see her determination, faith and love in every choice she makes. Whether or not her children are ultimatley the better and happier as a result of her choices is, of course, unknown - but that is the universal truth of being a mother. There is hope here, and I think that is the key."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"Topic: Motherhood/Marriage/Divorce/Next Steps/Love AffairWriting Quality: easy reading, one part made me cry (doesn't happen that often in books), interesting observations on her marriage and her own mental state, though sometimes \\"new-age\\" overabundant, some lyrical phrasing that was a pleasure to read, but parts of it left me in limbo trying to understand the outcomes.Item of Interest: The author, Maria Housden, is married to another author, who I just happened to have purchased several of his books before ever hearing about her. He has written \\"Ten Poems to Change your Life\\" and other poetry compilations. The book, Unraveled, discusses in depth how they met and their relationship. This will undoubtedly be off-putting for some of you, others of you will see it from a different perspective.Recommend It? Maybe -- ending left me uncertain about the author and her feelings about her choices. Recommendation based on your own biases, really. If you think that under no circumstances should a woman give up custody of her children for finding her own truths, then you most likely can skip this story. Those who are open to individual circumstances or simply are curious about this story will probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"Unraveled: The True Story of a Woman Who Dared to Become a Different Kind of Mother","review":"I read Maria Housden's first book, Hannah's Gift, and LOVED her writing style. Maria has a way of making you laugh and cry on the same page. Unraveled was written the same way.This is an amazing book!!I can look at my own life, the life of my neighbors, family and friends and see the experiences (or shades of them) Maria Housden so honestly talks about in Unraveled. I think there are a tremendous number of people that can relate to this book. I think it will also make some people very uncomfortable reading it! I think Unraveled/Maria Housden bravely talks about experiences and thoughts that most people keep secret. The reader may not have lost a child to cancer, or experienced such an unhappy marriage, but maybe they can relate to the author's experience of sitting in church and receiving a compliment on what a wonderful parent or family they are, and secretly knowing the person complimenting would be shocked if they saw how you and your husband were yelling at the kids on the way there! I think that Maria Housden's honesty has us re-look at what our lives are really like and take note. This book is an empowering reminder that we can make changes in our lives, and be authentic in our lives. Not that we have to go to the extreme that Maria Housden did, but we can take an honest inventory and adjust accordingly. It may need small adjustments, it may require significant adjustments. Maria Housden made brave choices for a woman. Notice, if you will, the same choices from a man would not be so shocking, or judged so harshly!!Even as you are reading this book, I would say to those who are tempted to judge the author harshly to look within your own life, or the lives of your family members, close friends, neighbors, confidants and see that Maria Housden's experiences, or shades of it, are a part of many of our lives.

I knew I wanted to read this book and then I saw Maria Housden had written another book Hannah's Gift prior to this one. I thought I should read that first, so I did. Hannah's gift was like a wound...but an engrossing and well written wound.When you read her story (stories) it makes sense that she gave her ex-husband custody of her children. I think she did what was in the best interest of her children. I think she was brave enough to make her decision based on what would be the best for everyone and not what everyone would think of her for it.I think if you don't judge and just listen to her story you can see that she is a very good mother.

This book is about Housden's individual path in life and the choices, often so difficult, she made on behalf of her family. Like her earlier Hannah's Gift, it's honesty is beyond inspired.I speak with some authority. I am the mother of a nine year old girl who became interested Housden's work, and Housden herself and her little girl Hannah and went on to become a nationally known advocate and activist for children with cancer, culminating in winning The New York Liberty Medal for her work last year (at the age of 8) and now having spent a year writing a full length book herself, KIDCOVERY: KIDS HELP KIDS TOWARD RECOVERY which will be published next year. She met Maria when she was seven years old at the beginning of her journey toward helping kids with cancer, and never forgot what she learned from her and Hannah, which has led her everywhere. How can that be measured in a book review? It can't.

If you're a student and want to understand things, I don't recommend it for you."},{"Title":"Genes VI","review":"Gene VI, by Lewin exibits no organization within the chapter nor a system or flow to the material being presented. The figures are incoherently positioned throughout the text, some before the written explanation, some after, but rarely were they coordinated.

I am too however, frightened by all of the positive reviews of this text."},{"Title":"Genes VI","review":"Genes VI is one of the most read books by biochemistry major and minor students taught by me in the area of advanced molecular biochemistry. We have been following this book for the last many years and I find that the book has improved right from its first edition exponentially. The illustrations have been redrawn and made more informative by adding colours. Each chapter has been reviewed to include the latest develoments in the area of genetics and biochemistry. Inclusion of experimental data is highly informative.

Benjamin Lewin has a stunning capacity to be verbose, dense and ultimately inaccurate. In the process of writing the book, more time should have been spent editing, and correcting rather than making elaborate, incorrect figures. It's interesting to note that 80% of the drawings of DNA are in a configuration that probably doesn't occur in nature. I believe it would be difficult for someone to find a single page in the book that didn't have at least one glaring error. My final complaint about this book is the lousy index. If you decide that the information in the book is worth looking at, you will never find it. The index is the smallest index I have seen for a book a quarter the size."},{"Title":"In the Land of the Blue Poppies: The Collected Plant-Hunting Writings of Frank Kingdon Ward (Modern Library Gardening)","review":"We tend to take for granted the intrepid and brave explorers that brought us knowledge of far-off places and new plants and peoples.

Most approach spirituality as a complex, difficult subject. I have often wondered why what we are supposed to be is always covered in so much rhetoric as to muddy up the search?Sonjas perspective is simplicity personified.Simplicity is not to be confused with simple! It is not always &quot;simple&quot; to find our way to healing and light after having been indoctrinated to believe that what we need is an interceedent between us and the unlimited energy field that surrounds as and sustains us as Spiritual creatures.Sonjas &quot;little&quot; book is proof that wonderful things do indeed come in small packages. To find ourselves represented as a cacoon, ready to burst forth with the ability to chart our own course through life with ease and simplicity, is refreshing after all the &quot;Gurus&quot; have made us believe that THEY are the light and MUST be our guides to eternal blessings.I highly recommend Sonjas &quot;little&quot; book to start each of us on OUR pathway to clear spiritual vision."},{"Title":"Clear Vision: Finding Peace in a Troubled World","review":"I have just finished reading my sixth copy of Clear Vision by Sonja Christiansen. I read each of the first five once and then gave them away to people who appeared in my life in a state of confusion. I passed Clear Vision on to them the way one would offer a map to someone who was tired and lost with evening falling.Among a plethora of spiritual self-help books Clear Vision can seem deceptively simple. Christiansen's language is easily understood and, unlike a number of the weightier, more opaque works available, cleaves close to her intention: clear vision. Her message comes through on every page both in language and in layout. The use of open space on each page invites the reader to introduce her or his own vision. The simple sayings from acknowledged spiritual masters are precise indicators of the ways to clear our ways of seeing. Every photograph (each taken by the author) is a visual extension of a concept presented in the book. Although I was at first disappointed that the photographs are in black and white I soon realized that the absence of color equated to an absence of distraction which often clouds the way we see things. The abstract black and white encouraged me, once again, to see clearly what was happening in each photo: the still and simple process of a blackberry blossom approaching full bloom while a white spider rests on one of its petals; the journey into silence of a monarch butterfly cocoon; the faith represented in the photograph of berries encased in ice waiting to release their seeds in spring. By the time I finished reading my sixth copy I began to see these pictures in three dimensions as a holographic representation of the larger universe which we do indeed see when our vision is clear.While Clear Vision offers eternal truths, Christiansen does not hesitate to give specific direction to the reader. Her instructions on breathing, relaxation and meditation will prove useful to both new and advanced students of conscious living. Because, apparently, Christiansen knows how difficult it is for the average reader to locate a piece of paper while reading a &quot;spiritual&quot; book (bless us, every one!) she includes pages that require that the reader write down precise plans and intentions for locating and traveling the spiritual path. Pages such as &quot;How I see my path unfolding,&quot; &quot;My learnings,&quot; &quot;My teachings,&quot; and &quot;Times I set aside to meditate,&quot; require the reader to develop a precise blueprint for the personal spiritual journey.Christiansen herself gives us the best summation of Clear Vision in her original poem written more than twenty years before her current book:I recommend Clear Vision as a bedside table companion--one of those books to which you can always turn for support in times of darkness, confusion, despair. And for the pilgrim ready to get back on the spiritual path I recommend Clear Vision as the Triple A Triptick that will give you directions to the clear heart of your own personal vision.-------------Edith Cheitman, Ph.D., MSW is a retired psychotherapist.

Some of the photos capture the eye simply by showing something unexpected: a Heinkel bomber flying over a sailing ship, or the wonderful shot of three Messerschmitt fighters looking small against the massive cliffs of Dover. Other images are more substantive and sobering: a confident Hitler dining with equally confident pilots on Christmas Eve; the massive Heinkel manufacturing plant; and the abandoned aircraft left in the desert as Rommel retreated. Some of the more interesting pictures are the aerial photos of London taken by Germany prior to the war."},{"Title":"LUFTWAFFE IN WORLD WAR II (Images of War)","review":"This is a good assortment of photos about the Luftwaffe but it falls short of even an adequate general photographic review of the Luftwaffe.The problem is that the book is simply a collection of photos with accompanying captions. Other than a brief two-page introduction at the beginning of the book, there is no introduction to any of the segments of the Luftwaffe portrayed in the book. Instead, you just get a bunch of photos in each section with accompanying explanations regarding the photos. This is okay if you are already well-versed in all aspects of the Luftwaffe. It is not okay if you need some background material to help make sense of all the photos.The sections provided are:I. Aircraft of the Luftwaffe (almost one half of the book)II. Aircrew and Ground CrewIII. Luftwaffe Operations (action photos, sort-of, a big six pages)IV. Luftwaffe Images (reconnaissance photos, a big seven pages)V. Luftwaffe PersonalitiesVI. Luftwaffe PersonnelAlso, the book I got was only 112 pages, not the 272 pages advertised. Had I known that I probably would not have purchased it at all.Further, not all of the photos are \\"rare\\", as several stock photos are used.Nor can the biggest section in the book, on Luftwaffe aircraft, be considered in any way comprehensive as it does not even include, for example, any photos of the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter plane.Overall, a bit of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Home Again","review":"From the back cover:Jody Calhoun and Chase Spence were at odds even before they met. She was an antiques lover who wanted to restore the Victorian mansion known as Spence House to its former glory. He was a wealthy developer who was about to tear it down. But when Jody put herself in front of the wrecking ball, she never dreamed she'd be sent back in time, on a mission to right a wrong for a restless ghost--or that the infuriating Chase would soon be right by her side.Thrust in the middle of the War Between the States, forced to play the parts of long-lost lovers, Jody and Chase were pulled together by the same forces that had pitted them against each other. As the line between dream and reality faded, each had the feeling that they had met before, that they were destined for each other. And these sworn adversaries would be forced to recognize the timeless power of their blossoming love before the spirits could be at peace, before they could return to their own time, before they could ever truly be home again.And my review:I love time-travel stories, but this one wasn't up to snuff. The first major problem is that you have to read over 1/3 of the book before the time-travel part of it even happens. I mean, that's what I want to read the story for. I shouldn't have to slog through 100 pages of silly bickering to get there.That was my other major complaint. I felt that the conflict between the hero and heroine was a little weak. Jody had gotten fixated on his ancestral home, and wanted to save it no matter what. After a while, she started to sound like a whining child. I mean, come on, that is not your house! You have no say in what Chase, who is the OWNER, does with it! Just because you have some weird disordered attachment to it doesn't mean you have the right to keep pestering the guy.Another complaint was that Jody and Chase were not well-rounded characters. They were just there, like a pair of cardboard cutouts. This was especially the case with Chase's character. I couldn't see any reason why Jody should fall in love with Chase, apart from the fact that he was gorgeous. Yeah, as if good looks are enough. I also couldn't really see why Chase should fall in love with Jody, since she came across as a spoiled brat. Maybe she improved by the end of the book, but to tell you the truth, I couldn't make it that far.Not many authors can handle time-travel romance very well. For a good time-travel romance, I recommend REMEMBER LOVE by Susan Plunkett or A TIME TO DREAM by Sherry Lewis."},{"Title":"Kira's Diary","review":"By far my favorite book to date.

I have a sense that were it compiled today it would have different emphases. There are essays here by Heschel, Jacob Petuchowski, Scholem, Solomon Schecter, Arthur Hertzberg, David S. Shaprio, Isadore Twersky, Emil Fackenheim, Jacob Neusner, Mordechai Kaplan, Max Wiener, Joseph C.Landis, Moshe Davis, Ben Halpern, Gerson D.

I quote one small passage from an essay of his to give a taste of some of the profound writing in this book.Writing of the religious survivor of the Shoah.\\"He relives in a form without precedent , anywhere, that great \\" nevertheless\\" which has always been the secret of the enigmatic optimism of Judaism. His testimony is a warning to men everywhere not to yield to death when Truth springs from the earth. It is an admonition to endure Truth and choose life.

Allen once again seems to touch on all the significant social, political, cultural and economic events during the decade.

The oligarchs were saying the same things, the politicians were saying the same things, the people had the same problems. It's like a revival of an old play where we're reading from the same script. Won't we ever learn from history? Allen has a way to distill the important stuff and make it understandable to everybody without being judgemental. Everybody should read it."},{"Title":"Psi Wars: Getting to Grips with the Paranormal","review":"It's difficult to write a book on this scientifically controversial subject that doesn't either dismiss the putative phenomena out of hand, or cross the line into stretching credibility. How can a book maintain a scientific tone while discussing things that so widely assumed to be incompatible with a scientific worldview, things like reading people's thoughts without using our five senses, or affecting physical matter with &quot;mind power?&quot;There have been a small handful of treatments that have come close, such Ray Hyman's &quot;The Elusive Quarry&quot; on the mostly skeptical side, and Broughton's &quot;Parapsychology: The Controversial Science&quot; on the slightly less skeptical side.When we pick up a book on science and the paranormal, the first thing we generally want to know is whether the author is arguing for the reality of anomalies or against them. When it comes to a true scientific controversy, many of the best treatments are neccessarily the ones where you don't quite know which side is being argued because the facts are being presented as far as practical for you to evaluate. That's a difficult posture to take in a book on scientific anomalies because the term itself is somewhat of an oxymoron to many people.If it is an anomaly, how can it be scientific? Isn't science supposed to be about things we can measure and &quot;prove?&quot; Parapsychology relentlessly tests our attitude and philosophy toward how science works by presenting us with what are potentially very significant anomalies to the way we understand nature.&quot;Psi Wars&quot; is a particularly good treatment of the general topic of the paranomal and its investigation by science. It begins by showing clearly why putative psi phenomena are so threatening to our understanding, by virtue of their sheer bizarreness. It then reviews the evidence for certain phenomena, such as telepathy, and shows it to be, (as parapsychologists have long contended, often against ridicule and accusations), remarkably strong.A unique aspect of this book is that while reviewing the strength of the evidence for psi phenomena is an unusually balanced way, it also presents well-reasoned articles explaining why skepticism is still the most useful approach for scientists to take toward certain kinds of anomalies. Standard statistical methods can show intrinsic weaknesses when used to analyze highly unusual results. Scientific protocols have some unavoidable difficulties dealing with results that are so unreliably replicated in a laboratory.This book stands out as an excellent case study of methdological issues of particularly difficult scientific investigations and a good way to examine tricky issues of philosophy of science. Could it be that the phenomena are real and our understanding of nature has some disturbing holes in it, or could it be that our methods of understanding nature have limits yet to be fully recognized?Psi Wars stands out for me as an unusually serious and responsible treatment of anomalous science in a field all to easy to dismiss or pass off as a joke."},{"Title":"Psi Wars: Getting to Grips with the Paranormal","review":"-For anyone that might be interested in buying and trying to read this book it is important to know the following:This book is a collection of articles, scholarly articles, from the Journal of Consciousness Studies, a special issue of the year 2003. The 15 authors (including the 3 editors) wrote these articles specifically for this issue, and the idea of the editors were to have both sides present as fully and as clearly as possible their views. The \\"both sides\\" are: Psi researchers (that is, parapsychology researchers), and researchers that are skeptic about Psi phenomena (that is, Psi research critics). Some of the articles may be a little difficult for the lay reader (like myself) to fully understand.I have bought this book because I wanted an update on the current status of the Psi research, as well as an update on the major criticism towards it. I myself have a skeptical site (in portuguese, Brazil) where I perform a deep scientific critical analysis of my own \\"faith\\", that is, spiritualism, mediumnistic abilities, and the like. I am a biologist with interests in mind-brain studies, physics, species evolution theories, artificial inteligence, and phylosophy of science (among other related interests). Parapsychology actually came as a \\"by-product\\" of my critical interest in life-after-life studies. For almost twenty years I had not paid much heed to parapsychology, precisely because it is mainly concerned with extrasensory perception and psychokinesis. I do not think (and I have never thought) that proving that ESP-PK exists can give any support to life-after-life hypotheses. To me, the current status of the scientific hipothesis of life-after-life is extremely weak (even though not negligible). On the other hand, I have come to know, during the last two years, that the current status of paranormal research (ESP-PK) is unimaginably strong.This came to me as an enormous surprise, as the \\"interest\\" of mainstream science for parapsychology research (and \\"respect\\" too...) seems to be close to zero.I have read many scientific Psi research papers (Dean Radin, Jessica Utts, Dick Bierman, Daryl Bem, Richard Shoup, etc), and I have also carefully analyzed the criticism of top skeptics like Susan Blackmore, Ray Hyman, James Alcock, Victor Stenger, Michael Shermer (and also of lesser skeptics like Robert Todd Carroll, Paul Edwards, Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker - I left out James Randi for want of a clear classification...). I don't mean to say that Psi exists. But \\"avowed skepticism\\", the way it has been practiced during the last twenty years or so, is clearly Bunk (to use the very same expression that Richard Dawkins used in his 1998 article What's Wrong with the Paranormal?: \\"The paranormal is bunk. Those who try to sell it to us are fakes and charlatans, and some of them have grown rich and fat by taking us for a ride.\\" - Incidentally, this uncivilized utterance came right after Dean Radin's wonderful, even though not flawless, parapsychology book: The Conscious Universe - 1997).Again, in this book, history repeats itself. I have found the skeptics' criticism in Psi Wars very weak (the articles by James Alcock, Stanley Jeffers, and Brugger & Taylor), even though respectful, respectable, and very much worth reading.At this point I must ask: What the hell is happening in this World of ours? I mean, I don't really care if Psi exists or not. If it does exist, I find it something very exciting, a true scientific revolution. But if it does not, I am not going to cry or even be just a little bit sad because of that (By the way, the very opposite happens with the life-after-life hypothesis. If it is false, I am surely going to feel very depressed: a true existential breakdown...). But how can the mainstream scientific community, universities, and governments (especially the very very rich US government) not support and fund research on this issue given the extremely sophisticated corroborative level of the current Psi research?The answer to me seems to be that we are not dealing with a scientific issue here. We are dealing with religous-like feelings, and also social-cultural-anthropological dispositions and unwillingness. In that, I must say that I am a little bit disappointed with Psi researchers. They are usually very bad at marketing strategies and at psychological-political strategies. They (and all of us too) do not understand why Psi research is being neglected. Therefore, it seems unlinkely that they can effectively alter this scenario. In a way, Adrian Parker's Psi Wars article (\\"We Ask, Does Psi Exist? But Is This the Right Question and Do We Really Want an Answer Anyway?\\") deals with it. But even he does not seem to fully understand what is going on (and, again, all of us too).Meanwhile, we are missing out on two priceless opportunies, which lie surely within our grasp: First, we could settle once and for all if Psi exists or not; and if the answer turns out to be \\"No\\", we could fight much more effectively the excesses of the so called \\"irrational beliefs\\". Second and foremost, if Psi exists, we could learn to control it and amplify its effect size, and by doing so harness a power that might bring enormous benefits for mankind (Sounds preposterous? But that is precisely what happened with electricity and antibiotics). Either way we would gain.Adrian Parker kind of foresees that Psi research will be soon cast out of consciousness studies, in a repetition of what has happened many times before. I suspect that too. Until we can better understand why we hold this most strange blend of fear and apathy for Psi research, there may be not much hope that we will gain from it what we deserve: understanding and existential fulfillment.Julio Siqueira - Biologist and editor of the site Criticando Kardec"},{"Title":"Command the Sun (The Liberty Bell Series, Book 7)","review":"This book is an excellent follow up of the previous books in the series.

It is written chiefly for scholars and students of literature, but it is lucid and sharply argued. For several decades, critics have thought of American literary naturalism (the fiction of Crane, Dreiser, Norris, and other fellow travelers like Edith Wharton and Jack London) as a distinctly masculinist body literature--obsessed with male selves, and with harsh or violent forces and fates. Fleissner takes on this bit of conventional wisdom by arguing that it is actually female lives that are at the heart of naturalism. By the time she is through, Fleissner has breathed new life into both naturalism and feminist criticism.Fleissner argues that, because women were presumed to be more closely rooted to biological and material forces, women's lives become the chief way that naturalists explored what it meant to be human. The naturalists had to leave behind inherited paradigms for narrating a human life; the pattern of the bildungroman, for instance, did not seem sufficient to get at the material reality of women's lives. Precisely by creating the \\"broken\\" or repetitive narrative patterns that characterize naturalist fiction, naturalists found a way to express ideas about lives and sociality that could being to absorb the insights of thinkers like Nietzsche, Darwin, William James, and Freud.Among the many virtues of this study, Fleissner is able to write about the naturalists as genuine thinkers--not just as authors with a good many distasteful biases, especially about gender and race. She doesn't apologize for their strains of racism and sexism, but she gives the authors credit for trying--and often succeeding--in breaking free from conventional modes of thinking and writing.There is a wonderful bonus for literary scholars in this book: Fleissner gives deft, elegant summaries of the arguments of earlier critics. It's an excellent way to get an astute overview of large tracts of critical history. There are quibbles one could make about the way she makes the term \\"naturalism\\" cover writers who have rarely been placed in this category (Gertrude Stein, for instance). But these quirks of classification rarely if ever invalidate her insights about the literary works or her claims about the literary movements. This is one of those books that will restore your faith in what literary criticism can do."},{"Title":"One Northern Soul","review":"When I purchased \\"ONS\\" I sat down with it that day and didn't put it down till page 80!

Her works haven't been available in the states, which is a real shame, as most decent Irish Lit programs in American universities can point to Enright's astounding first story collection, The Portable Virgin, as a major work in Irish Postmodernism. What Are You Like?, her first domestically-available novel, continues in her fine, and, yes, exciting narratological style. I've rarely enjoyed the craft of a sentence as much as I have reading Enright's works, and this novel does not disappoint. In fact, this novel makes a great starting point from which to discover all of Anne Enright's works (check out Amazon.uk), such as her previous novel, The Wig My Father Wore, and, certainly, her mesmerizing story collection. Finally receiving critical notice in the states (including a featured short story in The New Yorker this year), it's surely fair to dub her &quot;exciting and new.&quot; Now let's hope this is the beginning of something grand on this side of the Atlantic."},{"Title":"Quality management in psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities","review":"I found this book an intriging mix of confusion and satisfaction.

Sure. Just remember that the disjointed feeling is intentional. If that sort of thing does not put you off, then you will enjoy this book for the hidden treasures it contains.I can also say that despite the fact that Maria &quot;sleeps around&quot; quite a bit, it was not sexually explicit. I appreciated this. I get so sick of reading books that boldly refuse to leave any of the details to the imagination (or not as the reader chooses)."},{"Title":"Quality management in psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities","review":"This is a strange and fractured narrative of the strange and fractured lives of identical twins separated at birth. When their mother dies of a brain tumor at the time of the girls' birth, their father, Berts, decides he can take care of only one of them. Naming her Maria, he quickly donates the other one, Marie (renamed Rose), for adoption. Maria stays with Berts in Dublin, while Rose moves around the world as the adopted daughter of a British doctor and his wife.Both girls have big problems. Maria, from her earliest years, is always asking, \\"What are you like?\\" and looking into mirrors. Sometimes violent in arguments, she sleeps around, gets stoned, attempts suicide, and suffers a nervous breakdown. She believes she \\"does not have a talent for life.\\" Rose is a sadist who taunts the foster children her parents take in, goading one boy into throwing a kitten through a window and later trying to drown him. She believes there is \\"a hole in her head, a hole in her life.\\" Perhaps it is that hole she is trying to fill when she goes on her shoplifting expeditions. Neither girl seems to have profited in any way from \\"nurture\\"--only nature counts here, and finding your twin, even when you don't know you are a twin, is so compelling an urge that it overwhelms any attempt to live a normal life.With her very staccato style of short sentences, most having the subject at the beginning, Enright machine-guns her story at the reader. Her in-the-face style is emphatic and unrelenting as her narrative jumps from 1965 to 1985 to 1971, etc., from Dublin to New York to London, and from Maria to Rose and, eventually, to Anna, their mother. The story is sometimes difficult to follow, as the connections which explain some of the episodes do not occur until later in the book. Tellingly, Enright has to rely on several extreme coincidences to bring the strands of her story together and achieve some sort of resolution. The plot, such as it is, strains credulity, and if you don't agree with her thesis regarding the inborn compulsion of twins to find each other, even when they don't know they are twins, you will find this book difficult to accept.

If you liked this review, you'll love the book."},{"Title":"Quality management in psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities","review":"[2.5 stars] After reading THE GATHERING, the book that recently won Anne Enright the Man Booker Award, I picked up this earlier novel to see whether it would share the same preoccupations. It does, in its interest in exploring how women feel and think, its concern with the dynamics of mostly dysfunctional families, and its obsession with the grosser aspects of the human body. It shares the same ambience: Dublin and England, though here with some scenes in New York thrown in. Here too, Enright has the reader piece the story together in fragments as she jumps around in place and time. Here too, she comes up with passages that are unusual, even poetic, but too often maddening in their obliquity; the following paragraph is typical:\\"That night Evelyn dreamed of sperm and the smell maddened her. It lingered in the morning and made her ashamed. It was her fifty-third birthday. Time to throw things out, she thought, and started with a plastic bag full of shoes that had taken the shape of her feet. Ghost steps, and all the wanderings she had never made, knotted at the top and left out for the bin men, waltzing in the quiet, in the rain.\\"The image of that bag of shoes is insightful and true. But although the final sentence is beautiful as poetry, it makes little sense as prose. And Evelyn's dream of sperm is entirely gratuitous, as are most of the physical references in the book. Here, for a comparatively innocuous example, is her description of children following their mothers into a department-store changing room: \\"They came in sometimes, the little Caesars, all new beside the bellies that they had sloughed off.\\" A striking image, certainly, but when people are persistently reduced to bags, pipes, and plumbing, they quickly lose their humanity.I can't say much in detail about the book without giving the plot away. Suffice it to say that there are two principal characters, young women in their early twenties for most of the book. Enright is quite good at plumbing their psychological lives: their pale aspirations, their failures in work or love, and the compromises they make to keep on living. For both women, for different reasons, are incomplete. Yes, there is a happier ending, perhaps a little too good to be true. But is it worth undergoing such a fractured and frustrating journey to get there?"},{"Title":"Quality management in psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities","review":"At first, I didn't like Anne Enright's novel at all. I found it very hard to identify with any of the characters. Anne Enright's style of writing is quite singular, and takes some time getting used to. It took about a hundred pages before I really started to enjoy this composition.Enright's narrative jumps forwards and backwards through time, leaping from one perspective to another. The restless nature of this novel makes it very hard prey to track down. Anne Enright's prose is very subtle too. Incidents flash by, but the gun kicks very little. I admittedly found myself lost in the early part of the novel, especially when minor characters came to the forefront, and then disappeared. This novel either seems as though it has been culled too well or not enough. There's quite a lot of extraneous material that hints at a broader narrative, with good ideas dispatched all too soon, so that you almost never get a handle on them in the first place. This novel stands comparison with Trezza Azzopardi's Booker nominated 'The Hiding Place'. Azzopardi also has a quite developed and unique style, and her narrative also flits through time, and from person to person. Yet, even although Azzopardi doesn't give a time and date for each chapter as Enright does, you're never ever lost in 'The Hiding Place' as you are in 'What are you Like?'. Enright's novel is mostly the tale of two identical twin sisters divided at birth: Maria and Marie. One gets the impression that maybe Enright thought about keeping these two very similar names for her main protagonists: thankfully, Marie is also called Rose. When their mother dies during labour, Berts, their father, decides that he can only cope with one of the twins. It doesn't seem to matter particularly which one. Thus are the twins divided. Rose is adopted, and brought up in an English middle class home. Maria, brought up by Berts and new wife Evelyn, rebels and runs off to New York and goes a little mad. We seem to get more of her childhood than Rose's. Maria falls in love with the wrong man, and comes across a photograph of herself in his wallet when 12 - but the background and the &quot;parents&quot; are completely unfamiliar. Rose contemplates marriage with a Yuppie, and has an urge to find the mother who gave her up. Her quest brings treasures she never quite expected...This novel is mostly viewed through the eyes of women, with Berts the only strong male character. It's almost as if Enright has to remind you of his presence towards the end, by his having a drunken kiss with a female co-worker at a Christmas party. It's a well-told incident, but I've a suspicion that it's only been included to add a bit of melodrama. Evelyn, Berts' wife, is considering leaving him, and then she finds a letter from a strange woman... There are so many perspectives from the women characters that you can often put the book down, and forget where you were when you start to read again. Towards the end, the twins' mother, Anna, speaks from the dead in the first person. This is done so matter of factly that no hint of the supernatural is ever allowed to shine through. Anna tells the story of her life, but her privileged voice doesn't ever really seem to say anything significant. Although the divide between the generations of these women is done very well indeed: Evelyn and Anna spent their youth in a very different world from Maria and Rose. Berts notices that women's behaviour has changed a lot over his lifetime, and has to get used to the idea that women are drinking a lot more nowadays and that the term 'typing pool' is no longer politically correct or even employable.Enright's prose is so subtle that it does take a long time for you to feel anything for the characters. Indeed, there are glimpses of the Kennedy family background, of the boy Valentine gone mad which hints at the cause of Maria's mental distress and of her mother's eccentricity. The resolution is also a quite trite and maybe a little too concise. However, Enright's prose is still a joy to read. She has a lot of wit, and there are great one-liners. She's also incredibly good at capturing the consciousness of her protagonists. There's a delicious passage where Maria's mind's eye sees a lamp and a coat in a window across the road as a hanging body. Even though she knows that the delusion is not real, her imagination still gets her incredibly worked up. Overall, this is a bitsy book, which doesn't quite fulfil all its ambitions. However, if you stick with it as I did, then you'll find Anne Enright's novel hugely rewarding towards the end."},{"Title":"Quality management in psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities","review":"The story line could be really interesting but the style of writing is hard to take.

But first things first:1. The original edition of this book was Cara Colter's \\"Major Daddy,\\" a book I truly love, which is probably why the awfulness of this translation into Spanish galls me so much.2. I am a literary translator. I have a degree in it, and I've done a lot of it. I know it's never simple, and even the most uncomplicated-looking passages can hold dense layers of meaning.3. This is not really a translation--it's an ABRIDGEMENT.However, all that said, this book is a badly-mangled attempt to transmit the soul of a beautiful story. It's like replacing the diamond in your engagement ring with a cubic zirconia, for crying out loud. It has several huge problems.First, a lot of things are simply omitted, and I'm not talking about insignificant details here, either. The worst omission is that of the story of Thomas Edison and his assistant, a story which, we're told in the original, served as a guidepost for the hero (Cole) in his compassionate treatment of people (like the heroine, Brooke) who had made mistakes. Also omitted is much of the related discussion of the fragility of the human spirit, the importance of gentleness, and the ways mistakes can make or break people. This is some of the profoundest and most beautiful stuff in the original, and to take it out removes depth from Cole's character as well.Also omitted is the grandmother's commentary to Brooke on the relationship between coal and diamonds, with Cole's shining spirit being the treasure hidden in an unlikely place, just as diamonds are hidden in coal mines. This is a totally unnecessary omission since the translator does take particular trouble to explain the play on words between \\"coal\\" and \\"Cole.\\" Many small humorous touches are omitted, as well, but I particularly missed Kolina's cryptic and sweet purple-crayon messages, completely taken out.Worse than all these omissions, though, are two major mistranslations at critical moments. The first occurs during Cole and Brooke's second kiss, a scene which, to me, was one of the most touching and powerful in the book because of the emotional impact it has on Brooke. During the kiss she realizes that the power of Cole's love for her is such that it can help her become someone different--it can draw out all the potential locked in her spirit and help her become who she was meant to be. The Spanish translation destroys this entire scene simply by changing the tense of the verb; in the Spanish, Brooke does not see herself as becoming a confident, sensual, beloved woman, but as ALREADY BEING all those things. The power of love to transform is thus played down severely.The second horrendous mistranslation can't be attributed to anything but carelessness, but it too destroys a scene that is critical to the plot. Toward the end of the story, Cole returns home alone, wounded, cynical, and feeling that he has lost Brooke. The original English reads very much like this: \\"He decided that it was impossible to call a bird to land on your shoulder . . .However, he could lure them as far as the edge of his deck . . . .\\" Calling birds from the trees had been a gift possessed by one of Cole's ancestors, a result of the man's gentleness of heart. Giving up on acquiring this skill is, for Cole, tantamount to giving up on love. However, the Spanish translator misread the passage, and apparently misunderstood the disillusionment and pain it was meant to convey; the Spanish reads approximately: \\"He decided it was not impossible to call a bird to land on your shoulder . . . In fact, he had been able to lure them as close as the edge of his deck . . . .\\" Need I say more? Mission accomplished. Scene destroyed.This isn't the only instance of such blatant mistranslation, though it's by far the worst. The upshot of all this? Please don't judge either Cara Colter or \\"Major Daddy\\" by this shoddy Spanish rendition. READ THE ORIGINAL! !LEAN LA VERSION ORIGINAL! !!POR FAVOR!! Harlequin should be ashamed of this mess."},{"Title":"The Four Hundred Silent Years","review":"The Old Testament ends with the Jewish people restored to their land, after the Babylonian captivity, but firmly under the thumb of Persian kings, yearning for their lost freedom...The New Testament opens with the same people greatly multiplied and in the same country, but under Roman domination and chafing even more under this new oppressive rule. What happened in between? What occurred during those centuries, often called \\"the four hundred silent years\\" because the Bible doesn't answer these questions? Those years were anything but quiet for the Jewish people. It was a period of tremendous upheaval, both religiously and spiritually. H. A.

They even put Dr. Clayton Forrester in as a minor character. The novel follows the pilot episodes, with only minor twists and turns.

The aliens also have names, characters, goals, fears and so on which helps give the book more depth.A must for a War of the Worlds fan."},{"Title":"War of the Worlds: The Resurrection","review":"Although the T.V. show was not very popular, it had a loyal following. This book was one of the few media tie-ins done. J.M. Dillard is a capable writer, and does a good job of laying out the premise of the show and introducing the characters. It's a shame that the show has been largely forgotten. If you find a copy, it is worth a look."},{"Title":"War of the Worlds: The Resurrection","review":"This is a novelization of the pilot movie of a short lived TV series from the late 80s. I don't think the War of the Worlds television series has been aired on television in years, so there's a lot of people unfamiliar with the show. However, this is an fun book that could probably be appreciated even by people who never watched the television series.First bit of information, forget the H.G. Wells novel. This really has very little to do with that, this is a sequel of sorts to the 1953 George Pal version of War of the Worlds. It's been 35 years since the aliens tried to conquer the Earth, but were stopped by the bacteria living here. Harrison Blackwood, the adopted son of scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester, is trying to get information about the alien invaders and continue his adoptive father's work to figure out what he can about the aliens and where they came from so that we can prevent them from mounting another attack against the Earth. He has a whiz computer scientist, Norton Drake trying to find signals from outer space, and he just added Suzanne McCullough a microbiologist to his teamWe discover that the aliens aren't really dead, but merely in a state of suspended animation because of the bacteria when terrorists try to take over a secret military facility that stores nuclear waste and the supposedly dead alien bodies. When a firefight between the terrorists and military personnel shoots holes in one of the containers of nuclear waste, the oozing nuclear waste material drips onto a container carrying one of the aliens killing off the bacteria and wakes up the alien within. Somehow, the aliens discover that they can take over a human's body so that they can go undetected, so aliens take over the bodies of the terrorists and escape with the dormant alien bodies and containers of nuclear waste so that they can kill off the harmful bacteria and wake their brethren.Norton Drake intercepts a transmission from Earth that gets a response from space, so Harrison and Suzanne go to check out the location where the signal originated on Earth. There they meet Lieutenant Col. Paul Ironhorse who is in charge of the army investigation into the terrorist attack on the military facility. What follows is an exciting novel that has Harrison's team eventually joining forces with Col. Ironhorse to get proof to the government that the aliens are in fact back, and they must stop them getting their hands on the alien weaponry that is also being stored in top secret military installations.This book was written by J.M. Dillard who has written a lot of Star Trek novels and novelizations, and she does a good job writing a book based on television characters. This book does what all good novelizations do, it fleshes out the characters, it delves deeper into the motivations of the characters, and adds some interesting background to the situation and characters. I have a feeling this was based on an early draft of the television pilot shooting script, because there's a lot with the character of Dr. Clayton Forrester. I wonder if the original idea was to have him be in the pilot movie to show the continuation from the 1953 movie, but perhaps Gene Barry wasn't interested and they didn't have the heart to recast the part--total supposition on my part.If you remember the television series, you would probably enjoy this book. However, even if you haven't seen the television series, I think you can still enjoy the book. It would help to have at least a passing familiarity with the George Pal film, but even if you aren't familiar with it the author gives you enough background to understand what's going on. As long as you don't go into this expecting H.G. Wells, you should find this an interesting and fast moving story."},{"Title":"War of the Worlds: The Resurrection","review":"I was mostly aware of the story line of this novel as the pilot two episodes of the \\"War of the Worlds\\" television show.Clearly this book draws on an earlier plot draft, as there are some differences in the action and characters.

Joe is living with his mother in 1950s East End London, where he is always surrounded by hard-working people. From his neighbour Mr. Kandinsky and the wrestler Shmule to the shop owner Mrs. Abramowitz, little Joe is accompanied by people who are very fond of him and who take good care of him.As all of Joe's acquaintances seem to need a little bit of luck in their lives, Joe brings home a unicorn (which is actually a goat) since he hopes that his \`unicorn' will fulfil his friends some wishes. Mr. Kandinsky needs a steam press for his shop and Shmule needs to buy a ring for his beloved Sonia. Joe and his mother also have a wish - to join Joe's father in Africa. Will Joe's \`unicorn' really be able to fulfil all these wishes?A Kid for Two Farthings is a lovely book full of wonderful people who work very hard and who have humble wishes. Although they are very busy, Joe's neighbours still make time for little Joe because the boy doesn't really have anyone to talk to, since his father is away and his mother is working. Joe really likes to be surrounded by his neighbours, because he can ask them many questions and thus, he gets the attention he needs. In return, Joe wants to do everything in order to see his friends happy. That's why he brings home a \`unicorn' - the little boy hopes that his new \`pet' will grant all of their wishes.I really liked this touching book and I liked reading about little Joe. The little boy is very curious and has a great imagination. He believes in the magic of his \`unicorn' and he wants to help his friends and see them happy. Joe is very playful and inventive; he always wants to know everything and that's why I liked him so much. I also liked the other characters, as they are all very friendly, humble and warm, despite the fact that their lives are hard. Mr. Kandinsky is a very great person and he is like a grandfather to Joe. When the little boy brings home his \`unicorn', Mr. Kandinsky doesn't tell Joe the truth, because he sees how happy Joe is. Therefore, he lets Joe believe that his goat is a unicorn, which can grant wishes and make people happy. Mr. Kandinsky encourages Joe's imagination and creativity and that's why I liked him so much!Overall, I must say that A Kid for Two Farthings was a great book, which I enjoyed very much. It's a quick read and I recommend this adorable little book to everyone who likes to read books set in the past and to everyone who likes to read a heart-warming and hopeful story."},{"Title":"A Kid for Two Farthings","review":"Reason for Reading: I love early 20th century British lit. and I'm enchanted by the entire line of The Bloomsbury Group reprints.Summary: Joe is six years old, lives on a street near Whitechapel which seems to be the Jewish quarter. Joe and his mother live in a room above Mr. Kadinsky's tailor shop; he is a trousers maker and his assistant Shmule is a young engaged pugilist training to work his way through the ranks to becoming a champion. Joe's father has gone to Africa to make a life for them and will be sending for him and his mother sometime. Joe mostly spends his days with Mr. Kadinsky in the shop while his mother works all day and Kadinsky is a talker and storyteller. He's told Joe the story of unicorns and why they no longer live in England but since everyone seems to be wishing for something Joe decides to check out the market anyway. If he can buy a unicorn he can make everyone's wishes come true and on that day what does he find but a unicorn, now the owner seems to think he's a crippled goat but Joe knows a baby unicorn when he sees one. You can even see the nub of his magical horn starting to grow in the centre of his forehead so Joe brings him home and Kadinsky pays for him. Perhaps now Joe can see that all his friends' humble wishes will come true.Comments: This is a touching heart-warming story, what I would rather call a novella than a novel coming in at 128 pages and only that because of the large font. At first one is puzzled whether this might be a story for children, with the large font and the six year old protagonist. But it is not. We are shown all the poverty of the immigrant living conditions and the hardships of working continuously just to get by. Sure there are parts a child would enjoy, but not overall. The book is told in the third person and though we see things through Joe, a child's point of view for the majority of the time we also see from Mr. Kadinsky's where the tone and subject matter become deeper. Discussions of trade unions, business dealing and wrestling matches put the book above a children's story. Joe himself is a wise little boy who has learnt a lot in his adult world and often speaks with a deep wisdom that can only come from a child who has been in the adult world. But Joe is a sweet, kind, loving boy with an innocence about him that his world has not touched. He believes in unicorns and magic and this belief may just be enough to enrich everyone's lives. Wonderful characters and an inspiring ending, this book will sure to please readers who like to read about simpler times and want a good, clean read."},{"Title":"A Kid for Two Farthings","review":"Whimsical little story set among the Jewish community of London's East End of the 30s. Vivid descriptions transport you to a very different world- the markets, the struggling clothing manufacturers, the wrestling matches...The hero of the book, 6 year old Joe, lives with his mother (his father is away in Africa on unspecified business) over Mr Kandinsky's tailor shop. While his mother works at a milliner's, Joe spends most of his time with the tailor, and a bond grows between them.Mr Kandinsky tells Joe about unicorns, a wonderful description combining magic and pragmatism:'Every animal when it was made by the Almighty was given one extra-special present...But the unicorn got the most special present of all. He was given a magic horn...It could grant anybody's wish- straight off. And this horn consequently was worth 10,000 cash on sight'.So when Joe sees a unicorn (a small deformed goat) going for five bob, he has to have it. Whether it manages to grant the wishes of Joe's friends (a victory in the wrestling ring for Shmule, a trouser press for Mr Kandinsky and the return of his father from Africa), you will have to see.Although targeted at an adult audience by Bloomsbury Press, I have another edition which is certainly a children's book with illustrations; I would say it could be enjoyed by either group."},{"Title":"Coral Snakes of the Americas.","review":"Janis provides a good reference to coralsnakes.

I finally managed to lay hands on the last Elizabeth Willis book of which I'm aware, Second Law, last week. Unlike her other collections, Second Law is a single long poem, split into five sections and an envoi (actually, this is debatable, as the second portion of the book is entitled \\"Second Law,\\" while the others remain without title). While it doesn't have the punch of Turneresque, Second Law is a wonderful thing in itself. Willis manages to use L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E conventions in subversive ways, keeping the oddness without letting it divert from what's going on in the poem itself. Her language, as always, is pointed, precise, and evocative.It's somewhat difficult to build a library of Liz Willis' books, but it should be the goal of anyone interested in the many different and wonderful things language can do. ***"},{"Title":"Second Law","review":"Elizabeth Willis can be a difficult poet to understand.

Though only 60 pages on, it packs in a lot of musicological analysis and lots of cool quotations from scores.The book is divided into five chapters, covering Boulez's early work, the era of total serialization, \\"Le Marteau sans maitre\\", his chance works, and finally \\"works in progress.\\" I found the fourth chapter (titled \\"Alea\\") the most eye-expanding, as it elucidates the serial writing of \\"Constellation\\"/\\"Constellation-Miroir\\" and \\"Pli selon pli\\". The works then in progress discussed in the last chapter include \\"Messagequisse\\", \\"Rituel\\", \\"...explosante-fixe...\\", and \\"Eclat\\"/\\"Eclat-Multiples\\".It's a pity that the book has not been updated to cover Boulez's big comeback in the late 1980s, when \\"Repons\\" was completed and \\"...explosante-fixe...\\" dramatically reworked. The book's age shows in its discounting of \\"Notations\\"; the author could hardly be aware that Boulez would return to this early music to orchestrate it. Still, the work is useful for those interested in Boulez's early music. Also check out Jarmeux's biography-cum-analysis published by Oxford in 1991."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"This is my personal favourite of all Agatha Christie's books. For no good reason, though. It doesn't stand out particularly, but it is nonetheless a thouroughly brilliany mystery. I have long been of the opinion that Christie really came into her own when she ditched Poirot and marple. The books in which they do not feature are definitely some of her best. (\\"Towards Zero\\", \\"Death Comes As the End\\" \\"And Then there Were None\\" \\"Murder Is Easy\\" \\"The Pale Horse\\", to name but a few.)Arthur Calgary is a really likeable character, as are several characters in this book. Which makes it even harder to read about what this opening up of an old wound is doing to them. It is hard to imagine how you would feel if, after several years of security, a stranger comes along and reveals that the killer of your friend/relative was not indeed the one imprisoned, but someone else. Someone who has been walking amongst you all these years, talked to you, eaten with you. And now all of you are under suspicion again. This book demonstrates that wonderfully, and it is a brilliant study of what the hunt for a kilelr can do to the people involved, the assumed guilt, the intrusion, the harassing of the innocent. All trying to find that one person who is guilty.This book shines becuase it is actually rather realistic. It is full of human emotion and feeling, and some wonderful characters. they are not all of them incredibly likeable, but they are recognisable human, and you can empathise with all of them.The story is told brilliantly, and the solution is typically unguessable and shocking. The climax is great. Fear permeates the atmosphere almost all through the book, leading to a great resolution.One of her very very best books, if not her very best. Explores wonderfully issues of innocence and guilt, which raises it above the norm."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the St. Martin's Minotaur edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"I just finished this book recently and would recomend it to anyone. I think this is my favorite Christie so far. The ending was so unexpected. I loved the characters because they were all so well developed and each one of them was different. There's always at least one character you can relate to. In my case, my two favorite characters were Philip Durrant and Tina Argyle. A cool thing about this book is that, even though you never come face to face with Rachel Argyle (deceased before the opening of the book), you can see a clear picture of her in the background.If you like Christie, mystery, or just good characters and a good story, go to the top of the screen and order this!"},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE is one of the difficult Christies from her most controversial period, in which her novels grew longer and longer, while some argue her energies were primarily directed towards the stage where she was amazingly successful and the Queen of the West End for a few years. The novels of the same time grow ponderous, as though overswollen with social and moral anxiety, and this is one of the touchstones of the era, cited by Christie herself in her AUTOBIOGRAPHY as among her own personal favorites.Is it a plot she cooked up, then abandoned, for her contemporaneous drama THE UNEXPECTED GUEST? It seems like it, right down to the gloomy, Stygian opening in which a mystery man crashes into the closed society of a wealthy family grieving over a recent loss.As usual, Christie studs the novel with references to all sorts of high and low culture. As many have noticed, the character of Jacko Argyle seems borrowed from the real life \\"Let Him Have It\\" case of Derek Bentley and Christopher Craig, while she makes much of the famous line from Racine's PHEDRE that goes, \\"C'est Venus toute entiere a sa proie attache\\" (She is Venus, now indistinguishable from her prey) and the beautiful Jean Ingelow ballad for which Arthur Sullivan wrote the music,Ah, maid most dear, I am not here,I have no place, no part,No dwelling more by sea or shore,But only in thy heart!O fair dove! O fond dove!Till night rose over the bourne,The dove on the mast as we sailed fast,Did mourn, and mourn, and mourn,Did mourn, and mourn.Most curious of all, from our point of view, is Christie's reference to WAITING FOR GODOT--Hester Argyle and Donald Craig are said to have attended an amateur production of the play in a tiny suburban town two years before the action of the novel proper begins. Indeed, seeing this play turns out to be Hester's alibi during the slaying of her mother! GODOT was then a very new play in English, though it had premiered in French three or four years before the writing of ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE. We don't expect to find Beckett in Agatha Christie, or vice versa, but a case might be made that the two playwrights and modernists had much more in common, and the bizarre comedy and overweening sadness of Vladimir and Estragon find weary analogues in the plight of the Argyle family, a collection of misfits who are all sitting around waiting for something to make their miserable lives meaningful. They don't know their salvation lies in the unlikely form of Arthur Calgary, a geophysicist whose temporary amnesia led to the crackup of the strange, totally convincing plot behind Rachel Argyle's murder.All the characters speak of the \\"calamity of the innocent,\\" but Christie's theme here is really forgiveness. How do the children she adopted forgive Rachel Argyle for tearing them away from their blood kin? How does the polio-stricken air ace Philip Durrant forgive the fate that condemned him to a wheelchair? How does Calgary forgive himself for letting Jacko perish in prison? Though it has its longueurs and dead patches, ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE is amazingly beautiful, reflective, yes, and suspenseful. It's not easy to see who did it, and the ending is a classic surprise. Christie's plots are Apollonian and worked out with a clinician's perfection, but her storytelling is surprisingly intuitive, moving sideways, working by allusion and rhyme.The three love stories in the book, too, are all gracefully done. One forgets how much Christie knew about love (and betrayal). And how about that child ruining Tina's alibi by reporting the landing of a sputnik! (That turns out to be Tina's much-bruited \\"bubble car,\\" a sensation of the 1956-57 period that were the closest contemporary design has come to sn actual spacecraft-inspired mass-produced car.)"},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"I enjoyed reading Ordeal by Innocence.

And she never disappoints when it comes to clever, twisty, psychological, character-driven murder mysteries with stunning conclusions. Two years ago, Mrs. Argyle was supposedly murdered by her bad seed of an adopted son, Jack. But then, Doctor Calgary comes forward with an airtight alibi for Jack, who died in prison. Now the family--the husband and his new fianc&eacute; and the four other adopted children--begin to suspect each other and the family begins to break apart. Why would anyone kill the kind, benevolent woman who had devoted her life and money to the care of unfortunate children? Who is suffering the most: the guilty or the innocent? Christie's ability to capture character and psychology, motivation behind murder, is only matched by her ability to spin a great, surprising plot. Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"I liked the plot, although I was disappointed when the suspect I was plumping for turned out to be innocent.

Thus begins this Agatha Christie whodunit. Though it cannot compare to her earlier, better works, ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE does hold its own.ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE is most notable for the remarkable strength of all the characterizations, the dark, menacing atmosphere, and the fascinating themes of guilt and innocence that Christie brings up. The plot is not as intricate or complex as her masterpieces, but the clues are laid with absolutely impeccable skill, and the solution is both clever and surprising. One of her best late books."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"This is a fairly good mystery, the characters are interesting, Christie tries to keep you guessing, but the bottom line is, that this mystery is just not as good as her others. Although there are some interesting twists towards the end, the murderer's identity does not seem that surprising, and some details (one in particular) just seem sort of tacked on. This causes one to feel somewhat unsatisfied with the ending. Still, it was enjoyable for a light read, and it has some worthwhile aspects. One of the interesting things about this mystery is that it does not involve any of her usual detectives (Poirot, Miss Marple, Parker Pyne -- any others? I'm a hard core Poirot fan myself). You might try to find at your local library before you buy it, however, since you probably won't want to read it again."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Supposedly, Ordeal by Innocence was one of Christie's personal favorites of her own novels. It is not written to one of her famous detectives, but instead features Philip Durrant.Durrant is an outsider in a big and complex family which is still recovering from the death of their mother, Mrs. Argyle. When he thinks to do them a favor by letting them know that their brother Jack Argyle did not kill their mother, he is shocked to find that instead of being relieved, they are instead uneasy. If Jack Argyle didn't kill Mrs. Argyle, then who did?I haven't read Ordeal by Innocence since I was a teenager. At that time, I really liked it precisely because it was not a typical Christie novel. While I still enjoyed the reading experience, I did not like it as much as I did back then. There was something about the way that Christie approached adoption that grated on me. It felt even a little bit mean-spirited at times. That may just be me.In any case, I recommend it for Christie fans."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"in that it is not one of her 'series' (Poirot/Marple etc) and it is also not up to her usual standards.Dr. Arthur Calgary has just returned from an expedition to Antartica. Shortly before he left he gave a ride to a young man, Jacko Argyle who was later convicted of a murder. Jacko protested his innocence but was unable to find the stranger who gave him a ride. Dr. Calgary was finally able to clear Jacko of the crime, but unfortunately Jacko had died in prison. Now all that clearing his name accomplished was leave the rest of the family under suspicion.Although this novel does not feature any of Christie's repeat characters it does cover some familiar ground, a childless woman adopting a large brood of children, murder within the family, a domineering parent and amnesia to name a few. There are other of Christie's works that handle these elements better.If you are a Christie fan you'll enjoy this. If you are looking for your first Christie you'll be better served to look elsewhere but even a mediocre Christie is better that most other's best work."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Ordeal by Innocence (Queen of Mystery)Christie's always entertaining. You suspect everyone with so many clues, not to mention red herrings sometimes) thrown into the mix of characters. Half way through the book I thought everyone must have a had a hand in it. They all had a motive. But the one you might suspect the most, the other characters suspect the least! So was I right in my suspicions? I'm not telling. Reading it for yourself, you want be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Christie is undoubtedly the Queen of Mystery. Her books are written tightly, not a word wasted, with strong characters and a story that unfolds like a puzzle with shifting pieces. I was eager to read Ordeal by Innocence, particularly because it was one of Christie's own favorites and my own personal favorites tend to match up quite a bit with hers.As usual, the book opens in a terrific way. There are a couple of plot twists right up front in the first five chapters that really get things rolling. Calgary is perfectly-drawn as a man who is compelled to get to the bottom of the case because he feels he's partially responsible for Jacko Argyle's death. At what point do you bring forth your evidence and let the authorities handle the rest; or do you feel you owe the deceased a debt to be repaid and must pursue the murderer to a tragic conclusion? How much do you owe someone who's deceased that you've done wrong? Is saying 'I'm sorry' enough, or are you obligated to vindicate his memory for your part in the tragedy? These are the deeper questions Christie imposes on Calgary, and they are quite raw and realistic enough to keep him motivated but conflicted as he moves through the story.The opening of this book is quite strong. Even as Calgary goes to the house for the first time to deliver his news, you get an immediate sense of who all these people are, Hester, Kirsten, etc. Christie does a great job creating a big, creepy house with people full of secrets they may be willing to kill to keep.In addition to Calgary's dilemma, Christie adds other moral questions deeper into the story. Does someone who's as despicable as Jacko was in life, even deserve justice after death? No, he didn't murder his mother, but shouldn't he have been punished for all his other crimes and the misery he heaped on others in his lifetime, anyway? What goes around comes around and Jacko got his in the end. Who cares if it was for something he didn't do? Christie makes the reader ask the bigger, more ethical question: What's more important, judgment or justice? She also forces us to ask whether it's best just to let sleeping dogs lie in a case like this and if it's fair to suffer the innocent by opening up a situation that's come to a perfectly logical conclusion.She also makes some very strong arguments about motherhood and how you \\"can get too much of a good thing\\". Anything taken to it's extreme, even good things, always have a negative effect. Excess in any form is dangerous. I can't say much more about the motherhood issue without spoilers. The murder victim, Rachel Argyle, is as conflicted and torn by her deep insecurities as much as anyone else. Unlike other mysteries, where the victim is simply a means to propel the story forward at the outset and then it's all about the investigation; you feel that Rachel Argyle is still VERY much alive throughout this story. Her presence is so strong, and effect so profound on her children that, like Daphne du Marier's 'Rebecca', you feel her presence hovering all through this story. Although dead, it's as if she's another character right there in the house with everyone else.Initially, I thought this book was going to be similar to Crooked House, which is one of my favorites and Christie's, as well. In some ways, it is quite similar. The downside of this book is that it's too long. Christie usually writes with great economy, with every detail focused on unraveling the puzzle. Here, the relationships are so complex and wounds run so deep, that after a very solid opening, we spend MUCH time rehashing the same material over and over. I loved the complexity of the relationships and yes; we do need to hear about them. Still, characters would share the same feelings/information with one character, then another, then another, then the investigator. It really bogged the story down for a large section in the middle. There are a few scenes/chapters with Micky and Tina, as well as Hester and Don, in the middle that are spine-tingling page-turners. Then, it went back to slogging through.I loved the reveal of the murder and his/her motivation. That was a great device, although I feel Christie didn't give any real clues to it earlier in the story. Calgary interviews a Jane Doe almost near the end of the story that gives us an inkling of this motivation, but none at all during the first 3/4 of the book. Christie usually plays more fair than that with her readers. I also felt the last page of the book was contrived. It seemed much too 'happy ending' for a Christie book. She usually ends on a bang and this was more like a Lifetime TV movie. I was surprised at the very quick and short but sickeningly sweet turn she took. It felt abrupt, tacked on, and not at all in line with the dark, reflective theme of the rest of the book.With a good edit, getting rid of 7-8 chapters and adding a more appropriate ending, Ordeal by Innocence would absolutely be one of Christie's greatest. It has more emotional depth than any of her other books that I've read. That's what makes it great. The execution and ending, unfortunately detract from that. Still, I'm giving it four stars for the fantastic opening and the the depth of characters and themes."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Originally reviewed at: www.booksbiscuitsandtea.co.ukRating: 5 out of 5 biscuitsAccording to the courts, Jacko Argyle bludgeoned his mother to death with a poker. The sentence was life imprisonment.But when Dr Arthur Calgary arrives with the proof that confirms Jacko's innocence, it is too late - Jacko died behind bars following a bout of pneumonia. Worse still, the doctor's revelations re-open old wounds in the family, increasing the likelihood that the real murderer could strike again.....Reading these few lines was enough for me to know that it's going to be a great read - I fell in love with it in an instant, picked it up and came home, eager to start reading it. At two in the morning, exhausted from sleep deprivation and reading for such a long time, I simply couldn't put it down. And I was right - Ordeal by Innocence is pure brilliance.I don't usually like books that don't feature either Poirot or Marple but it was an exception. What's more, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if it featured one of them. It was just perfect the way it was written, without any detectives.It's quite hard to talk about Christie's novels without giving too much away but believe me, it's a marvellously written story. It's similar to some of her other books in that there's a house full of suspects and they all know one of them did it but still, this time it's a bit different. Mainly because it's not a real family - the five children were all adopted, therefore they're all different. As Mr. Argyle put it, you can't predict what's going on in their minds because they're not your own, they're not like you. In addition to this, Ordeal by Innocence is said to be one of Christie's darkest novels for a reason - it focuses very strongly on psychology. One of the most powerful lines for me was \\"It's not the guilty who matter. It's the innocent.\\"The characters aren't particularly likeable but there's no doubt about them being a queer lot. My personal favourite was Philip Durrant - an ex-pilot who was afflicted with polio of the paralytic type and became an invalid. Even though he can't move around as much as he'd like to, I think he played an important part in the novel - he was an invalid, but he was very strong mentally.Ordeal by Innocence is another masterpiece from the Queen of Crime. It doesn't matter how many whodunnits you've read before, Christie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole story and keeps you guessing until the very end. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone who likes a good mystery."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"I was very glad when this title was made available for Kindle. I have always liked this story about a family whose mother has been brutally murdered. The unsatisfactory son was found guilty, sent to prison and died there, still protesting that he was innocent. His alibi couldn't be proved at the time and no one believed him. Now, several years later, his alibi shows up at the family home and proves that the young man didn't do it. One of the family remarks that it isn't the guilty who matter, it's the innocent, since everyone will be suspected until the real killer is found. As usual, Christie used personalities and faults to show a train of events. Very well done."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Though she's best known for detectives Hercules Poirot and Miss Jane Marple, crime novelist Agatha Christie wrote a number of mysteries that involved neither one of them, instead utilizing a range of amateur sleuths, police officers, young adventurers or innocent bystanders as protagonists and mystery-solvers.Such is the case in \\"Ordeal by Innocence\\", in which a geophysicist by the name of Arthur Calgary travels to a country house to deliver some earth-shattering news to the Argyle family. Several years ago, Jacko Argyle was convicted of the murder of his adopted mother Rachel Argyle, and died in prison a few months later. But now Calgary has come forward to confirm that Jacko's alibi on the night of the murder was in fact true - he was hitchhiking in a car that drove him to Drymouth, and Calgary himself was the driver. Because of a freak accident resulting in concussion and a long trip to the Arctic taking place immediately afterwards, Calgary has only just remembered giving Jacko a ride that night and gone to the police with his new evidence.He has now come to the Argyle family in the belief that he is sharing tragic, though ultimately good news. Their son/brother will be given a posthumous pardon for the crime and the case will be reopened to seek justice for Mrs Argyle. Yet the family's reaction is not what he expected. Though stunned, they do not seem at all pleased at Jacko's acquittal, and as he leaves young Hester Argyle makes a tearful remark: \\"It's not the guilty who matter, it's the innocent!\\"It is not until much later that Calgary realizes what he's done. If it were not Jacko that bludgeoned Mrs Argyle on the back of the head, then it must have been another family member. Having all been in the isolated house that night with all the doors and windows locked, any one of the family members could have committed the crime: patriarch Leo Argyle, the housekeeper, his secretary, (now fianc&eacute;e) the in-laws, or any of his (now grown) adopted children. Living together in the house on the ironically-named Sunny Point, the Argyle family begins to break apart in the knowledge that one of them is a murderer...and whilst the murderer walks free, all of them are forced to live under the shadow of police and public suspicion.Feeling responsible, Calgary begins his own investigation, learning several surprising things about both the murder victim (on the surface a kind, altruistic woman) and the supposed murderer (a charming lady's man, but also a \\"bad \`un\\" with a vicious temper). Discovering the origin of each child that was adopted into the Argyle family, Calgary realizes that the answer to the case lies in the psychology of the victim herself.\\"Ordeal by Innocence\\" is one of the few Christie novels I've managed to crack - though whether that says more about me or the book, I'm not sure. In any case, one particularly telling characteristic is telegraphed just a little too early and obviously for any discerning reader, though it still remains a great read for a dark and stormy night, fill of suspense and character study and just a dash of romance too.Cited as one of her personal favorites in her autobiography, I personally felt that \\"Ordeal by Innocence\\" was perhaps a little too hurriedly wrapped up, with a likeable character bumped off anti-climactically and with no real sense of closure, but the themes and ideas that Christie raises will have you thinking for a good while afterwards: commentary on nature versus nurture, the human capacity to hold grudges, the mistrust that exists among lovers and family members, and of course the balance of seeking out justice with protecting the innocent."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Ordeal by Innocence does have that totally unexpected plot twist that, paradoxically, readers expect from Agatha Christie! Holding the reader with an exploration of different psyches and some British local color, she immerses the reader in the situation. Several war orphans, all in the same situation during the war, react each so differently to the people they lived with. Ordeal by Innocence is one of Christie's better character studies."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE is a good example of Christie's tendency to tweak and twist earlier plot devices and then combine them with different themes to create something new, and here she renders the sort of situation seen in CROOKED HOUSE with an unexpected most-likely/least-likely solution and combines it with her oft-repeated theme of an old, previously solved crime that reopens to affect present lives.The Argles are an unusual family, composed of wealthy parents and five adopted children--all of whom were drawn from underprivledged backgrounds that continued to affect them well into adulthood. One of these children, Jocko, grew up into a singularly undesirable man; constantly involved in legal scrapes, he is the obvious suspect when his adoptive mother is found with her head bashed in by a poker, and he soon convicted. But two years after his death, a man who could have given Jocko an iron-clad alibi suddenly resurfaces, and the family is suddenly thrown into disarray as the case is reopened.Christie is, as always, extremely expert in her writing, but ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE proves an extremely mechanical effort without more than one or two memorable characters--still, it offers a typically surprising and memorable Christie solution, and that is saying a great deal indeed. While it does not rank among her finer efforts, both fans and newcomers should enjoy it quite a bit."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"I didn't expect to like this book when I first began reading it, but was soon hooked.A house full of murder suspects is always good and the characters in this house are a bit different.

He had always maintained his innocence and said he had been hitchhiking at the time of the murder. The man who had given him a ride had never been found.Two years later, Dr. Arthur Calgary, the man who had given him the ride, returns from an Arctic expedition. Calgary had been struck by a lorry the morning after giving Jack a ride, suffered a severe case of amnesia, and left immediately to join the expedition without knowing of the murder or of the fact that he alone could provide an alibi.Although it is too late to change things, Calgary feels it necessary to tell the family his story. The family is less than receptive because this new revelation means the real murderer is still at large and could be one of them. This novel is filled with maladjusted personalities and one more murder plus an attempted murder will occur before the truth is revealed."},{"Title":"Ordeal by Innocence","review":"Two years ago Jack Argyle was arrested for the murder of his mother Rachel. Money was found on Jack that had been withdrawn from a bank earlier. Jack had an alibi - he got a ride from a stranger around the time of death. But this car and driver could not be found. Jack was found guilty and died in prison. Now the family gets a visit from Dr. Arthur Calgary, a geophysicist who returned from a Antarctic expedition. Dr. Calgary had given Jack a ride at that time, but had left the country and knew nothing until he returned. He visited Jack's lawyers, and they were arranging for a \\"free pardon\\" to clear Jack's name posthumously. Now the problem is this: who really committed the murder?We learn that all the children of the Argyle's were adopted, and suspicion would now fall on one of them (Chapter 3). Their house was locked so only an insider could have done the killing. It resembled the Borden case in America. Would the family remain under suspicion forever (Chapter 4)? All those present could be suspects (Chapter 5). Calgary visits Jack's wife, remarried and happy (Chapter 6). Unless solved, the family will be forever suspects (Chapter 7). Chapter 8 tells about the background of Rachel's adopted children. Can nurture triumph over nature? Chapters 9 and 10 have background facts on the family. Their lawyer says it is best to blame an \\"unknown intruder\\". Chapters 11 and 12 give the thoughts of the family on the murder.In Chapter 13 the Superintendent questions all the people about their activities around the time of the crime. The Superintendent has found the two people with a real motive, but no proof (Chapter 14). Philip Durrant considers the murder an intellectual puzzle to be solved (Chapter 15). The conversations reveal more of the family's life (Chapters 16 and 17). A new clue emerges in Chapter 19. Arthur Calgary does his own investigation (Chapter 20). Philip Durrant speculates as to the knowledge of the crime (Chapter 21). In Chapter 22 one of Rachel's children admits to a long-withheld secret. When they meet at the house they find Philip has been stabbed dead. When Dr. Craig arrives he discovers another victim, still alive! The police arrive and detain a suspect for questioning (Chapter 23).

He dies in prison a few months later of pneumonia. Nobody ever doubted that Jack was the murderer until after almost two years a witness turns up who can give Jack a watertight alibi. This witness is Dr. Arthur Cargary, a geophysicist who just returned to England from an expedition to Anrarctica. Unfortunately for Jacko, the night of the murder Dr. Calgary was hit by a lorry, and suffered a concussion which brought on partial amnesia. Now that the doctor regained his memory he hopes to free Jack Argyle of all blame by making a stand as a witness. But soon after his statement the family of Jack realizes that the real murderer is still free and possibly a member of the family.Ordeal by Innocence has no particular features that leap out to the reader. It has a conventional murder-in-retrospect plot with an exceptionally elaborate depiction of family tensions. This focus is makes that the book sags in the middle, because the numerous characters all have to make page filling statements about their alleged innocence. At points I was really craving for a good sleuth like Poirot or Marple to spice things up, but no luck since a dull geophysicist had taken up the role of detective. It does not count as a good point for this book that it is clearly bigger than an average Agatha Christie detective story.Strangely enough Agatha Christie claims that Ordeal by Innocence is one of her favorite novels. But believe me: if you do not aim to read all her books, you can simply skip this one."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious even by Wodehouse standards.

Worth reading."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime","review":"Wodehouse obviously spoke to a generation of English people - but what was he saying to them? That their fears and prejudices were good things, that women and romance were not to be trusted? It may have been partially that, but he was an author of escapist fictions, and as Anthony Lane points out so well in an essay about Wodehouse, like other second rate authors (Tolkien and Doyle e.g.), when one turns the key and enters their world, one enters a world of limited possibilities and guaranteed outcomes - and therein lies the pleasure. As for me, I have never been able to become a fan, and that is not because I have never tried. Wodehouse seems like the perfect summer author - I enjoyed reading a few stories in my teen years, but when I looked into his stuff later on, I found it to be fluffy to the point of tedium. Similar fare, with a contemporary viewpoint, is readily available on TV. I like humor that has a bit more bite to it - Wodehouse seems to do little more than celebrate harmless, pointless foolishness.This is widely considered to be his best book, and it is a pleasant enough farce, full of mild young men in pursuit of haughty damsels, the occasional ruffian, private detectives, old lords whose gray matter has been out to lunch for some time, prize pigs, and weekend parties at country houses. Spinning out an absurd plot, with odd twists based on mistaken identities and misunderstandings, was Wodehouse's forte. The general idea is that a young man wants to regain the hand of his beloved, who has spurned him after he sent a private detective after her during a foreign vacation. Enter milktoasty Pongo Twistleton and his madcap Uncle Fred, who immediately gets to work setting things right. Problems continue to crop up, and the pair make their way to Blandings Castle, home of the Clarence the prize pig, and the Earl of Emworth. The ending truly is brilliant, as one absurdity piles upon another, and everything turns out well. This story is classic farce and good for a few laughs, but I struggled to maintain my interest for a reading of the whole thing. What I did really like was listening to a dramatized version of this on the BBC, with good English actors doing the parts - now that was funny!"},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime","review":"This is my very favorite book, and I have been reading it about once a year for the past 15 years or so. I still laugh out loud at every reading. The very complex plot deals with Pongo Twistleton and his Uncle Fred, who visit Blandings Castle as imposters (Sir Roderick Glossip and his secretary, to be exact) in an effort to prevent the Duke of Dunstable from stealing the Empress of Blandings, Lord Emsworth's prize pig, and to keep him from smashing the drawing room furniture with the fireplace poker. Polly Pott (daughter of private investigator Mustard Pott) is also in attendance, pretending to be Sir Roderick's daughter. The story also involves the Duke's two nephews and their romantic problems: It seems Horace Davenport has hired a private investigator (none other than Mustard Pott) to tail his fiancee Valerie (Pongo's sister) and she has called off the engagement as a result, and Ricky's jealousy of his fiancee's attention to cousin Horace has landed him in the onion soup. Money won and lost at Persian Monarchs, the slipping of mickey's into people's drinks, and a Duke who throws eggs at people who whistle The Bonny Bonny Banks of Lock Lomand outside his window add to the hilarity. Of course, Mr. Wodehouse's unique turn-of-phrase doesn't disappoint in this delightful novel. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks diversion from reality. A must-read."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime","review":"Professors of literature are fond of writing that the three greatest novelists of the twentieth century are Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, and James Joyce. In this, they could hardly be more in error. The only contender for the title of the greatest novelist of the twentieth or any other century is P.G. Wodehouse, farceur supreme, or, in plain English, an extraordinarily funny writer.Wodehouse wrote novels and stories that can be easily classified into several series: there are the Bertie and Jeeves novels and stories, the Blandings Castle novels and stories, the Mr. Mulliner stories, the Uncle Fred novels, etc. The characters from one series rarely appear in another. This novel is an exception. Uncle Fred appears at Blandings Castle, where he poses as Sir Roderick Glossop, normally seen in the Bertie and Jeeves novels (and one story); indeed, he encounters Sir Roderick while traveling to Blandings Castle. Uncle Fred, properly, Frederick Altamont Cornwallis Twistleton, fifth Earl of Ickenham, is a man who \\"together with a juvenile waistline, . . . still retained the bright enthusiasms and the fresh, unspoiled outlook of a slightly inebriated undergraduate\\" at the age of sixty or so. It is he who sets in motion the events that enable young lovers to marry and his nephew Pongo to settle his gambling debts. In general, his role is that normally played by Lord Emsworth's younger brother Galahad.Of course, any reader of Wodehouse novels knows at the start that things will turn out all right for any sundered hearts or frustrated lovers, as he knows that, any time the efficient Baxter appears, he will be discredited despite being thoroughly correct. The fun is in discovering just how it happens.And what fun it is. Wodehouse's mastery of the English language is unrivaled. He succeeds in producing prose that not only is enjoyable in its own right but also moves events ahead at a pace that is nigh exhausting. In the Bertie and Jeeves novels and stories, it is Bertie's narration that does this. In this novel, it is the dialogue as much as the narration that moves events ahead, establishes the characters, and gives the reader immense pleasure."},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime","review":"If you have ever read &quot;Elements of Style&quot; by Strunk and White (and if you haven't, then you should be legally prohibited from writing even so much as a thank-you note), then this book, like all Wodehouse books, is a perfect example of how to violate almost every rule in the book.Consider the following: &quot;The ninth Earl of Emsworth was a man who in times of stress always tended to resemble the Aged Parent in an old-fashioned melodrama when informed that the villain intended to foreclose the mortgage. He wore now a disintegrated air, as if somebody had removed most of his interior organs. You see the same sort of thing in stuffed parrots when the sawdust has leaked out of them.&quot;How's that for failing to &quot;omit needless words&quot;? And how's that for vividly portraying the feeble-minded Lord Emsworth, one of Wodehouse's most memorable of his many memorable and hilarious characters?The plot here is typical Wodehouse: a few love-stricken young people see their dreams of eternal wedded bliss threatened by either misunderstandings or lack of cash or both, and a young ne'er-do-well has run up some gambling debts, a circumstance which puts him in danger of some painful bone-crushing. Enter Uncle Fred, an aging playboy with a manipulative mind and a sense of adventure. He orchestrates a plan involving a visit to Blandings Castle (the Emsworth estate) which results in everyone living happily ever after.But, of course, that plot outline is pretty much the plot outline of every Wodehouse novel. What makes it (and every Wodehouse production) a 5-star novel is the delicious phraseology, the preposterous and yet believable characterizations, and the continuous twinkle in the author's eye. You either &quot;get&quot; Wodehouse or you don't. If you don't, then go to a doctor and get it fixed immediately!"},{"Title":"Uncle Fred in the springtime","review":"P.G. Wodehouse has written this wonderful book about a pig, and love relationships (the author makes fun of the love relationships, nothing to worry about). In the beginning, it seems boring, but it speeds up after about 30 pages. Unlike other Blandings books where the hero is Galahad, in this story the protagonist is Uncle Fred. But it is the common Wodehouse theme where the Empress is kidnapped, and couples cannot get married because of the shortage of money. The funny things about his books are the way he plays with the character's personality. Beach-cold and calm. Empress-with a frown on her face tries to eat a bit of soap while locked in a bathroom. Mr. Wodehouse has a way with words when he describes the character's actions and he puts them in such a way that you laugh until tears pour down your cheeks. This is a really good book, and if you think it is boring in the beginning, stick with it for it becomes very funny. Enjoy!!!!

Anyway, in this Blandings novel, impersonation is very important with Lord Ickenham coming to Blandings at Emswoth's request but hacing to pretend to be the London Brain surgeon Sir Roderick Glossop in order to keep Lady Constance off the trail. To give a taster, there is a scene where Ickenham heads off Glossop on the train with a view to deflecting Glossop from coming to Blandings but also he wants to get some information on how Glossop goes about his work:\\"I wish I had a brain like yours\\" said Lord Ickenham, \\"What an amazing thing.

Uncle Fred or the Fifth Earl of Ickenham is one of my favorite Wodehouse characters. He always seems to be dragging his nephew Pongo Twistleton (occasionally mentioned as a fellow Drones club member in the Wooster books) into trouble but always seems to get through it as is typical in the Wodehouse books. Anyway, it is a great read, a good laugh, and a lot of fun.

I then read about Wodehouse inLives of the Mind: The Use and Abuse of Intelligence from Hegel to Wodehouse. There Kimball writes about how incredibly funny Wodehouse is. Based on that, I decided to give Wodehouse a go and I was not disappointed. In fact, I am exhilarated. He truly is a writer of comic genius. His characters all have something to offer the funny bone and his plot twists and turns keep you expecting something else unexpected but satisfying. You can literally get a laugh from almost every page. This story about an uncle who takes life by the horns and is always positive and looking to advance his agenda is funny and compelling. Wodehouse's descriptions of motives, clothing, attitudes, and expectations - you name it - are all clever, entertaining and hysterical.

Since I am not an archaeologist (or a professional historian for that matter), some of what I read was a bit above my head, but it did, however, give me an understanding of the organization of a major archaeological excavation, and some of the interdisciplinary techniques used in modern archaeology which was a useful lesson in itself.This book contains reports from 13 scholars who worked on the excavations at Harappa, and the following is a brief summary of the each of the major reportsChapter 3: Pedology and Late Quaternary Environments Surrounding Harappa:A review of the climate of the Punjab, the geology and geomorphology of the River Ravi, and soils and geomorphology surrounding Harappa. The conclusions are that conditions at Harappan were similar to the present with the possibility of a stronger monsoon periodChapter 4: Urban process in the Indus Tradition A Preliminary Model from HarappaA review of the earlier excavations at Harappa, the objectives for the 1986-1990 excavations, a review of the results of carbon dating of 33 carbon samples, and a discussion of the deposits during each of the five periods of habitation at Harappa from the Kot Diji Early Harappan phase to the final occupation of the Late Harappan phase.Chapter 5: Some specialized Ceramic Studies at HarappaA review of pottery, figurines, stoneware bangles, and faience discovered during the 1986-1990 excavationsChapter 6: Patterns of Technology and the Organization of Production at HarappaA review of the technical features of pottery production at HarappaChapter 7: Faunal Remains and Urbanism at HarappaA technical review of the results of measurements of bones of mammals (mainly cattle, sheep, and goats) found at Harappa, as compared with those found at other Harappan sites such as Mehrgarh and NausharoChapter 8: Fish Resources in an Early Urban Context at HarappaA review of the collection, preparation, marketing aspects of the fish trade during the Harappan period, and a comparison with the fish remains at Harappa compared with those at the coastal Harappan site of BalakotChapter 9: Urban Palaeoethnobotany at HarappaA review of major questions to be asked in future studies of macrobotanical remains from urban sites like HarappaChapter 10: Complementary Approaches to Late Harappan Subsistence: An example from Oriyo TimboA review of crop processing during the late Harappan period and the analysis of crop remains found at the site of Oriyo Timbo (Gujarat)Chapter 11: Biological Adaptations and Affinities of Bronze Age HarappansA review of the methods and analysis of human skeletal remains (primarily dental and cranial) recovered from Cemetery R37 at Harappa to address the question of progressive agricultural intensification and biological continuityChapter 13: Summaries of Five Seasons of Research at Harappa 1986-1990A review of the objectives and work accomplished including excavations, paleoenvironmental studies, site conservation, and training program for each of the five seasons during this periodThe reports contain numerous detailed maps, tables, illustrations, and charts, which are absolutely necessary to gain even a rudimentary understanding of the reports. My overall impression of the findings of these excavations is that much work still needs to be done, since many of the conclusions reached were at best very tentative. As a result of reading this book, I was tempted to search the \\"Net\\" for further information about ongoing excavations of Harappan sites, and found an impressive site at http://www.harappa.com which amongst other things provides many beautiful photographs and interesting essays on the Harappan sites and aspects of the Harappan civilization.In summary, I am happy to have read the book, in spite of the problems I had with understanding some of the details of the technology. I achieved my objective in learning more about the discoveries at the site of Harappa, as well as the difficulties of drawing definitive conclusions from them, and I also learnt many significant things about archaeological techniques which up to now I have rather taken for granted."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Fighting Ships (Brief History, The)","review":"This is a book that does pretty much what it says on the cover. The ships are mentioned, sometimes in surprising detail and with the emphasis on first to third rates, along with the seamen's life and living conditions of the period. Major sea battles of the Revolutionary, and Napoleonic wars are also outlined, and comments made on the state of the relevant forces, and contemporary political views. In effect it is a potted history, but excellent as an introduction to the period or for background reference when starting with historical naval fiction."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Fighting Ships (Brief History, The)","review":"This book is short sharp and to the point and yet has a suprising amount of detail.

These are the stories, written by MZB herself, that have appeared in the various collections, collected here in one place for those purists who refuse to read the Darkover fan fiction but want to read everything that herself has had to say. They include &quot;To Keep The Oath&quot;, the story of how Camilla came to be a renunciate; &quot;The Keeper's Price&quot;, written in collaboration with Lisa Waters about the failed keeper Hillary Castamir, &quot;Everything But Freedom&quot;, about the Lady Rohana, and several tales of Dyan Ardais.The writing is excellent, as any regular reader of Marion Zimmer Bradley could have guessed, and the stories give us interesting glimpses into the interstices between the full-length Darkover novels.If you've collected all of the Friends of Darkover Collections, you may not feel that it's worth the price of a whole book just for two new stories (although the new ones -- &quot;Hillary's Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Hillary's Wedding&quot; -- are both quite good) but if you have not been willing to buy collections of fan fiction for the one or two actual MZB stories per book, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover","review":"This book (kindle version) contains:To Keep the OathBonds of SisterhoodHouse RulesKnivesFiretrapThe Keeper's PriceThe Lesson of the InnHilary's HomecomingHilary's WeddingEverything But FreedomOathbreakerHawkmaster's SonA Man of ImpulseThe Shadow"},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to fill in the holes between the Darkover books without having to wade through fan fiction. I've never read any of the other Friends of Darkover collections. In my opinion, the stories ranged from excellent to painful.\\"Hilary's Homecoming\\" was a nightmare continuitywise. I know that MZB has stated that she was never concerned about continuity in her books, but there is a minimum. I mean, Hilary comes home as a very young virgin from Arilinn and meets her grandson as a potential suitor!The longest story in this book \\"Everything But Freedom\\" about Rohana Ardais (from the Renunciate trilogy) ran nearly 100 pages and was only vaguely interesting. Several of the other stories were also about the Free Amazons; they were interesting, but forgettable.The highlight of this book was definitely the section on Dyan Ardais; specifically, the last two stories, \\"Man of Impulse\\" and \\"The Shadow\\". \\"Man of Impulse\\" deals with Dyan's stay with Merryl and Marilla at Lindirsholme, which was referenced in \\"Sharra's Exile\\". \\"The Shadow\\" is about the relationship between Regis and Danilo between \\"Heritage of Hastur\\" and \\"Sharra's Exile\\".Although most of the collection was pretty mediocre, the book is definitely worth buying if just for Dyan's stories."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley declares in her preface to one of these stories that she was \\"not generally infatuated with [herself] as a short story writer,\\" but she still found it worthwhile, over 37 years writing about Darkover, to turn out a few short pieces, and here she collects them for readers who are unable to obtain them in the original form. The stories are arranged according to focus: four about the Free Amazons, five about Hilary Castamir, four about Dyan Ardais (whom Bradley calls \\"by far the most popular character [she] ever invented\\"), and a novella focusing on Lady Rohana Ardais. In these stories we learn how Camilla, familiar to readers ofThe Saga of the Renunciates (The Shattered Chain, Thendara House, City of Sorcery) (Darkover)as Magda Lorne's lover, joined the Amazon order, and visit Guildhouses large and small to see something of how Renunciates live. We follow Hilary ofThe Forbidden Towerthrough her difficult and painful attempt at Keeper training, through her disappointed return home and her conflicts with her mother over suitors, to her rejection of the widower Farrill Lindir in favor of Colin Syrtis. We share Rohana's difficulties with a hard-drinking husband and son, an intransigent fostri (Jaelle n'ha Melora of the Renunciates novels), and the management of her family's estate; in many ways, despite Darkover's level (or lack) of technology, Rohana seems more Victorian than Medieval. And in a quartet of stories unfortunately not chronologically arranged (continuity buffs should read \\"Hawkmaster's Son\\" first, then \\"Oathbreaker,\\" \\"The Shadow,\\" and \\"Man of Impulse\\" last of all) we watch the development of Dyan from class-conscious youngster (he ruins the happiness of at least three people when he warns a young girl's noble father of her plans to elope with a commoner) to mature, urbane homosexual--who has a love affair, and a child, with a friend's sister. As in all Darkover books, there are tidbits aplenty about Darkovan society, the planetary environment, and all the other background information that made the planet come to life for a large fandom and keeps most of the novels in print to this day. Since the stories are best appreciated if you're already familiar with the later exploits of the characters, this shouldn't be your introduction to Darkover; start, rather, with one of the books set following the Terran rediscovery, such as those already mentioned or THE SPELL SWORD - A DARKOVER NOVEL, Sharra's Exile, orThe World Wreckers (Darkover: Against the Terrans: The Second Age), then use this collection to better understand the people you meet in them."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover","review":"I was a fan of the different Darkover anthologies when they first came out. They were uneven - some of the stories were great and some were horrible. This collection is made up of the stories that Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote for the collections and shows an inside look at some of her characters.As a technical note, the Kindle version has a somewhat linked table of contents. From the table of contents, you can jump to any story, but you can't jump back to the table of contents from inside the book.

One of his prime exhibits was the AMERASIA case, where what started as an espionage conspiracy suddenly, mysteriously collapsed. &quot;It's true,&quot; said the Right and the Republicans. &quot;Nonsense you're all paranoids,&quot; said Democrats, liberals, and the Left. Now, thanks to Klehr and Radosh, we have the truth, and it is stranger than anything either side ever suspected. There were multiple, independent, overlapping conspiracies, at AMERASIA magazine (to spy for Stalin),in the State Dept. (to undermine FDR's China Policy), in the Communist movement (to shape U.S. policy) in the Justice Dept. (to cover up political embarrassments) and in Congress (to cover up the other conspiracies). Had the truth been told then, we might have been spared some of the worst political messes of modern times. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Amerasia Spy Case: Prelude to McCarthyism","review":"In 1995, with the release of the Venona Papers, the charade that the Russians were \\"Socialists In A Hurry\\" or \\"Socialists In Overhalls\\" went out the window. The subsequent access to KGB files and the discovery of the papers of the Communist Party-USA that had been hidden in a Russian warehouse for 40 years (Yelstsin asked Reagan if he wanted them as they were taking up too much space!!) only added to the primary research material that ended once and for all the arguments between the Left and the Right on who was right on the cold war. The Left lost!Further, the charade that there were no Russian spies, either domestic or foreign, in the US is finally put to rest with the exposure of not only the Rosenburgs (whose sons are now trying a new tack by saying that at least their mother wasn't a spy--sorry boys), Alger Hiss was an industrial strength liar until they buried him at 93 (Truman didn't move him out of the State Department to the Carnegie Endowment For Peace for nothing), Witaker Chambers was not only telling the truth but was right on every count, and Harry Dexter White (someone whose daughters were still trying to clear his name as recently as 1994) was \\"red\\" to the marrow while undermining the Nationalist Chinese cause during their civil war with the Communists. One member of the Truman administration, I forgot which (Laurence Duggan?), had the good sense to jump out a window to his demise as the FBI was closing in.\\"Amerasia\\" is superb in exposing it as a Communist spy cover being run out of Johns Hopkins University, not a bona fide research think tank, and that McCarthy was right in his charges.To make the reading even more enjoyable for those of you who were on the Right during those years the authors expose Tommy \\"The Cork\\" Corchoran, a major \\"fixer\\" for the FDR administration (he got Father Coughlin tossed off the radio by going to the Bishop of Detroit), as the go-between who fixed the trial with payoffs of judgeships and other government positions for the key people. The whole trial was a fraud and a set-up and the authors find the primary documents to prove their case.A seminal work of American History, the Cold War, and Communism in the United States.A book you'll probably read twice because of the dismay, keep in your library, recommend to everyone you know, and then proudly proclaim: \\"McCarthy was right!\\"."},{"Title":"Amerasia Spy Case: Prelude to McCarthyism","review":"The Amerasia spy case - a case where six Americans associated with the Far-Eastern affairs journal \\"Amerasia\\" were charged with espionage in June, 1945, but then cleared or had charges reduced - would be confined to the dust-bin of history if Sen. Joe McCarthy had not made the case relevant again with his Lincoln Day speech in 1950 in Wheeling, WV, where he asserted that up to 205 card-carrying Communists currently worked in the State Dept. The authors do not ignore the consequences of McCarthy's inflammatory charges, devoting a lengthy chapter to the special subcommittee hearings chaired by Sen. Tydings of MD to investigate State Dept security, but their main thrust is to detail the movements, meetings, and conversations of those six individuals and others from the time they were suspected of espionage through the disposition of their case, as well as, the actions taken by various governmental bodies in pursuit of them. Despite the authors' close look, in the end, the entire situation remains murky and ambiguous. It is not in doubt that all of the six had Communist sympathies and associated with known Communists, but they seemed to not have crossed the line into outright espionage, though one, Philip Jaffe, was actively seeking such an opportunity.The entire affair began only on the chance reading by an OSS analyst of an article published in the Jan, 1950, issue of \\"Amerasia\\" that was a virtual reprint of a secret report that he had previously written. The OSS, when given an opportunity to break into the journal's offices, found hundreds of classified documents from several departments, most of them related to the Far-East. The FBI was called in to conduct a thorough investigation. It is not surprising that virtually the entire book, other than the use of some public records, is based on FBI documents produced from all manner of sources: from break-ins, surveillance, phone taps, and hidden microphones, in addition, to more conventional reports.The individuals arrested were: Philip Jaffe, founder and editor, an independently wealthy person and the most pro-active of them all; Kate Mitchell, assistant editor, very smart and the daughter of well-respected, conservative family; John Stewart Service, State Dept diplomat, convinced that the Communists would and should take over China; Andrew Roth, a US Navy lieutenant, a Communist sympathizer who nonetheless was with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI); Emmanuel \\"Jimmy\\" Larsen, an obscure State Dept employee with Far-Eastern interests; and Mark Gayn, a well-known, free-lance reporter who traveled in radical circles. Larsen and Roth seemed to have been the sources for most of the documents, whereas, Service basically passed on his own reports written as part of his duties.In light of subsequent developments, it is startling that the Justice Dept pursued this case so vigorously. Initially, some in the FBI considered the case to be \\"airtight.\\" But such sentiments evaporated quickly. Instead, prosecutors quickly realized that they had no direct evidence of espionage. Furthermore, they had no confidence that the methods used to obtain evidence could hold up in court. And there were definitely political and exposure considerations. Political fixer Thomas Corcoran, working with the Justice Dept and special prosecutor Robert Hitchcock, orchestrated a damage-control strategy in not forcefully pushing the case, especially with the grand jury. Service, Mitchell, and Gayn were cleared by the grand jury. In the Fall of 1945, Jaffe and Larsen paid fines of $2500 and $500, respectively, on charges of theft and illegal possession of documents, not espionage. In Feb, 1946, all charges against Roth were dropped. The handling of the case was very controversial. The press excoriated the Justice Dept for hounding leftists, and conservatives found the conduct of the case to be a whitewash. Hitchcock joining the prestigious law firm of Mitchell's uncle shortly after the case was resolved seemed to confirm that view.Political conservatives and anti-communists, of whom McCarthy was a foremost member, had been convinced for years that a certain faction in the US government, primarily in the State Dept, was intent on undermining the Chinese nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek in favor of the Communists led by Mao Tse-tung. The fall of China to the Communists in late 1949 merely exacerbated those sentiments. The convergence of many factors buoyed McCarthy's charges. Cold War anti-communism was raging, but conservatives had been thwarted in gaining control of the Presidency for twenty years. They were certain that proving a large-scale penetration of the US government by Communist agents would propel them into the Presidency.McCarthy was not a member of the Tydings committee, but in playing the roles of witness and outside agitator, he set the tone for the proceedings. His aggressiveness is typified by his pursuit of \\"China Hand\\" and college professor Owen Lattimore, referring to him as the \\"top Russian espionage agent,\\" a charge found to have almost no substance. Of course, the Amerasia \\"whitewash\\" was on the agenda. However, the Amerasia defendants called before the committee provided no more clarity than five years prior. The Tydings' hearing did not go well for the conservatives or McCarthy. Clearly there was no wholesale penetration of the US government by Communist agents. On the other hand, McCarthy was not deterred. His vigorous pursuit of Communists would continue into 1954, until his own excesses in that search brought about a quick fall.The book is very narrowly focused; it is concerned almost entirely with the Amerasia affair and the persons closely tied to the case. It is almost too narrow. There would seem to have been room for the authors to widen the scope of their examination without loosing focus. It is not really clear that knowing all the minute maneuverings of the six persons is all that important, though perhaps is somewhat interesting. The book does provide some context for understanding McCarthy's charges. The authors do not hide from the clandestine activities, ambiguous loyalties, and efforts to cover-up concerning security matters. They are fairly even-handed in their judgments.No doubt, security and loyalty are dicey subjects, especially in a time of war in a nation that supposedly values the free flow of ideas. This book does shine a light on the difficulty of balancing those concerns, despite the lack of indisputable conclusions about many of the particulars of this case."},{"Title":"Good Night, Everybody ...and Be Kind","review":"Dennis Anderson is a talented and very popular news anchor with WDIO Channel 10 television in Duluth, Minnesota. His has been a familiar face in northern Minnesota for more than 30 years.Good Night Everybody...and be kind is a pleasant collection of relatively brief anecdotes from Dennis Anderson's childhood on the Iron Range, his married life, and his career in radio and in television. It combines personal autobiography, memoir, opinion, and local history. The episodes are not recounted chronologically. Instead, they are presented in chapters organized by subject matter. The tales of memorable news stories Anderson has covered nicely indicate much that has happened locally and nationally in the last several decades. His recollections of his parents and his grandparents and of growing up in Virginia, Minnesota paint a clearly affectionate portrait of time and place and family. The stories of his start in radio broadcasting as a teenager and of his later experiences as a successful television newsman (without the benefit of a university degree) are interesting. The book includes a full index of names and a good selection of photos.The author writes in an easy, informal, and conversational style which sounds very much like Dennis Anderson's on-air persona. Unfortunately, he is not a master of English prose. There are dangling participles, awkward sentences, and infelicitous word choices--enough, at any rate, to indicate that Anderson is a man more comfortable with the spoken than with the written word. The writing is nevertheless clear, and the book is enjoyable. It will be of interest to anyone who shares Anderson's love of this region, anyone who has shared with Anderson the events and changes of the last forty years, and anyone who has followed the professional development of this exceptional broadcaster."},{"Title":"Good Night, Everybody ...and Be Kind","review":"Being from the area in Northern Minnesota, we related to many of the stories he wrote.

Singer's first book, \\"Directed Verdict,\\" gave warning that he was a fresh and exciting voice in this genre. Could he back it up with a second hit?Yes, and again, yes! Singer introduces us to Mitchell Taylor, fresh out of law school and applying for that coveted legal position. But Taylor quickly finds himself frustrated, working for a glorified ambulance chaser. What Taylor doesn't know is that he's about to represent a critical case in which cloning and woman's rights will be challenged from every angle.Maryna is the beautiful and emotionally scarred illegal immigrant facing \\"irreparable harm.\\" Her story, along with journal entries, is the beating heart of this novel. Maryna not only faces a violent past, she faces an unknown future as she carries a surrogate child. The child's mother discovers that this baby could have Down's syndrome and wants Maryna to \\"terminate\\" the pregnancy so that she can pursue a healthy child with cloned cells. The legal battles that ensue are only part of the conflict involved.Singer handles the legal aspects with aplomb, and he does a fine job of educating us about cloning procedures. He particularly shines, though, when he dashes the dialogue with humor, and when his characters succumb to the dangers of romance and emotion. Without getting sappy, Singer makes us care for Taylor and Maryna. He threads many plot ideas together, creating a complex story--even if one or two threads remained a bit frayed in conclusion. For example, what ever happened to Maryna's would-be abductors?By the story's end, Singer throws us some wonderful curveballs and change-ups. His narrative rarely lets up, and he rewards us with emotional payoffs. He gives us characters we don't want to leave--and reintrodues a few from his first book. On the last page, he drops some strong hints that we'll be learning more about some of these characters in his next book. I can't wait!Singer, like Grisham, gives us serious issues to consider, while never forgeting to focus on human stories amidst the legal finagling. He serves up a hefty feast, but by the end leaves us wanting more. Hmm...I see no harm in that!"},{"Title":"Irreparable Harm","review":"Did I say Randy Singer was good? This man is awesome! If Randy Singer were a baseball, with all his twists and turns, and then a top notch fastball to boot, we'd be calling him Randy Johnson! I almost had to take a shower after this book, I was sweating so bad! And John Grisham needs to give Mr. Singer a call on writing tips, because Singer makes Grisham look like an amateur, and I really like Grisham. But there's a new kid in town, and that's who I'm reading!Join Mitchell Taylor as he takes the case of Maryna Sareth. Maryna is running from the Snakeheads, Chinese gangsters, and so much more. You also get the feeling that she is indeed searching for something, being raised as a Buddhist. There are a lot of heart pounding twists in this case that literally make you sweat. In some places you actually feel for Cameron when you realize that she never had much of a relationship with her father, better known as The Rock. You feel for her in wondering if things between them will ever be resolved. Judge Baker-Kline, better known as Ichabod returns in this first class thriller to liven up the action.All I can say is that if you have yet to read Randy Singer, you are missing quite a treat. Awesome! When you read him, you are reading more than simply a court case, or whatever it may be. He goes much deeper than that, and that is what I personally love about this author. He's one of my top 3 favorites to read!"},{"Title":"Irreparable Harm","review":"This is an overall nice legal thriller, but I just wished he tied it up a little better at the end with a little more follow-through. The romance seemed a little thrown together as well."},{"Title":"Irreparable Harm","review":"It took one novel for Randy Singer to tie Alistair MacLean as my favorite novelist. It took two for him to surpass MacLean.This novel has several common characters with Singer's first novel, \\"Directed Verdict\\". Those who were major players in both stories were paralegal Nikki Moreno and judge Cynthia Baker-Kline (aka Ichabod). Two minor characters from the first novel -- attorneys Winn MacKenzie and Bill \\"The Rock\\" Davenport -- are main characters in this novel.One thing is that there is no real formula between the two novels. For one thing, \\"Directed Verdict\\"s main character, Brad Carson, was not a Christian at either the beginning or ending of the story, while Mitchell Taylor, in this story, is. Another thing is the trial is the focus of the first novel, taking half the story. There is only a preliminary hearing that starts 2/3 of the way through this one, and it never had the chance to continue.The theme of this book is ethics, especially in the area of the starting of life. Cloning, abortion, etc. are the focal point here. The issue is handled well. Not unlike Frank Peretti's \\"Prophet\\", there is a pro-choice person who sides against the extreme of the abortion on demand side, and the hypocrisy of some in that movement.Singer is wise in having non-Christian protagonists in the stories, with Nikki Moreno being an excellent example. I also like that Singer has few true villains among his antagonists. Most of the antagonists are allowed to show a human side, so you don't utterly despise them.There are two ways that authors create suspense in a book. One is to hide as much as possible, so you are surprised at the turns. The other is to set up obvious confrontations early on in the book, and then see how the author gets you out of it. Singer uses the second method very effectively.I will admit that I liked \\"Directed Verdict\\" better, partially due to the theme and partially due to the story crafting. The finale of the book reminded me of a novel by Catherine Coulter, for example. However, I have a hunch that other Singer fans prefer this one.One reviewer complained that this book was sermonizing and promoting the point of view. I have a hunch that people who are pro-choice feel that way about any book that deals with abortion and has a protagonist opposed to it (same with stem cell research). But those who are open minded will see that there are pro-choice characters, including one of the good guys (technically, good girl), and those that are not good guys (or gals) are not such because they support abortion and/or stem cell research but because of other personality characteristics such as hypocrisy. One of those points out that one should not judge all pro-choice people because of their criminal activity any more than one should judge all pro-lifers because of a handful of abortion clinic bombers. If anything, the book actually creates understanding for those who have differing views on the issue."},{"Title":"Irreparable Harm","review":"Irreparable Harm by Randy Singer is a slamdunk Christian suspense novel. Singer is able to take on two controversial topics and handle them both with delicacy and care. Mitchell Taylor, just out of law school, ends up representing Maryna Sireth in a case involving both cloning and abortion. The characters are well-balanced and realistic (except for Blaine, but you always have to have a bad guy) and the Christianity is used as a foundation for the characters, not as a soapbox. Maryna's Buddhism is handled with respect. This is loosely a sequel to Directed Verdict, but you certainly don't have to read that one to enjoy this one, only a few characters return. The ones that do come back are rounded out better, and I look forward to the next book in the series. Grisham has nothing on Randy Singer. This has fast-paced action, lots of legal talk, romance, and it's just enjoyable to read.

Rather than easing into his on-the-job training as an attorney, he is thrust into a high profile case with precedent setting potential. It includes cloning and forced abortion among its issues.Singer does a very good job of explaining the complexities of different types of cloning as well as the relevant legal issues while still keeping the story interesting. The part that did not work for me was a romance involving two of the main players seems rushed and superficial. Although this is a good read, it is not Mr. Singer's best.For those who have never read his work, I would recommend three of his other novels ahead of this one:Directed Verdict,Dying Declaration, andFalse Witness.

The tone of his approach to SCIENCE vs. RELIGION is friendly and collegial, not ponderous. This tone is a key to the success of his book. However, Turell also comprehensively, accurately, and carefully reviews the serious scientific, philosophical, and theological literature that bears on his topic. By the means of presenting and synthesizing a depth and density of facts and data, Turell brings the reader steadily to contemplate his compelling and profound conclusions.Dr. Turell is candid about his personal journey in search of God that entwines with his writing of this book. This personal investment of energy enlivens Turell's creative work. Lets examine how Dr. Turell proceeds with his journey that becomes our journey as his readers.Chapter 1 (Enemies or Helpmates) frames the key elements of a respectful, honest and productive debate between Scientists and Creationists. Turell's quote of Pope John Paul II, sums it up beautifully: \\"Science can purify religion from error and superstition, and religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes\\". Chapter 2 (Our Designer Universe Fine-Tuned for Life) summarizes the fascinating findings of astronomy and cosmology of the 20th century and beyond. There are \\"Big Bangs\\" and big chemical events described as Turell concludes that only the God of \\"Intelligent Design\\" could have programmed a safe place for our existence. As usual he presents views to the contrary fairly. Chapter 3 (Is Life a Glorious Accident? No Chance), visits the intensely conflicted and often misunderstood and misrepresented world of Darwin's ideas. Roll-up your intellectual sleeves for this encounter! Chapter 4 (Is The Evolution of Humans a Glorious Accident?) takes us deeper into the Darwin trek by information-dense discussion of the implications of recent findings from geology, archeology and the implications of DNA for human evolution. Turell makes no excuses for complexity in our destiny and its religious implications. Chapter 5 (Our Hat Size Is Too Big for Darwin), gets into the implications that our large brain size, language development, and consciousness/self-consciousness has for transcendent religious experiences as a reflection of God's presence. Hold your hats for this discussion! Chapter 6 (Hallucination or Glimpse of the Afterlife?) soars into the fascinating territories of Near Death Experiences and Out of Body Experiences. Turell carefully presents distilled data from many sources about these spiritually enlightening and conscientiously documented medical phenomena. Dr. Turell follows the trail left by the implications of these unusual forms of human conscious experience. Does he jolt you with this conclusion? \\"My guess is our life-after-life is not somewhere else. It is probably right here with us. Generally, in our three dimensional form, we are not aware of it, but my theory suggests it is not difficult to cross over and come back at the quantum level, since quantum particles can be in two places at the same time.\\" (p171). Chapter 7 (Belief in God Through Rational Philosophy) is a scholarly and penetrating journey that integrates Turell's previous discussions of the design of the universe and ourselves with the implications of our Consciousness that leads to the conclusion that God exists. Competent philosophers and theologians would respect this chapter regardless of their conclusion about the existence of God. Chapter 8 (Reflections on a Personal Theology) is a gem because Dr. Turell expresses his personal convictions and conclusions with the same candor and collegial tone that characterizes the entire book.For the reader who stays attentive to the information and relentlessly persuasive synthesis that Turell provides, there will be rich personal rewards.Peter A. Olsson MD"},{"Title":"Science vs. Religion: The 500-Year War, Finding God in the Heat of the Battle","review":"I am the author:There is a need to present to the average reading public an overview of the science and theology dialogue now being carried on only at a very academic level. Dr. Turell has written a review of the field of the interaction of science and religion, for high school level readers who want or need an introduction to this area of intellectual discourse. Although it covers contributions from both secularist authors and also scientists who believe in God, Turell does, however, like John Polkinghorne and Richard Swinburne, conclude that the past 150 years of science logically prove the existence of God. Turell uses the method in Mortimer J. Adler's book, How to Think About God; A Guide for the 20th Century Pagan, proposing to prove the existence of God \`beyond a reasonable doubt.'After describing his own background, explaining why he wished to write the book, Turell presents a review of the current adversaries in the \`war'. A simple view of the cosmology of the universe is described in the Chapter, Our Designer Universe Fine-Tuned for Life. After understanding that the universe allows life, the reader is introduced to the scientific research difficulties in determining how life might have gotten started naturally from inorganic matter. The fact that evolution occurred is strongly supported, as a direct answer to the contentions of \`young earth' creationists. However, all of the problems with the Darwin Theory, especially the controversies between Darwin scientists, for example, the marked differences between Simon Conway Morris and Stephen J. Gould, are reviewed.In the chapter, Our Hat Size is too Big for Darwin, is the presentation of the issue as to why should a species appear with such a massive intellect, not really required by nature for survival? There follows a discussion of consciousness, and the philosophic problem of recognizing that somehow \`mind' appears out of matter. This leads naturally to a discussion on near-to-death and out-of-the-body phenomena and university level research into psychic phenomena. Turell concludes with his reasons for believing in the existence of God, and then discusses applications of this decision, for example' how to teach Darwin in the public schools indicating all the problems with his theory.Dr. Turell is a retired internist, who was in medical practice for over 30 years. After all of his scientific education he became an agnostic, but unsatisfied with that philosophic position, he spent over two decades reading more than 100 books, innumerable articles in scientific and lay journals and magazines before reaching his conclusions. This book really represents an autobiographical review of his research."},{"Title":"Science vs. Religion: The 500-Year War, Finding God in the Heat of the Battle","review":"I find Science vs. Religion is a very worthwhile book. It is chock full of scientists' 20th Century findings and philosophers' up-to-date thoughts about the universe, life, intelligence and how all this bears on whether God exists.If readers aren't interested in this subject matter, they must be wholly without curiosity.The argument for the existence of God that struck me as the most convincing (page 122) is the finding that the human brain grew four times larger during the 2.5 million years it took for hominids to become humans. This cannot be attributed to Darwinian gradualism. We had no need for so large a brain so soon. Why did our brain, and only ours, grow so relatively fast? Maybe there is a God, a playful one.On the other hand, it is argued on page 183 that \\"if a first cause was caused, then it could not be a first cause. It must be God\\". I'd say it must be an \\"Occam's Razor\\" issue, as the Razor is explained in the book, with no need to evoke God as a deductive explanation. The \\"Big Bang\\" may simply be the \\"Big Bang\\", having no cause, not requiring the invention of an explanation.I like the book's \\"argument from consciousness\\" (page 206), that \\"we are aware that we are aware,\\" and we have the intellectual capacity that might help us duck another asteroid like the one that killed off the dinosaurs and might later move to another hospitable solar system before our sun dies. Our helpful God at work again?All this is every interesting and thought-provoking, and I'm for it. The book is great. I've enjoyed reading it and thinking about it, and I'll probably use it as a reference for years to come.Yet I remain an agnostic, one who respects believers but who can't ever quite make it into the fold.Part of my trouble is that I don't understand what good it does anyone for me to hold a set of beliefs concerning God. Morals and ethics, yes, but not God Himself. I can only speculate as to whether He exists and if so, why?"},{"Title":"Science vs. Religion: The 500-Year War, Finding God in the Heat of the Battle","review":"Dr. Turell's book resonated with me because it crossed many trails I have pursued myself in terms of its reflection on the foundations for God's existence and presence in the world, while adding the personal perspective of the author on his own search for spiritual comfort with the Designer. I have been a fan of Mortimer Adler, whose philosophical approach to God Turell borrows, for many years and have monitored with interest the arguments of the proponents of intelligent design and the anthropic principle, as well as the explanations of the deficiencies of Darwinism as a final theory. Dr. Turell weaves all these threads together with a personal touch, and provides some suggestions for compromises in certain aspects of the cultural war that have merit as well as some helpful tips for other pilgrims.

A veritable brood who have cornered the writing of History as seen though their own warped, pinko tinted spectacles. And for this \\"service\\" to scholarship, the brood has lost no opportunity to monopolise state largess, siphon off grants for various projects without delivering. The few times this pretend-busy brood has deigned to deliver, then the output of any \\"research\\" has been so immersed in the ideology prescribed by some foreign, totalitarian, failed Party and State, that it defies the description of scholarship.No wonder that none of the eminences or their intellectual offspring have had the guts to respond to the issues that Shourie raises here. They deploy the same strategy as they do in their historical \\"researches\\" - first ignore it, then decry it as petty, from an amateur, hurl personal insults, falsify facts.Remember: these \\"eminences\\" have made a career out of claiming that Aurangzeb was a just ruler, that the Caste System was the sole reason for India's problems, that Islam brought equality, that the systematic destruction of countless temples was an economic exercise and had absolutely nothing to do with the hatred and contempt that the Islamic invaders had for Indian culture and traditions.For \\"eminences\\" who deny the history as written by the chroniclers themselves of the invasions, of pillage, of destruction, of the rape that they carried out in honour of their iconoclasm, it is easy to falsify even recent history like the events around partition; like the Ramjanambhoomi dispute; like Secularism and minority rights.Shourie's book is an excellent antidote to the .... from these eminences that still passes off as \\"academic research\\".

By going back to original documents (like the akbarnama) he shows how the conclusions are blatantly false, but are seen as 'true' simply due to repeated assertion!.Shourie traces these leaps and jumps across authors, across books, again and again.Its like watching someone take apart a Madoff scheme -- and show that even the share receipts are false!He does end optimistically, noting that all it takes for this edifice of lies to crumble is for people to think.

He denied citizenship to women (though this was normal for thinkers of his age). He used language such as\\" forced to be free\\" and \\"trained to bear with docility the yoke of the public happiness\\". The Censorial Tribunal and the insistence on a civil religion seem illiberal to the modern mind. He argued that monarchy (single ruler) is best in large states, and elsewhere aristocracy (preferably elective) is generally best because democratic governments often suffer internal strife: \\"If there were a nation of Gods, it would govern itself democratically. A government so perfect is not suited to men.\\" He requires citizens to cede all rights to the community, whereas modern democracies invariably stress rights. Finally, Rousseau condemns representative government and dislikes political parties and pressure groups, for they tend to create mini general wills that make it difficult for the General Will to emerge.Some of these points can be countered more or less successfully. On the question of language Rousseau is employing rhetorical flourish. On democratic government, Rousseau's preference for aristocracy is not all-important because the democratic elements of his theory concern the sovereignty of the people, not the form of government. On pressure groups and political parties, Rousseau wishes to discourage rather than ban them, and Rousseau has certainly not been the only critic of representative government.In what ways is Rousseau's thought democratic? The elements are consent, participation and majorities. Locke had postulated consent in the Social Contract and \\"tacit\\" consent thereafter, but for Rousseau consent requires all (male) citizens to meet regularly to determine the laws, for only thus could a general will emerge through which men find true freedom. Though this direct democracy is impractical in modern states (too large), the concept of participation won many supporters in the second half of the 20th century who argued that modern representative government provides inadequate opportunities for participation. The claim that people - all the people - must be the author of the laws is Rousseau's greatest claim to be a democrat. Others were later to assert that a \\"general will\\" existed in society without reference to a popular assembly, and Rousseau would have had no truck with that.One idea that makes Rousseau seem very modern is his claim that freedom requires sufficient economic equality for no man to be dependent on another: that freedom and equality are inseparable. Not all modern democrats follow Rousseau in emphasising equality but an important group does.Of the arguments for seeing Rousseau as authoritarian or totalitarian the most important is the extent to which Rousseau assumes each man's interest are synonymous with the common good. Rousseau says men must vote in the assembly on what they believe to be the general will and if in a minority should tell themselves they were \\"mistaken\\" rather than simply on the losing side. It is true that Rousseau constantly reminds us he is writing of small and homogeneous states, but even in the smallest states there are surely greater differences of wants than Rousseau supposes, and greater differences of opinion as to what constitutes justice.The key feature of an authoritarian state is that decisions are made by a minority without majority participation in the previous discussions. The tools considered necessary by modern liberal democrats for \\"participation\\" and \\"discussion\\" are missing in Rousseau, for he discourages interest groups and political parties. However, the reason they are missing is because he insists on popular sovereignty, with the participation of all citizens in making the laws to establish a \\"general will\\". On the other hand, it is in this concept that elements of totalitarian democracy appear. Pluralist democrats assume men differ and that politics is the resolving of conflict between them. Rousseau assumes that politics is consensual, with a solution (a general will) waiting to be found. The word \\"authoritarian\\" is perhaps inappropriate, but his collectivism surely has totalitarian overtones. Yet Rousseau is perhaps more democrat than totalitarian by modern standards, arguing as he does that \\"each citizen should come to his own opinion.\\" I don't think Stalin, Hitler or Mao ever said that."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"'The tyranny of the majority' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of 'Democracy In America' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau's societal vision.

Their very individuality is subsumed to serve the will of the collective. This cannot be right. Minorities must be protected. If not, they will find a way.

Rousseau claimed that a perfect society would be controlled by the \\"general will\\" of its populace.While he does not define exactly how this should be accomplished (as there are many possible ways, each suited to different situations), he suggests that assemblies be held in which the every citizen can assist in determining the general will. Without this imput from the people, there can be no legitimate government. Importantly, this input cannot come from representatives, but must be from the people themesevles.\\"THE Sovereign, having no force other than the legislative power, acts only by means of the laws; and the laws being solely the authentic acts of the general will, the Sovereign cannot act save when the people is assembled.\\"[Book III, 12. HOW THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY MAINTAINS ITSELF]\\"Every law the people has not ratified in person is null and void -- is, in fact, not a law.\\" [Book III, 15. DEPUTIES OR REPRESENTATIVES]\\"The legislative power belongs to the people, and can belong to it alone\\"[Book III, 1. GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL]The Social Contract was a progressive work that helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. The Social Contract finally expelled the myth that the King was appointed by God to legeslate; as Rousseau asserts, only the people, in the form of the sovereign, have that all powerful right.The stated aim of the Social Contract is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority. \\"Man was born free, but he is everywhere he chains.\\" In order to accomplish more and remove himself from the state of nature, a man must enter into a Social Contract with others. In this social contract, everyone will be free because all forfeit the same amount of freedom and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau also argues that it is illogical for a man surrender his freedom for slavery, and so, the participants must be free. Furthermore, althought he contract imposes new law, especially on property, a person can exit it at any time (except in a time of need, for this is desertion), and is again as free as when he was born.Rousseau seems to prefer a benevolent Tyrant over any other form of leadership (including a true democracy); however, he remains obscure on this point.Rousseau posits that any administration, whatever form it takes, should be divided into two parts. First, there must be the sovereign (which could be the whole population if that is the majority's desire) who represents the general will and is the legeslative power within the state. The second division is that of the government, being distinct from the sovereign. This division must be since the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters (it is then acting as particular wills and not the general will--the sovereign is no longer whole and therefore ruined), like applications of the law. Therefore a government must be sperate from that of the sovereign body.[Rousseau] claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchal government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the bureaucracy, the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an aristocracy or monarchy. In light of all this, Rousseau seems to prefer a benevolent Tyrant over any other form of leadership (including a true democracy); however, he remains obscure on this point.Main IdeasOf the State of NatureRousseau scorns the state of nature as a state of perpetual war. In this state there is no private property--in fact, the only property that is truely one's own, is property that no one else wants.In this state of nature, strength rule, not by legitemacy, but by force itself. It is in this way that in a state of nature, man is only as free as he is strong. Furthermore, there is no pretection from others.It is from both of these detestable qualities that people enter into a Social Contract; it is to empower themselves to thereby be able to accomplish more--with the help of others--than would be possible in a state of nature. The elementary point in this social contract though is legitemate leadership and freedom. The freedom to be the same as others (no special burden unique to one person) and the freedom to leave the social order and revert back to a state of nature.Of WillsOne of the most important distinctions throughout the treatise is that of the seperate wills of people and government. For the people, there is the general will, the personal will, and the will of all. The general will desires what is best for the society as a whole, the personal will wants what is best for an individual, and the will of all is the summation of all personal will--not the general will. In government, there are three wills again: the general will, the coporate will, and personal will. The general will of the government is the same as those of the populace (as members of said populace make up the government), the coporate will desires the longevity of the government, and the personal will, as in the former case, is merely what people want for themselves.Of Government\\"Every free action has two causes which concur to produce it, one moral--the will which determines the act, the other physical--the strength which executes it. [...] The body politic has the same two motive powers--and we can make the same distinction between will and strength, the former is legislative power and the latter is executive power.\\" (Book III, Chater 1)The quintessential form of this Social Contract would be a democracy; however, unless, as Rousseau states, the population is one of Gods, this true democracy is impossilbe and, therefore, the state must be either an aristocracy or a monarchy, or a mixture of any of the three. The only duty of the sovereign is the embodiment of the general will, and when the general will fails to dictate the laws of the society, the sovereign has failed. To protect themsevles from this, the people should have an active role in the government election of officials and the passage of laws and must not pass their rights off to representatives. As an example of this, Rousseau gives ancient Rome with a monarch and the three lawfully convined assemplies known as comitia. Through these assemblies all citizens were represented; however, the emperor had much power in all. As for the discussion and voting in assemblies, people should vote not according to their personal interests but according to the general will. If the executive (government) goes against the general will, it breaks the social contract and should be dissolved. Rousseau furthers this idea and suggests that the sovereign, like those in Rome, should legislate clear times for assemblies to be held which cannot be posponed by the leader(s) of the state. This safeguards the people from a government that is acting not for the general will, but for its own, corporate will by trying to extend beyond its constitutional power and act only in the interests of the administrations longevity.Rousseau adds a caveat: in times that require a swiftness which a bureaucracy cannot attain, it is important to act quickly and in one of two ways: appoint one or two magistrates to act as the government, or place one man above the law--a dictator. Both are only temporary solutions and as soon as the danger that catalyzed the change in government abates, the officials must abdicate their position. This is in keeping with the general will because the safety of the state is its foremost concern and the suspension of laws and due process is sometimes, albeit rarely, the only method to ensure this.Of ReligionRousseau breaks religion into two catagories: religion of the man, and religion of the citizen. Religion of the man requires only an inner belief in a supreme being, the religion of the citizen, however, requires dogmas, rituals, external forms of worship, and views other religions as alien and backward.Rousseau continues and adds that there is a curious, third form, that \\"one might call the religion of the priest.\\" (Rousseau, 1762) This form bestows upon men two rulers, two motherlands, and two legislators, thus, placing the citizens in a paradox. Due to the inherint contradiction between church and state in this form of religion Rousseau declares it to be fatal to social unity and therefore utterly useless. He considers the religion of the Lamas, the Japanese, and that of the Catholic Christianity to be such religions. Due to their inate flaw, he does not expound further on this form, but focuses only on the first two.The second form of religion is excellent for the state as it binds men to it via a divine being. Therefore, obeying the laws of the sovereign is, by proxy, obeying the laws of God. Similarily, dying for the state is, by proxy, viewed as dying for god, et cetera. In this case, the government is also the clergy (this is not the same as the clergy being the government). This form of religion does have its downsides though in that it decieves men and thereby makes them \\"credulous superstitous\\". Furthermore, this form of religion breeds intolerance and propagates bloodthirst because the citizens believe it a holy task to kill those that believe in other deities.The first form of religion is more or less inert. It does not place men at odds with one another, but it also does not unite.According to Rousseau, the dogmas of a \\"civil religion\\" must be simple and small in number. He gives as examples of positive dogmas: \\"the existance of an omnipotent, intelligent, benevolent being that provides and forsees; the life to come; the happiness of the just; the punishment of sinners; the sanctity of the social contract and the law;\\" et cetera. The only negative dogma Rousseau allows is for no intolerance. \\"Intolerance is something which belongs to the religions we have rejected.\\"The most important idea stemming from this chapter is the seperation of church and state. According to Rousseau, when the church becomes the government, the sovereign are no longer sovereign. Intolerance leads directly to this consequence. Due to this, there must be no national religion, but rather all should be embraced. The only exception to this is a religious dogma that forces people to be bad citizens--this must not be tolerated.Interestingly, although Rousseau proves slavery unjust, he also posits that it maybe the only way for a society to be free. In otherwords in order to be free yourself, you must enslave another lest you both be slaves to someone else."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"Rousseau's ideas are well known.

This text, at least in translation, is hardly lively or personal. It is more of a political theorist's attempt to break things down for its target audience (the one its ideas are cocnerned with) - the people. Some of Rousseau's beleifs regarding personal freedoms are rather cynical, and considering that he is writing a revolutionary free-thinking text, he seems to objectify his own theories more than is warranted while dismissing other possibilities. Still, Rousseau's vision of social will compromising personal freedoms in the name of social progress is nothing if not untuitively appealing. Some of his musings regarding socioeconomic factors and political attitudes are understandably cockamaney considering the lack of resources for sociological research druing his time. His discussion of liberty with regard to indirect representation is a critical one and should be read by all lovers of freedom - even &quot;freedom in chains.&quot;"},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"I'm still not entirely certain how to take Rousseau.

Rousseau's ideal reminds me of a perfect democracy in that he wants all involved and the body of the people make an irrevocable law. However, one of my big problems with a perfect democracy is almost the same problem dealt with in our republic (and here I mean our notion of a republic, not Rousseau's definition of any legal framework ruled by the people)-- that is the vast amount of laws and the girth thereof make them unwieldy. Show me a congress member that actually reads the hundreds of thousands of pages that cross his desk each day; Much less equipped is the average person who would have to deal with this as well as their daily toil.I make this point again and again. We don't need more laws, we need less laws and a more easily understood framework. There does not need to exist a sentence for every possible situation in existence. Besides being impossible, it is impractical. How even do you communicate all these laws to the laity? You can almost hear the clich&eacute; refrain now being touted: Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Except, as they saw in law school, when it is. Yet still the average member feels the frenetic need to be \\"doing,\\" and thus our framework sprawls like malignant cancer.Be that as it may, here are some of the points and quotes I found interesting and my thoughts around then where applicable.\\"Tranquillity is found also in dungeons; but is that enough to make them desirable places to live in?\\"He says examine the people first and that if they are inappropriate don't try to change them.\\"The people of England regards itself as free; but it is grossly mistaken; it is free only during the election of members of parliament. As soon as they are elected, slavery overtakes it, and it is nothing. The use it makes of the short moments of liberty it enjoys shows indeed that it deserves to lose them.\\" The same could be said of these United States.'\\"In a well-ordered city every man flies to the assemblies: under a bad government no one cares to stir a step to get to them, because no one is interested in what happens there, because it is foreseen that the general will will not prevail, and lastly because domestic cares are all-absorbing.\\"He had a few chapters where it argued that different people need different government because their differences in diet, consumption, and climate. It seemed ridiculously immature given today's global economy.He talks a lot about all of the people being involved and that they cannot be wrong and that they have no will. However, what about the tyranny of the majority? What about the preservation of rights of those that are under represented?On the joys of being stupid: \\"Men who are upright and simple are difficult to deceive because of their simplicity; lures and ingenious pretexts fail to impose upon them, and they are not even subtle enough to be dupes.\\"On religion: \\"Every religion, therefore, being attached solely to the laws of the State which prescribed it, there was no way of converting a people except by enslaving it, and there could be no missionaries save conquerors.\\"Overall, a recommended read for all."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"Anyone wishing to study political philosophy should read this for sure.

It is my understanding many of the Founding Fathers of the United States had read the book and this work certainly had a major influence on French thought, therefore on the French Revolution. French society suffered many wrongs because of religious intolerance and it had a major effect on the author's thoughts. In my Faith, in my thoughts those who do not accept Jesus Christ as their Savior are damned to Hell. I believe there is one true Universal church. A church not made bricks and mortar, but of souls. While this definition of church does include a denomination, the theology is in disagreement with what Rousseau believed to be of a benefit to social cohesiveness. He be believed people should only have positive dogmas which did include earthly punishment for sin, that people should seek to do God's will; God has a watchful eye over people and government. The author certainly had a problem with one believing that God damns those of other Christian constructs. He wanted to outlaw or redefine the Catholic Faith and Protestantism to fit into his idea of social cohesiveness. His idea of religious tolerance gets a more sympathetic ear today then when written.Rousseau contributed to the thoughts of man. That man gives up certain rights in a civil society. That only through government does anyone truly has his rights protected. That it is only through some sort of social agreement that ones civil rights and property rights are protected. My physical security is no longer just dependent on me. It is through the organization of men I can own, I can do without fear that another will deny simply because of my absence or more might.Partiality and equality. Equality is not to have a right beyond that of another individual Partiality is to have more rights then another individual because who your Father is, wealth, friendship with the Prince, or any other reason. Rousseau did not dismiss partiality from society, but he did ask it only be set up through the general will of the people. He therefore argued that people should associate together for the purpose of forming a political argument. He wanted each person to come to conclusions based on the strength of argument. How debate could not be obtained without alliance and organization of debate is not dealt with. Freedom of association is not dealt with in the book.The General Will is determined by the majority. Rousseau recognizes the particular will of the individual is often in disagreement with the general will. Compromise is needed and an individual is generally better off because of government action then if no action were taken. The author decries sectionalism ( beliefs or ideas that grow out of living in a different geographic area and beliefs coming forth from other associations). He does not have an idea how this can be eliminated.The author speaks on many topics on the determination what is the best form of government. The author makes a distinction between the prince as the one who enforces the law and the lawmaker. Rousseau discusses how population, climate, geographic landscape, beliefs of the public and education effect the form of government and the ability to be governed. This book I believe made a major contribution on how we think about government and society."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"I picked up a copy of this book in a shop in Hong Kong with high expectations. I had heard of it but had not yet read it and was rather shocked to find an english language copy in a place like Hong Kong.

This is a must-read for any lover of deep thought and classic literature."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"This is a valuable historical document, because it shows us the thinking that led up to the French Revolution. Rousseau wrote: \\"Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.\\" What Rousseau means by this is that Man is born free in the State of Nature - it is society, government, and urban life that are the corruptive forces. Without those things, Rousseau argues, man would exist in peaceful co-habitation. What is striking to the modern reader about this claim is how blatantly wrong it is. Rousseau was trying to refute Thomas Hobbes who wrote that the State of Nature is the same as the State of War. Apparently Hobbes got the better of the argument because, as soon as the French Revolution took effect, peaceful liberty went out the window in favor of the Reign of Terror.But, back to Rousseau. He claims that, even though men in nature peacefully co-exist, it is more beneficial for them to come together to form a society. Thus they SHOULD come together and form a Social Contract. The ideal contract for Rousseau would entail the individual GIVING UP ALL HIS RIGHTS on entering the contract with the understanding that he will get them all back from the Sovereign. Who is the Sovereign? Well, for Rousseau, the Sovereign is the People. If Rousseau's Ideal State were an organism, it would be a large one-celled organism with no differentiation. This is very much unlike Hobbes' Leviathan, with the Sovereign at the head and each part assigned its individual task. For Rousseau, only the SOCIETY AS A WHOLE has the right to govern.Of course, this system is incredibly unwieldy, that is why - in Rousseau's world - there are a whole bunch of little city-states, like ancient Athens. HERE COMES THE SCARY PART. Once the whole population gets together and makes a decision, that decision is infallible. \\"THE GENERAL WILL CANNOT BE WRONG.\\" Those minorities who are disaffected by this general rule shall be \\"FORCED TO BE FREE.\\" In the case of the French Revolution, that was the freedom of one's head from one's shoulders.According to Simon Schama in his wonderful book, Citizens, the importance of the Social Contract has been overestimated. Rousseau's love of the State of Nature (which was the spirit of the French Revolution) had more of an effect on the public through his novels Emile and La Nouvelle Heloise.The Social Contract must be viewed in its historical context as a piece of history in itself. If one reads it for philosophic reasons only, it will come of sounding either frightening or painfully nave. One sentence caught my imagination however - Rousseau saw the island of Corsica as the perfect candidate for his ideal state. \\"I have a presentiment that this little island will one day astonish Europe.\\" It did. It produced the greatest warlord the world had ever seen - Napoleon."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual.His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking. In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the \\"noble\\" savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization. He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original, yet ignorant state. I found the Discourses to be a little flighty and unrealistic. The Social Contract was a different story altogether. This is a monumental work. In it Rousseau shows his vast knowledge of the Roman Republic and Empire and the reasons for it's rise and collapse. Rousseau also denounces monarchy and aristocracy as forms of government and exalts republicanism. He also decries the power of organized religion in the oppression of mankind. With his \\"General Will\\" theory of the social contract he shows true brilliance. A great buy."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"\\"The Social Contract\\" is an important read that marks a crossroads in Enlightenment thought. This crossroads has made significant differences in the past 300 years in political history.The crossroads specifically begins, to me, with philosophers John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. I, for one, am a Lockean. The influence of Locke is best observed in the USA's Constitution and emphasis on the \\"Rule of Law\\" (though this has waned over time due to the popularity of Rousseau-like ideologies). Locke, considering his reasoning was perhaps not sexy or exciting enough, was the philosophy road less traveled. His view was summarily that man was an individual who had rights to liberty and property. Governments were formed among men to protect individual liberty and property through means of negative rights.Rousseau, to me, is Locke's polar opposite. His view is \\"Rule of the People.\\" The descendants of his philosophy can be seen as early as the French Revolution that led to the Reign of Terror. Robespierre was an avid follower of Rousseau. Rousseau's ideas can be greatly seen in Socialist and Communist philosophy as well.One should definitely find the time to read Locke. In regards to \\"The Social Contract\\", Rousseau has moments of contradiction and obscurity. He writes that \\"man must be forced to be free.\\" A paradox that sums up Rousseau.Rousseau believed that man is selfish without the State. With the State, man goes from being an animal to truly being a man. Through the State, man acquires moral liberty. The State is master of all goods. Every man has a right to everything he needs. A man must occupy only the amount he needs for subsistence. A man's estate is always subordinate to the community. These are the only ways to make man equal.The State is progressed by the General Will. The General Will tends to equality and public advantage. The General Will is always right. The People can never be corrupted. The State must have a Universal and Compelling force. The Social Compact gives absolute power over all of its members. Every citizen should render his services to the State when those services are demanded. Life is to be devoted to the State.If a Prince of the State says, \\"It is expedient for the State that you should die\\", he ought to die, since the State has provided security up to this point. The people will always do good, but at times should be enlightened. Each citizen should resort to nothingness so that he cannot do without the rest. There will be equality in morals and talents. In times of attack upon the State, a dictatorship will be instituted silencing all laws for a moment.There are brief moments of Lockean ideas in \\"The Social Contract\\", but are so flittering that there is no point in elaborating upon them. Rousseau contradicts himself within the next paragraph which renders those Lockean ideas moot.The most dangerous and most significant of Rousseau's ideas is found in the last chapter, \\"Civil Religion.\\" It is here that one can trace the Salvation of Mankind theories seen in Communism, Socialism, Black Liberation Theology, etc. There is to be a civil profession of faith established. Man can be banished from society as an anti-social being, through death if needed, if he behaves as if he does not believe the profession of faith. It is impossible to live at peace with these who are regarded as damned and they must be reclaimed or tormented. The Church can only offer Salvation if the Church is the State.We can see where Civil Religion has led to the massacres of millions in the 20th Century. I won't lay blame completely upon Rousseau for these tragedies, but for one to speak of murder and torment of his fellow man so easily, he indeed has blood on his hands."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"Rousseau's treatise on the nature of people and their government has left a lasting imprint on political discourse. Though at times passionate and persuasive, most of the short book was simply too vague for Rousseau's semantic games to be indisputable, and sometimes even comprehensible. Some of his ideas are simply wrong, such as the &quot;noble savage&quot;, while others quite clearly debatable, such as the social contract itself. I, for one, would fear to live in Rousseau's ideal world, where every right I have is only mine so long as the majority (who never can be wrong) wills it.Whether you agree with him or not, plowing through Rousseau's 150 pages is a necessity for anyone who wants to carry on high-level political discourse."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"The issues of liberty and democracy, monarchy and legitimacy, are never better explained that in The Social Contract by Rousseau. Rousseau explains every thought on to the page, from the most abstract thoughts of the ideal society to every day issues of Lobbying (which he finds a major detriment to society) and Suffrage (which Rousseau demands of society). The book is wonderfully written, every word is deliberate (I must pay my respect for the translator on such a splendid job) and shows how important understanding language is in order to understand the great ideas that are discussed by language. Liberals will see this book as a beautiful light of democracy, conservatives might see this book as proof of authoritarian beliefs. The truth is that both can be read in the book. Because the book not only conveys to the reader what Rousseau thinks, it inspires the reader to think for him or her self."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"I am a huge fan of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, and was hoping to appreciate this book just as much. There is a telling irony in that in the former text, Rousseau sees civilization as incapable of being repaired, and the source of most of the problems of inequality through wealth and politics. Private property is an overall pariah to him, which ought not to exist.As Rousseau got older he seems to have changed his mind a bit, and tempered that anarcho-primitvism. In the Social Contract we see Rousseau setting himself the task, he would have once found impossible: developing a legitimate state, in the interest of the sovereign, that constantly develops towards equality, and not away from it. Unfortunately we are given zero insight into how the old ideology of the corrupt states, and rotten civilization are to be overcome at the moment of developing this grandiose social contract; this is a serious problem of praxis, probably not fully taken up until Gramsci.Now it is worth pointing that Rousseau's contract is significantly more radical, or left-wing, than anything Locke, Hegel, or Hobbes proposed. Rousseau does see excess property as a problem (unlike Hegel), and unlike Locke, Rousseau does see the origin of property as corrupting, and not beneficial. Moreover, Rousseau categorically rejects the idea of slavery, and a wage slave. Locke doesn't touch upon the former, and in a single line in his entire Treatise, says a wage slave is A-OK. Given the overall momentum of the Treatise, it's a perplexing passage. Rousseau asserts that labor ought to create products for itself and some excess for the community (so long as the community is doing the same), but not for private owners to capitalize on.Rousseau believes government ought to work for the general will of the sovereign, and the sovereign ought only to meet and conduct legislative that serves the interest of the general will. The general will is to be distinguished from the particular will, and an example of healthcare should suffice. It is the general will that each of us ought to have health coverage, i.e., because each of us desires particularly and also generally, and our desires ought to be towards equality. The particular will would desire health care, and if it comes at a cost to the general population, it ceases to be a product for and by the general will. I.e., I start a health care corporation so I get free benefits, and my family gets free benefits, but all my customers pay excess in premiums and co pays. This is the very the system that we have come to live in, where we are \\"free\\" to \\"purchase\\" in the \\"free market.\\" Rousseau would roll in his grave and point out the lunacy of atomizing society into particular wills in competition with one another, as a true travesty, acting against the general will.Although all these points are correct, or at least I appreciate most of them, the book still deserves 3 stars for a few reasons. There is certainly a tyrannical streak in Rousseau, of supporting the death penalty, and demanding people be \\"free\\" by \\"force\\" and \\"execution.\\" Moreover, Rousseau, like most social contract theorist, fails to consider the consequences of a minority who at first accepts the direction of the government, even if it votes against him constantly, to at a future date, resign his participation from a government he can no longer identify with; due to gradual change. Socrates made the same absurd point in I believe the Crito.Also Rousseau at times is extremely contradictory, on one page arguing against tyranny, on another vesting individuals with tyrannical amounts of power; or demanding we are all free on one page, and on another that we are enslaved (at the same time). His notions of democracy are not properly fleshed out, and he believes one single law giver ought to bestow the contract in the communities' interest. While at the same time believing no human is capable of developing a lasting constitution. He implores us on one page to generate a government of everlasting and perennial general will; while on another saying no government whatsoever can avoid receding into tyranny and despotism.His logic is frequently atrocious, and entirely emotional. This isn't inherently bad, emotion has its place in guiding reason, but do not present logical formulas as logical, when they are in fact entirely emotional. Be candid. Also, there's a constant reliance on appealing to authority -Grotius- as whatever he says must be true, when Rousseau decides to appeal to him.Still, if one finds themselves reading Locke, Hegel, and Hobbes, or Rand and Hayak, maybe even Novack, they ought to temper themselves with a good dosage of Rousseau."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"When the Social Contract was published in 1762, Rousseau became a wanted man in France and Switzerland, but in 1794 after the French revolution, his remains were buried in Paris as an international hero.In 1814, religious fundamentalists stole the remains of Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and dumped them in a pit full of quicklime, a cruel burial reserved for individuals condemned by the church.In the Social Contract, Rousseau postulates that a legitimate political authority in a civil society comes only from a social contract intended for their mutual preservation and agreed upon by all citizens (the sovereign). The sovereign that expresses the general will that aims at the common good has absolute authority over public matters. The state that is protecting citizens should follow laws of equality and liberty that are interestingly created by non-citizen lawgiver, and the state should also have a government to exercise executive power and daily business.The social contract might sound very basic, utopia like and naive to many readers but considering the political nature of that time and the topics debated such as liberty, free will, and the state of nature, this work is absolutely a rebellious scream, which was much needed at the time.Rousseau dreamed of a civil society, but given alone the way his remains were treated in 1814, it seems unlikely a civil society will ever exist. However, if we are not free in any way (or as Rousseau puts it: Man is born free, but he is everywhere in chains), we are still free to dream. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a free spirit who dared to dream, though imperfectly, had the courage to speak up; and for that alone his dream should be praised."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"Deeply influential book, &quot;The Social Contract&quot; is a &quot;must read&quot; for anybody interested in the history of political ideas, or even in history. It had a big influence on the French Revolution, and in many movements after it that considered that the individual owes everything to the state.After reading this book you will be astounded by the insight that Rousseau (1712-1778) showed. He explains us, among other things, the reason for the formation of political society, and the origin of the social contract.I believe this is a good book to start a study on political ideas. It is simple and well written, it has had an important political impact and can make you curious enough to know more. If you are interested, read also a book about the history of political ideas (for example the one written by George Sabine), because it can guide you to other interesting books, and can give you a deeper insight into the ideas, circumstances and life of Rousseau."},{"Title":"The social contract (Books I-II)","review":"Rousseau is one of the most influential of all social thinkers. He is generally considered to be a major influence in creating the climate of opinion that brought about the French Revolution.The myth of a primal virtous state of human nature which is increasingly corrupted by human civilization is presented in his work on \\"Second Discourse in Equality\\". Here he develops the mythic idea of a human social contract in which individuals sacrifice certain liberties to come together and form one unified General Will.A scatching critique of his ideas is presented in an article from \\"The Catholic Encyclopedia\\".\\"It is quite intelligible that the Contrat Social should have come to be considered by some as the gospel of freedom and democracy, by others as the code of revolution and anarchy. That it contains serious contradictions is undeniable. For instance, Rousseau assigns as the essential basis of the general will the unanimous consent of the people, yet he assumes that this general will is expressed in the plurality of suffrages; he affirms that parents have no right to engage their children by a contract, and yet children from their birth will be subject to the primitive contract; he affirms that a man has no right to alienate himself, yet he bases the social contract essentially on the total alienation of personal rights and personality in favour of the community. If there are some true considerations and reflections in this book--as, for instance, on slavery and the dignity of man, on the adaptation of the divers forms of government to the character of the people, etc.--its fundamental principles--the origin of society, absolute freedom and absolute equality of all--are false and unnatural.\\""},{"Title":"Global Intelligence: The World's Secret Services Today (Global Issues)","review":"This book is basically an alphabet soup breakdown of the intelligence agencies around the world, with more emphasis on some of the more important ones, and actually a reasonably lengthy explanation and breakdown about what has gone on in South Africa, at least organisationally.Need the name for Lebanon?

Those who think of a cognitive system as also being one that is conscious will find the author's contention perhaps even more radical. However, the author's notion of a cognitive system is not as elaborate, and such systems are very prevalent in manufacturing and control systems, telecommunication networks, and military systems.The book is targeted toward a wide readership, and therefore the author omits detailed scientific jargon and also omits many references. Readers (such as this reviewer) who are not experts in immunology though can still gain a lot of insight into the workings of the human immune system, and the book could be read as an introduction to this important field. In fact, a non-expert in immunology might gain much more from the book than an expert, for the former has not been biased by the \\"classical\\" clonal selection theory of the immune system, and will therefore be more open to the prospect of a different paradigm. The physicist/mathematician reader will find an interesting use by the author of chaotic dynamical systems and its notion of an attractor. The use of these concepts goes along with the author's notion of evolution and adaptation, which he describes as a radical departure from the standard view. Adaptation, in his view, is defined as an attractor, and is not correlated with improvement of the organism. Evolution does not involve the \`improvement of DNA' but rather is the \`creation and occupation of attractors.'The main virtue of this book is the author's careful elucidation of the notion of a cognitive system. This is necessary in his view in order to distinguish such a system from one that might qualify as being cognitive, but one would not want to view as being cognitive. As evidence of the latter, he gives the example of the production of urine by the kidneys. Such a system he says exhibits complexity, precision, and regulation that rivals many nervous systems, but one that should not qualify as being cognitive. A cognitive system he argues is able to make decisions, is able to form images of their environments, and is able to learn from experience. This learning ability involves the updating of their internal structures and images, which the author refers to as \`self-organization.' Hence \`choice,' \`internal images,' and \`self-organization' allows the cognitive system, and therefore the organism that possesses it, to interact with the world that will give it distinct advantages over what can be obtained from evolutionary genetics.So what is the nature of the \`images' of the environment encoded by the immune system? They are merely proteins, some of which are distributed throughout the body and form geometrical shapes as well as \`abstract, functional' ones. These images are also of two types, the \`innate' images, which are inherited, and \`acquired' images, which arise from the cognitive process. Autoimmune diseases, the author argues, involve an image dysfunction in the immune system.A cognitive view of the immune system the author thinks is necessary because of the need for immune receptors to have the ability for specific recognition. However, they are degenerate, \`pleiotropic', redundant, and random observes the author, and this means that cognition (as he defines it) is necessary in order that the immune system generate specificity out of the non-specificity of its components. The author outlines in detail how to construct immune cognition, this involving the \`geometry' of cognition, the \`dynamics' of cognition, and the \`images' or \`patterns' of cognition.In terms of its ability to engage in cognitive decision-making, the immune system reacts to a pattern of signals that it receives by selecting a particular type of response pattern from its collection of available responses. An \`immune language' that combines germ-line and somatic \`chemical words' is used to make the decisions. These choices, the author emphasizes, are not the result of any \`self-reflective consciousness' or \`mystical free will' but in fact are deterministic. Choices in the immune system can occur because it can exercise options and because it can learn. From a chemical perspective, the decision-making in the immune system involves associating somatic perceptions of objects with classes of effector responses in the germ-line.These views of immune system decision-making are fascinating, and will certainly invoke strong reactions from the philosophical community. Indeed, what is normally thought of as capabilities only found in a \`mind,' namely that of abstraction, semantics, and context, these can also be found in the human immune system. It communicates via molecular interactions; its antigens and cytokines express semantic attributes since they can confirm ligands and their receptors and can arrange the signal molecules in patterns; and can patterns of signals can create a signal context.The immune system can be defective, this resulting among other things in the deadly autoimmune diseases. The author discusses this unfortunate circumstance in detail in the book, but he is also willing to contemplate deliberate intervention into the workings of the immune system in order to circumvent any problems with it. In the last paragraph of the book, noting that \\"two cognitive systems are better than one,\\" the author advocates the deliberate engineering of the immune system, i.e. that of turning \\"on or off the immune response as we see fit.\\" Along with genetic engineering, metabolic engineering, and other endeavors of twenty-first century technology, such a prospect is awesome."},{"Title":"Tending Adam's Garden : Evolving the Cognitive Immune Self","review":"Cohen's book is the first book I've read about immunology that baldly goes where no book has gone before.

Keep goin Cohen!"},{"Title":"Tending Adam's Garden : Evolving the Cognitive Immune Self","review":"First, a 'proper disclosure' is in place; I should say that the author and I are not acquainted. This is quite surprising since we are both Israelis, and our fields of research are adjacent. However it is not surprising that we share a similar approach to the notion of 'meaning'. The use of meaning in Biblical Hebrew differs from meaning in Western Tradition; it is a change that an agent makes in the actual world and not just a process that takes place in the representation of the world in the agent's inner 'mind'. As the author, Henry Atlan, and others have pointed out in their scientific papers, both in my 'turf' - culture dynamics - and his - the human immune system - the question of how meaning is generated, passed on (in time) and distributed (conveyed between agents) is crucial. It is not surprising therefore, that Biblical meaning sprang to both our minds.Another 'proper disclosure' is that even so I am biased in favor of the book, because it does save me a lot of time and work. Had professor Cohen not written the first hundred pages, containing a general description of the position of our current know-how about Complex Adaptive Systems - CAS - in the perspective of the reduction, driven by the functional approach to meaning (rather than considering meaning a property of the substance that its denotation points to, as usually is the case) I would have probably had to write something to the same effect myself.Let me illustrate this point (summed-up on page 99) by making use of Cohen's book as an object. The fact that the book is meaningful is not just something I think, it has also grown a small 'lawn' of markers and had sojourned to the side of the Complexity Science book shelf nearest to my desk; I also occasionally find out that pieces of text in my own writings are actually conversations with it.Another point of self organization worth noticing is its neighboring books. It seems that in the time-vicinity of an expansion in the capabilities of CAS science, there comes out a book to prepare the hearts and minds of people for it. These are the books, which tend to cluster inadvertently at the side nearer to my desk, since one tends to remember what they said and therefore returns to them for reference.The fact that I find these books meaningful is therefore, not just a set of forms in my mind; these drive decisions that result in self organization happening in the shape of the real world (the geometry of my study, in this case) and in time, i.e. a certain pattern of narrative is realized each time CAS science is poised and ready to expand.Although I am an expert on city/culture dynamics and a neophyte of/to the human immune system, I find the second part of the book - 150 pages - which deals with the way functional meaning establishes our understanding of the human immune system to play a greater role in my own work.The point that this part drives home is that in the context of a Complex Adaptive System, to be useful, a model cannot possibly be applicable to too broad a spectrum of relevant phenomena. Cohen challenges in the second part a conventional wisdom of scientific tradition, which has served us well for the last couple of centuries.Contrary to the well established 'corporate culture' of science which strives always for a model to be as concise as possible and encompass in its range of relevance as wide a chunk of nature as possible, in CAS based research, one can miss by being excessively universal, thus rendering a model of the mark by being too far removed (resolution wise) from the real world subject system.Cohen elaborates this proposition not by discussing theory but the way a Bedouin fixes his pickup truck, i.e. by disassembling it (the 'cognitive' model of the immune system, in our case) to the level of cogs, shafts and sprocket wheels and then putting it together again.I would like to further his course of thought by suggesting that like the rift between idea and action that exists in our mind and discussed above, the ubiquitous great-divide between theoreticians and experimentalists in the actual practice of science does not serve us well in the advancement of CAS-based research.By going into the specifics of his 'cognitive' model, Cohen has demonstrated that a CAS scientist should not be, as our 'corporate culture' ordains: either one or the other, but work like a master luthier, who envisages the sound of the violin and then proceeds to the minute details of its construction, back and forth, adjusting both ends - the imaginary concept of the instrument's future sound and the details of its construction - as the real world violin-sound takes on a form. It is in the interplay between the general outlook and the indispensable hands-on experience that new insights appear. Therefore, although as a neophyte some of the details of the model may have been lost on me, it is still at the nuts and bolts level, that I as a scientist could look, learn and hopefully follow the example."},{"Title":"Tending Adam's Garden : Evolving the Cognitive Immune Self","review":"Cohen's book is the first book I've read about immunology that baldly goes where no book has gone before.

Goodis is reputed to be an acquired taste-not necessarily for everyone but if you like him chances are you'll like him alot-so far so good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Burglar (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)","review":"The Burglar - first published in 1953 - is a very tightly wound crime story. Just shy of 160 pages, it's a very quick read. I first read it maybe 12 years ago, and it definitely stayed with me. It may be short, but the characters are vivid and the action is suspenseful.The main character is a professional burglar named Nat Harbin who runs a 4-person burglary crew. There are two other men in his crew, Baylock and Dohmer; the other key member is a young girl named Gladden. Gladden is the daughter of the thief under whom Nat apprenticed, and since his death Nat has been her caretaker. Nat's loyalty to Gladden and to her dead father is the linchpin around which the story revolves. At the beginning of the book Nat's team has completed a very successful jewel heist, but things go downhill from there. The crew is starting to come apart, and they're being hunted by a psychopath who wants the loot from the jewel heist at any and all costs.David Goodis is one hell of a writer. In addition to this book, he also wrote Dark Passage and Shoot the Piano Player. He was educated at Temple University in Philly, wrote for the pulp mags most of his life, and died of cirrhosis at the age of 50. I would have to agree with a previous reviewer - Goodis and Jim Thompson share a similar literary sensibility. Their protagonists are desperate, usually doomed, and exist in worlds of broken promises and shifting loyalties. If you're a Jim Thompson fan, give David Goodis a try. If you read this and like it, I would also recommend Black Friday and Street of No Return."},{"Title":"The Burglar (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)","review":"I tracked this down after reading George Pelecanos describe it as his favorite crime novel.

The loneliness of a Philadelphia suburb, an eastern highway with flooding rain, and the crowded emptiness of an Atlantic City boardwalk stay with a reader for a long time.

Written in 1953 when Goodis had left Hollywood and moved back to his native Philadelphia, \\"The Burglar\\" was published only in an inexpensive paperback edition. It was the sort of book sold in bus stations or at newstands for a short, entertaining read. Like some other art, Goodis' books were not written or sold with the expectation that they would one day be found of long term value. In 1957, a movie version of \\"The Burglar\\" was released directed by Paul Wendklos with stars including Dan Duryea and Jane Mansfield.Goodis' novel is set in Philadelphia and Atlantic City in the late 1940's. For a short book, \\"The Burglar\\" includes a considerable number of well-developed characters and addresses several important themes in addition to the robberies and murders of a crime story.The primary character, Nat Harbin, 33, is the leader of a group of four robbers who live together in an old house in a shabby area of Philadelphia. Harbin's confederates are two slightly older men, Baylock and Dohmer, and a young woman in her early 20s, Gladden, whose relationship with Harbin is developed in the course of the book. As the book opens, Goodis' gang of four meticulously pulls off a heist of $100,000 in emeralds from a safe in a wealthy Philadelphia home. Tensions break out among the four members, and the loyalty and cohesiveness of the group is severely tested. A major source of the tension involves Harbin, who falls heavily for a wealthy woman named Della whom he meets, apparently by chance in a cheap restaurant. Della invites Harbin to live with her in an idyllic home in rural Pennsylvania. The group appears to be about to dissolve.The search for love, and its elusive character, is a major theme of \\"The Burglars\\" as Goodis creates a poignant, surprisingly thoughtful love story. The major theme of the book, however, is loyalty. Although I doubt that Goodis was aware of the connection, the emphasis on loyalty in \\"The Burglars\\" reminded me of the American philosopher Josiah Royce who put the virtue of loyalty at the heart of ethics. When Harbin's parents died during his adolescence, he was taken in by a thief named Gerald Gladden who treated him kindly and taught him the trade. When Gladden died in a robbery, Harbin took responsibility for the care of his young daughter, then six, whom he called simply \\"Gladden\\". Gerald instilled in Harbin the value of loyalty in addition to the tools of theft. Here is how Goodis describes Gerald's teachings to young Harbin:\\"This big thing, Gerald would say, this thing of being honorable, was the only thing, and actually, if a human being didn't have it, there wasn't much point in going on living. As matters stood, life offered very little aside from an occasional plunge into luxurious sensation, which never lasted for long and even while it happened was accompanied by the dismal knowledge that it would soon be over. In the winter Gerald had a mania for oyster stew, and always while he ate the stew he would complain the plate would soon be empty and his stomach would be too full for him to enjoy another plate. All these things like oyster stew and clean underwear and fresh cigarettes were temporary things, little passing touches of pleasure, limited things, unimportant things. What mattered, what mattered high up there by itself all alone, Gerald would say, was whether things are honorable.\\"In Goddis' novel, Harbin has to examine both his personal relationship to Gladden and his relationship to his fellow thieves and assess them in light of his passion for Della. These themes are developed in the context of a noir story which includes as well passages of acute description of run-down Atlantic city hotels, furious storms, and poor Philadelphia bars and restaurants.\\"The Burglars\\" is a thoughtful, difficult novel in the unprepossessing guise of a throwaway paperback. I am looking forward to reading the remaining two Goodis novels in the LOA volume.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Battle for Rome","review":"It is painfully evident that the other two reviews which appear under this heading actually refer to some book by someone else that has absolutely nothing to do with the book at hand.

I own about six different retriever training books and this is by far the best. BTW if you plan on training anything other than a labrador retriever you may be put off by his obvious prejudice for this breed."},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager in the late 1960s. Now I am giving it to my father in-law as a Father's Day gift.One of the other reviewers said that this was an outdated book about training a field trials dog. I don't know how dogs have been updated in recent years, but I do know that field trials are the graduate schools of dog training. It is true that this isn't the book for you if you have a wild or stupid dog. Mr. Free believed that some dogs just were not worth trying to train. You give the bad dog to someone who would love it and care for it (did this happen to you?); then you get a dog with potential.That said, this is the finest animal training book I have ever read. Don't get lost in the field trials stuff; try to concentrate on Mr. Free's principles. I think you could train anything based on Mr. Free principles. Oh, and most importantly - it's a good read."},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","review":"If you're even just thinking about owning a retreiver, you need to read this book--and more importantly follow the author's advice. My father and I have trained several labrador retrievers over 30 years in accordance with Mr. Free's philosophy; it works.The book reads well; is not overly complicated in scope--and provides practical strategies and &quot;fixes&quot; for most dog problems. Although oriented primarily to training big water dogs, it's also an excellent reference for training dogs of any breed.You'll probably want to keep this book on your nightstand through your dog's formative years-- and refer to it often."},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","review":"Originally published in the early 1950's, this book was republished several times as evidence of its valuable content. James Free definitely has strong opinions...he may offend some of the more &quot;90's thinkers&quot;; however, his basis is sound. I would recommended anyone contemplating purchasing a retriever to read this book PRIOR to making their decision. I personally have purchased three copies of this book. The first copy was an early edition passed down through the generations and was lost in a move. The second copy was purchased for lab I had who liked the it so much, she ate it in her attempts to digest all the information she could. The third copy is on its way. Typical quotes include references like: &quot;the only thing worse than a bargin dog is a gift dog.&quot; Free acknowledges that all puppies are cute, but recommends dogs properly bred for their hunting and sporting ability -- not cuteness. He's is not a strong supporter of dogs bred strictly for show but has an insurmountable respect for the working dog."},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","review":"Throw away all those other training books!

You wont need to buy any other book or tape."},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","review":"Training Your Retriever is a fantastic book, if it's measured in terms of tried-and-true methods of training a working retriever. If you do what this book tells you to do, you will end up with a hard-charging, field-ready dog whose manners are impeccable.That said, this book was written a long time ago and times have changed, so I want to make clear, without being insulting or judgmental, that this book is not suitable for everyone. If you think of your pets as your children, talk to them in baby talk, or chat with them continuously as though they are holding up their end of the conversation, you probably will not like this book.There is no doubt that Mr. Free loves his dogs, but never for a moment does he lose sight of the fact that they are animals, not people, and they are bred and trained for a purpose. It is true that his methods of discipline might sound harsh today, but the book really isn't about beating a dog into submission. He does discuss corporal punishment, but the book and the training methods don't revolve around it. It is one tool for correcting improper behavior, and he discusses how it can be done without doing harm to a valuable animal.There is a great deal more to this book than punishment. But if you think those passages might be more than you can bear, I suggest something by Bill Tarrant. Mr. Tarrant is much more modern in his approach and attitude and offers up insight and reasoning that is very creative and effective. Personally, I like reading both. If Free is coffee that's strong, hot, and black, Tarrant adds the cream and sugar."},{"Title":"TRAINING YOUR RETRIEVER","review":"My dad used this book when he started with Labs many many years ago.

She, who once was the wife of a prince, is now a slave of Neoptolemus, son of Achilles. The play really shows war's effect on women. It also shows the results of revenge: Achilles killed Hector, Orestes (son of Agamemnon) kills Neoptolemus, and Orestes' wife wants Andromache killed."},{"Title":"Andromache (PBK)","review":"\\"Andromache,\\" set in the aftermath of the Trojan War and focusing on the widow of Hector, is one of the weakest of the extant plays of Euripides. In truth, the work is better considered as anti-Spartan propaganda, written circa 426 B.C. near the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, although it present a tragedy. However, the scenes are much more episodic than we usually find in Euripides; the first part of the tragedy is essentially a supplicant play, but then it changes dramatically. The play has one of Euripides' strongest beginnings, with its strong attacks on Sparta, represented by Menelaus. But even as propaganda Euripides elevates his subject for what he sees is not merely a war between two cities, but rather a clash between two completely different ways of life.Once again, Euripides uses the Trojan War as a context for his political argument. Andromache, the widow of Hector, is the slave of Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, who is married to Hermione, the daughter of Menelaus and Helen. The setting is the Temple of Thetis, the mother of Achilles, somewhere between Pithia and Pharasalia in Thessaly. Andromache has born Neoptolemus a son, and the barren Hermione accuses the Trojan woman of having used witchcraft and seeks her death. Andromache has taken refuge as this temple where Hermione and Menelaus try to get her to come out by threatening to kill her son. However, the title character disappears from the play and everybody from Peleus, the father of Achilles, to Orestes, the cousin of Hermione, shows up, mainly to talk about Neoptolemus, who is at Delphi. Thetis shows up as the deus-ex-machina and the play ends rather abruptly.The interest in \\"Andromache\\" is clearly for the anti-Spartan propaganda. As a tragedy there is little her beyond a progression of characters who all talk about doing something they end up not doing. If there is supposed to be a series of object lessons offered by each of these characters, then that idea is pretty much lost on contemporary audiences. Jean Racine wrote his own version of the myth of Andromache, as did William Congreve, Gilbert Murray, and Gabriele D'Annunzio. Racine's play \\"Andromache\\" is certainly superior to that of Euripides, which is probably the only time you can say that about the French neo-classical playwright. \\"Andromache\\" is clearly the least of the extant plays of Euripides."},{"Title":"Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century","review":"His thesis hangs in mid-air, not fully articulated, but if you relax, it should wash over you. Well-written, flows nicely. Excellent job defining buzzwords/key concepts others don't bother to. I found his book to be the best on the topic I've found so far and invaluable in my own studies.However, he does get a bit redundant and didactic, keeps resorting to catch-all phrases to explain what people are trying to escape from, e.g. economic inequality, environmental pollution, yah-dah-yah-dah. I wish he had drilled down a bit here.Also, his groupings seems a bit forced, he seems to have dug himself a hole in his overall design. But it was probably a difficult project, so you have to forgive him that."},{"Title":"Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century","review":"\\"Escape velocity is the speed at which a body...overcomes the gravitational pull of another body,\\" begins Mark Dery in his non-fictional amalgamation of the current state of computer culture, Escape Velocity. Dery uses the concept as a metaphor for what is happening to the many memes--concept viruses--of the on-line and turned-on and their relation to the greater society (mainly American, although some service is given to Japan and Europe). Like the emergence of the Internet (and the 'net concept of on-line connectivity) into the mainstream, the ideas of body sculpting, merging with machines (either virtually or prosthetically), and transhuman growth, among others, are just below the cultural surface, according to Dery.To be a cultural historian to the fast-paced world of computers is a difficult one, because the cyberculture, far more so than any subculture before it, is as varied in its parts as it is separated geographically. It exists on change. In ways, the myriad differences in the cybercrowd is what makes it a culture rather than a cult--it encourages the free range of expression from left to right, and all the fringes top and bottom, and there is no single authority to consult. Mark Dery's job, therefore, was to piece together a picture of a living community that is less than 30 years old and is more malleable than one of his favorite images, that of the T-2000 liquid-metal android from the movie Terminator 2. He assembled this jigsaw by grabbing at the outward manifestations of the culture--its art--rather than focusing on the nuts and bolts of how it came and stays together. Dery's goal was to achieve a focus on where cybernauts and cyberpunks are headed, rather than where they have been. Within the cybernetic expressions in print, screen, music, body art, performance, and philosophy lie the seeds of a cultural revolution that began with the home computer, according to Dery.Any cultural representation requires a polymath to untangle the multitude of threads that bind it together. When that culture is the front end of the runaway train of technology, the examiner must also be moving at the speed of information. Dery, for the most part, rises to the challenge, able to quote both fiction writers and art critics, social commentators and \\"hackers\\" within the same page. His profiles of those on the fringe and those with the mainstream are balanced, except when he pauses to regroup his thinking at the end of each chapter and his own impressions slip in. One of the most rewarding aspects of Dery's compilation is that he went beyond the most visible proponents of cyberculture (William Gibson, Mark Pauline of the Survival Research Laboratories, Hans Moravec) to also get the equally important contributions that have not engendered cultish followings (in fiction, for example, Dery quotes the work of Pat Cadigan and John Shirley as well as that of Gibson and Bruce Sterling), as well as progenitors to the culture (again in fiction, the work of Philip K. Dick and J.G. Ballard).As a document of fact about what happened and is happening in the computer subculture, Escape Velocity is hard to fault. But Dery's goal was to portray where the culture is headed (in his eyes into the larger mainstream), and it is herein that trouble lies. To extract the future of society from this mismatch of ideas would be like portraying the future of cinema in the 1960s by examining both Easy Rider and La Dolce Vita. Yes, these movies had a profound effect on the cinematic culture at large, but it was subsumed into the larger whole. Dery quotes Gibson's oft-touted refrain, \\"The street finds its own uses for things.\\" Just so, the mainstream often finds its own uses for the street, as evidenced in the music business by the commercialization and marketing of punk, rap, and grunge, each a thriving subculture at one time.Escape Velocity is an intriguing volume, and Mark Dery is to be commended for attempting to achieve a cyberculture gestalt. For those interested in what is happening \\"in there,\\" Escape Velocity is a one-stop shop, a veritable sourcebook of cyberdom."},{"Title":"Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century","review":"I read this about 3+ years ago and I was just discussing it last night.

Escape Velocity presents real people doing wierd things with more esoteric aspects of our accelerted culture. A man who attached his computer to the nerves in his arm to invoke spasms of thrashing and flailing, all the while injuring himself in the process of making performance art is a whole other realm from Bill Gates' pedestrian spreadsheet programs.

He gets plenty of mention among those who are familiar with his work and his many contributions to the field of parapsychology. I highly recommend Rogo's work for the bookshelf."},{"Title":"The haunted universe: A psychic look at miracles, UFOs and mysteries of nature","review":"I picked up this book to read because I had recently learned that there is a journalist looking for clues in the murder of D. Scott Rogo and I suggested to her that there might be any clues as to who might have wanted him dead in his writings. Was he writing anything that might be considered threatening to any agency or organization? That was the question in my mind as I began to read.Rogo starts off telling us how conservative he is and how he has learned how the mind can deceive. Too bad he doesn't apply this principle to himself. But, I will come to that.Rogo writes that, \\"To date, parapsychologists have only been concerned with the study of two groups of phenomena: extrasensory perception and psychokinesis.\\"The whole field of UFOs is just churning with unbelievable psychic phenomena that includes apparitions, poltergeists, PK, ESP of various kinds including telepathy, clairaudience, clairvoyance, and so on. The UFO researcher who is not also well-versed in the field of parapsychology is actually only playing with half a deck. (See my own book:The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive)At the same time, there are many paranormal events associated with alleged \\"religious\\" phenomena, and there is an intersection there, too, of UFOs!!Rogo points out that only a few writers have ever written about all of these things together and other than rather dry and boring experiments that are repetitious and not very useful, today's respectable parapsychologists would rather jump off a cliff than discuss such things as the Fatima miracles, UFOs, and so on. From an outcast group that has only recently managed to acquire some respectability, parapsychologists have become even more rigid than any other group of academicians.Rogo covers the \\"multiple realities\\" ideas in a casual, anecdotal way and presents some interesting cases that raise very important questions about teleportation of both objects and human beings. Of course, his conclusion is that it is all being done by the minds of the victims. I used to entertain such ideas myself (under the influence of parapsychology, I should add.)Rogo tells us quite assertively: \\"It is my own belief that if these accounts of mysterious transportations of objects and the human body are genuine, they represent some form of poltergeist activity.\\"He then goes on to discuss hyperdimensional realities as a sort of \\"transportation system\\".\\"What I'm suggesting is that all of these oddities represent a transportation system. And like any other system, things are bound to go wrong every once in a while!\\"The concept of instantly transporting objects and people via teleportation through some sort of \\"hyper-dimension\\" is certainly not mere science fiction. Strange disappearances and psychic phenomena indicate the reality of apportation, and it is a concept that has intrigued scientists and world governments alike.\\"Rogo then writes a rather odd paragraph:\\"There are a number of people who have some acquaintance with our field and who come up with intriguing though totally irrational delusions that our military and government are secretly conducting experiments into the paranormal or are nefariously covering up strange discoveries. I'm not what one would call a paranoid-tripper, but my skepticism did become a little shaky as the result of an encounter reported with relish by Ivan Sanderson. Sanderson was once talking to Pentagon officials about UFOs, as part of a regular briefing session. Although the conversation was not top secret, it was obviously confidential. Sanderson, who was always a gutsy sort of person, decided to stretch the conversation as far as he could and asked the officials if he could talk to any scientists experimenting with \\"teleportation.\\" Why e thought such experiments were going on is somewhat of a mystery itself, but even he was shocked at the response; all hell broke loose. One top official screamed, \\"We don't mention that subject.\\" He asserted that he didn't know anything about it, yet another official paradoxically concluded, \\"Anyhow, we don't call it teleportation anymore; we call it ITF.\\" For the uninitiated, ITF stand for Instantaneous TransFerence. So obviously something was up!\\"Too bad Rogo didn't follow that line of thinking - or, conversely, maybe he unfortunately did follow it later and that's why he was killed. In any event, most of the rest of this book is his attempt to \\"paranormalize\\" just about anything strange that ever happens on the planet... it's all about ESP and PK to one extent or another. There is, to his mind, no phenomenon that cannot be explained in these terms. And boy, does he do some backflips to do it!His next subject is so called \\"Forteana\\" such as mysterious falls of different objects and objects found in \\"impossible places.\\" As he points out (and again, I've experienced this myself), those interested in Fortean phenomena do not seem to be very knowledgeable about psychic phenomena just as those that research UFOs are similarly ignorant of psychic phenomena and the religious phenomena connection to UFOs and vice versa and so on.And again, his solution for the problem of strange rains of frogs, blood, flesh, metal, cylinders, peas, beans, \\"angel hair,\\" and whatever else is... poltergeist activity. (Keep in mind that his definition of \\"poltergeist\\" is basically PK that is being uncontrollably manifested by some human in the vicinity.)Regarding OOPARTS (out of place artifacts), Rogo quotes Ivan Sanderson's three possible explanations: 1) ancient, advanced civilization; 2) teleportation; 3) ancient ET visits left them there.Rogo smugly tells us that Sanderson easily disposed of hypothesis #1 \\"on the basis of inherent improbability\\" (!) and Rogo doesn't like the \\"ancient ET visitors\\" theory, but doesn't give us any rationale for dismissing it, and turns instead to hypothesis #2 and expands it to... you guessed it, \\"poltergeist type activity.\\"Rogo then begins to cover religious \\"miracles\\" as poltergeist activity, (manifested by groups, also, such as the Fatima miracles).Now, as it happens, I agree with Rogo on his explanations for quite a few of the examples he uses: \\"Bleeding religious objects are in themselves not miraculous. They are not caused by the will of God superseding physical laws. Instead we can better understand them as psychic effects. [...] Additional evidence that what we call miracles are actually collective psychic projections can be witness by anyone willing to travel to Naples to see 'the Miracle of St. Januarius. [...]The miracle was first reported in the fourteenth century, and it is hard to believe that it could have been perpetrated by so many different clergymen over a period of 500 years! ... Some psychic field is affecting the blood which regulates when it liquefies and when it hardens. On the other hand, another likely explanation could be that the act of veneration and celebration by the crowds of the devout projects a collective psychic force that acts on the vial [of blood].\\"Rogo takes us through a few more fascinating cases and generally does a pretty good job of explaining them, and then marches on to UFOs that have often been associated with religious mania. This is where the weakness in his arguments begin to show.Because, certainly the hyperdimensional explanation is the correct one, but it is not that everything is \\"created\\" by the minds (PK) of the humans involved, but rather that their emotional energies may be being used by \\"something on the other side of that curtain\\" as a portal by which to enter this reality.Rogo writes: \\"People in an emotional and religious frame of mind are likely to create almost anything. There seems to be a definite relationship between these lights and crowd activities.\\"This proposal fails because it is clear that it is not the crowd that is creating, but rather the crowd is being used.There are way too many contradictory arguments and illogical leaps of assumption to list them all, but I do want to mention one as an example.As noted above, Rogo announced at the beginning that he was conservative and the reason was that he knew how the mind could be deceived. Well, he goes along debunking just about everybody's experiences as them being deceived by their minds, even when there is physical evidence! The physical evidence is, of course, to Rogo merely evidence of PK! But, when Rogo or one of his personal friends has a strange experience, all of a sudden, it is quite real and valid and nobody is being deceived!First he describes the experience of his friend, Raymond Bayless who tells a story about coming home when he was a boy.\\"In 1938 I experienced an unusual and frightening adventure along with my brother. Our family was living in Denver. We had arrived home one evening only to find no one there. I remained downstairs after entering the house, while my brother went upstairs. At this time, I suddenly realized that something hideous and evil was in the house. There was no logical reason for my receiving this impression, it was a totally spontaneous impression. This impression was so forceful and disturbing that I could not help but run out the back door to escape outside. As I ran, I almost collided with my brother. He was bolting downstairs and was also heading for the door! Outside at last, we compared notes. To my surprise, my brother told me that while upstairs he had been overpowered by the horrible feelings that there was something evil in the house. he, too, had had the urge to run from the house in order to escape from it. Even to this day, I have no explanation to account for this strange experience. Suffice it to say that no normal explanation can account for the fact that both my brother and myself ha identical impressions while in different parts of the house. \\" (Raymond Bayless quoted by Rogo)Now, what does Rogo do with this after 138 pages of debunking everything that ever happened to everyone else as being PK that manifests out of subconscious conflicts? Well, he sets about confirming that this is evidence for the existence of EVIL!!!\\"I think we have to conclude that Raymond Bayless actually did confront something evil, something from which he knew he must escape. This loathsome thing was only ephemeral, however. When the Bayless brothers ventured to reenter the house later that evening, its atmosphere was perfectly normal.\\"He then goes on to tell his own similar story after which he concludes:\\"Never in my life have I ever had a similar experience. Nor can it be argued that I merely \\"suggested\\" the reaction because I knew the house was haunted. That explanation is sheer nonsense since I had lived in the house for two years without ever experiencing anything like that before. ... Sometimes this type of evil does not invade or seek to possess some weak mortal, but instead permeates an entire area. The evil becomes affixed to a certain location in space, just as a haunting does.\\"Now, notice how easily he dismisses the idea that HE might be suggestible! And yet, that is exactly what he says about virtually everyone else when the issue of UFOs are involved, no matter what the other circumstances, the evidence, testimony of multiple witnesses, etc. (You should read what he does with the Pascagoula case and Travis Walton!)It is this last bit that actually exposed Rogo to me as one who \\"prestidigitates\\" the data. Notice his mention of the idea of evil being able to \\"haunt\\" a specific area.Rogo describes an experience that John Keel wrote about where he realized that there are \\"zones of negative energy\\" and then he goes on to a most interesting reference to the work of Tom Lethbridge. He then compares it to Keel's, and, by default, his own and recounts a couple more examples to bolster his point.Earlier in his book, Rogo talks about a religious relic that had strange properties. His explanation was:\\"In this respect the object is acting like a miniature haunted house. A haunting is set up when a tragedy and the strong emotions accompanying it contaminate a house, church, or other structure. These emotions somehow are ingrained into the structure and periodically cause the scenes of the disaster to replay themselves. Apparitions are seen, footsteps are heard, and phantom dramas are reenacted. It is as though a motion picture of the events had been projected onto the atmosphere. Sometimes these residues even have physical side effects. I once stayed in a haunted house during which time the bed in which I slept was shaken every night for about a week.\\"Two important points to note about the above paragraph: first of all, Rogo excuses himself from the definitely poltergeistic type activity of the bed in which he was sleeping. It had nothing to do with HIM! But more important, what he writes reveals that he knew a lot more about the Lethbridge ideas than he let on.So why did he twist an obvious scientific conclusion that negative energies could be manifestations of electrical energies, or even recordings into some hocus pocus about evil?I guess we'll never know. But having discovered this twist in Rogo's thinking, put together with his other illogical assumptions and leaps, I don't think I trust much of what he writes at all.Have to give him two stars for trying, but he loses points for obfuscation of evidence and subjective thinking."},{"Title":"ROBOT.","review":"Sad that this is no longer in print.

Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics. Monograph)","review":"While Markowitz is a name well-known in economics (joint winner of the Nobel Proze in 1990) and the investment industry, it is known hardly at all among the public. Perhaps this is the inevitable fate of a man well ahead of his time: Markowitz's work on the relationship of risk and return is truly one of the staggering intellectual achievements of modern economics, and has a great practical impact on people's economic welfare. This volume recapitulates his argument that risk is what drives return, rather than being (as was thought by earlier generations of money managers) merely an unfortunate by-product of the search for higher returns, that the portfolio dominates its constituent assets, and that the way to minimise risk for a given level of expected return is to minimise the covariance of returns of the assets within that portfolio using a quadratic programming algorithm.

A Blueprint for Health","review":"Dr. Rogers does a good job of presenting technical information in a way that it is readable and understandable by anyone. At the same time, she includes enough technical depth and references to satisfy the advanced or professional reader. This book, for the first time, not only described some of my unusual symptoms, but their significance, cause, and biochemistry. She one of the few doctors that approaches illness from an understanding of its biochemistry and causes rather than treatment of symptoms. She explains how to deal with illness at the causitive level. This is the only hope for real cures. The book covers a wide variety of illnesses. She writes that chemcial sensitivity, and allergies may be implicated in more serious diseases.Mainstream doctors are too quick to blame their own lack of knowledge on the patient and most too lazy to evaluate new information as Dr. Rogers has done. They are also too quick to label doctors who think outside the norm as a quack. Unfortunately, thinking outside the norm is required for breakthroughs in any science. Those doctors who support tired old theories, or worse, are financially invested in the status quo, are the most vociferous in their opposition to change. Remember, they put Galelleo in prison.Dr. Rogers is onto something very significant that will become the medicine of the future. Everyone can benefit from readng this book because we all have been exposed to chemical pollution in our environments and food. You will discover that your symptoms have causes that can be identified and cured.My only criticism of the book are minor; there are a few redundancies, and there is no index. This is a book that you will want to refer to over and over and an index would be very handy."},{"Title":"Tired or Toxic?

Trust me, I am only a consumer here, but I pass these books on to everyone I care about and have for years! I'm going to post this to all the books I have read by Sherry. I just can't say enough about this woman. She literally saved my life (allergies, life and health threatening mineral and vitamin deficiencies) and my husband's too (bladder cancer).

If you have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or Chemical Hyper-sensitivity and you grasp the idea of toxic overload (not to mention the idea that your illness is not psychosomatic) you will be able to monitor and guide your progress toward health. I went to a doctor with a \\"specialty\\" in environmental toxicology who thought Sherry was a quack! Quack, quack to you doctor!"},{"Title":"Tired or Toxic? A Blueprint for Health","review":"For anyone dealing with a serious illness, or that wants to avoid a serious illness, the books by Dr Sherry Rogers are absolutely essential reading.Her books explain in a very easy to understand manner how to deal with the causes of disease using cutting edge medical knowledge, technology and testing, and not just how to mask symptoms with drugs and other superficial treatments (which lead to worsening problems in other areas of health).As Dr Sherry Rogers writes in \`Detoxify or Die',\`I have to laugh when people ask me if I do alternative, herbal, acupuncture or holistic medicine. 'No,' I reply. 'We do state-of-the-art medicine. In other words, we find the biochemical, nutritional and environmental causes and cures rather than blindly drugging everything. Sure, herbs are gentler, safer and more physiologic than drugs and holistic medicine attempts to incorporate many diverse modalities, etc. But there is no substitute for finding the underlying biochemical causes and cures. This is real medicine. This is where medicine should and would have been decades ago, if it had not been abducted by the pharmaceutical industry.'The question is not whether you should read a book by Dr Rogers, but WHICH book of hers you should start with! Choosing which books to start with can be difficult and a bit overwhelming, as there are quite a few. My opinion, is as follows:1. For healthy people that want to stay well, healthy older people who want to avoid degenerative diseases as they get older, or parents who want to keep themselves and their kids well, then the book you need is \`Detoxify or Die.' This one book will probably contain everything you need to know as prevention is so much easier than cure!After reading this book and acting on the advice it gives, you may then like to subscribe to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter, to stay up to date with new developments - if your budget allows for this.2. For those dealing with serious illness, you need both \`Detoxify or Die' and \`No More Heartburn: Stop the Pain in 30 Days-Naturally! : The Safe, Effective Way to Prevent and Heal Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders.' Almost all serious illness involve poor gut health and so poor food and nutrient absorption and one cannot improve with these diseases until the gut issues are dealt with.As Dr Sherry Rogers explains, \`The road to good health is paved with good intestines!'It is very important that you heal you gut problems as much as possible, and treat any serious nutrient deficiencies before beginning any type of detoxification program as these types of programs use up a lot of nutrients and place additional stress on the body. Once you've worked on healing your gut, and your nutrient deficiencies, you can then move onto the information in \`Detoxify or Die.'These books will be helpful no matter what disease label you have, or even if you don't yet have a correct diagnosis. They explain how to heal the body, and how to identify via testing the individual factors that affect your health and so they do not provide disease specific information, generally speaking. (With some exceptions.) This is very good news for those that don't have a correct diagnosis, or that have a disease where very little or no specific research into your disease and how to treat it is taking place.There are 3 basic principles of this type of medicine:A. Get the good stuff in. Give your body the fuel and tools it needs to work at an optimum level. Good food, nutrients and all the proper vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Make sure you aren't deficient in any of the major nutrients as the different nutrients all work together.B. Get the bad stuff out. Make sure your body can detoxify out all the toxic substances and toxic by-products of bodily processes properly. Stop as many toxins from getting in in the first place, and do a detoxification program to get rid of the ones you have. Stop doing or eating the things which cause inflammation and have a pro-oxidant effect, and so on.C. Reduce your body's total load. The total load concept is that lessening the body's overall burden/work and stress level in one area, will improve health generally and improve the body's ability to heal because the body's total load (or burden) is lessened. Fixing one problem frees up bodily resources that can be then be used to help other parts of the body function getter or to heal. In other words, you need to look at the body as a whole in order to heal, and not just the one part of the body that is generating the most symptoms.Dr Sherry Rogers explains that with treating the causes of disease, 'A life sentence to medications that block physiologic pathways is avoided.' She continues,\`Bear in mind that since medications do not fix anything, they allow the underlying problem to continue uncorrected and actually accelerate. Meanwhile, new symptoms and new seemingly unrelated diseases are the inevitable consequence of this biochemical faux pas. Furthermore, drug side effects are the leading cause of death. NSAIDs as an example of only one group of medications, are fatally toxic to thousands of people each year by damaging joints, lungs, kidneys, eyes, hearts, and intestines. And they are covered by insurance.You and your doctor have been screwed into believing every symptom is a deficiency of some drug or surgery. You've been led to believe you have no control, when in truth you're the one who must take control. Unfortunately, the modus operandi in medicine is to find a drug to turn off the damaged part that is producing symptoms. A simple example is the prescription of calcium channel blockers, the number one drug used by cardiologists for angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia. But as with any drug, this does not fix anything that is broken. It merely poisons normal physiological pathways, thereby forcing the chemistry in a direction that attenuates symptoms.Since nothing has been done in terms of getting rid of the underlying cause, the disease continues. In addition the missing fatty acids and minerals in the cell membranes that house and calcium channels are not identified and repaired. Nor are the sequestered membrane chemicals that caused the damage, like unavoidable PCBs and Mercury, gotten rid of. If this were not enough perpetuation and acceleration of damage, the side effects of drugs are not innocuous. For example, calcium channel blockers have been shown by MRI to cause definitive shrinkage of the brain and loss of brain function, a side effect rarely mentioned by clinicians or news media.It should not come as a shock that this type of information is ignored, since studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association document how the practice guidelines for American medicine are made by physicians who receive compensation from the drug industry. (Choudhry, JAMA 2002; 287: 612-617). In addition so is the FDA, the very government regulatory body that approves drugs, riddled with advisers with financial ties to (and is heavily lobbied by) the very drug industry that is seeking its approval. And as the New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of the American Medical Association warm, even the hired clinical investigators for new drugs may have their price. 'If after following the advice in \`Detoxify or Die' (and using your FIR sauna daily or every second day etc.) for a year or two, your progress stalls, then you need to follow a more intensive plan. The book \`The High Blood Pressure Hoax' is the Part 2 to \`Detoxify or Die' and shows you where to go from there to start making progress again with healing. Part 3 is called \`The Cholesterol Hoax' and again this book is recommended only if after following the advice in Part 2, your progress stalls.After reading a couple of Dr Rogers' books, you may also then like to subscribe to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter, to stay up to date with new developments - if your budget allows for this.3. Doctors are recommended to read \`Detoxify or Die.' The book \`Is Your Cardiologist Killing You?' is also recommended if they commonly prescribe statins, beta blockers, Coumadin and other cardiac drugs.-----Information on each of Dr Sherry Rogers' books:1. Detoxify or Die (2002) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is excellent. It is also very easy to read and understand. It talks about the importance of treating the causes of disease and the most important chemicals to avoid in food and in cleaning and personal care products, the impact of each of the major chemical types on the body, tests which can be used to determine your toxic load (as well as your nutrients levels and how well your detoxification pathways are functioning etc.), the problems with many common prescribed drugs, the benefits of a daily detox cocktail, the benefits of juicing and enemas, the benefits and safety of regular FIR sauna use, how to use the sauna safely and what to expect when doing a sauna program, and so much more. There is also a great little summary of the parts of the book on FIR saunas that is available as a free PDF online which is exceptionally good. (Google the relevant terms to find it.)2. No More Heartburn: Stop the Pain in 30 Days--Naturally! : The Safe, Effective Way to Prevent and Heal Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders (2000) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is excellent (even if the title is NOT!). It is also very easy to read and understand. It talks about the importance of treating the causes of disease and why healing the gut is an essential first part of any healing program - whether you feel like you have any gut issues or not. It discusses food allergies and intolerances, low stomach acid, dysbiosis, the problems with many prescription and over the counter medications (such as NSAIDs, aspirin and ibuprofen) on gut health, rotation diets, Candida, enemas, and leaky gut syndrome and the tests which can be used to determine which gut issues you have.It also discusses the importance of detoxification enemas and other detoxification regimes and the all-important concept of the \`total load.'3. Pain Free in 6 Weeks (2001) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book may be useful if you are generally in good health, but suffer with chronic pain. If chronic pain is part of a serious disease complex then you'll be treating the pain along with all of your other symptoms by following the advice given in the books on gut health and detoxification and so this book probably wont be necessary. Several supplements which can help with chronic pain are discussed in this book as well as a nightshade-free diet, improving gut health and lowering your toxic load and detoxification enemas for pain relief.4. Wellness Against All Odds (1994) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.In most of Dr Rogers' books the only diet recommended is the macrobiotic diet, although every now and again there were also comments about how not every diet works for everyone and that some people may not do well on the macrobiotic diet and should read \`Wellness Against All Odds' for more information about other diets. This book explains that while the macrobiotic diet suits a large percentage of ill people, some of us need far more protein and fat in our diets and do much better when our food is cooked rather than raw. Dr Rogers explains that some of us may need a raw food macro diet to heal, and others a cooked diet with lots of animal protein and fat or something between these two extremes, and that as we heal we'll all likely move more into the middle and eat some raw food, some cooked food and a balance of plant and animal foods. What is most important is eating whole foods and making sure to find the diet that works best for us at this point in time.As well as discussing different diets, this book also contains excellent information on enemas, detoxifying salt baths, the liver and gallbladder flush, the castor oil and olive oil body rub and the use of systemic enzymes to treat cancer and other diseases. It's an interesting read and probably essential extra reading if you have cancer.5. The High Blood Pressure Hoax (2008) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.Part 2 to \`Detoxify or Die.' Also contains useful information on how to treat and how not to treat high blood pressure.6. The Cholesterol Hoax (2008) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.Part 3 to \`Detoxify or Die.' Also contains useful information on why the \`cholesterol hypothesis' is dead and why statin drugs are hazardous to your health.7. Is Your Cardiologist Killing You? by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone taking statin drugs, daily aspirin, Coumadin, NSAIDs, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers etc. The information given on these drugs and the problems they cause was frightening.Overall, this book is very easy to read and well organised and very clear in its message and with its references. If you're taking some of the above drugs, this book really is essential. It not only warns you of the dangers of these drugs but tell you how to safely get off them. (Very gradually!) If you aren't taking any of these drugs, you are much better off with 'Detoxify or Die' instead as it contains much more detailed treatment information for those of us with heart problems.This book is highly recommended for any doctor that commonly prescribes the above drugs as well.7. Depression: Cured At Last? by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This (very long) book is kind of an early version of \`Detoxify or Die' although it does contain a small amount of material that isn't in any of the other books. While I took 8 pages of handwritten notes from \`DOD' I still managed to write 2 pages of notes on the new information in this book that was of interest. Most of it was information about the specific role of each vitamin and mineral. This book looks at how nutrient deficiencies and toxic overload are the root causes of disease, using depression as an example. It makes a strong case for the use of environmental medicine in treating all disease, including mental illnesses. This book is an interesting read if you're able to get a copy, and read such a large amount of text. It is probably essential reading if you have depression, anxiety or disorders such as schizophrenia or OCD and so on.8. Chemical Sensitivity (1998), The EI Syndrome Revised (1995) and Tired or Toxic? A Blueprint for Health (1990) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.So far I have chosen not to buy these books as a) They are older compared to \`Detoxify or Die' b) I have read a huge amount about chemical sensitivity and its associated problems already and c) The book \`Detoxify or Die' seems to be an updated version of all of these books, to a large extent. They are recommended reading if you are very new to the subject of chemical sensitivities and would like to know more about this problem and what symptoms it causes and so on.9. The Scientific Basis for Selected Environmental Medicine Techniques (1994) by Sherry A. Rogers M.D.This book is designed to be given to doctors and perhaps also insurance companies. It contains summarised information about the basic principles of environmental medicine, along with lots of reference lists. Unfortunately, as this book is now almost 20 years old, most doctors would probably see it as outdated and you may be far better off using books such as \`Detoxify or Die' to try and get relevant information to doctors and other professionals. This book is not necessary for patients to buy for themselves and it doesn't contain any information that isn't given in far more detail in \`Detoxify or Die.'10. Macro Mellow : Recipes for Macrobiotic Cooking (1993) by Shirley Gallinger and Sherry A. RogersThis is one of three books on macrobiotic cooking by Dr Rogers. I need to eat in a way quite opposite to the macrobiotic diet and so I haven't bought any of these books. These books are highly recommended if the macrobiotic diet works for you however.-----General comments on Dr Rogers' books:1. There is a bit of repetition in some of the books, as some reviewers have noted. But overall it isn't a big problem and it does help you remember all the major points she is making.2. There are some typographical errors in some of the books, but please don't let that put you off. These books aren't produced for massive profits and are written by someone who never planned to be an author, isn't in it for the money and doesn't advertise her books, instead relying on word of mouth sales. There may be a few typographical errors and some books may have somewhat of a \`homemade' feel to them in parts, but the information in the books and their references are spot on and that is what is important. The books are very well written and extremely well referenced.3. The books almost always give recommendations for actual brand name products, as Dr Rogers notes that the quality of supplements varies widely and she only feels comfortable recommending trusted brands and long-term tested products. This is helpful as it gives you a starting point in your research of which products to buy, whether you end up buying those exact brands or not. Note that Dr Rogers has no financial ties with ANY of these companies.4. All of the recommendations in the books can seem overwhelming, but all you need to do is start small. Do one small thing at a time and make gradual changes. The worst thing you could do, especially if you are very ill, is jump into taking and doing lots of different things all at once anyway.(Actually, the need to start some supplements very slow is something I feel Dr Rogers could have given more attention to. Some of us would get (even more) extremely ill taking the amounts of reduced alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, reduced GSH and garlic etc. she recommends if we didn't raise the doses very gradually over 1 - 3 months or more. Perhaps this is just an issue for people like me who have M.E., that almost all have to be especially slow in introducing new supplements of this kind, but perhaps it relates to at least a small group other patients as well, which is why I am mentioning it. I can now take her recommended daily detox cocktail with no problems at all, but the first time I took 5 g of vitamin C, and even 100 mg of ALA daily, it really knocked me around. It was awful and very severe.)5. Dr Rogers books are to some extent \`do-it-yourself' health books but ideally Dr Rogers recommends that you get well with the help of a qualified practitioner that will be able to order the appropriate tests for you, and also help you interpret them.6. One extra thing I feel I have to mention in relation to Dr Rogers' books is the amount of religious material some of them contain. In books such as the one on gut health and \`Detoxify or Die' it is fairly minimal, but in books such as \`Depression: Cured At last?' and \`Wellness Against All Odds; and others it is quite extreme. Topics are mentioned such as the need for prayer in schools, what a terrible idea it is to teach kids about homosexuality and condoms at a young age, evolution is mocked as unscientific and the theory of intelligent design and creationism is discussed, evidence is given for biblical events/artifacts such as the Ark and the moral decay caused by more people rejecting religion. The push for readers to embrace religion and Christianity is very full-on and a very hard-sell.I really hope that readers that have big problems with this type of information, or just with its appearing in a scientific textbook, will be able to take the mountain of very good information on health in these books and perhaps just skip over the religious parts (which are generally focused on one chapter towards the end of the book) and agree to disagree with the author on this topic. It would be such a loss for anyone to miss out on these books because of the religious content, I hope nobody does. It is also important that you know these books have this content if you are going to give them to others, so that you can also mention it to them beforehand, this avoiding or minimising any upset on their behalf as well (or a very unfortunate blanket rejection of all the health information in them).7. You will often be referred to other books while you're reading one of Dr Rogers' books. I think I actually would really rather pay more and have the one BIG book (or set of 3 books) with everything in it and all up to date, rather than keep being referred to other books when reading. I'm ill and get easily overwhelmed, as I know many others do too. I'd rather not buy an extra whole book just for a few pages of relevant information in it too, but I realise the one big book idea may be too difficult to do for a whole host of reasons. (Sorry Dr Rogers, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, I'm a big fan. This is just a suggestion.)8. In addition to books by Dr Sherry Rogers I'd also recommend books by Dr Lawrence Wilson (and his website), Dr Abram Hoffer, Andrew Saul, Sally Fallon and Mary Enig (most especially \`Eat Fat, Lose Fat' and \`Know Your Fats) and any and all of the vitamin C experts such as Linus Pauling and Dr Thomas Levy. Other excellent books include \`Good Calories, Bad Calories' and \`Deep Nutrition' as well as books on the SCD eating plan and the GAPS diet for the treatment of dysbiosis and a diet-based plan to heal the gut.That's it!BTW I'm writing all this as someone that subscribes to Dr Rogers' monthly newsletter and owns most of her books, and that is slowly improving month by month from a very severe neurological disease - thanks in part to the work of Dr Rogers, and others like her - that has left me housebound and almost entirely bedbound for many years. I wish so much I had had this information early on in my disease, rather than coming to it more than 10 years in. Healing is so much easier the earlier you start it.Best wishes for future health to anyone still reading this far! And a big thank you to Dr Sherry Rogers for sharing all this valuable information!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

Chomsky's analysis clearly shows how the US has selectively used the Universal Declaration of Human Rights when the need arises and how the US has ignored it when the need arises. One of the more essential aspects of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the US prefers to ignore is the language about economic rights:Article 23 of the UD declares that &quot;Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favorable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment,&quot; along with &quot;remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.&quot; &quot;Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.&quot;With the complete approval of the US Gov't., US industry has conducted one of the most successful antiunion wars ever, illegally firing thousands of workers for exercising their rights to organize, prompting the International Labor Organizationto issue a recommendation that the US conform to international standards.Chomsky documents how US officials continually complain about goods made by prison labour in China, yet remain silent concerning the same practices in the US. Prison labour is a violation of the UD.&quot;The Umbrella of U.S. Power: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Contradictions of U.S. Policy&quot; is a powerful and important work that exposes US hypocrisy and its total lack of respect for international law and humanitarian principles."},{"Title":"The Umbrella of U.S. Power: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Contradictions of U.S. Policy (Open Media Series)","review":"This is one of Noam Chomsky's most interesting pamphlets (actually a quarter-size booklet of 78 pages). It has a special relevance and importance to citizens in the aftermath of 9-11 because he directly links our corporate criminality (\\"Justice Department estimates the cost of corporate crime as 7 to 25 times as high as street crime\\") to our national policies against human rights (poverty pays, for the corporate class that strives to liquidate Third World nations in their predatory roving of the planet).He pointedly identifies the U.S. arms industry as being among the worst violators, but even more importantly, points out that U.S. policies favoring our arms dealers are opposed by 96% of the U.S. population. While that number might be high, I believe there is no question but that Washington is being instructed by corporations rather than its citizens on this vital point of policy. It is time for citizens to take the power back.Chomsky notes that in 1996 the World Health Organization characterized extreme poverty as the world's most ruthless killer and the greatest cause of suffering on earth. This ties in with the United Nations finding that human suffering is now a legitimate basis for intervention, and with George Soro's observation in The Washington Post of 24 February 2002, that \\"We can't be successful in fighting terrorism, unless we fight that other axis of evil--poverty, disease and ignorance.\\"This little gem of a book also includes well-footnoted observations about how nations seek to carry out trade negotiations in secrecy, in part because they are agreeing to overlook if not actively participate in the looting of poor countries as a condition for prosperous trade among the already developed nations.The book begins and ends with thoughts from Chomsky on the intellectual discipline he founded, the relationship between linguistics, ethics, and action. He begins with pointed observations on how the most horrible crimes are allowed to go without comment because of *self* censorship, and ends by noting that our citizens do not need to be forbidden to speak of these monstrous deeds that our corporations and government are secretly agreeing to perpetuate, because we have chosen to remain ignorant and silent.U.S. policy today is *not* founded on moral values, and it is *not* representative of the will of the people in so far as it is carried out in secret collaboration with major corporations and in opposition to the minimal mandatory needs of developing nations for water, food, disease, and economic security.This is not about political ideology--Ralph Nader, the ultimate spoiler, has one thing right: the parties are irrelevant, this is now about the people versus the corporations. Absent a huge popular turn-out *prior* to each election, to make it clear to candidates that they will be held accountable by the people for keeping all trade and other negotiations in the public domain, and for voting on issues mindful of the will of the people rather than their corporate Enron-like paymasters, then we are the ones ultimately responsible for U.S. policy's misdirection."},{"Title":"The Umbrella of U.S. Power: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Contradictions of U.S. Policy (Open Media Series)","review":"This is not so much a review as a note to buyers: you can obtain this exact essay by buying Chomsky's _Rogue States: The Rule of Force in World Affairs_. It's just a few dollars more than this pamphlet, yet it offers 13 *additional* essays. It doesn't fit quite as neatly into your back pocket, and it's a tad less digestable, but I think it's well worth the extra 2-3 dollars.

You don't have to agree with his politics, to learn something from his books. In \\"The Umbrella of U.S. Power\\", Chomsky points out the hypocrisy that our great country can sometime perpetrate; in this case in regards to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UD). The UD is an international document that U.S. is a co-signer of that spells out the universally accepted minimums of the human rights that all people of the Earth retain.Unfortunately, we do not have a great track record of upholding these rights when dealing with threats to our nation. I am not going to debate the necessity of these or not in this review; I, like many, have my moments of better us than them. But, if we are to call ourselves Americans and wish to embrace our liberty, democracy, and freedom, we need to be honest with ourselves. And, to do that, we must, as good citizens, be aware of how our government conducts our business in these matters.Only through fully understanding our history and our actions can we better handle crisis in the future. Is holding prisoners from our \\"War on Terror\\" in limbo on a beach in Cuba the best solution to the problem that some of these people pose? Or could we have found a viable solution to this situation and protect ourselves at same time, all while upholding the UD we signed?Read this book for the truth. Then choose how you fall on the issue. But, don't stick your head in the sand and assume that our leaders know what's best; collectively, if informed, we the people can guide our nation best.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"The Umbrella of U.S. Power: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Contradictions of U.S. Policy (Open Media Series)","review":"Chomsky's writing is always something that will make an uproar.

If you are an open minded individual ready to see all sides, then you might just possibly give this book a chance. However, even the most open-minded person will have problems with this Chomsky edition simply because it is pure ultra-liberal propaganda that only a small percentage of people actually follow or for that matter, believe. Political affilations aside, Chomsky's assertions are based on half truths and are founded on the firm belief (Chomsky's belief) that the American government is inherently flawed in all that it does because of its hypocritical &quot;means justify ends&quot; approach to foreign policy. A true democracy (according to Chomsky and others)must approach policy with an &quot;ends must justify the means&quot; approach. That is, if America preaches the importance of freedom, democracy, diplomacy, its policies must be democratic and diplomatic, not unilateral and without regard to human rights. This is a common leftist and idealistic sentiment that political science academics debate all of the time. However, if you are like most Americans and firmly believe in the strength of the U.S. constitution (small c because our foundation lies not in the Constitution, the paper document, but the unwritten laws and codes that were established before such a document existed)and if you place a certain level of trust in our government to do the right thing most of the time and be as truthful as it can be --then you will quickly gag after reading Chomsky's extremism and firm anti-patriotic sentiments.After 9-11, the last thing this country needs is an overly zealous political academic who is more than willing to criticize the past, present and future of American foreign policy. Has our governemnt done wrong to people around the world? Yes. Have we been told half truths and half lies in the name of National security. Yes. Has our military and corporations committed crimes against humanity? Most likely. However, freedom around the world comes at a heavy price. No one said it would be easy. No one ever said it was going to be democratic all of the time. Sometimes we and others must pay with our lives to secure freedom for the the good of the whole. This is what makes the United States a great and relatively safe place to live.So if you like reading extreme liberal academics rant and rave about how the U.S. is so full of contradictions and flaws, but offer no realistic solutions to these obvious problems in U.S. foreign policy, read this book, you will love it and become a Noam Gnome. However, if you were like me and have had it up to here with extremism all around the world, then save your money and join a club or something."},{"Title":"The Umbrella of U.S. Power: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Contradictions of U.S. Policy (Open Media Series)","review":"The whole concept underlying this volume is based on a myth. The law in the United States is the U.S. Constitution. The Universal Declaration of Rights (&quot;UD&quot;) is a creature of the UN. It arguably has the force of a treaty, but no more. It by no means supplants or replaces or trumps the U.S. Constitution. If we follow our own law, but not UD, this is fine, and probably preferable: basing our actions on votes at the UN is a pretty bad idea. Whereas Chomsky will always be much more critical of the US than any other country (even though the other countries are almost universally less free), most of these other countries would be only too happy to impose their views of liberty on us. It's a good thing that neither they, nor Chomsky, will get a chance."},{"Title":"Burke and Hare (Notable trials library)","review":"This book was first published in England, in 1921, a little over 100 years after the murders by Burke and Hare. The language is therefore of a more learned nature, and not even remotely as graphic in description of crime scene, etc., as modern novels. This is either an irritation if you're looking for gritty tabloid-style facts...or pleasing if you enjoy language as an art. The author, William Roughhead, has most definitely judged both Burke and Hare in the writing- therefore allowing his adjectives to convey the evil nature of the duo, but doing nothing there to allow the reader to draw their own conclusion.The author's villification aside, the book is a must-have if you're researching Burke and Hare. The better part of the book is a reproduction (in modern type-face, thank heavens) of the notes of the trial itself. Also included: both of Burke's confessions, letters Dr. Knox wrote to defend himself, prints of Burke, Hare, Laird, and M'Dougal, drawings of the apartment where most of the murders occured, and more. It's an interesting read, but invaluable as a source of original information."},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"From the front cover to the last page, Martin delivers a non stop, heart-stopping, adrenaline pumping thriller, that burns images into your mind, and steals your breath away.

But his adept turn of phrase sometimes gets the better of him as he tries to sound hard-boiled. (He's always using slightly caricature-worthy phrases like &quot;gnarled corridors of pain&quot;)Despite that, Cul-de-Sac is a sprint to the finish, implausible yet exciting, an engaging and insubstantial twisted tale with gore by the bucket."},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"I gave this book only two stars because I actually felt compeled to read to the end. I should have known; any book that opens with a beheading, and the victims heads being placed in the washer and dryer, is bound to be disgusting. I guess I just had no idea how disgusting. I'm not generally a squeamish person, but this was just over the top. Not to mention the plot was thin; you know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and the eventual revelation was no big surprise. I personally found Martin's writing to be overdone; his descriptions had the subtlety of a 2 by 4, and some were just plain bad. The run on sentences and lack of commas just beg for a good editor. If you are looking for some good psychological suspense, just get a Stephen King or an Iris Johansen novel; those are actually scary and mysterious, not just gross."},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"Couldn't put the book down!!!

I was so caught up in this story that there was no way I could put it down and ended up finishing it in one afternoon. Martin's writing is clear, and he drew me in with all the twists and turns to this story.Donald Growler knows he has been wronged. He has just spent several years of his life in prison for a crime he says he never committed. Now he's out, and he's in search of all the people who caused him to be locked up. I was squirming in my chair with the descriptions of some of the more creative murders in this novel. The plot twists are amazing, and there were quite a few surprises. I love that Teddy Camel makes another appearance; he was a great character in Martin's LIE TO ME (another incredible serial killer novel).Martin is not for the squeamish! He is very detailed, and his bad guys are downright brutal. But he is a master of plot and character development.

The discussion by a couple of the characters on whether Growler's name is pronounded Grow-ler or Growl-er is hilarious. Also appreciated by this reader is that Martin gives a plausible rationalization for Annie returning to Cul De Sac, knowing that a killer is probably waiting for her. So instead of saying to myself, &quot;Lady, don't go in there!&quot;, I'm saying, &quot;Yeah, I can see why she'd do that.&quot; I liked that he cared enough about the reader to realize that we'd need a reason for her risky behavior."},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"I wasn't riveted, fascinated or spell bound by this tawdry little book. I gave it two stars instead of one because I love characters that are just a little out of sync with the rest of the world. Annie and Teddy were interesting as lead characters alebit you never understood why their brief summer affair couldn't have ended with something close to reality. Teddy didn't want to marry Annie so they broke up.... how trite given the nature of their summer together. Annie finds out she's pregnant and doesn't tell Teddy at the time but years later he's apologizing for not being there for her when she was pregnant. So when do you think the author might let it slip in that Annie had told him she got pregnant that summer. The whole stupid book is full of this sort of crap. Starting things and then forgetting how to end them and what they relate to. It's so ridiculous especially the 'bad guy'. So abused and taken advantage of by everyone you start hoping he gets to kill everyone. If you want me to feel sorry for the rat finks that lied at his trial then you gotta do better than this. I hated to see the way he died given he never did a thing to deserve the horrible things done to him while in prison for a murder he didn't commitOh yeah, just to let you know, there is no big mystery here.

An absolutely spiffing thriller that never loses momentum, punctuated with the occasional exceedingly nasty scene, and all wrapped up with a huge dose of hilarious gallows humour, makes for an absolutely unputdownable page-turner. I can't wait for Tarantino (or possibly Cronenberg?) to make the movie!"},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"The majority of my favorite books have me well-hooked by the end of the first chapter. David Martin's latest nailed me by the end of the first page. And kept me thoroughly riveted right through the end.Cul-De-Sac involves a very burned-out ex-cop, whose life is turned inside-out by the sudden appearance of his sensuous ex-girlfriend, the fairly freckled Annie. There's also the ex-girlfriend's husband (an ex-Jesuit). Most notably, there is Growler -- an ex-con who, after serving time for a murder he didn't commit, goes on a bloody rampage of vengence against all those who put him away. Growler's prison experiences have left him with a serious grudge as well as a new set of teeth; he's a man on a mission and in addition to wreaking some extremely violent havoc, is in desperate search of...yup, you guessed it; an elephant. Really.This book made me laugh out loud. It also made me avert my eyes from the page occasionally; while some scenes are very funny, be warned that the violence is not for the faint of heart.I've bought four more copies for friends thus far, because I won't let mine out of my sight. I've also scrambled to get my hands on all of Martin's previous books (only partially successful); Cul-De-Sac takes gets my vote as Martin's best for its sheer audicity, outrageousness, and great, great writing.If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction or Twin Peaks, Cul-De-Sac will thrill you"},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"To say that this book is following the same formula as Martin's previous Detective Teddy Camel thriller is an understatement. Both Lie to Me and Cul-De-Sac deal with a killer who is recently out of prison where horrible things happened to them, both deal with an extremely gruesome crime right off the bat, and both have layered mysteries and characters that are more than meets the eye. I suppose it's a case where the old line \\"If something ain't broke don't fix it\\" applies, because it didn't bother me one bit.Cul-De-Sac is even more graphic and disturbing than Lie to Me, and we really get to know Teddy Camel more as a character. Annie Milton, was a wonderful counter to Teddy and their history is tumultuous and what was touching is that despite the years and circumstances, when reunited you get the sense that they feel as if no time has passed between them. The entire dynamics of their relationship was well thought and believable. In fact, the characters in general were better written and more thoughtful in this book. Even the villain (Growler) who did awful and positively sick things through out the story had moments where I could sympathize with him.Though Cul-De-Sac is not a perfect book, several things are overlooked because it was a page turning thriller that kept me thoroughly engrossed with gory acts, legitimate mystery, dark humor, a Bogart style hero and a satisfying ending. I found myself wanting to read more about Teddy Camel and his crime solving mysteries and would automatically order another if I should happen to come across it in the future."},{"Title":"Cul-de-Sac","review":"Once you start reading this book, you cannot put it down.

He simply takes these various elements out of the ring and on to the street. The emphasis is on full-contact, live training and realistic drills. He begins with \\"Fundamental Fighting Concepts\\", introducing the clinch, the shoot-style takedown, clinching against a wall, weak points of the human anatomy (differentiating between lethal and non-lethal targets), drills for closing the distance vs. punching and kicking, and even a little on pre-emptive striking. The second section is \\"Street Boxing Concepts\\", and includes the basic position, how to generate power, and a basic arsenal of tools including both open-hand and fisted techniques, and the headbutt. His explainations of the use of his stance and the medical justification for not excluding the headbutt are worth reading. The third chapter is on \\"Mobility and Defense\\". He goes over basic footwork from his stance, and moves on to defensive body movements like the slip, and simple, scientific defensive techniques like the catch and Driscoll parry and Driscoll bridge. He includes examples of their usage and some drills for improving both footwork and defense. Covering almost sixty pages, his chapter on \\"Ground Fighting\\" is the longest. He starts off by stating that going to the ground is not desirable most of the time in a streetfight (good advice if I've ever heard it), and then proceeds to discuss the various groundfighting positions. He gives the reader several offensive options for each position, and usually some accompanying drills. He always reminds the reader that \\"dirty tactics\\" (biting and gouging) should be utilized whenever possible. He also includes striking for downed opponents, getting back to the feet from the ground, taking down an opponent from the \\"open guard\\", and various training drills. My only objection to this section is that, at least in the States, kicking a downed opponent is considered excessive and will most likely result in criminal charges being made. Overall, though, this is a very good book. The only thing that might be missing is basic weapons usage and defense. The techniques are very basic and essential, and the training seems quite practical. They seem very compatible with Jun Fan and BJJ/MMA.

The only other books I've seen come close to it in quality are from Claudia Nice but she uses many different types of pens. This book focuses strictly on the technical pen only. The beautiful artwork in this book alone is worth the price.The artwork demonstrated is definitely pro quality and it could potentially be daunting to the absolute beginner. However, I believe if a beginner is willing to sit down with this book and carefully read and implement the exercises and suggestions the author gives they will quickly find themselves executing drawings of a caliber they would never have dreamed possible except by the most experienced pro.The first few chapters deal with care and maintenance of the pens plus the many inks available. There are chapters on various textures &amp; strokes you can create, chapters on creating a loose, breezy style or alternately a very highly detailed drawing. There are discussions of using a pattern motif as a texture fill and chapters on dynamic use of dark shapes for contrast and composition.One chapter shows the exact same drawing of a Monk portrait redone in no less than 24 completely unique styles. 24! And the final page in that chapter is that exact same portrait as an outline you can photocopy to let you practice any of those techniques yourself. Some techniques demonstrated include tonal patterns, regular/irregular weaves, basket weaves, scales, bubbles, wood patterns, feathering, merging/radiating lines, hatching/crosshatching, waves, zig-zags, loops, dots, engraving effects and random scribbling...Whew... there are too many to list but hopefully it gives an idea of the diversity this book demonstrates.There is a chapter on various loose pen-stroke techiques and exercises. Exercises such as how to handle an outline (some ex: tight &amp; thin, thick to thin, missing edges). The next chapter is on tight pen techniques &amp; exercises.My favorite chapter is titled Color and the Technical Pen. It shows page after page of color technical pen work. The first color piece shown is of a beautiful dragon with a Celtic style border and it was all done with technical pens filled with colored inks! Other demonstrations and examples shown have the technical drawing done first and then painted later with acrylics or watercolor or ink dyes.Overall this is a stunning book. It is crammed full of artwork from pen &amp; ink artists, how-to exercises and tidbits. Anyone wanting to become more proficient with pen &amp; ink NEEDS this book."},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"If you love the subject of pen &amp; ink, you'll no doubt love this book. It contains one of the most thorough collection of basic pen strokes, and an impressive variety of styles: from simple portraits to highly elaborate fantasy art. One of my favorite parts is showing how a drawing shall look incorporating a variety of different pen strokes with each of 24 renderings. This chapter concludes with a reproducable sketch that can be used by the student to explore the exercises. A book replete with examples and exercises. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"Very helpful. When I bought this book I hadn't used a technical pen in over 12 years (since high school art class). So, I needed some thorough instruction on techniques and materials. I am glad that this is the book that I got. It covers a wide variety of different strokes and includes many examples of how they can be used. The color stuff is pretty cool too.I looked at many other books on the technical pen. This is the best one that I found which is devoted to tech pen work. (Other books had chapters devoted to using ink with brushes and metal nibs - which is also cool if your interested). If you are looking for a book full of info on just the tech pen though, then I would highly recommend this one.It was written in the early 90's, so the one thing I found is that there are some inks available at my local art store that probably didn't exist back in 1990. Therefore, the book doesn't have any information on them.The author seems to have a preference for the Kohinoor Rapidograph brand pens, which are still widely available today and work great. The early portion of the book has very detailed information on filling, cleaning , and maintaining the pens. It is very helpful and much more detailed then the instructions that the Kohinoor pens come with.Great choice!"},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"The book is just plain awesome. Besides taking the time to explain how to care for the technical pen, how to do the different strokes, and what type of beginner mistakes to be aware of, the artwork is the best pen work I've ever seen. If you work with pen and ink, or even if you don't, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"This book is simply amazing! Author Gary Simmons has delivered a perfectly organized and extremely informative book on the techniques of the technical pen.

I would recommend this book to anyone (all skills levels)interested in learning how to draw with ink"},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"This is one of the first books I picked up on the topic of Technical Pen illustration. The author (who is apparently known for his work with equine illustrations in pen and ink) is quite accomplished and provides a great introduction to the technical pen and its many uses in art. Decidedly missing much on the lines of brushwork in ink (not watercolor, of course) and it's possibilities, but, then, this is a book on the technical pen (not the brush). I rate this 4 stars because not enough time is spent identifying many of the basic styles and the author tends to stray from style to style in his illustrations. This makes for confusing stylization (ie: shifting from parallel line to scross-hatch to stipple) for the beginning technical pen artist."},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"This book is one of the best I have seen for examples of pen and ink work and styles. I recommend it to anyone interested no matter what level of expertise you are at. This is a great reference book that no artist should be without!!"},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"Of the 15 or so art instruction books I've bought over the last few months, this is one of my favorites. This is ironic, since I originally was turned off somewhat by the subject matter and/or style of many of the works inside (nothing wrong with it, just not my particular cup-o-tea).However, on deeper consideration I realized that Simmons offers really great instruction on the use of technical pen, so who cares whether one likes the artwork itself. Take for example the \\"monk\\" drawing that is depicted on the cover. I don't care for the drawing at all, no matter how it's rendered. However, this drawing is used to demonstrate a couple dozen rendering options, and these renderings are a great teaching tool.Simmons spends plenty of time on the technical details of using a technical pen for both tight and loose rendering, and that's what makes this book great."},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"This book is the best I've read on the subject so far.

It is a perfect companion book to Guptill's \\"Rendering in Pen and Ink: The Classic Book On Pen and Ink\\". This book has great information on the care and use of the Technical Pen and has more imaginative examples of pen and ink than Guptills more traditional (but, none the less beautiful and important) works. This book also has more on the \\"process\\" of doing an initial pencil outline,choosing pen strokes and building up patterns to create a drawing. It includes a section of problems to avoid with pen strokes and tones etc. which was very helpful to me. I would have never thought of using the patterns the author used to render some of the drawings. I look forward to playing with these in my own drawings. I would recommend getting both of these books and you should have all you need for a really good foundation in pen and ink."},{"Title":"The Technical Pen","review":"Sadly, because it is the best pen and ink book ever!

Although he ignores much of the Cantonese-style cooking that is prevalent in many Chinese cookbooks available in the US, his information is traditional, accurate, and all of the 10 or so recipes I've tried so far have been good. Ingredients such as tofu, oyster sauce, malt sugar, five-spice powder, and Sichuan peppercorns are presented individually with Chinese characters, Pinyin, English, and Latin (for the plants) and photographs of the ingredient and recipes and photos of one or two representative dishes. There's also information provided on how the ingredient grows or is produced or packaged, what it looks and tastes like, how to buy and store it, some basic medicinal uses,...and recipes! I like to use the book in combination with Nina Simonds' and Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's books--taking the best of each."},{"Title":"The Chinese Kitchen: A Book of Essential Ingredients with Over 200 Easy and Authentic Recipes","review":"I have always enjoyed Deh Ta-Hsiung's recipes. They are simple to follow &amp; difficult to get wrong, even for a novice cook like me! The recipes he shares range from tasty family dishes to making your own Peking duck or roasting your own barbeque pork which are difficult to come by in most Chinese cook books. Mr Deh also takes time to explain how different types of ingredients come together, and offers to the uninitiated, methods of preparing an ingredient, and photographs which makes me want to dog-ear all the pages with the recipes I plan to try! Most of all, Deh's cooking leads to the most authentic tasting Chinese food!I'm glad the author has finally released an US edition!My only complaint is there just aren't enough recipes!"},{"Title":"The Chinese Kitchen: A Book of Essential Ingredients with Over 200 Easy and Authentic Recipes","review":"This book presents all the basic ingredients for a Chinese kitchen.

It's a treatise on the ingredients that go into Chinese cooking, an encyclopedia of what goes into the food and how to find it, how to use it, and where it comes from. I found it delightful reading, and I can now go to the local markets without always feeling that I have no idea what I'm looking at. I bought it as a gift for my son, read it before handing it over, and think I'm probably going to have to get one for myself. It's beautiful to look at, too."},{"Title":"The Chinese Kitchen: A Book of Essential Ingredients with Over 200 Easy and Authentic Recipes","review":"Chinese Cuisine goes way beyond cooking: it's a gastronomical philosophy in itself. What to eat when, how and why. One has to realize this if the goal is something other than fixing chop suey or egg foo young (which by the way, are not Chinese!). If so, this is the book to start with. Take it along to the supermarket if you have to. Check out every spice and tool before buying. And then start cooking and enjoy yourself.

In this entry you get a good explanation of the ingredient (where it comes from, what it's history is - which is great because Chinese cooking is more about the story of the food than just eating tasty food) followed by a recipe or two featuring each ingredient.As a person who does not have the books suggested pantry, it would've been quite difficult for me to assemble the pantry and would've been even more difficult to use all the food items listed given only one or two recipes. Also, it should be noted that there are some ingredients that you WILL NOT find in American groceries or your local Asian market - such as Shark fin for Shark fin soup or the bird nests for Bird Nest Soup. While I find the process and history of each of these dishes interesting I will never make these dishes because 1) the ecological implications and 2) the absence of a market for the required ingredients.I would summarize as follows:Pros: The colorful pictures of every dish, the detail of each ingredient, the layout by ingredient (I'm on the fence because I like that all are arranged by ingredient, but it's also hard to plan when you want to use an ingredient, but need a main course/side dish).Cons: low ratio of recipes to ingredient (1:1 or 2:1), suggested pantry contains many uncommon ingredients, some recipes in the book cannot be made in American kitchens."},{"Title":"The Chinese Kitchen: A Book of Essential Ingredients with Over 200 Easy and Authentic Recipes","review":"I quite often enjoy browsing through this book. A great selection of Chinese culinary ingredients are described and the extensive pictures which accompany each entry are excellent. Some ingredients are discussed in a single page, others in two, while a few, such as rice, merit four whole pages. There is a good description of every item, a recipe or two illustrating its use, information on storage and handling, and good information on the general function of the entry as both a food and a medicine. I especially appreciate that the book lists the Chinese characters for each ingredient along with the pronunciation in parentheses. Unfortunately, one criticism I have is that the pronunciation provided is sometimes Cantonese and sometimes Mandarin and the transliteration is decidedly non-standard... Gong Bao Chicken, for instance, is given in the common restaurant rendering, 'Kung Pao Chicken'.I also have to say that most of the recipes provided are really not that particularly interesting... As this is not a recipe book, though, I did not particularly care but I was very surprised when I recently purchased another book by this author, and found the same thing again - great pictures but mediocre recipes!Still... as I say, I did not buy this book as a recipe book and I love flipping through its pages.

I am currently trying to identify, for example, a ship from a photograph which shows part of her name (in Russian!) at the stern and a curious funnel motif which appears to show the capital letters \\"S\\" and \\"Y\\" superimposed over each other. Consequently, I purchased this book in the hope of being able to find that particular logo.The book itself is a moderately useful research tool but does have a very limited application. The book's first 48 pages reveal twenty squares on each page arranged into a grid with each box containing a small colour rendition of a shipping company's flag and funnel beneath which is the name of that company. 955 companies are represented in this fashion but sadly - as far as I was concerned, none depict that \\"S\\" and \\"Y\\" logo!These are followed by 26 pages where the companies are listed alphabetically with a cross reference back to their specific flag and funnel. No other comment or information is included.Many of my own favourites are here - such as the Anchor, Moller and Oldendorff Lines. That said, the book was published over 50 years ago and any changes or new companies after that date will not be found.NM"},{"Title":"War on the Saints","review":"War on the Saints was a gift some 20 years ago. It was a battle just to read it. I gave a copy to a spiritual friend who placed it on the dash of his truck, but was able to read only 6 pages within 5 months.

When you begin to read you will get sleepy; the phone and the doorbell will ring forever; you'll get a headache; your eyes will blur, you will be supplied with hundreds of \\"reasonings\\" that you don't need to read it, etc.Most Christians are not aware of being in a spiritual war, but God has given us this sweetheart of spiritual warfare, Jesse Penn-Lewis, to whom He has revealed devilish tactics (2 Corinthians 2:11). While reading War on the Saints, you will get angry when you discover how many times the devil has duped you as well as your loved ones and the body of Christ. The awakening will be like finding yourself naked in the midst of a packed house at Madison Square Garden. But you will become strong in the Lord.The Army teaches us to begin \\"hand to hand\\" combat in the onguard position. So, I challenge you to strap on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18). We have authority over all the devil's power \\"and nothing shall by any means hurt us\\" (Luke 10:19).

This book also gives in-depth explanations why Christians can easily become demon possessed. It is futuristic, it reads like a book from the 21st century, therefore I deeply believe this book to be written by the hand of GOD.

It has belonged to the people, and it has also been the symbol of monarchy and supreme power. The dragon was a mythical beast. It was a concept. But most Chinese people, indeed most Asian people, were convinced that it existed. There are many occasions when there were claims that it had been seen, even as recently as 1920. No other creature in the world could have produced such a far-reaching influence on the mind of man.Unlike the European dragon, it was considered a beneficent beast, until the Buddhists introduced the concept of evil dragons. Yet the basic belief was always that it had noble spiritual qualities that were unconquerable.This book has been written by an author who has lived for many years in China researching into its history. It is in an easy-to-read style and is dedicated to the dragon and its many offshoots and variations. The pictures are delightful. It gives details of what a dragon was, where it was used, and what it was called. The reader will become more acquainted with the dragon, and will gain a greater understanding of this magnificent beast. It will interest and please the serious student and the enthusiastic Chinaphile alike.It would make a perfect Christmas present."},{"Title":"Chinese Dragons (Images of Asia)","review":"This book, though short, provides a remarkably detailed survey of the Chinese dragon as represented in the art of his native land. Beginning with an overview of early dragon representations and possible sources of inspiration, Mr. Bates' book goes to considerable effort to describe the many variant images and beliefs that may be found regarding dragons throughout China. I have a hard time finding the kind of information brought together here - dragons in architecture, dragons as represented on dragon robes, the beings and images popularly represented as sons of the dragon - anywhere other than highly specialized scholarly tomes. Finding as much as Mr. Bates has put forth in Chinese Dragons in such an accessible volume is a remarkably pleasant surprise. The twenty-four colour plates are just about worth the price of admission all by themselves. The author clearly knows and loves his subject."},{"Title":"Chinese Dragons (Images of Asia)","review":"This is a fascinating book, and I concur with the other reviewers.

The first four heroes relive the lives of Adam, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad respectively, and the fifth hero represents modern science and technology. I give it only 4 stars, because the translation needed to be revised - and was, asChildren of Gebelaawi.

If this book is not definitive, it is about as close as any Andrews Sisters book is likely to get.The only major missing element of this history is the lack of participation by the surviving Sister, Patty, who apparently did not respond to requests for an interview for this project. This lack of input from Patty is significant but the author provides key insights from many contemporaries close to the Sisters.The price tag is a bargain for anyone interested in the best female vocalists of the 20th Century, their times, their struggles, their success and their joyous legacy of brassy, vibrant popular music.

His thesis is that social institutions can best be explained as the outcome of social conflict among rational actors seeking to maximize their utility (benefits) in the form of distributional advantages over others.Traditionally, social institutions have been explained by referring to the collective benefits they provide to society. But the author argues that while some institutions are necessary to coordinate activity, there are many ways to structure institutions to accomplish certain aims. The real question is why some institutions have developed rather than others. The author concludes that an explanation can be found only in the different distributional consequences alternative instiutions provide.I really thought I was going to enjoy this book. The literature on New Institutional Economics is great because in presenting their theses, the authors also survey the existing literature on the subject. This book did this in the beginning, but the argument became a bit weak and tedious toward the end. His chapter on spontaneous emergence turned out to be a bit weak, much as I was looking forward to reading it, and his long chapter on the theory of social conflict was really just a restatement of some of the arguments contained in the introduction.The argument in this book is really fascinating, and one that should be explored further by others. But the execution and writing of this book turned out to be a bit weak."},{"Title":"Institutions and Social Conflict (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)","review":"Knight applies a rational choice approach to explain how social institutions emerge and change. He contends that social institutions emerge as the result of social conflict between actors with differing interest and power asymmetries. As such, the gains from interaction between players are not equitably distributed. According to Knight, social institutions are a way for \\"some to constrain the actions of others with whom they interact\\" (19). Institutional development stems from the on-going social conflict between actors with competing interests. The motivation behind social institutions is not social efficiency, Pareto optimality, stability, or any other collective benefit. Social outcomes results from institutional rules reflect the self-interested motivations of individuals. Individuals will seek institutional structures that best serve their strategic interest. As such, we need to \\"look to the distributional consequences of those institutions\\" in order to decipher their origins. So, actors create institutions to gain strategic advantage in interactions. The question becomes, how did such actors gain this power to create the institutions most conducive to their strategic interests? Knight contends that the explanation stems from asymmetries over resources which in turn leads to asymmetries in bargaining power.Social outcomes are the result of interdependent action. In order for a strategic actor to make choices in pursuit of his maximized utility, he must be able to form expectations regarding the behavior of others. These expectations are formed by institutions in that they provide information and sanctions. Once expectations are formed regarding the behavior of others, the strategic actor can select strategies that he feels will maximize his utility. This implies that institutions shape future behavior and that information and sanctions constrain the choices of the interacting players.Knight writes, \\"Put simply, if self-interested actors want institutional arrangements that favor them as individuals, they will prefer institutional rules that constrain the actions of others with whom they interact. That is, they will want to structure the choices of others in such a way as to produce social outcomes that give them distributional advantage\\" (164).Knight's origins for institutions stems first from the informal norms and rules that reflect existing power asymmetries in society. These interactions are governed by asymmetries in resources between players. We can think of a strong player (A) and a weaker player (B). Player (A) can create institutions that constrain their future choices. If these constraints are credible, it limits the subsequent choices of the weaker player (B) to those that are preferable to (A). Additionally, because (A) has less to lose from a breakdown in coordination they are less willing to negotiate towards a more equitable equilibrium. (A) is able to have longer time horizons than (B). Furthermore, (A) may have power to credibly threaten (B) to select the equilibrium which (A) prefers.In short, it becomes rational for (B) to follow the rules posed by (A) because in doing so, (B) attains the most benefits it can hope to achieve. So what we see is the formation of institutions stemming from micro-interactions.The next step, once the actors achieve a credible equilibrium is to institutionalize these rules, \\"generalizing these constraints as rules governing the community as a whole\\" (139-140). This occurs when the \\"social actors recognize that the committed strategies have become socially anticipated action and realize that compliance with them is their best response to the actions of others\\" (140).We see (1) distributional inequalities emerging as a consequence of informal rules, (2) which in turn leads to systematic asymmetries of power, which (3) becomes institutionalized through \\"a network of common and repeated social interactions\\" (145).Changes occur when asymmetries of power change. This could be from exogenous shocks to the system, unexpected distributional effects in the long-term, changes in actors bargaining power, etc."},{"Title":"Remember the Rock","review":"This is a marvelous overview regarding the last days of the Rock Island Railroad. There is a chapter at the end entitled \\"Farewell Decorah\\". This intrigued me since I am a train buff living in that idyllic northeast Iowa college town."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The knot of this novel is a moral dilemma: should we follow the right path fate seems to have decided for us, or should we do what we really want to do? Both alternatives have consequences, for good and bad. There are moments in life when we have to make difficult decisions which will change our life in a definitive way. This is what happens to the central characters in this novel. The plot is simple: Chad Newsome, a wealthy young man from Massachussetts, has been having the good life for too long now in Paris. His mother and sister (the father has died) have the terrible suspicion that he is living in &quot;sin&quot; with a wicked Parisian. So Mrs. Newsome sends his 50-something fianc&eacute;e Strether to look for him and bring him home. Only if he succeeds will Mrs. Newsome consent to marry him. So old Strether goes to Paris, finds the guy, tells him right away his intentions, and then nothing happens for months. Except, that is, for betrayals, switching alliances, a lot of gossip, parties, misunderstandings, and so on. Strether, a self-aware man, realizes little by little that he doesn't want to go back to New England for all the money in the world, and Mrs. Newsome has some, and also that Chad is no longer a spoiled kid , and that neither he wants to go back very much. The tension of the novel is built up little by little, in twisted, malicious and nuanced conversations that occur between all the characters. In the end, Strether resolves his moral dilemma somehow.Much is said about James' prose going way over the top here in his overworked style. It's true, but nonetheless it is perfectly suited to the place, environment, plot and characters of his novel. It is certainly not an easy reading, but I did like it. James is really a master creator of athmospheres, of conversations and of subtleties. This is a novel to be read slowly, little by little, as the plot evolves gradually and without sudden jumps. If you like to appreciate the full potentialities of the English language at its most complex beauty, as a plus to a hard moral dilemma and splendid scenarios, try this novel, with patience."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Kind of in response to the highly understandable review above, I'd like to state that this book is in fact enjoyable, and not as much of a drag as the other reader makes it sound like. It is however very eloquent and artistic, and should therefore not be read purely for the enjoyment of the story, but also for the language used. The language itself is part of the story, and thats why it would be good for you to buy this critical edition. It will explain exactly how this is so, and will probably lead you to understand and appreciate the book much better. So even though the reader above is not wrong, I think it is a highly superficial argument, and I urge all of you people interested enough in prose and literature to buy this book nevertheless."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Poor quality print. Hard to read and expensive. Disappointed of amazon will sell a book that looks like someone bonded together pages copied from an old book with lots of writing and notes in it. This is not a book. This is a note book with a fancy cover."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"THE AMBASSADORS is the story of Lambert Strether, a middle-aged man dispatched to Paris by the wealthy widow Mrs. Newsome - a woman Strether hopes to marry and thereby assure his comfort in old age - to retrieve her son Chad. No one has heard from the boy for some time, which has given everyone the illusion that he has been ensnared by loose women and the bohemian lifestyle of Europe. Strether is tasked to inform Chad that if he gives up Paris now, and returns home to respectibility and to run the family business, he stands to gain enormous wealth. Unfortunately for those back home, Strether immediately experiences an existential crisis upon landing on Europe's shores, one which propels him to evaluate his own life as poorly lived, and which, on finally encountering Chad, opens his eyes to the fact that, rather than having fallen into corruption, the lad has matured quite well during his stay.What follows from this may loosely be termed a comedy of manners, albeit a very droll one, although I think that the conventions of that category are simply the framework that James uses to get across his larger points, which boil down to the particular sort of mid-life crisis that Strether experiences, as well as the admonition to 'live all you can.' As Strether feels as though he has missed that train himself, he speaks of it to another young character, hoping to impart the wisdom that 'it doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what _have_ you had?' No spoilers; this occurs before the mid-point of the book, though a similar incident taken from real life was James' inspiration for the novel. From there, THE AMBASSADORS recounts the minute changes in Strether's character as Europe and Paris continue to work on him, even in the face of reinforcements sent from home - sent because Mrs. Newsome has decided that Lambert may no longer be the man for the job.The most salient point in any discussion of THE AMBASSADORS is the ridiculously difficult prose of Henry James. The main question, to my mind, is not whether it is worth it in the end, but does it in any way meaningfully contribute to the ideas within the novel - does it elicit nuance that would be lost in plainer speech? I suppose that question is as subjective as any other; if it adds to the book's charm for readers, then that may enable the rest of the author's ideas to resonate in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise - but personally I'm on the fence as to whether James' style added or detracted. I thought it was devilishly hard to pierce, and while I freely admit to the possibility that I may have missed particular shades of meaning that would have elevated the book even further, I do feel fairly certain that I was able to puzzle most of it out.There are very few dramatic events on which to rest the narrative though. Most of the characters are so guarded with their comments and true feelings - hamstrung, no doubt, by their sense of propriety by turn of the century standards - that it can be hard to discern immediately whether or not someone actually admitted to something that advances the story, or at least in some way illuminates more of the intrigues between the players. For a nearly four hundred page novel, there is almost no action at all. Of course, that isn't really the objective - instead it is detailing the change in Lambert Strether over the course of the novel, and by doing so in such a meticulous manner, the reader is able to identify with much of his confusion and learning processes as he maneuvers through the currents of society.There were two important aspects I took away from the book, though whether those were a result of the additional attention I was forced to bring to bear because of the book's style, I can't say. The first was the utter straight-jacketing of these character's lives due to the forms and conventions of their time. And whether true or not, James' picture of this society is one dominated by women - at times frustratingly so for this reader. I wanted to yank Lambert up by the collar and tell him to quit letting himself get pushed around by these ladies. He did so, eventually, though in his own way, which was never as strident as I would have liked it to be.The other spot I noted, and appreciated, was at a chapter near the end of the book, where Strether, realizing his time in Europe is drawing to a close, takes a day trip out to the French countryside. In this instance, I do tend to attribute the peculiar charm of this interlude to James' method - I found this chapter most effective and affecting; beautiful, actually, though I suspect it wouldn't have been so if James hadn't prepared me, so to speak, for his way of rendering it with the previous material.Although these two impressions seemed uppermost to me, I quite enjoyed the novel all around, though I'm not such a cynic that I didn't wish for a different ending to the relationship between Lambert and Miss Gostrey. Perhaps James thought that that would have cheapened the overall theme, I don't know. I am also unsure as to whom I would recommend the book. Considered a masterpiece by many, and even listed on Modern Library's top 100 novels of the twentieth century, it is definitely one of the most difficult books _I've_ ever read. I suspect the book itself will cast the deciding vote - as Leon Edel says in the introduction to the edition I have: 'There are readers for whom certain books will always remain closed; and others for whom the same books cannot be opened too often.' The best I think I can suggest is that if you were to try the first few pages and find it to your liking, and also were able to muster up the fortitude to venture on, then I'm confident you'll find it a rewarding experience.At any rate, here at the end, I am split on how to rate the novel - as one I 'liked' or one I 'loved'. Usually in these cases I flake out and rate them four-and-a-half stars, since I try to reserve five for fiction so extraordinary that it changes the way I think about its subject. Here though I think I'll take a stand - demanding, affecting, and thoughtful, THE AMBASSADORS is a novel I'm certain to remember for a long time, and also one I can see returning to again, should time last so long. Five Stars.(And thanks to my Amazon friend H. Schneider, whose previous reviews of James' work convinced me to read this one.)"},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"This is surely one of the great works of literature.

I have read several of his books, from the atrocious Portrait of a Lady and the even worse Washington Square to the bland muddle of The Awkward Age and The Spoils of Poynton. The Turn of the Screw was all right, if only because the subject matter seemingly inadvertantly held my interest. The Wings of the Dove I actually remember liking, but I can't say that I remember much else about it. So it is with The Ambassadors, another terrifically engaging book that I will forget all of the characters names tomorrow.It really is a pretty good book, written, frankly, with a brilliance I have yet to encounter in this over-rated author's ouevre. It is beautifully written: psychologically acute and even at times interesting in spite of itself. The characters are all--and that includes every one of them, from the fleeting passersby to the central focus--astutely articulated creations. The trouble is that they all seem to be less human than cogs in the machine James called 'narrative'.This can get annoying the deeper one gets into it: everything and everyone is a set piece, a prop thrown out there to move the story along instead of giving the reader the idea that these are real people having things happen to them.This is not--not by a long stretch--the book an initiate should enter James with. That being said, however, this is (and I imagine will remain) my favorite of all his books. It is really quite moving when the point (frequently hammered home to us) is made aware to the primary characters. I am tempted to proclaim that I give this book four and a half stars because there was about a 200 page stretch in the middle when I was throughly and completely engaged in the story. Be that as it may, I round it down to four because I really, still, don't like Henry James . . ."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"There, is that praise faint enough for you? Yes, I found &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; a great deal more readable than James' novel of the year before, but that's not to say I have any great love for this one. Henry James seriously needed to write about something other than European sophistication contrasted with American naivety and crudity (how many times can you tell the same story?), but this novel does tackle that theme about as well as James was ever going to.I have nothing against people who like James' writing; each to his own. But I don't know that I've ever read an author whose style has annoyed me more. People praise James for his pychological complexity and his mastery of subtext. His novels certainly are full of subtext; it's practically overflowing the pages. But a novel that's all subtext is no better than one that wears its agenda on its sleeve. I understand the influence James had on literature. He acted as a kind of bridge between the moral simplicity of the Victorians and the more psychologically ambiguous writing of the Modernists. But as with many literary figureheads, knowing and understanding his influence does not necessarily make him enjoybable to read."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"This book is horrid.

I loved other Henry James, so this one must be just too difficult."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The Ambassadors, by Henry James is a book that straddles the styles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It concerns the plight of the ridiculously-named Lambert Strether, sent from America to Paris to recover the wayward son of a wealthy family. Strether, who, by his own admission, is a failure, looks forward to his marriage (which I found unbelievable) with his boss, the matriarch of the family, if he is successful in bringing Chadwick home. However, while abroad he succumbs to the unemployed, carefree lifestyles of the Americans in Paris of which number Chad is included. Although a third person narrative, all events are filtered through the somewhat dim-witted Strether. Despite very difficult passages with almost endless parenthetical clauses, and such sentences as \\"...the greatest divergence from which would be precisely the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by levity,\\" the interested reader will become aware of the reality of situations well before Strether. Strether's conversion from American idiot to bohemian is unconvincing. He finds Chadwick \\"improved\\" without being able to explain why (Strether is impressed that Chadwick knows how to enter a box seat at a theater - that about sums up the best Strether can say about the young man), he quickly befriends Miss Gostrey without reason (H. James admit that Gostrey is mostly a device to allow for explanation where Strether fails), and is charmed by Madame de Vionnet despite an obviously illicit affair. It takes Mr. Strether endless amounts of thought to figure out the simplest things. This novel has little reward for the persistent.The introduction by Kyle Patrick Smith in this Barnes & Noble version is nevertheless insightful."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"This is flat out one of the greatest novels ever written, and it's more fun than any of James's other novels, too. It's nice that he thought such a pleasant book was his best.If the style is too much for you, wait till you can handle it. On the other hand, if you start out as I did fifty years ago with liking the puzzle and getting a kick out of it, then as you keep coming back it will get clearer and clearer. Meanwhile, on my fourth reread, I'm tremendously enjoying the humor on every page of the first three sections.Check this out: \\"Waymarsh had smoked of old, smoked hugely; but Waymarsh did nothing now, and that gave him the advantage over people who took things up lightly just when others had laid them heavily down.\\"Meanwhile, be advised: the theme, \\"Live all you can,\\" is laid out openly in the fifth of twelve sections, and is totally present from Section One. Maybe Paris isn't as bad as Americans think it is -- yes, that's the comic point, but it's not what the book builds up to; it's what the book starts out from. We are given the comedy of American Puritanism versus Parisian High Culture right from the start ... and THEN what happens?

Lambert Strether arrives in Liverpool and travels to Chester to discover that his friend, Philip Waymarsh, someone he is supposed to be meeting, is not present. He encounters Maria Gostrey who is to constitute a presence in a number of the novel's scenes.Eventually there is a threesome for dinner and in its aftermath an opportunity for Strether to visit with his friend Waymarsh who has been living separately from his wife for fifteen years. Miss Gostrey is a woman of fashion and Mr. Waymarsh can't stand Europe. Miss Gostrey and Strether share a sense that they are superior people and they are failures.For the first time in his life, Strether dines with a woman in a public place, Miss Gostrey, before going to a play. (Lambert Strether has been sent to Europe by Mrs. Newsome to retrieve her son, Chadwick Newsome, age twenty-eight. Strether edits a review in Woollett (MA) funded by Mrs. Newsome.Strether married young, his wife died, and ten years later his little son died of an illness at school. He regretted the sacrifice of school. He felt that he had banished and neglected his child. In Paris Strether ascertains that Chad is absent from Paris temporarily and does make a friend of Mr. Bilham, Chad's friend. Later Strether finds that Chad is easy-going and that he has been made-over in France. Chad claims he is not being kept in France by a woman, that he is not entangled. (Mr. Bilham speaks of a virtuous attachment.)Chad Newsome has a connection to Mme. de Vionnet and her daughter and Strether isn't sure what the nature of the connection is. Chad takes Strether to meet a famous artist and Strether wonders whether he has passed the test of being considered an interesting person. Miss Gostrey, recognizing Mme. de Vionnet, wishes to be kept out of the encounter of Strether with Mme. de Vionnet and her daughter, Jeanne. Maria Gostrey and Jeanne's mother had been schoolmates in Geneva. The Comte de Vionnet had been a brute. The couple lived apart and the wife had all the merit.Critics have spoken of a sagging middle in the novels of Henry James. Two issues arise. The first is that there does seem to be a period of waiting, (of spinning), when the hero tries to determine what reality his search has revealed and what action must be undertaken. The second is that the rhythm accurately resembles real life. In other words, say, upon getting to the top of a mountain, one wonders what else there is to do or to anticipate. Contrary to an understandable readerly perception of Jamesian fog, there is hyper-lucidity and that circumstance is quite surprising (as a fruit of analysis). The book is mature James, produced in the same period as THE WINGS OF THE DOVE, and is excellent. Written in an indirect style, the novel is a comedy."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I read this book in a way I never read: slowly and deliberately, concentrating and drawing the words through my teeth, because, I swear, the words have flavor and meat. Yes, the sentence structures are not easily sorted out, and the story contains no high drama, only highly intelligent people with wit and culture to spare, trading subtle wit and threats with their best smiles pasted on. His characters don't live as we do, but move in an uniquely Jamesian world. James is infuriating, especially his genius works, this one, The Golden Bowl and Wings of the Dove, because his style is maddening. All I can say in support is that this book will not disappoint if you are seeking something challenging in a satisfying way. Also, buy this Norton edition because the typeface is really nice, good and tight and small, suited perfectly to the story."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I love Henry James, and generally find his novels worth the admittedly stenuous effort, but here there just isn't enough going on to justify the required time and effort. The central character is sympathetic in a pale sort of way, but he's not very interesting or perceptive, and this lack of perception becomes irritating when the whole novel is written from his point of view. The whole scenario is not very dramatic, which is unusual with James; generally there are real conflicts in his novels, even if they are hard to locate through the mists of his prose. The lack of conflict in this book makes the whole thing tedious, despite the intelligence and subtlety of the author."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The Portrait of A Lady by Henry James is as perfect as a novel can be, and long after reading it, I remain mesmerized by its perfection, which has me wanting to flay The Ambassadors for having the impertinence of being created by the same man.The writing in The Ambassadors---I read every word, slowly---reminds me of the story of the mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr., in the movie A Beautiful Mind, in which Mr. Nash is consumed by a madness of numbers. The numbers are all there, in his head, and he adores them, but is too absorbed by them to be able to get them out properly for another person's account. In the movie The Pillow Book, there is a scene where words are superimposed over the body of a woman to suggest that she is washing herself with them, as they are the objects of her devotion, the means to record life, the means of hanging on to moments. In The Ambassadors, Henry James strikes me as being overcome by an infatuation with words to no great account---words composed for love of them without giving lyrical effect, clarity, or shape to a story or characters.Artistry is making something perfect, communicating a personal vision, with all one's tricks, so that others get it clearly, perfectly---not being so personal that the creation hardly reaches anyone but the creator, and, in the case of The Ambassadors's main character, Strether, not being so personal that his fascinations are chiefly fascinating to him. Overly many words in The Ambassadors give reverence and eternity to a moment, a thought, or the delicate ascertainment of motive, but the reverence is not remembered as much as the roughness in going through so many words, obscurely put, to reach understandings that are not great enough or numerous enough to make the effort fulfilling. The novel should have been shortened by at least one-third.Allusions in the novel's narration and dialogue are chronic, creating a deliberate vagueness without building a sufficient quantity of impressions to keep one from finally being exasperated that all one has met is a pile of words in which only James is bathing luxuriantly. Using too many words to tell too little has James repeating, too often, what long ago was implied or expressed. At story's end, little more is known than what one suspected at the beginning. Obviousness in a plot is not fatal, as demonstrated by William Shakespeare, who sets out characters and purposes straight-off in most of his plays and then proceeds through the details with magnificence, large points being told clearly with the fewest words in the prettiest arrangement. In getting to the end of his story, James does not add much of interest, but confounds by having one unsure, too often, what language intended, whether in describing a thing or a person or a motive. Throughout, something that is imputed to one person seems capable of being imputed to any of the characters, which might be alright if it led to discovery eventually. The work in determining something as simple as who or what was meant by the words \\"he,\\" \\"she,\\" \\"this,\\" or \\"it\\" was not worthy of the gain.Subtly leading a reader to an impression appeals to me, but finally there has to be impression. Gore Vidal is a master of subtlety and clarity. Everything he tells me subtly seems to be absorbed by me clearly. In The Ambassadors, James has me arguing through language that did not tell me enough to provide delight from comprehension, in contrast to his writing in The Portrait of A Lady, where subtly there is a building of Isabel Archer's personality so that one sees her from above, from below, from the sides, and straight through without quite knowing how one got to know her in the round except through magic.Long, controlled, and clear sentences are to be adored, and so is repetition, which is the key to learning. James's sentences in The Ambassadors are long, controlled, and too often unclear, and rather than gathering to clarity, they annoy as nonsense for requiring so much work from the reader for so little. In The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin's masterpiece of clarity, it is clear that Darwin cannot write except by way of long sentences, but his sentences on matters obscure and subtle are commanding, so clear that they make light work out of something difficult in other hands. And throughout, Darwin is repetitive in a delightful way, reinforcing and accumulating knowledge so that you are drawn into his view of the world if only because you want to be drawn by someone who has expressed his view so clearly and perfectly, with dedication.And dedication is what my most favourable impression of The Ambassadors is---the dedication of the main character, Strether, to figuring out motives and making what he regards as the right choices. In this way, Strether reminded me of the determination of Michel de Montaigne and Charles Darwin to working hard to figure out the motives of life, determination that inspires awe, except that Montaigne and Darwin saw themselves through their words clearly and Strether, while making decisions and figuring things out, did so only with words that leave the reader with more sensations of the unclear than the things figured out."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"It took me three tries to make it through the novel; at last, while traveling, I got far enough in to swing me through. The text alternates btw dense, syntactically complex descriptions of the protagonist's psychology and light, allusive dialogue in which he talks to the other characters about everyone else's psychology. Very little happens except thinking and talking by Americans in Paris. You fall under the spell of the subtlety and your own ability to just barely keep up -- just as Strether does when he first meets the subtle Maria. The endnotes disappoint because the one thing in the sentence that doesn't need explaining is the French word which the note glosses.James tells rather than shows. He beautifully and repeatedly tells that Chad has become truly civilized in Paris, although from all we see this mainly consists of his calling his stepfather-to-be &quot;my dear man.&quot; But telling seems to work for James.James's overall trick -- in this, Portrait and Washington Square -- is to set up a morally complex situation, then show that it was all along a simple and severe morality tale, but enriched by how we reacted before we learned that. Here Strether goes to rescue Chad from living in sin with a French hussy, and at the end learns that essentially, after all, Chad has been doing just that. The puritans were right; Chad's savoir faire is French wickedness, though it is also everything rich and wonderful that we imagined it before."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"What is the point of writing, other than to communicate? In \\"The Ambassadors,\\" I feel James failed to do so much of the time. There were sentences and entire passages I read, and reread, and read yet again, and even again, but still didn't quite understand. However, I finished the novel with a sense, however vague, of having been through something with Lambert Strether, a man I grew to admire. There were probably subtleties I missed, but perhaps a second reading, someday, will fill it all out for me. Would it have been any less an artistic achievement if James had expressed himself more clearly, as his earlier works show he could do very well? I think it would have been even better, but even though this is a tough one to get through, and not for wimpy readers, it's worth the effort in the end."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Henry James (1843-1916) was American born but spent most of his life in Europe. Henry was the brother of the philosopher Willam (the author of \\"The Varieties of Religious Experience) and a famous philosopher father. He is one of the greatest authors of American/British literature (HJ became a British citizen five months before his death).The Ambassadors is one of the three final gems of novels written by James. The other two masterpieces are\\"The Wings of a Dove\\" and his final novel \\"The Golden Bowl.\\" All of these novels are densely written with long complicated paragraphs, frequent use of foreign language quotations and psychological probes into the minds of the chief protagonists of the works. In our age of texting and internet jargon a James novel is a challenge to the eyes of 21st century readers!The Ambassadors deals with the fiftyish and bookish Lambert Strether. Strether is engaged to Mrs. Newsome a solid society widow living in splendor in a small New England town. Strether is supposed to travel to Paris in hopes of enticing Mrs. Newsome's son Chadwick to return home where he will be put in charge of the family business. (this business in never specified). Strether becomes enamored of beautiful Paris where he is warmed by the personality of Marie Gostrey and male friends such as Wayland and Little Bilham. James is good at evoking the sights and sounds of Paris. Strether believes Chad and Madame Vionnette are involved in a platonic relationsip. She is ten years older than Chad who has a daughter she is hoping to marry to a rich man.When Strether fails to persuade Chad to return home, Mrs. Newsome sends her starchy and obese daughter Sarah Pocock and her bovine dull witted husband to Paris. They bring along Mamie the sister of Mrs. Pocock as bait to induce Chad to leave Europe for America. Will Chad return home? Will Strether ditch Mrs. Newsome for a new love?These are some of the questions this novel asks as its simple plot (explained in James' unique convoluted and verbose style) seeks to resolve.The Jamesian themes include:1. Innocent and naive Americans dealing with European customs and an old civilization2. The need to experience life to the full because we soon go the way of all flesh.3. The deceptions and secrets which lie underneath the surface of polite society.James deals with a small sliver of society. His focus is on the wealthy and we learn little of poor and ordinary people. The only time these folks appear is as servants to the toffs. James is a difficult author to love but he is well worth the effort. This is one of the greatest masterpieces from the fluid pen of the aging master whose cosy pre-World War I world of leisure and luxury was about to be ruined forever with the gunshots fired in Sarejvo."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"While Henry James' favorite of his own novels, The Ambassadors (1903), in my opinion as well as E.M. Forster's, doesn't quiet live up to the genius of The Wings of the Dove (1902) or even the earlier The Portrait of a Lady (1881). The familiar James themes are all there--the American abroad, American reactions to European culture, exploration of the terrain of the life unlived--but missing is the truly ecstatic prose and characters with remarkable psychological depth that distinguish the finest of James' works.The narrative follows \\"ambassador\\" Lambert Strether to Paris in pursuit of his widowed fianc&eacute;e, Mrs. Newsome's, son Chad--whom she believes to be romantically involved with an undesirable woman. Strether's mission is to extricate the wayward youth and return with him to Massachusetts directly. Once in Paris, however, Strether falls under the spell of the city and finds Chad refined rather than corrupted by its influence and that of his charming companion, Madame de Vionnet. The summer wears on with little correspondence between Strether and the Newsomes waiting at home. Impatient to see her son returned and suitably married, Mrs. Newsome sends yet another envoy, Chad's cynical sister Sarah Pocock, to confront the errant Chad and a Strether whose view of the world has changed profoundly. In the end, it is Strether who prevents Chad from returning to America.The highlight of the text is certainly Strether's speech to Chad's friend Little Bilham in Book Fifth, in which he gives voice to his new sense of things: \\"Live all you can; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what have you had? Do what you like so long as you don't make my mistake. For it was a mistake. Live!\\" It is an expanded vision of life, an affirmation that seems an appealing climax to Strether's confrontation with the realities of his circumstance. The sentiments of Strether's speech, however, are tested in the remaining two-thirds of the narrative."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The audiobook version of The Ambassadors makes the famously dense prose of Henry James easier (but not easy)to wade through. Most of the book consists of scenes in which two of the several principals meet to discuss the basic situation: whether or not a young New England manufacturing heir, Chad Newsome, can be persuaded to leave Paris--and his paramour, Madame de Vionnet--and return to his Mom in America.Everyone else is some kind of ambassador. Most prominently, Lambert Strether is Mom's fiancee and first ambassador. When he succumbs to the charms of Europe and Madame de Vionnet, more insulated ambassadors race over from America--Mom's daughter, Sarah, and son-in-law Jim--to try their luck, ineffectively, as it turns out, with the wayward Chad.The role of ambassador becomes more nuanced as various characters from Europe and America assume the role with each other in subtle ways. Strether, the most deeply explored and self-aware character, demonstratesan inner-ambassadorian way of managing his own conflicts and divided loyalties.All this takes place in slow motion over the course of three downloads.James structures each scene, or dialogue between two principals, by leap-frogging from the beginning of the scene to it's end, then back-tracking to reveal the middle. This seems to be consistent with his means-justifying-the end theme, in which the interesting thing is not how things wind up (which is unresolved in The Ambassadors), but how they get there."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I found this more or less unreadable.

But the payoff is worth the effort, however we may begrudge James' frustratingly and intentionally thick prose. James does indeed describe intense human situations in great depth and detail: duty, honor, nostalgia; the contrast between the starchy-collared stiffness of Brahmin Boston (read: America) contrasted with the joie de vivre of Paris (read: Europe); how difficult certain of life's choices can be. These are just a few themes that make this book worthwhile. James' America is young and trying to assert itself (and so takes itself too seriously); his Europe is old and satisfied (and perhaps doesn't take itself seriously enough).Lambert Strether, a fiftysomething turn-of-the-20th-century bourgeois Bostonian gentleman on an aristocratic lady's errand--she will not marry him until he convinces her son Chad to return to Massachusetts. We see his struggle with his uncomfortable position when he realizes Chad is no longer a spoiled young prep-schooler, but a young gentleman of increasing refinement and self-awareness. And if Strether is anything, by the way, he is one of the most supremely self-aware characters in literary history. Once that Paris air starts to play its magic with Strether himself, we are off to the races. Keeping in mind, of course, that with James' prose we are racing with tortoises. James invites us to ponder how many chances a person truly gets in this life to reinvent his or her self? And if we get the chance, do we always take it? How much should we weigh the consequences before we decide? How much are we willing to accept them after we have chosen?For similar themes with clearer, faster-paced, and wittier prose, try Edith Wharton's marvelous homage to James, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"This is a novel about a man named Strether, who is as obviously an alter ego of Henry James as Ralph Touchett is of Mr. James in Portrait of A Lady or, to jump continents and switch authors, the main character in Remembrance of Things Past is of Proust. Strether is in Paris to retrieve his (hopefully?) future son-in-law Chad from the wiles of the City of Light and return him to New England so that Strether can marry, settle down and pass his waning years in Puritan New England (New England was still Puritan at the time.). At least, that's the plan. But once Strether arrives, something happens to him, and that mysterious something is what makes this work great. One could easily sum it up and say that Strether becomes enraptured by beauty, and one would be quite right. But to do so would be to miss the point....What is beauty? This is the question the novel essentially asks, all plotting and sub-plotting (and plenty of it) aside. Strether's paralysis because of his inability to grasp what is holding him there and why he becomes one of the greatest procrastinators in English literature (not excepting a certain Danish prince) is the great theme around which all else revolves. Strether is essentially a sensitive, cultured man with hyper-refined sensibilities. Alighting in Paris from the drab New England factory town awakens things in him that can only be perceived through the mind's eye of such a man. He is a sort of Geiger counter which registers things missed by others not so equipped (i.e., the rest of the characters.) &quot;Strether had not for years so rich a consciousness of time-a bag of gold into which he constantly dipped for a handful.&quot; Ch.6 The beginning of Ch. 16 has a beautifully succinct line of his predicament, &quot;How could he wish it to be lucid for others, for any one, that he, for the hour, saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright, clean, ordered water-side life came in at the open window?&quot; Reasons, that is, to stay in beloved Paris. The denouement of the struggle between this sensibility and his deeply engrained New England morality becomes really beside the point. All the tergiversations and multiple reflections and subtle dialogue that convey the consciousness of a great soul constitute the book's undisputed prominence. I came away from the novel asking myself anew the question raised by Plato and other great philosophers and artists throughout history: What is beauty? What is the mysterious hold it has on us? And why do those who feel its power most acutely, such as Strether, suffer the most?"},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"If one were to choose just one novel from Henry James and say that this one is the quintessential example of a work that combines theme and style, one could do worse than to choose THE AMBASSADORS. James had a fascination with yanking Americans from their new world padded cells of insulation and transporting them to Europe, an old world that simply reeked of style and long held cultural givens. Lambert Strether is the ambassador of the title, an American who has grown up with typical American values, most of which relate to the Jamesian belief (often incorrect and exaggerated) that Americans were a breed of money mad social cretins who would not recognize class if they bumped into it. At the beginning of the novel, Strether is depicted as a basically good-hearted man who exists--but does not live--at least in the sense that he later comes to understand. It is he who is sent to London to retrieve a wayward Chad Newsome, a fellow American, son of the immensely wealthy Mrs. Newsome, who is eager for her son to return to America to take his rightful place as heir to the family fortune. In Europe, Strether is the fish out of water--at first. His job is to convert Chad or at least retrieve him from what Mrs. Newsome considers the clutches of a dissipated anti-Puritan and lascivious culture. But the conversion works in reverse. Lambert is affected by the openness of the European lifestyle, which compares refreshingly favorably to an American lifestyle that he now views as ponderous and stifling. He is further affected by a growing closeness with the target of his journey, Chad, a man that his mother assured Strether needed saving, but the only saving that Chad needs is to be saved from having to return to an America that will surely destroy Chad's new-found soul just as surely as it had stifled Strether's. Strether is finally affected by his relation with Mme. Marie de Vionnet, a lovely, elegant, and older European woman who is the girlfriend of Chad. This woman is another in a long line of Jamesian old-world icons of feminine exoticism who can seemingly float in mid air, so appealing is her capacity for infinite variety. Lambert concludes that she is RIGHT for Chad. Further, Europe is RIGHT for Chad, and finally, America is WRONG for Chad as well. By extension, Lambert learns the same lessons for himself. If he remains in Europe, he will suffer considerable sacrifice, not the least of which is that he has considered marrying Chad's mother, who suggests that at the successful conclusion to Lambert's journey, she will marry him, thus assuring him a share of her wealth. When Lambert delays in his mission, Mrs. Newsome sends yet another set of ambassadors, Chad's sister and her husband, both of whom prove invulnerable to the charms of Europe. Ironically, James shows that in the disreputable actions of the two in Europe (both engage in some tawdry behavior like drunken American sailors in a seedy Parisian saloon), that true class is a state of mind and not a function of where one hangs one's hat. At the end of the novel, James does not definitively wrap up all the loose ends. Presumably, Chad will eventually return to America--or perhaps not. Lambert will probably remain in Europe--or again perhaps not. Clearly, in THE AMBASSADORS, James leaves the door deliberately and ambiguously open, so that the resolution may need some unfolding after the words \\"the end.\\"Just as Henry James sets up a collision of cultural worlds in crisis, so does he do with a parallel collision of style in crisis. Many readers complain that James' style--ornate, ponderous, excessively prone to mutlti-pages of interminable dialogue--simply will not let them read a book that to them needs more plowing than reading. The problem here is that such readers have been taught to read conventional novels of slam-bang action, Hemingway-esque dialogue, and rapid pacing. In THE AMBASSADORS, James explores a different universe. His universe is the microverse, one is which most of the action is internalized. James wishes to unveil conscience and the intricacies of human dynamics. One might almost argue that the events in THE AMBASSADORS occur in real time. If it seems to take days to read, then perhaps that is the way that events occur in the fictional construct of any Jamesian novel. To read Henry James is to reread him as well. Just as human beings pause to use their memories of significant events to consider what to do for the future, so must the reader pause to reread passages to ponder past events. Thus, Henry James is one of the few authors (Proust is another) who has melded content to style. One does not read James merely to satisfy the requirements of a college class on the novel. One rereads James after the college class is over, and it is only then that one discovers the beauty of exploring the infinitely more beautiful world of the inner landscape over the outer."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Was there any American more European than Henry James? \\"The Ambassadors\\" begins in England and takes place mostly in Paris, and even though most of its characters are American, it is only referentially concerned with its author's native country. At the same time, the novel is not about Americans frivolously sowing their wild oats in exotic ancestral lands, but rather how they use their new settings to break away from restrictive American traditions and conventions and redefine their values and standards of living.The main character is a late-middle-aged widower named Lambert Strether who edits a local periodical in the town of Woollett, Massachussetts, and is a sort of factotum for a wealthy industrialist's widow named Mrs. Newsome, a woman he may possibly marry. Strether's latest assignment from Mrs. Newsome is to go to Paris to convince her son, Chad, to give up what she assumes is a hedonistic lifestyle and return to Woollett to marry a proper, respectable young lady, his brother-in-law's sister to be specific. There is a greater ulterior motive, too -- the prosperity of the family business relies on Chad's presence.In Paris, Strether finds that Chad has surrounded himself with a more stimulating group of friends, including a mousy aspiring painter named John Little Bilham, and that he is in love with an older, married woman named Madame de Vionnet. Providing companionship and counsel to Strether in Paris are his old friend, a retired businessman named Waymarsh, and a woman he met in England, named Maria Gostrey, who happens to be an old schoolmate of the Madame's. When it appears that Strether is failing in his mission to influence Chad, Mrs. Newsome dispatches her daughter and son-in-law, Jim and Sarah (Newsome) Pocock, and Jim's marriageable sister Mamie, to Paris to apply pressure. Ultimately, Strether, realizing that he's blown his chances with Mrs. Newsome and that Chad has the right idea anyway, finds himself enjoying the carefree life in Paris, which has liberated him from his lonely, stifling existence in Woollett.Not having cared much for James's previous work \\"The Wings of the Dove,\\" I felt something click with \\"The Ambassadors.\\" Maybe it's because I found the story a little more absorbing and could empathize with Strether; maybe it's because my reading skills are maturing and I'm learning to appreciate James's dense, oblique prose style.

Every other great novel I've read has dealt, in one way or another, with some weighty issue or theme; I feel The Ambassadors does not. Despite this I found myself mesmerized by its intricacies, its perpetual ability to surprise; yet I also frequently asked myself whether I cared enough about its subject matter to continue. In the preface James tells the reader that it's about a man who, late in life, reflects on what he's missed in his youth, and the possibility of recapturing it. This man, the main character, is Strether, who has been sent to Paris to bring back to New England the son of a wealthy widow he hopes to marry; if he fails to do so, his engagement falls through and the son loses a large chunk of his inheritance. The mission is viewed somewhat as a rescue since the son is believed to be ensnared in the throes of either an unsuitable woman or a dissipate lifestyle, or both. Europe, and especially Paris, awakens latent feelings in the provincial Strether, and what he discovers in Paris turns out to be full of surprises for him. Beyond this, I don't think it matters much what the novel is about - it seems to me that the broader one outlines it, the less palatable it appears. The novel is very subtle, and definitely the most dense and tedious of any I have read. I find the characters to be so intelligent and flawless in their manners that they become intimidating, oppressively so. I don't care about the outcome for any of them because I feel they lack humanity. It's as if regular people did not figure into James's universe.

You will feel every inch of being in Paris here, and, as well, the frustration and confusion of every lost soul in the story. Even the scared conformist characters are vividly drawn.

The Ambassadors of the title of the novel seem to be the group of Sarah, Jim and Mamie, who come to Europe later with the purpose of fetching Mr. Strether back for Mrs. Newsome. What occurs is a trial of manners and propriety with Mr. Strether encouraging Chad to stay on in Paris, France, with the advice of living life to the fullest rather than going back to America to a life of boredom and a stale marriage.

Still, one has the illusion of freedom; therefore don't be like me, without the memory of that illusion. Don't at any rate miss things out of stupidity. Live!'For Henry James, people lived in \`the corruption of Europe' with its \`femmes du monde'; people were lived in the US. It is the Catholic (live like God in France) against the Protestant ethic (\`I seem to have a life only for other people').We are far away here from the Calvinist lesson of \`Daisy Miller' who died because she didn't respect the supreme respectability of her class.The novel advances extremely slowly, is full of suggestions, hints, (mis)understandings and fluctuating feelings. Direct confrontations are subdued to the extreme, and end with a laugh.The novel has another typical characteristic of James's stories: it's all about \`thoroughbred' people, sublime members of the high society. They are presented in a superlative style: prodigious, exquisite, graceful, supreme, transcendent, precious, admirable, beautiful, bright, lovely, magnificent, splendid, brilliant, wonderful ...With its essential message, this novel is a classic masterpiece.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Ambassadors (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"James' novel affected me in part because I also fell in love with Paris, though not with a Parisian. The sinuous, difficult prose provides the perfect vehicle for the adventures of aging Lambert Strether as he goes to Paris to try to recover a New England son who will not return to his domineering mother and take a role in the family business--manufacturing an article that is never named. In Europe he meets a degree of sophistication he had never known but also a jungle of moral ambivalences. If I gave the novel only four stars, it is not because of the difficult prose, which I sometimes cursed, but because the crucial instance of moral turpitude which he describes seems practically banal now. I once bundled up all my Henry James books in a fit of pique and was on the way to taking them to a library book sale, but thought better of it. And it was a better thought."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"The characters, settings, and Peter's use of language are so engrossing that I quite forgot that this was supposed to be a mystery.

Many years after his Crusader days, he met a young man and realized that man - Olivier de Bretagne - must be his son, fathered during a love affair with a Syrian widow. Cadfael did not make the relationship known to Olivier, who nevertheless became his fast friend despite their knowing each other only briefly and on only two occasions. Now Olivier is held captive by a nobleman who refuses to offer the young man for ransom, as is customary in the England of civil war between King Stephen and Empress Maud; and Cadfael feels that he must do whatever it takes to see his son set free. When his abbot refuses him permission to pursue that goal beyond a certain point, Cadfael knowingly breaks his vow of obedience and proceeds anyway. His background as a soldier stands him in good stead, but he yearns for home - for the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul, his brothers there, and his life as a Benedictine - throughout this 20th and final adventure in the long running series.This book makes a fitting conclusion to the Cadfael mysteries. Like the earlier entries, it is fully as much a well written, meticulous historical novel as a tale of mystery, adventure, and suspense; but it particularly shines in its development Cadfael as a character. The lesser players do almost equally well. Despite a rather slow start and a lot of political maneuvering, it is a terrific read.--Reviewed by Nina M.

I find that large numbers of readers/listeners have made it before me, saying all the things I wanted to say but I will have my 2c worth anyway!The Brother Cadfael mysteries are always worth a read, well written, characterized and historically placed, they are always time well spent. However Brother Cadfaels Penance rises above the rest, in that it brings the normal nice sense of touch, character and mystery from a setting in civil war to being an integral part of that conflict. Some of the others have been entertaining but perhaps thin ... however this is deeply embedded not just in the history of the time but an integral part of the conflict. His themes of the futility of war and the attempts to end it combined with an almost Shakespearean father/son relationship storylines are a joy. Added to that Cadfaels own deep insecurities and a wonderfully clever series of culminations make this a deep meaningful well rounded and satisfying read.Stephen Thornes audio is outstanding, catching the (unusually for Peters) heavily nuanced text beautifully. This book is a joy on its own but those that have read the other books whose stories lead to this culmination will find the most satisfaction with it.Do yourself a favor and look at the (now) 37 glowing ratings and treat it like an expensive bottle of wine.

When Cadfael learns that his son, Olivier, has been taken prisoner after the seige and fall of Faringdon castle, he also learns that his captor refuses to release him for a ransom, as he has done with all of the other prisoners. Cadfael is determined to secure his release at all costs and begs leave of the Abbot to travel to Coventry to attend the conference between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, so as to beg for help for Olivier. The Abbot grants him a short leave of absence but stipulates that he must return in a week or consider himslf recused, having failed to keep his monastic vows. Even with this heavy penalty hanging over him, Cadfael knows that he cannot leave his son languishing in a dungeon, and offers his life in return for Olivier's. With the help of Yves Hugonin, scion of a noble family and now brother-in-law to Olivier, Cadfael gains entrance to the castle where he makes the offer of an exchange of his life for Olivier's to Philip of Gloucester, lately of the Empress's court and now an adherent of King Stephen, in this perpetually changing war which is devastating the country.

Without my leave or blessing.\\"\\"Without your prayers?\\"\\"Have I said so?\\"\\"Father, it is written in the Rule that the brother who by his own wrong choice has left the monastery may be received again, even to the third time, at a price. Even penance ends when you shall say: It is enough!\\"- Radulfus and Cadfael, discussing Cadfael's leave of absence hereinThis book contains a major spoiler for THE VIRGIN IN THE ICE, which introduced two characters appearing in this book, and a spoiler for THE HOLY THIEF that the reader might miss.Several illegitimate sons figure prominently in this book, all great men in one way or another:- Robert of Gloucester, the empress' chief supporter and half-brother, who would have been king had he been legitimate. While Robert himself is only on stage briefly, his relationship with the empress is the motive for her actions in the final section of the book. - Robert's son Philip FitzRobert, who recently shocked everyone by repudiating his allegiance to the empress and going over to the king, taking an entire castle and its garrison with him after his father ignored his pleas for support during a siege.- Geoffrey FitzClare, one of Philip's chief captains in Cricklade, whose seal was set first to the surrender.- One obscure knight of Philip's following, now held prisoner and not offered for ransom: Olivier de Bretagne.A list of prisoners taken at Cricklade sends Hugh Beringar to Cadfael, who in turn makes full confession to Radulfus at last: that Olivier is his son, which he never knew until the events of THE VIRGIN IN THE ICE (and Olivier still does not know), and that he never knowingly abjured the ties of fatherhood in taking his monastic vows. Radulfus gives Cadfael as much leeway as he can, giving him permission to attend peace talks in Coventry with Hugh Beringar where the subject of prisoners and ransoms is expected to be a topic. But Cadfael's leave will end with the conference, after which his further absence will indicate that he has repudiated his vows and cast himself adrift.This is one of only two books in which King Stephen appears in person, and the only one in which the empress appears, which in itself is worth seeing as the two are brought together for peace talks in Coventry. Alas, the end of the war still seems far away, as each holds substantial territory (he in England, she in Normandy) with hopes of total victory, and neither will give up their separate claims to the crown: Stephen's, that he has been formally anointed king; Maud's, that she is the late king's only surviving legitimate child, to whom all the nobles, Stephen prominent among them, swore oaths of allegiance as the king's heir. While most of their faults are complimentary - he is too impatient to pursue either a siege or a grievance, her arrogance with her allies knows no bounds - they share one grievous fault: neither considers their responsibilities to their people, not even in great matters of the devastation wrought by war, let alone small matters of individual justice.So it is that Cadfael, as he had feared would be the case, is left to pursue the mystery of Olivier's fate without official backing, aided and abetted chiefly by Yves Hugonin, now nineteen and Olivier's brother-in-law, and like him of the empress' following. Soon Cadfael needs to save Yves as well as Olivier, as Yves' hot-blooded confrontation of one of Philip's turncoat captains at the conference makes Yves chief suspect when the man is assassinated soon afterward. While the empress protects Yves under the safe-conduct that made the conference possible, she herself does not believe in his innocence (and, chillingly, approves of the act), nor does someone else. Yves, like Olivier before him, vanishes into unransomed captivity, but this time leaving a trail that Cadfael can follow.The mysteries of the murders to be investigated in this book, while very interesting in their own right, are in a greater sense only tools in setting the stage for greater mysteries to be explored: that of the relationships between the characters, the mysteries of the human heart. Cadfael's loyalty to his own son, without expected return, is set against Philip's troubled relationship with his great father - all four very fine, honourable men, but separated by various entanglements. Yves' loyalty to Olivier is set against both Olivier's entanglement with their captor and Philip's loyalty to his dead captain. There is also a constant background of personal loyalties conflicting with greater responsibilities: monastic vows against fatherhood, oaths of allegiance against law, order, and justice, loyalty to one's liege against loyalty to one's friends.And what drove Olivier's captor to hold him beyond price? That, more than any murder, is the great mystery of this book.Drive-in totals:- Two murders, one a stabbing at close range.- One attempted murder (a very nasty fall resulting in permanent injury).- One sequence straight out of THIEF: THE DARK PROJECT wherein a lone unarmed man sneaks into the heart of a guarded fortress by night.- One battle with siege, when the empress for hate and scalded pride takes action she would not take to rescue loyal knights of her following.As always, I recommend the unabridged recording narrated by Stephen Thorne."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"This twentieth chronicle of Brother Cadfael reads as if Ellis Peters knew it would be her last.

I've read every single one of her books, including all twenty Brother Cadfaels. I enjoyed them all, but it is a truly wonderful thing when her last book is also her best one. This book is about Cadfael's heart. He loves his Church. He loves his way of life. And yet, he is willing to sacrifice what he's worked so hard to build-and his life-for the life of his son. There is no more poignant moment than when he closes the door on his herb hut and walks away.Because he's Cadfael, he ends up meddling in the affairs of men far above him on the social ladder, and changing the course of the endless war between Stephen and Maud.

The war between Stephen and Maud that has exhausted the people and served as a backdrop for much of the series now becomes almost a character in itself. The rapidly shifting tides of political instability take their toll on relationships and characters, forcing some to grow up too fast and others to ponder their place in the midst of the chaos. I like that the murder itself takes second place to (and indeed almost solves itself) to the personal struggles of Cadfael and his son. It is fitting that in the end Cadfael again uses his wit and keen mind to bring mercy and grace where it is most needed, help those most in need (regardless of allegiance), and save the day as much a humanly possible. That he does so while upholding as much of his vows as he does--indeed, he keeps far more of the rule than he breaks--is a testament to this great character and shows why he is so much missed."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"This book is the final one in the Brother Cadfael series, and gratefully brought to full circle Cadfael's adventures with his son Oliver.

But now, in the final creation of Ellis Peters, Cadfael learns that Sir Oliver has been taken hostage and no one knows his whereabouts, and Cadfael leaves his order in search of his son and the solution of not one but two murders.

This one happens to be before the rise of the King Henry's. It is a bit fuzzy when it is, but there is a civil war going on over who should be king of England and Brother Cadfael gets into the middle of it, though, to be sure, he has nothing to do with the culmination of it (that is outside the bounds of the story).Brother Cadfael has a son who gets captured by one side of the war and is being held incognito. The important part of this book is that Mr. Ellis gives a good cultural education throughout. You learn of the various prayers and times to be praying; you learn that the Welsh are not adverse to having and acknowledging illegitimate children; and you learn the structure and discipline brothers live under. It is quite entertaining.Brother Cadfael has to find out what has happened to his son and what may be done for him. He takes leave from the monastery to go with the Lord of the realm he abides in to a conference where he hopes to find some information about his son. A murder occurs and the wrong person is accused, as well as no information about his son is forthcoming, so he traipses on to further adventures. He saves people from treachery, he finds his son and frees him, etc., etc.The most unfinished business is that of why was his son captured and kept incognito? I do not remember coming across the answer to that, but still, the book told a good story and it was fun to read."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"I have reviewed many of these in this series in the last few days as I try to finish the series before the end of 2008. Well one to go, but after this, the penultimate, can it get better? If you can get past that there is little need for a mystery, for the body is truly a device to continue the action of what is a first rate historical.We have spent twenty tales with Cadfael and Hugh and the others of the times. We have Bishop de Clinton, and Earl Beaumont, and even King Stephen. Now we meet Empress Maud but more importantly her nephew Phillip. The tale of what takes place in and around the events of the Coventry Peace conference of 1145 and how Cadfael and Hugh find their way there and the actions that Cadfael must see to of a personal nature is worth the price of admission.The body, the murder is not important. We have 19 tales that have set this up to be what Pargeter, what Peters seems to do better, give us the setting of this civil war and a story to encompass it.

The writing is typically adroit - wise, full and redeeming, and the passages found toward the last third of the book, describing the interior heart of Brother Cadfael towards Olivier, his 'unknown' son, are as beautifully trenchant as anything one will find in popular prose writing. In this series of books, the mysteries themselves are always well-placed and fascinating, authentic and without tricks, but again, it is the superlative writing of Ellis Peters, the warmth of the language and the architecture of its comeliness, that captivates; indeed, she has permanently raised the genre of mystery novel to a new plateau of genuine literary interest.

There will be no more Brother Cadfael mysteries. Ellis Peters is gone, but she has left a rich estate for all her readers, especially in the well-known Brother Cadfael series.Cadfael's conflict in the book is between his monastic vows and what he perceives to be his natural duties as a father. His son Olivier has been captured and none know where he is. Cadfael looks for Olivier though he knows the search may cost him his home in Shrewesbury Abbey.Later parts of the book deal with the issue that an honorable man may do that which seems most dishonorable if it helps end a destructive war.Ellis Peter's characters are far more realistic and human than most. They are sympathetic, mostly good characters torn by events, doing wrong in reaction to being trapped in unpitying reality. Her characters are consistent and believable with a few possible exceptions. Olivier, for example, seems all perfection -- yet is this not how his loving father would see him?As a whole, the Cadfael series is an excellent blend of plot, character, and setting. Brother Cadfael's Penance, the last written in the series, is one of the best.

Cadfael gets word that his secret son, Olivier de Breatgne, has been taken prisoner in the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, and has not been offered for ransom. Born in the far East of a Syrian mother, and choosing his unknown father's religion to join the English, Olivier does not know that Brother Cadfael is his father. By chance Cadfael met him he when looking for two missing children, and the monk realised that the young man was the son that he never knew he had. Now Olivier is prisoner, his whereabouts and imprisoner unknown. Although Cadfael has broken the Rule of the Benedictine Order before, he has never broken his monastic vows. But as he said, &quot;Knowing or unknowing, before I was a brother I was a father.&quot; Cadfael is torn between the monastic life he loves so dearly and the duty he feels to find his son and set him free. A wonderfully moving and exciting book."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"...it should come as no surprise that BrotherCadfael feels he must pay penance for his, as well. And in this20th--and final--chronicle of Brother Cadfael, Ellis Peters takes us a giant step forward in her characterization of the good Benedictine monk, a man once a member of the Crusades and now wrestling against sin behind the cloth.In \\"Brother Cadfael's Penance,\\" Peters permits Cadfael to come face to face with another aspect of his life--a time before his monastic vows. It is 1145 and the great civil war rages on between King Stephen and Empress Maud. However, there is hope. A meeting between the two factions is scheduled for Coventry and Brother Cadfael secures permission from the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury to attend. Known widely for his skills in diplomacy, as well as crime solving abilities, Cadfael, however, wishes to attend for a very personal reason. He is seeking news of a young knight, Olivier de Bretagne. Olivier is Cadfael's son, from his days fighting in the Holy Land as a crusader. His holy vows aside, he feels he must do all within his power to save his son.Peters, as always, presents Cadfael as more than human--she gives us a man for all seasons, as it were. In addition, she presents the good brother in a realistic but incredibly humane manner. He is a man whom we can love, respect, yes, evencherish. Peters' ability to draw out these characteristics is perhaps what makes the series so fascinating. Hers is a series not to be missed. One probably should read them in the order they were written; or at least, read earlier ones before this one, as the poignancy of the meeting between father and son is so much more dramatized when the reader has the background to appreciate such a climactic episode. I cannot imagine a reader being disappointed!(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"Had Ellis Peters know this would be her final &quot;Brother Cadfael&quot; book before her death, she couldn't have written a better one. Returning to the fascinating plot line of Cadfael's long-lost son, Olivier, she does an excellent job of balancing Cadfael's love for his monastery and his monastic profession with his love and devotion to the son he has only begun to know. Almost everyone in life has experienced the tension of two loves that nearly tears them apart and destroys them. Ms. Peters again does a wonderful job of keeping her characters true to themselves, to their times, and to the interplay developed in the long line of Cadfael mysteries. I very much enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"It is unfortunate that Ellis Peters has died. I do not know if this book was meant to be the final chapter in the Cadfael series, but it brings the series to an appropriate ending. Brother Cadfael's search for his son, the end of much of the series political strife, and Cadfael's acceptance and embracing of his clerical life tie up many of the series' themes.A terrific series that transcends usual mystery genre's conventions and limitations."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"BUT! Now Brother Cadfael belongs to history, and the readers who love him so.Start at the beginning and READ THIS SERIES! Miss Peters had an unparalleled gift for conjuring the most beautiful images with her words. I mean, how many people can write about the grim and gritty middle ages and almost make you want to live there? When Cadfael digs in his garden and breathes in the scent of his herbs, you are there, my friend.In this volume we again meet Olivier, Cadfael's son. That would make it worth buying alone, but we also get a brilliant story with EP's usual marvelous characters. What a marvelous ending to this stand-out series."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"I enjoy Ellis Peters on a number of levels. Her mysteries are fun, her way of handling history is interesting and the way she handles language makes for a lovely reading experience. I suppose I should wonder how a man as cloistered as Cadfael could possibly run into so many unfortunate circumstances, but I never do. I love the pace of Cadfael's life and the depth of his character. I love best his honor and the quality of his faith. I found this the best of the series. The character lived and breathed in his quest, and in the pain his decision cost him. We see him as a fully rounded man - a solidly spiritual person who is also quick witted and capable. But there's more to it than that - there is such love in this book, such affection for humanity, that it was a rich, satisfying read. Action for the action minded, complexity for the intelligent, and warm - for those who read to find friends."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"Ellis Peters (Edith Pargeter) came to my attention early in the Brother Cadfael series, and has seldom been a disappointment. This novel has an interesting, historically sound plot, a keen grasp of human nature, and great characterization throughout.More than one reviewer has marveled at the virtuousness of her medieval characters, but when Peters paints a portrait of virtue, it is never cheap, sentimental, or caricatured. In a 21st-century culture trying to light the dead wood of honor and chivalry with the fickle tinder of cynicism, warrior monks like Brother Cadfael were and are a welcome breath of fresh air. Those reviewers who dismiss Cadfael as too saintly have let his faithfulness to Benedictine rule and Catholic orthodoxy blind them to his literary kinship with the good-but-not-to-be-messed-with likes of Huckleberry Finn and Phillip Marlowe."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"After reading Ellis Peters' 20th and last Cadfael story I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that there will be no more coming. The Cadfael novels were all finely written and satisfying as mysteries and historical novels. In this last installment, there is a murder mystery, but Cadfael ends up solving much more than a crime. In fact, the crime solving aspect is a small part of this story that mostly surrounds the relationships between a father and an estranged son. I think most fans will agree that it isn't one of the best three or four, but it was very good, and is a fitting conclusion to the Cadfael story."},{"Title":"Brother Cadfaels Penance Cadfael 20 (The Cadfael Chronicles)","review":"The twentieth and final book in the popular series, Brother Cadfael's Penance finds the title character drawn out of his home at the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in a quest to free a young man taken prisoner in a war between the Empress Maud and her cousin, Stephen. Betrayal at the hands of Robert, one of the Empress's most trusted soldiers has landed Olivier de Bretagne in prison, where he seems destined to rot. But word of his fate reaches Brother Cadfael, who knows he must leave the Abbey and come to the aid of the young man-who is the monk's only child, sired before his vows during the time he fought in the Crusades. He must also keep Olivier's impulsive brother-in-law safe, and solve the murder of a rogue lord who supported Robert. A fascinating story on many levels, Brother Cadfael's Penance combines the best of adventure stories, mysteries, and historical fiction into one seamless, well-realized tale. Everything about the story-especially character, setting, and historical detail-rings true. Peters' knowledge of Middle Ages customs, language, and beliefs, honed through years of writing, is extensive and makes the era come alive. Cadfael, now the subject of a twentieth story, feels as familiar as family. Torn between his vows and his duty as a father, Cadfael places his son first when he decides to travel to Coventry to seek help and information. But such a decision comes at a cost to Cadfael's peace of mind. Here is where Peters' familiarity with her character becomes noticeable. Cadfael's faith is tested, as is his devotion to the way of life he has chosen. Peters makes his internal struggles seem genuine, the natural outcome of having his world turned upside down; yet he emerges from his travails stronger in both spirit and character. The secondary characters, such as Olivier, Yves, and Robert, are also fleshed out and realistic. The conflict in the story is based on real history, yet the fictional aspects of the story blend very well with the historical facts. Sometimes the plot becomes too thick for its own good, and there are times when there seem to be more characters than necessary. But the story progresses well, and is never boring. Interestingly, Cadfael's search for his son takes precedence over the mystery, which seems almost an afterthought. (It does tie in with the main plot, though). The identity and motive of the murderer is well-hidden until the revelatory moment, and ultimately the story is left with a few plot threads hanging. It is possible that Peters intended to write another book but died before it was realized. The resolution of the main plot thread, though, is very satisfactory and allows the story to end on a positive note."},{"Title":"Options in contemporary Christian ethics","review":"Geisler has an easy-to-understand, but thought-provoking way of writing.

Still a good story!"},{"Title":"Life With Mother Superior, acting edition","review":"This is a touching true story that could happen to anyone - but this one happened to Jane Trahey... It really made me think about future, destiny and friendship. Friends are friends, no matter what. And maybe sometimes we cannot notice it."},{"Title":"Life With Mother Superior, acting edition","review":"The published script for the play, \\"Life With Mother Superior\\" (1974), should not be confused with the 1962 novel on which it was based. Both were written by Jane Trahey, although dramatist Anna Helen Reuter co-authored the stage version. Most will prefer to read the novel, rather than the play. On the other hand, the 1974 script may have some appeal to dramatic groups, although casting (for 2 male and 25 female characters) could be challenging. But it is also interesting to compare the Trahey/Reuter stage script with Blanche Hanalis' screenplay for the motion picture, The Trouble With Angels. Although both are based on the same novel, they differ in significant ways.Some differences between the film and the play are minor. In the play, the school is \\"St. Mark's\\" rather than \\"St. Francis.\\" And most characters have different names, most notably \\"Jane\\" (presumably based very loosely on Trahey herself) who corresponds with \\"Rachel\\" in the film. Several of the teachers are not nuns. The play evidently takes place in the 1930s, as Mary adopts the alias, \\"Fay Wray,\\" and girls in the sewing class want to make outfits patterned on those of Carole Lombard and Ginger Rogers.But the play features many of the same events that occur in the film. After an older woman becomes upset that girls as young as Mary and Jane (i.e., Rachel) are smoking, Mary tells her, \\"I am a forty-seven year midget.\\" The girls change names. They conduct a tour of the cloister, and find themselves locked in by the Mother Superior. After making a cast of Marvel Ann's face, they are unable to remove the hardened plaster. Mary and Jane put bubble bath in the sisters' sugar bowls--but, in the stage version, the audience sees only the bubbles appearing from offstage. In retribution for these misdeeds they are repeatedly made to scrub the floors and perform other janitorial functions. As in the movie, Jane (Rachel) attempts unsuccessfully to make a dress for a sewing contest. The Mother Superior completes the dress, which earns an honorable mention; but Jane is compelled to forfeit the prize money. And there is a band contest, which St. Mark's wins by subterfuge.The Trahey/Reuter script does include some different events, most notably, a school play about Abraham Lincoln, in which Jane mistakenly delivers her Act III line in Act I, inducing some other cast members, costumed as African American field hands, to make a similar leap and deliver lines which they were supposed to deliver in Act III when they were portraying assassination conspirators. The stage version lacks some events that occur in the film. There are no swimming pool scenes, no dancing lessons with Gypsy Rose Lee, and no brassiere shopping with Sister Rose Marie. Also missing are some of the sobering experiences that contribute to the girls' maturation in the film. They do not visit a home for the aged, or learn how one sister had been imprisoned by the Nazis, or how another sister plans to teach in a leper colony. Nor do they experience the unexpected death of the friendliest sister. Without these events to drive character development, the girls do not seem to change much in their years at St. Mark's.The dichotomy between Mary and Jane (i.e., Rachel) is not so sharply drawn in the play as in the movie. In the film, contemplating the possibility that Rachel (i.e., Jane) might become a nun, the Mother Superior exclaims, \\"If she does, I quit!\\" But, in the play, the Mother Superior directs this sentiment, not at Jane (i.e., Rachel), but at Mary, when Mary suggests that she might join the order--\\"The day you come in, I go out.\\" Like Rachel in the movie, in the play, Jane is nonplused when she learns that Mary plans to become a nun. Thereafter, she avoids Mary, explaining to the Mother Superior, \\"I'm not interested in anyone that gets roped in.\\" The Mother Superior responds that this was Mary's choice--in fact, \\"I did everything I could to talk her out of it.\\" Jane finally agrees to speak to Mary, but, with tears in her eyes, she says, \\"I will never understand, Mother. I will never understand.\\" Thus far, the play is very like the film; but, in its final lines, apparently with some new practical joke in mind, Mary tells Jane that she has a \\"most marvelous . . . most heavenly idea,\\" which she whispers to Jane. Jane is doubtful, but Mary assures her, \\"Trust me.\\" Mother Superior, walking past, warns Jane, \\"I wouldn't if I were you!\\" Thus it seems that, despite her decision to become a nun, Mary has not lost her interest in pranks.A reading of the script for the stage version of this story enhanced this reviewer's appreciation for how Hanalis' screenplay and Ida Lupino's direction gave a depth and dignity to the film that are absent from the play."},{"Title":"Urban Change in China: Politics and Development in Tsianan Shantung 1890 1949","review":"This 1970s scholarly book provides a lot of information about the history of Jinan between 1890 and 1949, much of it in English for the first time. As a source for facts and research ideas, it is very good. It has drawbacks in other areas, however.First, the entire point of the book seems flawed. Buck wanted to take a Chinese city that had all the ingredients needed to turn itself into a modern Western-style city, and see whether such a transformation could have taken place, and if not, why not. The entire premise is that the Western-style city is the natural course for a city to take, and China is somehow lacking for failing to develop in the same way as the West. In reality, might it not be Western cities that are the anomalies?In addition, Buck's conceptual framework, while dealing with Western ideas of the city, makes only a passing reference to the work of Skinner, as though Buck was rushed for time and could not fully incorporate Skinner's economic ideas into his thesis. Although the title of the book claims that the book goes through 1949, in reality it stops somewhere in the early 1930s, with a vague later section which merely repeats then-current Communist rhetoric about turning &quot;consumer cities&quot; into &quot;producer cities.&quot; This rhetoric is not subjected to critical scrutiny.I wished for more maps and other visual material, as well as for more stories, non-scholarly sources such as novels and plays, and other materials that would have given a more vivid sense of the city. If one compares this book to the later 2-volume work on the city of Hankow by Rowe, Buck's book does seem lacking; nevertheless, it remains a valuable resource for students of Shandong province."},{"Title":"Just Tell Me What To Do! Easy Marketing Tips for Small Business","review":"I must admit that I have a pile of half read self-help books for business in my office. Completing them, is unfortunately, low on my priority list right now. I flip through the chapters that I need and promise myself that I will get to the less relevant topics later on when I have more time. When I take that holiday... when I finish the paperwork I have been putting off.....Maybe one day. This is precisely what made Just Tell Me What To Do such an enjoyable read. The Author obviously recognizes that the average reader-especially if they own their own business- wants to read information that is presented as clearly and concisely as possible. Tell What to Do accomplishes this through its format. The words are laid out with plenty of white space between them. This makes the book nonintimidating and very eye friendly to read. The material itself was also very informative, with practical solutions to marketing dilemmas the everyday entrepeneur will likely identify with."},{"Title":"Just Tell Me What To Do! Easy Marketing Tips for Small Business","review":"There is a saying that the longest journey starts with a single step. Your first step towards becoming a successful marketer is to invest in a copy of Just Tell Me What To Do by Eric Gilboord. This obviously successful marketing guru has managed to put together one of the best books I have read on marketing for small to medium businesses. If you fall into this category, this book could help turn your organization into a success story. The book is divided into four parts. The first looks at Understanding and Managing Your Marketing with an excellent definition of what marketing is and it's purpose; the second part covers Strategies For Success with an overview of customer service; the third area examines Marketing Tools and gives endless tips, practices and advice on what good marketing materials consist of; and the fourth section details Marketing and Sales, A Killer Combination tying together the partnership of sales and marketing. Mr. Gilboord explains thoroughly in a clear, concise manner, how good marketing practice is the driving force behind the success of a business. His expertise is displayed throughout the book as he shares innovative techniques, the use of checklists and real life examples that you can relate to. The book remains consistently an easy read and covers every imaginable marketing concept. It's a fresh approach without all the hype. He discusses the root cause of why so many businesses fail due to the fact that they don't develop and follow a well constructed marketing strategy. Anyone involved in any aspect of marketing will benefit from reading this exciting and extremely informative book. It was quite evident to me that he has the winning solution and he shares it well. I found the main theme to be 'stay focused' as he conveys a proven strategy that works. I have already implemented some of these methods. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Local Color: The di Rosa Collection of Contemporary California Art","review":"Basically, Rene di Rosa took one of the finest pieces of property in the world--a vineyard in the Carneros region between the Napa and Sonoma valleys--and built himself a home and an art collection which is open by appointment. This book catalogues his collection which is heavily (or you could say patriotically) skewed toward Norther n Californian artists--Wiley, Arneson, Michael Alfe and others. The di Rosa art preserve is exactly what I'd do if I had the money; two medium sized galleries and a three story home covered from floor to ceiling with art works, surrounded by an inviting but unostentatious garden. A flock of more than 50 peacocks yelling their empty little heads off wander around the place. I don't think I've seen a place that sums up the creative, pleasurable side of what it meant to be in the Bay Area in the 1960s. This book gives you a taste of di Rosa's collection, but for the real thing arrange a trip out to see the preserve; you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Classical Yoga","review":"This book is for the intermediate to advanced student or teacher of yoga who wishes to understand the definitions and inter-relationships between the concepts of classical yoga. For those interested in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, this text will help you access the ideas that lead to liberation. A clear understanding helps one's spiritual practice. This is a short book that is read slowly and digested. It serves as a reference to review from time to time as well. Enjoy! It would be a good gift for someone who is really into yoga, but not the choice for the novice."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Classical Yoga","review":"Those familiar with some of Georg Feuerstein's popular books, such as \\"Yoga for Dummies\\" may mistake this very short book for something similar, but with more emphasis on theory and less on practice. Despite being brief and -- considering the subject -- clearly written, it would probably be unreadably difficult for someone not already somewhat familiar with at least the names and major tenets of the major philosophical schools of the Hindu tradition, and their various relations (or supposed relations) to Yoga. Despite its brevity (or maybe because of it), this is the sort of book one needs to prepare to read. (Feuerstein's own description on the Amazon site is \\"for Advanced Students,\\" and he suggests his \\"Encyclopedia of Yoga\\" -- there are also several excellent general works on Indian philosophy, including Zimmer's old \\"Philosophies of India,\\" which I found helpful.)Feuerstein attempts nothing less than a re-visioning of the place of the Yoga-sutras (attributed to Patanjali) within the development of Indian philosophies (including Buddhism). The book is in some ways a companion to his own \\"The Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali: A New Translation and Commentary,\\" and picks up many of the issues argued there in relation to the received text and its classic interpretations.Feuerstein also surveys relevant positions taken by modern scholars. His phrasing in these discussions is sometimes, to my way of thinking, a bit unfair (although engagingly lively). For example, Mircea Eliade, whose \\"Yoga: Immortality and Freedom\\" is probably still the most widely accepted academic work in the field, is congratulated for disagreeing with his Indian mentors, and blamed for agreeing with them, strictly according to Feuerstein's views on the matter at hand. This is helpful insofar as it makes some of the issues stand out clearly, but I find that it grates a little."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Classical Yoga","review":"The book is much more academic than I expected and needed, It dwells extensively on the meaning of certain key concepts, mainly in sankscrit.

I bought two copies and sent one to my mom. We both read and cried about this book! This is such a heart-warming book! This brings back the magic of Christmas. I really loved the end where Santa tells us grown ups why he thinks Santa helps kids have faith. It teaches them to help others, to think of others, and puts God's love and face on a very special time of year. I really liked the part when Santa is talking to a young girl that is asking him how he flies. Santa tells her that with all of God's love, her Parent's love and her love, it gives Santa the magic he needs to fly on Christmas Eve. There were several things that Mr. Butchart shared in this book that my Husband and I will use when we have kids. If you have anyone in your life that thinks telling their kids that there is a Santa is lying to their kids tell them to read this book before telling their kids that. Also if you are one of those parents that ruin the magic of Christmas for their kids please tell them to keep the information to themselves. I can't tell you how many times I've had a niece, nephew, or family friends children come home crying because some kid at school told them there is no Santa. By reading this book you will understand that most of us use Santa to help us teach our kids about God. Its a very easy quick read. I bought several copies last year to give as gifts to all of our friends and family. My Husband was transferred to GA last year and my Christmas present was to go to Stone Mtn and see Santa!! I was so excited. I waited in line with all the kids and then it was finally my turn! I went and sat on Santa's lap and told him how my family really enjoyed his book. He said that he appreciated the compliments but had to share with me some sad news. On Christmas Day 2004 Santa's wife Annie Butchart passed away and this Christmas was very hard for him. His wife worked with him at Stone Mtn and was very active being Mrs. Claus. From reading his book it is very clear how much he cared for his wife even though I'm quite sure it doesn't even show the half of it. I wanted to share this news so you can appreciate the book a little more. Please buy this book and share it with everyone in your life. I have two copies so when we have guests during Christmas they can read the book and enjoy the season as much as I do."},{"Title":"Red Suit Diaries, The: A Real-Life Santa on Hopes, Dreams, and Childlike Faith","review":"This is an inspiring true account of one man's journey from Marine to real life Santa.

The rest of the time he works with Friends of Disabled Adults and Children (FODAC), an organization in Georgia that he founded that \\"provides home health (mobility and daily living) equipment to people of any age or any disability, temporary or permanent, for medically necessary and medically helpful reasons.\\" The book gives a portion of the author's testimony as a Christian, telling how he started FODAC and how he started working as Santa Claus.Butchart's work as Santa became an extended outreach of his ministry with FODAC. He decided early in his Santa career that he wanted Santa to be a reflection of Jesus by showing love to everyone who came to see Santa. Some of the stories in the book are humorous and some are serious and some of them are simple anecdotes and others convey an important message. They expand the reach of his career from his first day working as Santa in a large mall in Atlanta, his on-the-side Santa gigs, and his years as the official Stony Mountain Santa Claus.I really enjoyed reading THE RED SUIT DIARIES. The book is full of love and joy. It tells why this Santa (Butchart) believes it's important for children to believe in Santa Claus and how it helps them grow in their own faith of God.

Randolph) and the A.M.O.R.C. Rosicrucians of California.Randolph, it seems, had been declared Supreme Grand Master of the Dome by a French Rosicrucian congress in the 1860's, and was chartered at that time by the Rosicrucian congress that elected him.A.M.O.R.C. (the Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rose Cross) was founded by H. Spencer Lewis. In 1921, the head of the Pantheosophical Lodge of Europe, Theodore Reuss, granted Lewis a charter to found A.M.O.R.C. in North America. Reuss was also the Outer Head of the Order and Grandmaster of the Ordo Templi Orientis. However, Reuss did not *grant* this charter as O.H.O. of the O.T.O., he did it as the Grand Master of the Pantheosophical Lodge.Clymer believed that A.M.O.R.C. was not legitimate. His two-volume \\"History of the Rosicrucian Fraternity in America\\" details in 400 odd pages all the reasons that A.M.O.R.C. was not a \\"legitimate\\" Rosicrucian organization. *This* work is a summation of all mentions of Aliester Crowley from that two-volume set.Clymer's main points come down to two:First, that Theosophy and Pantheosophy have nothing to do with Rosicrucianism, and second, that since the O.T.O. practices Sex Magick, they can't be Rosicrucian, either.It is with no small amount of amusement that I note that it seems clear to modern magickal researchers that the Sex Magick teachings of the O.T.O. seem to clearly derive from the \\"Anseratic Mysteries\\" of Sex Magic as taught by Dr. Paschal T. Randolph. So what Clymer claims are not Rosicrucian teachings were certainly earlier propounded by the very man who founded Clymer's organization.Clear as mud? This book might be of some interest to those who collect Crowleyana, but of little interest to legitimate Rosicrucian researchers.Love is the Law, Love under Will."},{"Title":"The Patsy","review":"This is a fascinating story about what would have happened had Lee Harvey Oswald stood trial in Dallas for the murder of John F. Kennedy. It does not purport to sort out the truth like some final scene in a Thin Man movie. The evidence which finds its way into the trial scenes was lifted from the Warren report and unofficial investigations that sorted through the versions of witnesses on hand, the bizarre autopsy report that took place, the physical facts that so patently denied the official recital of events. The trial proceedings in so far as possible are faithful to the event, none was contrived by the author.The novel identifies the author's personal selection of malefactors , a group cold war fanatics, alarmed at President Kennedy's back stairs dialog with Cuba's Castro in particular and the Soviet Union and its client states in general.At their service were disgruntled Cuban exiles and organized crime figures, both wedded to policies that would return Cuba to the &quot;free world&quot; as the eden of gambling, drugs and prostitution. There were no end of figures and groups that dreaded a detent between United States and the Fidel Castro that were prepared to liquidate those who threatened their own agendas.In addition to the legerdemains of legal maneuvering and crackling exchanges in the courtroom, the novel introduces other appealing elements: suspense, action, and romance. It is a pleasurable read, captivating and thought provoking, a must for those still be amused by the events of that November morning of 1963."},{"Title":"The Patsy","review":"The assassination of John F. Kennedy will always be of interest to students of American history and politics. The author of this book, James J. Thornton, has taken an unusual, counterfactual premise -- that Lee Harvey Oswald survived to be tried in a court of law -- and has then created a suspenseful courtroom drama based upon that premise. The book is brilliantly plotted and superbly paced, the well-rounded characters are believable, and the period details are precisely accurate. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Families Are Forever","review":"Most baby albums start with new-baby photographs. But for a little girl named Rain, her \\"forever family\\" album begins with her adoptive mother's trip to China to meet her. Told from Rain's point of view when she's \\"almost six,\\" this sweet tale is graceful and eloquent: \\"Our eyes were different, but we could both see. Our lips were different, but we could both smile.\\" There's no question that it was love at first sight: \\"I could see love in her eyes. So I gave it right back.\\" Bridging both the generation and culture gap is Bo, the cuddly stuffed hippo who was once the mother's toy and now is a companion to Rain.

The photo-album technique is perfect here, providing the highlights of this family-building process.One of the book's creators - who did adopt a Chinese girl - founded a company called As Simple As That, which provides multi-media products that encourage children to understand and respect other cultures.

This book oversimplifies the subject and leads children to believe that an adopted baby understands the journey she begins when she meets her forever family. The text is nothing like what a six year old (the supposed age of the character narrator) would use. The pictures are over simple in some parts to look as if a child has drawn and colored them, and in other parts they are something like a bizarre cross between a photo and a sketch. They are not likely to draw a young child in or hold their interest.It is impossible that this character, Rain, would have had all of the thoughts and feelings she tells her young readers she had. Many, many other adoption books are out there for children. Do not spend your money and time on one that paints an over-simplified story.

It deals with trashed ecosystems, chemical and other pollution, the extinction of species, the risks of new technologies, scary human health problems, and the environmental effects of global inequities. It gives an often amusing (sometimes hilarious) and sobering account of the various attempts to convince us that environmental crisis does not exist (or more blatantly, that it is actually good for us) that have entered American politics and culture over the last three decades."},{"Title":"From Apocalypse to Way of Life: Environmental Crisis in the American Century","review":"I know of no better book about the environmental crises in the US today than this one.

The story itself is molded in the crusty fashion of a circa-1970's made for television movie, complete with horrible dialogue and one static character after another.

The ONE spritual, invsisible, omnipresent, omnipotent God.2. And the Immortality of the Soul (meaning basically that death is another part, or continuation of life).These two are referred to as the two great truths of Freemasonry by the author, whom wrote this work during the 1950's, a much safer time for secret societys to openly publish these, rather than todays mass-attacks by the collective awakening happening throughout the world (wich is good).When you have read this book, and gathered an understanding of the sprituality of man lost ages ago, you will se how everything fits together, and why we have huge monuments of sun-symbolism all-around the world.In reading other researchers books such as David Icke, they tend to skip this most basic, underlying, spiritual truth and jump directly to way more advanced and outlandish theories, such as the \\"reptillians\\" etc.Beginning with this one foundational work, wich is very easily read, you will have a strong ground to start your research upon.Enjoy your read. /Adam Jay."},{"Title":"Stellar theology and masonic astronomy: Or, The origin and meaning of ancient and modern mysteries explained","review":"\\"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy\\" by Robert Hewitt Brown is a classic; which, explains why a book first published in 1882 is still available today. This book is for anyone interested in the origins of religion and the mysteries schools. The portion of the title \\"Stellar Theology\\" perfectly describes what Brown addresses in part of the book. This section deals with the \\"Great Year\\", the 25,900 years precession of the zodiac cycle, and discusses the ages which corresponds to the each house of the zodiac.For example, Brown discusses the ancient worship of the Bull 6000 to 4000 years ago during the age of Taurus, the Dagon during the age of Pisces, Heracles the lion slayer in the age of Leo, etc. Brown provides many other examples. The thesis being that religion stems from the worship of the stars. Astro-theology is another term for this.After reading the book you will see symbols though new eyes; for example, the teramorphs, although not called this by Brown, is example of stellar symbolism hidden in plain sight of anyone who visits a gothic cathedral , but you will be able to decode the meaning of these symbols where the uninitiated seeing them won't comprehend the meaning.The allegory of the birth and death of the sun, Jacob's Ladder, Joachim and Boaz, the Temple of Solomon, and the orientation of temples are explained.This book is for anyone interested in myths, astro-theology, and masonic symbolism.

Here, primarily by analyzing the experiences of airline stewardesses, Hochschild tackles the question of what happens when, in our hyper consumer culture, one's emotions become commodified, when our feelings become a product? For service industries - hence the stewardesses - Hochschild finds that it isn't just delivering drinks that is part of the product; it is also one's smile and positive attitude that is similarly included (no matter how much you might want to dump a drink on the guy in the second row). As one can likely imagine, emotional commercialization doesn't lead to the best of outcomes: burnout and an inability to parse out on-stage and off-stage emotions.This book is great for those interested in sociology of emotions, the effects of modernizations and commercialization, and anyone hankering for another reason to not like consumer culture. For me, this book stands as a model for what good sociological writing can be like: insightful, entertaining and inspiring."},{"Title":"The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling","review":"My doughter use thi book in the colleges and she think is great and help the students to learn the class."},{"Title":"The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling","review":"I received this book and thank you for having it.

For twenty-three long years, she has clandestinely supported Bryce in his endeavors, hiding it from her brother who refused to recognize the lad as his off-spring. Her efforts have been rewarded with Bryce being a highly regarded barrister. However, she was never able to lavish as much affection as she wanted to on him for fear her brother would learn all and cut the child off with nothing. Now she wants to shower the thirty-one year old man with love and affection, and introduce him to her ward, Gabrielle Denning, who suffered a childhood trauma.Bryce and Gaby are emotionally as far apart as any two beings could ever be. Bryce is pure logic, using his brain to resolve everything. Gaby is pure heart, pouring love into her endeavors. When they meet, sparks fly and love flourishes. However, before this deserving couple can find a lasting relationship, they must uncover the mystery behind the tragedy that radically changed Gaby's life thirteen years ago.Fans of historical romantic suspense know that some of the best books of the genre come from that awesome author, Andrea Kane. Her latest, novel, THE MUSIC BOX, is her usual brilliant fiction, filled with the mark of Kane: a fast-paced, action filled intrigue, starring two wonderful, but wounded characters who touch the reader's heart. This novel is must reading for all romance fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Music Box","review":"THE MUSIC BOX is one of many novels i have read by Andrea Kane...this book leads you into a magical Wonderland Adventure. You frequently find yourself smiling at the antics of the uncommon staff and characters residing in Nevon Manor. I was and am thoroughly enthralled by this and many of Mrs. Kanes other novels. Its as if she has the ability to pull you into an unending abyss of happiness, togetherness, and love...brilliant work!"},{"Title":"The Music Box","review":"I've read many of Andrea Kane's novels and I do have to admit that The Music Box was a slight disappointment. It's hard to describe but you just couldn't really get into the story. Usually with her novels, you can't put the book down, but this one, you can leave it. It draws your attention in after a while, but it's not as suspenseful as her other novels. Gabrielle's guardian--Hermione was cute with her quirky staff, but things were a little too rushed and unreal. Not everything clicked. Gabrielle was a beautiful girl, but a little too predictable, which makes her character slightly flat, the same with Bryce Lyndley. The book is just okay, nothing great. Not very satisfying for someone who has read much of Andrea Kane already. To put it simply, I've definitely read better of Kane."},{"Title":"The Music Box","review":"I was disappointed by this story. I found the storyline all too predictable. I just couldn't get into the characters, I never found myself feeling what they were supposed to be feeling.

I hope she writes more in this genre!"},{"Title":"Her Immortal Soul","review":"Julien Longo's book is quite fascinating and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy type books. It is a story about several people who become annointed with some oil before the collapse of Atlantis, and this makes them immortal.

There is no doubt that Lawson's work (which is a product of more than 10 years of research at Cambridge) is deep and raises fundamental questions. One big problem, however, is that the book assumes that the reader has a substantial amount of knowledge about philosophy of science and this is surely not the case as far as the &quot;representative&quot; economist is concerned. Too bad. Lawson's message deserves to be made available to a larger audience. This would only be accomplished, however, if Lawson had chosen to cut the amount of philosophical blah-blah-blah and give more direct to the point examples of what he has in mind. He preferred to demonstrate his erudition, though."},{"Title":"Economics and Reality","review":"There are two claims made ,either implicitly or explicitly,by critical realists(Lawson,Hodgson,Runde,Fleetwood,etc.)in general, and by Lawson specifically in this book,that are simply incorrect.The first claim is that J M Keynes was a critical realist.Keynes was an early logical empiricist upon whom R.Carnap based his formal Logical Empiricism.All of the major points made by Keynes in the A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP)-the importance of intuition,a priori reasoning,Kant's synthetic a priori,the logical theory of probability,the weight of the evidence(argument),the equal importance of experience and reason in making decisions, the principle of indifference ,the special nature of frequency theories of probability versus the generality of the logical approach to probability,were all upheld in Carnap's 1969 defense of his philosophy.Carnap got one thing,and only one thing, wrong.He,like so many others,fell for the canards spread by F Ramsey ,in his 1922 and 1926 book reviews of Keynes's TP ,that Keynesian probabilities were \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\"(Lawson is a prime example of the \\"so many others\\").He failed to recognize that Keynes's basic approach to probability estimation was interval valued.In general,probabilities are indeterminate or imprecise or indefinite intervals which have a lower and an upper bound.Nowhere in his book ,or in any other book written by any other critical realist or economist, is the above connection noted or even alluded to in a footnote.This ignorance about the basic nature of Keynes's philosophy calls into question the accuracy and reliability of practically every statement made by Lawson about Keynes ,not only in this book,but in the entire corpus of Lawson's published writings.The second error of both Lawson and his fellow critical realists is the explicit and/or implicit claim that Keynes did not provide a general theory of employment in his 1936 work,The General Theory of Employment,Interest and Money(GT).This claim is the result of the pervasive mathematical illiteracy,ineptness and innumeracy prevalent among critical realists(institutionalists,post keynesians,cambridge keynesians).The following summary of the technical aspects of Keynes's GT can be duplicated by any reader,economist or critical realist included, of this review who knows how to integrate(take the antiderivative of)derivatives.First,go to the pages of the GT where Keynes presents derivatives.These pages are pp.55-56,ft.2,pp.280-286(chapter 20),pp.304-306(chapter 21),pp.271-278(chapter 19),and pp.114-117,126(chapter 10;Keynes's definition that Y=PO on p.209 refers back to chapter 10 and the Y-multiplier model.The other pages listed above all refer to Keynes's D-Z model).Keynes's expected aggregate supply function Z(Z1+Z2)=g(N)=P +wN,where P equals expected profit,w equals the money wage,and N equals aggregate employment.Keynes's expected aggregate demand function D(D1+D2)=f(N)=pO,where p is the expected price level of aggregate output and O,real output,is a function of N.Keynes has just specified an aggregate production function(p.283,GT).The actual or current aggregate demand function is Y(=C+I)=PO=bY+(1-b)Y,where b is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods(mpc), 1-b is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods(mpi),and Y is a function of N.P,in the context of the Y-multiplier model,is equal to the actual price level of aggregate output.Setting D=Z,one obtains the aggregate supply CURVE,a locus of all possible expected prices and expected profits. Assuming that Say's Law holds,set the elasticity at the bottom of p.116 of the GT equal to the elasticity at the bottom of p.283 of the GT.The following result is obtained:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p equals the expected real wage and mpl equals the marginal product of labor.If,and only if,mpc+mpi=1 will the classical and neoclassical labor market clearing equilibrium condition ,needed to obtain an optimal result,occur.There will be no involuntary unemployment,only voluntary and frictional unemployment.If mpc+mpi is &lt; 1,involuntary unemployment will occur since as (mpc+mpi) falls,the ratio on the RHS will rise.To maintain the equality requires that the money wage rises or that the money wage rises by more than the price level.The LHS ratio must rise.This simply means that labor as a whole can do nothing in this situation to LOWER the money wage ,since this would violate the necessary first order condition for optimality THAT THE W/P=MPL.Obviously,government(public)goods,export goods,and import goods can be divided into consumption and investment goods,in which case Keynes's general optimality condition does not need to be expanded.It can ,of course ,be expanded in the following way.Let mpg,mpe,and mpm equal the marginal propensities to spend on public goods,exports,and imports.Keynes's general theory would then be summarized and read as follows:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi+mpg+mpe-mpm).Unless mpc +mpi+mpg+mpe-mpm=1,involuntary unemployment will occur.Finally,the strange objections made by Richard Kahn and Joan and Austin Robinson that Keynes ignored imperfect competition are easily met by multiplying the LHS(w/p) by the elasticity 1-[1/(Es)]and the RHS by the elasticity 1+[1/Ed].Until Lawson and/or his fellow critical realists deal correctly with Keynes's philosophy,approach to probability , and his general theory of employment, important side issues, like the proper role that methodological considerations should play in economics if it is to become a science,the misuse of econometrics(addiction to the normal probability distribution),the relative importance of a particular set of evolving labor ,political,social,financial and economic institutions over time,etc., will offer no challenge to the reigning neoclassical school at all."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure (American Casebook Series)","review":"The &quot;book description&quot; above belongs to a different book: this hornbook is not part of the &quot;Black Letter Series,&quot; its author is not Professor Clermont, and it doesn't come with a handy computer disk.It is, however, an extremely helpful hornbook to have and use during your first-year course on Civil Procedure.

There may be students who can squeeze a profitable education out of the &quot;casebook&quot; approach, but I'm not one of them and you probably aren't either.During your first semester, it will be tempting to spend a lot of time briefing cases.

Since the Emperor regarded himself as the poet par excellence, everyone else was ultimately disposable. Both Petronius and Seneca were ultimately requested to commit suicide and did so, lest the Praetorian Guard were called in to \\"assist\\" them.In the earlier days of Nero's rule, when there was some possibility that his would be one of the rare enlightened reigns, Petronius and Seneca joined Nero in a regular after-dinner literary society where the humor was frequently raunchy and the sex more often than not perverted.The SATYRICON was originally a fairly long episodic spoof of the ODYSSEY: its hero offends the God Priapus by ransacking his temple and is stricken with impotence. He and his friends and bedmates wander through Italy recounting their adventures. The only fairly intact sequence tells of a dinner by a nouveau-riche merchant named Trimalchio who holds an elegant banquet but whose base-born origins are always showing. All the rest of the episodes are fragmentary, though not without interest.Seneca takes the recently poisoned Emperor Claudius down a peg by spoofing his deification. Starting with Julius Caesar, the Romans turned many of their leaders into gods upon their demise. Claudius -- who was by no means the nice guy portrayed in the Robert Graves books -- gets short shrift in the underworld. A clue: The title is usually translated as \\"The Pumpkinification of Claudius.\\" Seneca was treading carefully here, as Nero's mother was Claudius' wife and is generally considered to have been the one who poisoned him.These are not works that you can sit down and read as if they were novels. The introductions are not only helpful, but mandatory to understanding what follows. Both works, along with the works of Lucan, are essential to understanding this darkly fascinating period of Roman history."},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","review":"Petronius, according to the translator's notes, was a person of unidentified occupation and member of Emperor Nero's court. Chances are that Petronius got by ingratiating himself with the rich and famous, perhaps by amusing them with his stories. It's also fair to guess that he joined some of their debuaches - perhaps some of this is drawn from experience - and that the tales grew in the telling.The story starts with the narrator Encolpius, with his friend Asclytus, and with the toyboy they share, Giton. What follows is a wandering series of encounters. They split and reunite a number of times, usually around some improbable scheme. Later on, the aging poet Eumolpus takes Asclytus' place in the story, in Giton's intimacy, and in the petty schemes with Encolpius.At one point, Encolpius is found spying on the ecstasies offered up to one of the gods. The punishment for that lewd interlude is in kind, to have ecstasy thrust upon (and into) him beyond bearing. That's an early passage, and sets the tone for all the other adventures and escapes in this book.Towards the end, his dissolute ways make him the Cialis poster boy. He seeks an aged witch for aphrodisiac treatment, and she gives it to him all different ways. To his dismay, many ways involve her own aged body in the treatment. A reader with a vivid imagination will see lots more humor than this 1965 translation would have dared put on paper.But I wonder, is this really the best translation? Yes, it has some integrity - Sullivan has been careful to note breaks in the manuscript. He even adds a chapter of \\"fragments,\\" too broken and disjoint to guess at. The reader doesn't get a false sense of continuity caused by the translator's patches. On the other hand, the reader doesn't get a full sense of continuity, either. On the scale from academic rendering to storytelling, I wish this were a bit more in the storytelling direction. No matter, it's a great story anyway.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","review":"How much you appreciate THE SATYRICON depends on why you're reading it. If you're reading for a good story, look elsewhere. This is a fragment. The missing parts are gone forever. We can only imagine what the missing parts contained. But if you're reading for a glimpse into Roman life in first century AD, this is a treat. It's a very readable translation that is also very funny. I laughed out loud a couple of times. The introduction explains that it is a spoof of THE ODYSSEY. Odysseus gets blown around the Mediterranean as a result of having offended Poseidon. In THE SATYRICON the protagonist has offended Priapus and must suffer his wrath as the bounces around the Bay of Naples.This work is famous for its depiction of the uber-freedman, Trimalchio, and his excessively vulgar banquet, and it lived up to my expectations. Oh how I wish that someone would miraculously discover the missing parts. What there is of this is great.The APOCOLOCYNTOSIS is an amusing brief work (once again fragmentary) by Seneca that gives some insight into the sensibilities of the time. Also included are several chunks of text that were perhaps part of the SATYRICON at one time. There are detailed notes and introductions for everything. I can't imagine anything better, other than complete texts. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","review":"Rome, centuries ago..In the vast and important Greek and Roman literature from which we still live, there are just a few novelists. Maybe for an overwhelming majority of illiterates it would be much more affordable the theater, which is enough to listen, that the written narrative which must be read. The same was true of poetry and the rhapsodies recited in public.The fact is that in Greece there are only few examples of novels, apart fromDaphnis and Chloe (Oxford World's Classics), and from the Romans only Apuleius and Petronius, whose work we offer here.It appears that, at the time, the Satyricon enjoyed considerable popular success, for both Tacitus and Quintilian commented it in their manuscripts, although it is apparent that neither knew it directly, only from hearsay. It is likely that they did not grant it much literary value because its style and form collided with all the concepts in vogue.However, the Satyricon was not lost and copies were kept in the Middle Ages, while jealously concealed because of its subject matter [pederasty] and for being the work of a pagan. The work continued to be ignored by the public to the point that only scholars knew its title, but believed it was lost.Therefore, a scandal broke when, in 1664, appeared the first edition of Pierre Petit.Soon after, the Satyricon was translated into several languages, including ours, with such success that has made it one of the great bestsellers in history. There were those who sought to take advantage that the work is incomplete, rewriting it to their liking. It was easy nevertheless to expose them.Presumably, however, the author would not work at top speed like if we should go to a literary prize. He seems to have devoted years to this task. Do not forget that what is now known are only fragments of the original, estimated in twenty books. He might have started writing when Caligula reigned and Nero followed, to see the publication during the reign of the next emperor. It can be no coincidence that the book mentions contemporary events known to all, or that the author considered worth mentioning many names.This is a job too conscientious not to be the work of a professional. Moreover, the action does not take place in Rome, but in the provinces and almost none of the men are Latins. It seems as if the author had had an interest in showing the reality of the empire, a reality ignored in the capital.The novel consists merely of the travel story of Encolpius and his servant Gitone through different locations. The incidents, sometimes unrelated, their adventures and the people they encounter are the text of the Satyricon, which lacks a plot as was the style of the epoch. We could actually say that it consists of countless short stories of the two protagonists. This technique influenced many centuries later the books of chivalry, the picaresque and evenDon Quixote (Penguin Classics). Throughout many incidents the author reveals us an extraordinary real view of the life in the Roman provinces, although tinged with irony.Petronius simply tells us what he saw. In a way, his novel was an approach to realism, leaving aside the epic tone of the tragedies to focus on current issues, as Aristophanes did in Greece. And that was the pattern followed by Petronius. There is a huge difference between his style and that of other contemporary writers.Poets, despite their undoubted genius, are pompous and in the tragedies the dialogues are extremely emphatic. Petronius by contrast, remains accessible to everyone. He expressed himself in a conversational tone, which justifies the use of a first person that conveys the feeling that someone is telling us a live tale. That's why today we can read his Satyricon with the same interest of his times and nothing of its freshness is lost.Writing is, in a sense, a childbirth with the same joys and suffering. Both things must have accompanied Petronius in this trip with Encolpius and Gitone through the decline of Rome.(by Jacinto Leon Ignacio)"},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","review":"The Satyricon is an interesting story on many levels. It includes a fascinating look into concepts of friendship and love in Rome, and is one important source we have for views of magic and witchcraft in Rome. The work has a great deal to tell us about Roman society, and perceptions of Roman society despite its satirical nature. Secondly, just as Livy and Virgil tend to draw a great deal from the Illiad, this work draws from the Odyssey but does so in what seems to be intended to be a humorous way. It is also an enjoyable read.The Apocolocyntosis is a humorous skit mocking the late emperor Claudius's ascent into godhood. The title includes a play on words (if Apotheosis is turning a person into a god, then Apocolocyntosis is turning a person into a gourd or pumpkin). The message seems to be that Claudius was a gambler who was more fit to be remembered for his gambling tools (made of gourd?) than honored as a god. There are subtle elements to this metaphor which are dependent on a good knowledge of the Hellenistic world (such as the widespread cult of Tyche, the goddess of luck).The translations are easy to read and well put together. This edition also adds insightful introductions and copious end-notes to help the serious student get more out of these works. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","review":"... or at least the Latin equivalent, one of those great Latin adjectives that are being dumped from English and replaced by raw slang. Scurrilous means roughly 'raunchy' or 'sleazy', but with a sharply disapproving tone to it. \\"Shameful' might also be a near synonym. The Satyricon is a scurrilous book - a collection of fragments, actually - a depiction of gluttony, pretentiousness, vulgarity, and sexual decadence: sodomy, pederasty, public intercourse, scatophilia, sadism, rape, all subjects to be laughed at uproariously. The challenges to any modern reader will be to decide whether Petronius meant his work as satire or pornography... or both... and whether he intended to censorious. Clearly the extravagance portrayed was perceived as \\"shameful\\", as scurrilous, or else it wouldn't have been funny. Another and greater challenge to the modern historian is to decipher just how realistic such a portrayal of bizarre perversion and vulgarity might be. The Roman Empire was unquestionably a marvel of administration and efficiency. It had to be, to survive the insanity at the center ... if even a tenth of the center were as corrupt as Petronius and Suetonius describe. With no means of transportation or communication faster than a man on foot or a ship with rowers, the Roman Empire was so much more secure and luxurious than any lands around it that every barbarian with a sharp stick was ready to fight his way in.Yet Nero was real. We know that. We have archaeological as well as literary evidence of the scale of his excesses. Making sense of how an administrative empire with high internal security and general satisfaction could survive Nero, and the dozens of mini-Neros implied by Petronius, is half the fun of being a historian. And if you, dear reader, have any ambition of appreciating ancient Rome historically, you must see it through the obscene descriptions of Petronius.The young Nero's personal tutor was none other than the austere stoic philosopher Seneca, and Seneca was capable of scurrility as shameful as Petronius, though never as lurid. The Apocolocyntosis (a title translated by Robert Graves as the \\"Pumkinification of Claudius\\") is a scurrilous semi-dramatic account of the efforts of the dead Emperor Claudius to claim his rights as a demi-god, with a place on Olympus. Like several of the plays attributed to Seneca, it was obviously written to amuse and to curry favor with Nero, Claudius's successor. We all know that Seneca's boot-licking failed in the end; Nero ordered him to commit suicide.These two translations were done in the 1960s, a time when the late Victorian conventions of language still prevailed. The vocabulary of sexuality and body functions is a good deal less blunt here in English than in the original Latin, but perhaps our modern imaginations are more attuned to euphemisms.This society of rich slaves, imperious freedmen, opulent prostitute priestesses, and the unchallengeable privilege of the super rich was the substrate of Christianity, and of Islam, and of the modern world. Get to know it. From Petronius's Trimalchio to the Renaissance Popes and to the Saudi Kings is a direct historical progression."},{"Title":"The Satyricon (The 100 Greatest Books of All Time)","review":"Lacking the complete text, which is probably forever lost, this surviving material is still a very entertaining look into Roman life and culture. It offers perspectives that you will find no where else in classical literature, often very humorous. I've wanted to read this text for many years and was not dissapointed when I final picked it up. Those who are reading this review are likely aware of how frequently this work has been cited and referenced by more modern writers, and upon reading it one can easily see why that is so.

So I really wanted to like this book. I tried to read it several times and was never able to get through more than 40-50 pages. Paxton made an earthquake, a volcano eruption and the death of an entire civilization so boring I kept falling asleep. Dozens and dozens of names are mentioned in the first 50 or so pages. Most of these people are never seen or heard from again. Characters that do make it into the story are so one-sided and shallow that there is no way to get engaged in the story. I kept re-reading sections just to figure out what was going on and remember who was related to whom. I finally gave up, it just wasn't worth the effort."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"For whatever reason, I love Marion Zimmer Bradley's books - love reading about the Goddess, love reading about pre Christian UK, etc. Some of the books though, are a bit violent, all the feuding, etc. This book warmed my heart. Enjoyed her version of how Atlantis \\"ended\\". Loved reading about the red and white spring in the \\"summer country\\". Talked about how Stonehenge came into being. Talked about the maze on the Tor. Made me remember the wonderful times I've had at the Chalice well and on the Tor. Some very nice hymns, chants,etc. Enjoyed Tiriki and Micail. Good read for me. Sorry when it ended."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"Like everyone else here, I had loved (and I do mean loved!) the Avalon series. I felt that no one portrayed the preChristian land of Britain more brillantly or more indepth than Ms. Zimmer Bradley and I deeply mourned her passing. I was thrilled to hear of this new novel, thinking that it would continue the story alluded to by the past life memories of several of the Avalon characters. Well, even if there was much connection (which I didn't see), the style of writing and the character portrayals were lack lustre at best. I literally had to force myself to get through the book and greatly regretted the time I had wasted on it. I feel like Ms. Paxton is simply capitalizing on the Avalon brand name and is not putting forth any effort on her own part. If you love the Avalon series, stick with the true Zimmer Bradley books and avoid this one. It's not part of the series, it wasn't written by her, and it is no where near the glorious and brillant world of myth and magic which Marion had created."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"As other reviewers have said this book does not do MZB justice. however I have read other books where MZB was not the only writer and felt I new what to expect.For me I loved the book.

The survivors of Atlantis fled to the wild lands of the north in an attempt to continue their civilization but once they arrived they discovered that the Goddess has preceeded them and, as they adapted to this new land, the Atlanteans found that they had brought along some other things - greed, lust for power and prejudice to name a few. As the refugees and the natives learned from another they forged a society that would in time become Avalon.This is a prequel to Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series. It follows Bradley's THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, one of her earlier works. Diana Paxson, the author of this work, had collaborated with Bradley and picks up the Atlantis thread a few years after THE FALL OF ATLANTIS ended. The babies that were born at the end of that work are now grown and face the consequences of the older generation. Paxson has a good grasp of Bradley's style and voice. This novel fits in well with the Atlantis/Avalon world that Bradley created. Is this then as good as MISTS OF AVALON, no not quite, but then neither were some of Bradley's later works either. This is a very good story in its own right. It is best understood and appreciated if read after FALL OF ATLANTIS. The biggest flaws I can find with ANCESTORS OF AVALON is that it has a huge cast of characters, the action divides to two locations for most of the book into two complicated situtation each full of subplots that make it difficult for the reader to keep everything straight. The characters do not come to live as vividly as Bradley's and sometimes it is not quite clear what the motivations for their actions are.For fans of this series this is a must read. For anyone who enjoys this genre this series is a treasure but I would not recommend this particular book as a good place to start. Begin with THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, or the Avalon stories."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"The story starts off slow and takes awhile to pick up the pace.

Separated they make their way on separate ships north to the the island of Britain. Neither knows if the other is alive, and they must survive in radically different situations that will not only challenge their marriage vows, but also their view of their life's purpose.In \\"Ancestors of Avalon\\" Diana Paxson weaves the story of the founding of the order of priestesses on the Isle of Avalon and the building of Stonehenge in with the fall of Atlantis. This is a moderately interesting book that tells a big story, spans about a decade of time, and answers a lot of questions raised by Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series. A good novel not only draws you into a cleverly conceived situation, but it makes you care for the people in the situation. Although I rooted for the good guys I was not emotionally involved. Paxson could have done a better job on character development. However, the book was fun to read during that hour before I go to sleep at night."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"I am glad I read Ancestors of Avalon even though it lacked the magic of MZB's previous books.It wasn't true to MZB's style.I am sorry to say that DP didn't do it justice.I felt disconnected from the characters.Some of the wording and phrases didnot flow for me.I will cherish MZB's Avalon saga and put this book on the shelf next to the rest.Thanks Ms.Paxson for trying to fill such big shoes.Eldri"},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"ANCESTORS OF AVALON is the missing link in Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon sequence. It ties together Bradley's novel of Atlantis, THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, with the THE MISTS OF AVALON and its prequels. It is questionable whether it was really neccessary to have this novel written, because the other entries in this series can stand solidly on their own, but if Bradley had lived a littler longer, and if she had been in good health, she probably would have written it herself, so it is justifiable that Diana L. Paxson, who had such a close relationship with Bradley, wrote the novel after Bradley's notes and ideas (and with the help and knowledge of Bradley's oldest son David). Diana L. Paxson is a skillful writer herself with over twenty novels to her credit, and she has made a name for herself with splendid historical fantasies about the British Isles such as THE WHITE RAVEN or the four books of THE HOLLOWED ISLE. Diana L. Paxson is unable to write an ungraceful story, and this is no exception. This is, however, not a good starting point for readers who are unfamiliar with the Avalon novels, but rather for experienced Bradley readers who want to return to Avalon one last time."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"Well, I can tell you that Marion Zimmer Bradley may have started to write this book....or had the idea of writing it, but Diana Paxon is not, and never will match the gift that Marion Zimmer Bradley had with words and story craft.I couldn't get into it...I may finish it one day. Then again, maybe not."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"\\"Ancestors of Avalon\\" is written in Zimmer Bradley's unique and detailed style, much as her other books of the Arthurian legend and her science fiction series have made her famous. The reader feels as if s/he is actually there because the characters are drawn so vividly. Her knowledge of the Atlantean legend, probably gleaned from the Edgar Cayce readings, and her detailed description of Ancient Southwestern England makes for a book that is hard to put down.

Recently I came upon \\"The Fall of Atlantis\\" and although the amount of characters in such a small book was rather overwhelming, I managed to love and understand each of them as only MZB can make you do.\\"Ancestors of Avalon\\" connects MZB's Atlantis story to Avalon and makes us believe that both places did actually exist. Diana L Paxson has her own style and takes a little getting used to on the heels of a MZB read. I had to console myself once or twice at her usage of modern vernacular that totally shocked me out of this wonderful world of the ancient past.

I highly recommend it for any other enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"This book did explain some things, but honestly? It could have been much better. If you're just getting into the Avalon books, this should probably be the last one you read, and not the first. The Mists Of Avalon should be your first one.Also, before you read this, you should really read The Fall Of Atlantis... The reason I say that is because it makes things SO much clearer. It makes things easier to understand \\"How on earth did they GET to this?

I generally prefer the ones written strictly by Marion Zimmer Bradley, but knowing that Diana Paxson knew Marion's intentions helped & it almost feels like a channeled work in some places.

If you enjoyed the other books you should definitely read this one."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"The world of fantasy lost a great voice when Marion Zimmer Bradley died. Her prot&eacute;g&eacute; and collaborator, Diana Paxson, deserves credit for trying to keep that voice alive.Now please, don't ever do it again.There is so much wrong with \\"Ancestors of Avalon\\" I don't even know where to begin. How about the fact that the book is entirely unnecessary? From veiled hints and glimpses of past incarnations, astute readers will have already managed to piece together a pretty good idea of how the vows of Deoris and Domaris, the two sisters from \\"Fall of Atlantis,\\" shaped the world and lineage of Avalon. Why, then, do we need to hear the specifics of how the Atlantean refugees built Stonehenge, or settled at the Tor? Short answer: We don't. Long answer: We don't, and thanks a lot for boring us with it anyway.Then there's Paxson's writing style, which is unfortunately so inferior to MZB's that I had to go back and read \\"Fall of Atlantis\\" just to cleanse the bad taste out of my mouth. Every sentence is either ridiculously expository or hopelessly vague. And the exclamation points! So annoying! Like a ninth-grader's email! Furthermore, the story just DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I'm sorry, but Micail and Tiriki end up the equivalent of three towns over from each other, but they don't find each other for FIVE YEARS?Speaking of the characters, most are so poorly drawn that at times I literally could not remember whether certain characters were even male or female. And far from MZB's wonderfully nuanced and conflicted portrayals of, say, Riveda or Lancelot, here all we get are cartoons. In Paxon's Avalon, anyone who was rich and privileged in Atlantis will invariably become a power-mad egomaniac bent on exploiting the British natives, while her \\"good-hearted\\" characters love their savage brethren and rail against the injustices of their countrymen. Oh no! Damisa thinks. Will I join the clearly delineated forces of evil and enslave the natives so I can keep wearing silk and drinking decent wine, or will I become a force of truth, justice, and the Atlantean way by painting myself blue and grubbing in the muck in a thinly veiled attempt at atonement for my race's arrogance? Boooring.If you're a fan of \\"Mists of Avalon\\" I know you think you need to read this book, but honestly, you don't, and you shouldn't. Sometimes certain things are better left unsaid, and this story is one of them."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"When I learned that a new installment in the Avalon series was published, I was thrilled. \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is one of my favorite novels and I have read all of Bradley's other novels in the series. Diana L. Paxson who collaberated with Bradley on one of the Avalon books, decided to take on the prequal and link Bradley's Avalon series with Bradley's Atlantis novel. She should have left both alone.Paxson cannot write. I would go as far as to call her work drivvel. It was terrible. The chacters were unsympathetic and hollow. They contained no substance whatsoever and as a reader I could not connect with them. Their speech was all wrong as well. Paxson had the characters swearing and using modern day slang! The whole novel was contrived, poorly written and not at all inline with Bradley's previous writings.I cannot advise anyone to read this novel, it was so poor."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"I'm a huge MZB fan, so I had to get this. I'm really discouraged by Paxon's work. The effort to make a storyline was a good one, the result was not.There are too many characters and it's difficult to tell them apart, they're so similiar! Part of the cast ends up in one place, the other in another. While there is a list of characters and a brief, one-line description at the beginning of the novel, it's just not nearly enough. I was reading about one girl, and I was asking myself, \\"Who is this? Elara? Cleta? Damisa?\\" They're really that indistinguishable.The characters are also very static. The good ones do No Wrong. the bad ones are Suspects From the Start. What I enjoyed about MZB's books is that the characters were like real people--they made some bad choices, some good, some totally uncomprehensible.AoA does explain the transition from Sun-worship (masculine) to Moon-worship (feminine), and I'll give Paxton credit for that."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"Out of loyality to Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece \\"The Mists of Avalon\\", I really tried very hard to get into this book.

I forced myself to get to page 174 (because of the money I spent on this) and decided I'm not going to torture myself anymore.

I understand that Ms. Bradley was planning on making a book that connect 'Fall of Atlantis' to 'Mists of Avalon' and all those books, but she sadly left us, and Ms. Paxson should have left the series alone instead of tainting it. I can see Ms. Bradley rolling over in her grave right now."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"I love Marion Zimmer Bradley's self written Avalon books. Their mixture of the conflicting pagan and chirstian religions, history, and fantasy were nothing short of to/die/for. I was astounded when I saw this book was being released (awhile ago). I saw that it was actually written by Bradley's protege: Diana Paxson. I haven't read any full novels by her (are there any?) but I have read many short stories and for the most part they range from good to excellent, so I was sort of expecting Marion Zimmer Bradley quality, unfortunately I expected too much.The feel I got while reading this was that of the pulpy fantasy books ala Dragonlance series and the such. You know the ones, where an author spews out 3 or 4 books a month in the series and the stories are all similar. That's how I felt with this. Plus the names, gods the names! Some of them were okay, but Tiriki?! Come on! And I hate those hyphenated names, so pulp fantasy! Feel free to add some realism to fantasy, it makes is so much better. Another complaint was the believability of characters, especially between the Priest Micail and Preistess (groan) Tiriki. They are husband and wife, lovers. It is very unrealistic that they would always agree on every single issue of everything *lovingly*! That never happens. People are different and disagree! Gah! Those characters and other just seemed to be cardboard cutouts and you really didn't care about them (unlike in The Mists of Avalon).And my! Final! Complaint!!!! !!! Guess what it is! It seemed about every other sentence of dialogue had an exclamation mark. That is way to much and out of place. It was horrific.Other than that it was a decently average read. I'm not going to throw it out or disown the author. I'm a completist and want to have all the Avalon books. Plus I would read it again if I want to read the series in chronological order (again).

Noticed another name. Ohhhhh, I get it. On my return flight terminal bookstore, literally angry at the void this farce had created, I demanded my money back on the terms that the cover was depressingly misleading. They complied. Being an arist myself, and continually trying to see art from every non-judgemental side, it's quite difficult for me to write such a negative review.

Atlantis is doomed. Its people, from craftsmen to priests and priestesses, are now refugees seeking a new home.The horrific situation in which they find themselves is an opportunity for an author to build to climax after climax, to give her readers a roller-coaster of a ride. Having read Ms. Paxson's Hallowed Isles series, I expected as much.It wasn't there.The characters are flat and wishy-washy. The women are way too upbeat. (Did they have Happy Pills in 2,000 B.C.?) A princess, Damisa, promised to be interesting, but she turns out to be only slightly less milquetoasty. Micail, a priest and prince, and supposedly one of the wisest, is convinced that a foolish assumption is true.The priestesses are almost always smiling, walking on the sunny side of the street. That outlook seems to come not from wisdom, spirituality and knowledge, but from a lack.As for the story, there's little edge or conflict. Oh, there's plenty of potential for it! Which makes it all the more disappointing that such opportunities are blanched over. Everyone's just so gosh-darn nice.I liked the beginning, the sense of history it gave. And I like how \\"magic\\" is presented, as a real force that, used properly, maintains a balance of Earth's powers; how the loss of their islands is the result of good intentions gone bad (though evil intentions would've given the story some kick).I wonder if Ms. Paxson may have felt restrained by carrying on MZB's mission. Perhaps her hands were tied and she wasn't given free reign to write the story in her own way?It's a pleasant read, but only a mildly interesting one."},{"Title":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Ancestors of Avalon","review":"The things that compelled me to read this book were: 1.

This series is just SO fascinating... how could i NOT read it? It's REQUIRED reading! :)It was an enjoyable read overall, but not superb..some parts made me not want to put the book down, some parts were slow..and unfortunately, the ending was disappointing. I enjoy both authors' works, so writing style wasnt a problem. After reading some of the other reviewers thoughts on that subject... I have to say not all of MZB's novels were perfection, and Ms. Paxson has written some amazing books. They are equally good writers. But, the story was sort of just a repeat of some of the other themes of the Avalon series...like the relationship between Tiriki and Micael.. it felt like we've already heard that story.However, what reader of the Avalon series could NOT read this book? It would be like a Star Wars Fan refusing to see Episode I.

Still, one can't fail to read the recollections and opinions of someone like Bearden who was involved with so much. The first 40-50% of the book (and it's a big book!) is hard to follow because it skips around among different persons and places; it's hard to keep them straight, especially the Russians. When the narrative comes back to someone mentioned previously, it's often hard to remember who they are. After that, as it moves into the recent decade--fall of the Iron Curtain--readers will be fascinated to read of the inside look at things still fresh in their own memory. Bearden had quite a career and you can get a good feel for it here; the epilogue alone is a good summary of the recent ordeals of the CIA."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"There's lot of spy vs. spy folklore here but it's presented in a format that really jumps around, making it unnecessarily confusing. The story of the CIA's operations in Afghanistan could have made a separate book and doesn't fit with the rest of the more familiar spy games. In fact, that book has already been written- Ghost Wars, the Pulitzer-Prize winner by Steve Coll. It seems like Bearden wasn't sure whether he wanted to write an autobiography or a history of CIA operations."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This is what appears to be an extremely authentic and insightful look at the last decades of the struggle between Russian and American intelligence. The author writes with authority and conviction in an engaging manner that makes this book a very enjoyable read. Overall, one comes away from this one with the impression that the KGB somewhat edged out the CIA in terms of competence, but that the CIA, as the author says, at the end of the day was \\"good enough\\" to protect America until the Soviet system imploded. Both agencies penetrated the other at various times, but the KGB, with Aldrich Ames within the CIA and Robert Hanssen within the FBI, appears to have gotten the better of the CIA. Nonetheless the CIA was not without its victories, although many \\"KGB turncoats\\" turned out to be double agents who fed the CIA disinformation.The author is particularly engaging when writing about the US effort to subvert the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, and the final days of the Soviet Union. In Afghanistan the Soviets learned in full why that country has been termed \\"the graveyard of Empires.\\" (A lesson America is learning today.) We learn that when the East Bloc and Soviet systems came to their abrupt ends that American intelligence did not see it coming and neither did the Soviets. The Soviet system was apparently appallingly weak economically and no longer able to bear the burdens of a corrupt inefficient economy, aid to Soviet satellite states, and irrationally high military expenditures. The CIA should doubtless have understood this better but did not.One ominous conclusion of the author is that Hanssen and Ames were not the only Russian moles within American intelligence. He believes that there were others who were never found and thus may be in place today.I deprived this excellent piece of one star because of its chaotic organization. It jumps from event to event in abrupt style, switching between first and third person in an occasionally confusing manner. Nonetheless, this is a good read that those interested in international espionage should not miss. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This book is indeed a quick and delightful read that shows an insider's view of the CIA during the late 80s and early 90s. It is also a condensed 'point of view' based on the author's interpretation of events and his level of access to information of those events. As the book went through CIA review prior to publishing, it no doubt has been sanitized to some extent, but should prove worthy in the end of those who desire that some light be shed on the demise of the Soviet Union. While it reads like a good spy novel, it does reveal some insight into the waning years and months of the Soviet Union and should be logged into the annals of historical documentation from an individual on the inside of an extremely strong governmental force that worked toward the end of the Soviet Union. Read it with an open mind, and enjoy the style and pace with which it is written. It is not boring and it does provide a window into our country's 'dirty work'."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The first hand accounts of the successes and failures of the CIA and KGB and the explanations for those successes and failures added to my knowledge of those events as I recalled reading about some of the events reported by the news agencies.

Lots of \\"Ahhh, so that's what happened\\" moments."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"While I have a deep appreciation for the thoroughness of this effort, I have to admit that this book got a little tiresome toward the end. Considering it was released in 2003, this may be a little bit of Monday Morning Quarterbacking, but the entire section on Afghanistan was somewhat superfluous due to everything out there about Charlie Wilson; not to mention the end-all, be-all conversation ender that Ghost Wars is on the subject. That being said, this book can be extremely fun and exciting to read. Reading about Soviet moles revealing the CIA's agents will hurt, but you'll find yourself rooting for every successful operation as it unfolds. More than anything else, this book will show you in painstaking detail and excruciating description how devastating espionage is to American national security. Though it is long, I'd still highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"The book provides some insight into the working habits and the nature of the environment in which intelligence officers worked in. For both sides, during the ending of the cold war the descriptions and facts are impressive. Previous operations and what type of mind set was needed to get the job done. The author did explain some details of the more known names as Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen were introduced to show the confusion and external forces as they flipped spies for information. The names of other officers who lost their lives as one of their own leaked it. The authors did a great job explaining the details and I enjoyed reading the book, twice.

Remarkable stories about \\"Year of the Spy\\", detailing the spy cases of the most valuable CIA spy netwotk in USSR. Excellent reviews about Tolkachev, Ames and Hanssen spy cases. Also interesting are the author's experience in Afghanistan and the last years of communism in Eastern Europe.Finally, the last part (Epilogue) promised something new for future: the posibility that could exist \\"a fourth mole\\" (undiscovered) within US intelligence. For the first time we have very accurate information and a professional analysis about this posibility; together with Cherkashin's \\"Spy handler\\", who also confirmed Bearden's hypothesis, we truly have an undiscovered and intriguing case for the future.A very comprehensive volume that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This is written less like a story and more like a history book. The language is usually dry and factual, and not structured in a storybook way (i.e. often you are told the outcome of a particular anecdote at the beginning, so the rest isn't exciting and/or mysterious). If you are a history buff, you'd probably like it, otherwise it's kind of interesting but not as enjoyable as I thought it would be."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"It turns out that Milt Bearden (one of the authors) won the Cold War, and here he tells you how. I'm joking, however the story follows Bearden through his CIA career up to the fall of the Soviet Union. There are three major parts to the story - initially the year 1985,when the KGB captured almost every spy the CIA had in Moscow - the work of a series of spies in the CIA and FBI; the second part is the covert supply of Afghan rebels and the third is again the Eastern European scene in 1989-91. I have always wondered why the West was taken so much by surprise by the fall of the Berlin Wall and this book goes some way towards explaining why.The intriguing part of the first section of the book is the methods by which spies were recruited (or volunteered) to the CIA. There are a number of accounts of civilians throwing notes into cars driven by American diplomats, usually these were unsigned, so to re-establish contact was usually a challenge. In one case the attempts to reconnect led to the CIA giving a reply to the wrong person, which ultimately led the KGB to uncover the potential agent; presumably with ghastly consequences.Quite a number of spies within Russian Intelligence were recruited when they ran into financial difficulties within their own agencies - they had misappropriated funds and went to the CIA to replenish the missing money before an internal audit. All very human, but not heroic.The Afghan section of the book is written with one eye on September 11 and the war on Terror. The American's were enthusiastic suppliers of weapons and satellite intelligence to the Afghans, but Bearden is keen to show that this was moderated at all times by the Pakistani Intelligence service (the ISI). I presume this is true, but it also reads like a \`not my fault'. The book is clear sighted about the need to come to arrangements (bribe) the warlords in Afghanistan, in order to make any political progress.The latter part of the book deals with the European consequences from the fall of the Berlin wall, I had expected this to be the most exciting, however it was actually a recitation of known events. It turns out that both the CIA and KGB were following events on CNN, as neither had any inside knowledge of what was happening. The only time the CIA got ahead of the game was giving warnings about the possible coup against Gorbachev and, when it went ahead, predicting its collapse. It seems this came from the CIA's semi-overt contact with the KGB, knowing that there were elements within it very hostile to reform and then making the assessment of the divisions and inertia within the organisation when the coup had taken place.Overall a realistic description of the latter stages of the Cold War espionage struggle. Its hard to know how useful it was. There are references to books written by the CIA's KGB counter parts, I think these might be useful to read. There are some claims that the CIA helped uncover military secrets that kept the US ahead of Soviet countermeasures. Bearden also claims that the CIA employed up to 2,000 analysts, while the KGB had very view - I wonder whether their output was useful."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"My introduction to Milt Bearden came from reading \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\" by George Crile. A great book by the way, I would highly recommend it.I would recommend this book to people who are interested in Cold War history.My only dissapointment with this book is that in the epilogue Milt doesn't approach the question of whether or not the rules have changed from when he was chief of the SE Division, and if those changes are for the better. For example, let's take \\"extraordinary renditions\\" - in the days when Milt was chief of SE Division the unwritten rule was that USA and USSR didn't kill or unduly rough up each other's spies. Now that we engage in those kinds of activities, are our CIA operatives in the DO more cautious? Are there more restrictions on their movements when they are overseas? And has the change in methods and attitudes affected our relationships with other intelligence agencies, and if so, for the better or for the worse?"},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"It is good to see a book written about the late stages and aftermath of the Cold War by someone who was actually involved in it and committed to the American side at the time. The straight CIA-KGB stuff at the beginning can be a tad frustrating as it is more anecdotal than analytic, more spy story than retrospective scrutiny. And when the spy narratives resurface at the end amid the USSR's dissolution they go little beyond what was known at the time from the headlines. But the Afghanistan stuff is truly fascinating. Bearden reveals how flawed, indeed sometimes ludicrous, the Soviet rationale both for invading Afghanistan and staying there after 1985 truly was. The Stinger missile technology was only used in Afghanistan after the US became convinced that the Soviets already knew of it so using it in a place where the USSR was bound to capture some evidence of it did not jeopardize the integrity of the technology. This is illustrative of an epistemological paradox--tools which can be effectively deployed are tools whose secret is already known and thus cannot be given away; transparency was, in this case, more efficacious against the enemy than mystery. By being known, the Stingers escaped the net of deterrence that held everything in seeming deadlock, and this was certainly a turning point in the Afghanistan war and perhaps the Cold War as well. Another memorable episode occurs when the Mujahedin use a Stinger to shoot down a Soviet MI-24D attack helicopter and Bearden, monitoring events in Islamabad, sees a video of a dead Soviet soldier of about twenty; realizing it looks too much like a 'typical' American soldier for comfort, he does not transmit it back to Washington along with the rest of the information about the effectiveness of the Stingers. This is not only a moving revelation of humanity and compassion on the part of a hardened operative in the midst of the global chess game but an anecdote rife with implications both for the nature of the Cold War as well, of course, for events in Afghanistan today. Bearden explicitly compares Operating Enduring Freedom to the Soviet Afghan experience. In fact sometimes the similarities he observes are misleading if taken literally because, though the terrain and even some of the personalities have remained the same, the global framework is so different. Bearden is a straight shooter but he has also thought about the events in which he was involved. He and his collaborator James Risen have made this a rich and rewarding book, written with narrative flair, that is a quick and riveting reading experience. Though an ardent Cold Warrior, and justifiably so, he is an independent thinker and does not necessarily ratify consensus. The photographs included also tell many stories in themselves."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"Very well written, easy to read novel with great insight into the end of the Cold War. Both sides of the conflict is explained, helping us remember that there is always two sides, both feeling that the job they are doing is for the good of their country and cause."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This book is a fine read, and to my surprise, the contributions from The New York Times are quite worthwhile. In essence the primary author, Milton Beardon, wrote the core of the book, on his experiences with the Soviet Division in the Directorate of Operations at the CIA, and in Afghanistan and Pakistan driving the Soviets in Afghanistan, and then journalist James Risen filled in the gaps with really excellent vignettes from the other side. The two authors together make a fine team, and they have very capably exploited a number of former KGB and GRU officers whose recollections round out the story.This is not, by any means, a complete story. At the end of thise review I recommend five other books that add considerable detail to a confrontation that spanned the globe for a half-century. Yet, while it barely scratches the surface, this book is both historical and essential in understanding two facts:1) Afghanistan was the beginning of the end for USSR and2) CIA made it happen, once invigorated by President Ronald Reagan and DCI William CaseyIt may not be immediately apparent to the casual reader, but that is the most important story being told in this book: how the collapse of the Soviet effort in Afghanistan ultimately led to the collapse of Soviet authority in East Germany, in the other satellite states, and eventually to the unification of Germany and the survival of Russas as a great state but no longer an evil empire.There are two other stories in this book, and both are priceless. The first is a tale of counterintelligence failure across the board within both the CIA and the FBI. The author excels with many \\"insider\\" perspectives and quotes, ranging from his proper and brutal indictment of then DCI Stansfield Turner for destroying the clandestine service, to his quote from a subordinate, based on a real-world case, that even the Ghanians can penetrate this place. He has many \\"lessons learned\\" from the Howard and Ames situations, including how badly the CIA handled Howard's dismissal, how badly CIA handled Yuchenko, to include leaking his secrets to the press, how badly both CIA and FBI handled the surveillance on Howard, with too many \\"new guys\\" at critical points of failure; and most interestingly, how both DCI Casey and CIA counterintelligence chiefs Gus Hathaway (and his deputy Ted Price) refused to launch a serious hunt for Ames and specifically refused to authorize polygraphs across the board (although Ames beat a scheduled polygraph later). The author's accounting of the agent-by-agent losses suffered by the CIA as Howard, Ames, and Hansen took their toll, is absolutely gripping.The second story is that of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and how the anti-Soviet jihad nurtured by America and Pakistan ultimately turned back on both countries. It may help the reader of this book to first buy and read Milt Bearden's novel, \\"The Black Tulip,\\" a wonderful and smoothly flowing account in novelized terms. From the primary author's point of view, it was Afghanistan, not Star Wars, that brought the Soviet Union to its knees. The primary author provides the reader with really superb descriptions of the seven key Afghan warlord leaders; of the intricacies of the Pakistani intelligence service, which had its own zealots, including one who launched jihad across in to Uzbeckistan without orders; into how the Stingers, and then anti-armor, and then extended mortars (with novel combinations of Geographical Information System computers and satellite provided coordinates for Soviet targets, all 21st century equipment that was quickly mastered by the Afghan warriors) all helped turn the tide. As America continues to fail in its quest to reconstruct the road of Afghanistan, having severely misunderstood the logistics and other obstacles, one of the book's sentences really leaps out: the supply chain to the rebels \\"needed more mules than the world was prepared to breed.\\"This book is a collector's item and must be in the library of anyone concerned with intelligence, US-Soviet relations, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Saudi funding of terrorism. It is a finely crafted personal contribution from someone who did hard time in the CIA, and made an enormous personal contribution, in partnership with the hundreds of CIA case officers, reports officers, all-source analysts, and especially CIA paramilitary officers (including Nick Pratt and Steve Cash, forever Marines).A few other books that complement this one: Thomas Allen & Norman Polmar, \\"Merchants of Treason\\", Ladislav Bittman, \\"The Deception Game\\", Vladimir Sakharov, \\"High Treason\\", Victor Sheymov, \\"Tower of Secrets,\\" and Oleg Kalugin, \\"The First Directorate.\\" There are many more but these are my favorites."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"by Richard Sale, UPI Terrorism CorrespondentThe U.S.-Soviet war of spies was essentially a war about &quot;denied areas&quot; -- breaching those inner circles of government secrecy whose existence is existence is essential to national security and military supremancy.For both sides, this meant recruiting defectors in place -- agents with access to denied areas and who were spotted, conditioned, recruited and trained to betray their countries' vital information. (Sometimes they volunteered.) Since government's do not act on a single piece of information, an agent's production must be sustained over a signficant period of time, and it should go without saying that the value of the information is go reat that the recruiters will hazard almost any risk to get it.This brutal war of brains is the subject of a new classic of intelligence literature by Milt Bearden, a true CIA legend, and James Risen, a first-rate reporter on intelligence for the New York Times.Called, &quot;The Main Enemy,&quot; the book opens in 1985, when the FBI and the CIA had suffered a series of disatrous losses among the Russians they had recruited. It is with intense disquiet that the reader comes to realize that top U.S. assets are one by one coming under the dominion of a dark power. Within a space of 15 months, like night lights in a distant village winking out, two dozen priceless Soviet spies working for America are recalled to Moscow, interrogated, and many shot in the back of the head in a KGB prison including a 65-year-old Russian grandfather Gen. Dmitri Polyakov or &quot;TOPHAT,&quot; of the agency's and FBI's most irreplaceable and beloved sources.The book is built around a rough chronology of Bearden's career, which poses a narrative problem mainly because right in the middle of the spy hunt for moles, Bearden is pulled out of Washington and made head of CIA operations in Afghanistan to bolster anti-Soviet mujahideen fighters there. This is an arresting section of the book in which we view one colorful tableaux after the next.After the Russians are defeated Bearden returns to Washington and to his dismay finds that the probe for the mole who caused the losses is continuing but has lost its focus and become feeble. The climax comes when a CIA investigator helps to uncover Aldrich Ames, an agency traitor arrested in Februrary 1994.By 1990, communism had collapsed but questions about the mole remained. Many were answered when FBI agent Robert Hanssenis finally uncovered.But Bearden still believes that another extraordinary effective U.S. traitor is still at large and doing damage, and he sets out his case.It is a gripping book of extraordinary sweep and signifcance. In putting it together, Bearden and Risen have produced a work of the first distinction."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This is the story gathered through hundreds of interviews with both US and USSR players of the battle between the CIA and KGB in the closing days of the Cold War, 1985 through the collapse of the Soviet Union.Part I, Year of the Spy tells of the efforts to \\"turn\\" KGB agents, Government officials and high-ranking military and subsequent contacts by their American controllers. We're told of the constant surveillance of embassy officials, the training of new agents, tricks for eluding tails. Surprising to me was the involvement of spouses who often accompanied the agents on \\"runs\\" or otherwise aided the agents. In training there would be surprise arrests that would seem real to the agents, they would include a roughing up by FBI agents. The test for the agent was to hold back his CIA connection.Starting in 1985 a string of our moles were arrested by the KGB. Despite ridicule of James Jesus Angleton whose paranoia about moles inside the CIA was legend, it appeared now that his paranoia was well-placed.The luring of moles, their exchanges of money and information at drop points are covered from both sides. For example meticulous planning has gone into a \\"run,\\" i.e., CIA meeting with a KGB agent to exchange money, needs, information. The story is told by the US agent arriving at the drop site, having shaken his KGB tail; the same story is then told by KGB officials who are setting him up and the capture of the spy (a scientist in this case).Almost at the same time, June '85, Aldrich Ames was meeting in DC with his Russian handler, delivering to him the name of every spy he knew. He did this because John Walker, US Navy man, had been arrested in May as a Russian spy. Ames feared Walker had been fingered to the FBI by someone in the KGB that the CIA had previously \\"turned.\\" He didn't want the same fate.In their recruitment efforts the CIA always had to be on the alert for \\"dangles.\\" These were spies trying to be double agents. Some of the Russians turned for money, some for ideology, a hatred for the Communist system. Edward Lee Howard was a CIA agent who was fired by the CIA and who betrayed us out of his anger over what he thought was unfair treatment. He eluded capture and escaped to Russia with help from his wife, his training in eluding tails, and the incompetence of the FBI.There were constant turf wars between the FBI and CIA which sometimes got in the way.Robert Hanssen (FBI) started spying in 1979. Among information turned over to the KGB was his revealing to them the spy tunnel under the Soviet embassy in DC.There were many more tales of recruitment, capture and sometimes execution.Part II, Afghanistan. In December 1979 Russia invaded Afghanistan. They were fearful of the country coming under the sphere of the US, further completing the ring around the USSR.When the British decided decades earlier to withdraw from Afghanistan, the cost of marching out was horrific, 16,000 men were reduced to 1 left standingAfter the loss of 15,000 soldiers, in 1986 Gorbachev decided enough was enough. He wanted to get out, but how to do it without looking like the US in Vietnam or with the costs the British incurred.US efforts helped Gorbachev reach his decision to exit. We had been pouring in money and arms. The destruction of a huge Russian arms depot was pivotal in firming up his mind as was the introduction of Stinger missiles and advanced anti-tank weapons, both of which produced spectacular results.They managed the withdrawal at a minimum loss of life. Then began the tribal chiefs dislodging the puppet leader in Kabul and the jockeying amongst themselves for leadership.Part III, Endgame. The story here is the winding down of the Soviet Union, starting with tearing down the Berlin Wall, the role of the East German secret police, STASI and the interplay with the CIA. The dissolution of Reagan's Evil Empire, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania and the Baltic states; the fragility of the new Russia and its near fall to reactionary forces, the emergence of Yeltsin.Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 after 20 years of spying. A Russian agent provided enough information but no name, enabling the CIA to identify him. A group within the CIA had spent years trying to locate the leak that James Jesus Angleton was sure existed.Robert Hanssen was arrested in 2001 after 22 years of betrayal, his capture also aided by Russian agents.The author Milt Bearden was close to all the activities he recounts. He concluded after a thorough analysis of times and dates that there must be another mole yet to surface within the CIA.I found much of the book exciting. After all, this wasn't fiction; these were real people and events."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"Much as I have enjoyed this fascinating book, I wish to point out a startling anachronism. Bearden makes much of the delivery of the \\"120 mm Spanish mortar\\" to the Mujahideen in 1987, and elaborates on how teams were trained in applying GPS readings to precisely deliver their ordnance beyond visual range. \\"It came...with a ranging system worked out by Langley...that fused the low-tech mortar with the high-tech world of satellite guidance.\\" And \\"Once their exact coordinates had been calibrated, the leader of the team would feed the GPS data into a small computer, add the coordinates of the target, and then query the computer for the precise compass direction and elevation...\\" This procedure, GPS and all, supposedly led to devastating night attacks on the Spetsnaz battalion at Chagasaray on 28 Nov 1987 and 15 Dec 1987.Problem: Although initial use of GPS was reported in 1990, it did not become operational until 1993. In 1987 the satellites had not been launched yet (this was during the Challenger stand-down).We can only conclude that while the attacks and the mortars were real, the procedures and the \\"ranging\\" method used must have been invented by the authors for literary convenience. No doubt this is the ghost writer's shortcut, not Bearden's, but this does raise questions about technical accuracy throughout the volume."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This reviewer served in Embassy Pakistan for two years from the week the author arrived in mid-1986 as Chief of Station, Islamabad.In a government career that spanned twenty-five years, he was, without a doubt, the best Agency operator and manager ever encountered. Looking back on events, what was accomplished under our watch was not only important, it was truly exciting.This book, especially the middle third that deals with the war in Afghanistan, is right on the mark. In fact, I learned things in this book that I never knew about at the time as I did not have the \\"need to know.\\"This book has a very important story to tell on a critical junction-point in the resolution of the Cold War told by the man at the tip of the spear. In all areas where I have direct knowledge, there is not one instance where I felt he was less than totally objective. Most remarkably, he made what he did seem effortless and, more importantly to me, he did it with elan. His troops relished every minute of every day -- unless they dropped the ball. One lapse and there was all hell to pay.The seriously broad scope of this book is such that, clearly, there was simply not enough pages to encompass all the many peripheral stories that might have been mentioned. Anecdotes and telling detail abound throughout but there are many more tales that could have been told that would make the reader drop the book in sheer glee. Of the many that do make it into the text, the one on the exchange of cables between the field and Langley on the \\"specifications\\" for mules delivered to portage materiel into the Afghan war zone, is, without a doubt, a classic.For those of us then in Islamabad who fought in Viet Nam and saw it as a correct but completely mishandled affair by both the Pentagon and Capitol Hill, we all understood on that crisp, Fall day in 1986 when a Stinger missile brought down the first Soviet aircraft, that their arrogant adventure in Afghanistan was the death-knell of their perverted philosophy and totally-flawed and simplistic system.One had to be there. To date, for the armchair warrior, this book is as close and as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"In a brief period of time between 1989 and 1991, the world changed dramatically. Several significant events transpired, each literally changing the way the world worked overnight. In The Main Enemy, Milt Bearden and James Risen provide a detailed and fascinating view into the struggle between the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Soviet security service, Komitet Gosudarstvenoj Bezopasnosti (KGB).Anyone aware of the state of world affairs for the last half of the twentieth century would be hard pressed to believe any of the events that took place as the final decade of the century was poised to begin. Starting with the Soviet Union's withdraw from Afghanistan in 1989, we observed as one event followed another, each coming as a greater surprise than the previous. We watched the collapse of the Berlin Wall and saw the reunification of Germany shortly thereafter. Not long behind Germany's rejection of socialism, we saw revolutions in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and elsewhere. In the latter half of 1991, we watched a failed coup in the Soviet Union, and as that year drew to a close, the Soviet hammer and sickle was replaced with the Russian tricolor flag over Moscow.These were not events that took place on their own. These were the highly visible climax of an ongoing struggle between the proponents of the Soviet Revolutskyj Mir (\\"World Revolution\\") and their counterparts in the West -- including Britain's MI6 and America's CIA. Such a conclusion wasn't always assured, and there were times when CIA was baffled by the tremendous success of KGB's operations against Western agents and interests. It is during these \\"1985 losses\\" that the book opens, providing a foundation that helps the reader to see just what was happening in the world of intelligence.Milt Bearden is a career CIA officer, having spent a lifetime in the shadows and working for America's interests. James Risen is an accomplished journalist. The collaboration -- which also includes the input and assistance of many other players from many sides in this international game of strategy and intrigue -- is an admirable success. The story is gripping, compelling, and personal. The book is well-structured and the prose makes it easy to forget that The Main Enemy isn't a novel, but a book of real history.For those of us whose understanding of intelligence is primarily from the technical side -- most likely through Bamford's glimpses into the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) -- The Main Enemy is instructive, helping us to see the value of human intelligence (HUMINT) and its role in world affairs.While hardly the definitive work on the operations of CIA, The Main Enemy provides valuable insight into the climax of the Cold War. Hopefully its accessible style will help to open this important chapter of history to a wide audience -- not just spy buffs."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This is a work about diverging cultures on two levels. It is the conflict between the cultures of the two world powers, the USSR and the United States. But a theme running throughout the book is how the world of intelligence is a culture unto itself. This story is better than any fictional tale around. Tom Clancy only wishes he could produce something like this.We are back in the final days of the Cold War, with both sides working through proxies and attempting to trump the other side in any way possible. What strikes one throughout is the motive difference between those who chose to spy for the other side. The few Americans did so for money or revenge. The volunteers behind the Iron Curtain - and this included generals, high-up party members, scientists - did so for ideological reasons. The two worse US spies - Hannson (FBI) and Ames (CIA) both loved the thrill and the money; both were contemptuous of the Soviets.In the end, this is an old-fashioned spy tale with all that that implies - skulking in the dark alleys, the drops, the chase, the planting of devices, transfers of cash, discreet signs, suicide pills, bravery, cowardice and a battle of wills in the agencies that exemplified the clash between the two cultures. This is one of those books you just can't put down."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"Superbly written, page burning, riveting book. All of the excitement and word craft of a Tom Clancy novel but real history from a man who lived it. This book is a great read and about a subject that anyone interested in history, politics, or current events should absolutely read.The Main Enemy chronicles the secret war of spying from 1985 until the end of the cold war. What makes this book so interesting, and different, is that one of the authors lived the story. In addition this book shows how men make history while not even knowing the ultimate consequences of their actions. Milt Bearden puts the stories and the lessons learned in a global context. Instead of being simply a collection of anecdotes or a another narcissistic (and self-serving) biography, this book opens up a very poorly understood period of history and of a profession.The Main Enemy also clearly shows us the debt we owe countless men and woman who protect and serve this country whose actions and sacrifices will never be known. The authors show how the information acquired by these brave people contribute to saving lives on the battlefield, contribute to better US-World negotiations, and impact every American's life, without our even knowing it.Not only have Mr. Bearden and Mr. Risen written a great book, but they have served this country by better educating us on how the world really works and what is needed in the future. I believe that this book should be required reading by every student and politician. It could save grave errors and costly mistakes in the future."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"Superbly written, page burning, riveting book.

Lots of sex and violence with the KGB being at best stupidly evil. In addition,many Americans today think of the CIA as almost more of an enemy to the Republic than Moslem terrorists, the Chinese, or the resurgent Russians. Far too many people today blame the CIA for not having clearer information about Iraq or worse actively plotting with the 'Government' to get us into a war.This book of Bearden and Risen though, is one that both popular historians and casual reader alike can get into. They show that often intelligence services make educated guesses on fragments of information that may or may not be compromised by the enemy. Concerned with a period of global turmoil that was surprisingly governed by understood rules of intelligence gathering and other activities, this book brings the reader into the world of the CIA. Far from the James Bond style killing and counter killing by the Allies and Soviet Empire, it was one of limited violence between the two principal powers. A busted or captured agent was interrogated briefly and put on a plane for home, no killing and seldom more than a mild roughing up.The dying days of the Soviet Empire were ironically the period that that the KGB (with help from American traitors like Aldrich Ames and Robert Hannsen)had wiped out most of the CIA operatives in Russia. The Americans had been sent home and the Russian agents of the Americans killed. The US had virtually no human intel assets behind the Iron Curtain. This is some of the most interesting parts of the book, seeing how much damage a couple of American traitors did as we blindly tried to understand what was going on. The bewildered KGB agents simply cannot believe their Empire is collapsing while they have gotten the upper hand over their Western enemies.Bearden's insider accounts need to be taken with a grain of salt but his recounting of that period and the US efforts in Afghanistan are informing. Many of us who have studied the period or were in the Armed Forces knew in a general manner what was going on, but seeing the CIA somehow keep Congress on their side while turning on the heat on the Russians in Afghanistan is a both a pleasure and source of wonder. One does not have to think hard to wonder what our present Congress would have done in similar circumstances.This book illustrates a critical period in our history. Depicting intelligence services being blindsided by events is something critics should remember happens far too often. No intel service of any country has a 100% batting average, not even the legendary Mossad of Israel and that is something Congress and the American public too often forget."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"Good book.

I am a junkie for spy books, and this one reads like a novel."},{"Title":"The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB","review":"This is a strange book consisting on 50% of a repetition of well known cases and personalities, 30% of a description of the author's heroic deeds in Afganistan secretly fighting against the Soviets, and the rest 20% of an attempt to show how good the team of Gerber, Reynolds and Bearden was in the time span of ten years between 1985 and 1995, when the Agency lost ALL ITS AGENTS in the USSR due to the treason of Howard, Ames, Hanssen (FBI), Nicolson and others under Mr Bearden &amp; Co. As a result, the author strangely claims that the West has won the Cold War. I cannot guess what makes him think so.In almost ten years of Mr Bearden's involvement with the SE Division, his best achievement was probably the so called Gavrilov channel - a secret channel of cooperation/communication proposed by the KGB, which was established in Vienna before the end of the Cold War. It culminated in the author's proud publication of a photo where he was shown embracing KGB Gen. Rem Krasilnikov - practically a sole executioner of the American agents and officers in Moscow, when Bearden was in charge. Congratulations!Among the best reviews of &quot;The Main Enemy&quot; (the title is evidently ill selected and generally erroneous: should be 'Main Adversary') the most professional is certainly Oleg Gordievsky's article in the London Literary Review.

TOLKACHEV! Anyone interested in what Tolkachev revealed to US Intelligence may have difficulty finding out the facts. Tolkachev gave us everything from Soviet Missile research to the latest designs for Soviet combat aircraft. Mr. Milton Bearden and his writer friend James Risen, chosen by Uncle Milty so he could avoid the CIA \`black magic marker' when he submitted this manuscript for approval in Arlington, reveal for the first time that neither Aldrich Ames nor Edward L. Howard had anything to do with Tolkachev's betrayal!This begs the question: WHO WAS AND POSSIBLY STILL IS THE TRAITOR MOLE INSIDE THE CIA?For those of you interested in the on-going historical MOLE hunts inside the CIA, stop watching the idiot TV show \\"The Agency\\" and read: \\"Legend, the Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald\\" by Edward Jay Epstein. I am a believer and follower of the late James Jesus Angleton who went to this grave wondering about the mysterious 1978 death of CIA official John A. Paisley and several others inside the agency from 1978 to 1985. Angleton was the MOLE HUNTER who came close to discovering the identity of the super \\"Soviet Mole\\" before he was suddenly fired by CIA Director William Colby. Colby, like Paisley, died in an equally mysterious \\"canoe accident\\" in 1996. He and Paisley's demise had one thing in common: it happened on the water. Paisley, in addition, had a 9mm hole behind his left ear. They called it a \\"Suicide\\".As you begin this reading adventure you might consider finding a copy of \\"The Encyclopedia of Espionage\\" by Norm Polmar and Tom Allen.

For me personally, I the latter part of the book to be most valuable. Chapters are dedicated to many design topics including: coupling mechanisms (both conducted and radiated), layout and grounding, digital/analog circuit design, interfaces and filters, and shielding. The book wraps up with four very useful appendices: Design Checklist, CAD for EMC, Case Studies, and Important Formulas.If you can get only three EMC books, I would recommend Clayton Paul's Intro to EMC, Michel Mardiguian's EMI Troubleshooting Techniques, and William's EMC for Product Designers. They all come from different angles (academic, design, and troubleshooting), but together they serve as a good foundation.Please be kind and indicate if reviews are helpful.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of \\"Process of Elimination\\" - a thriller that pits a martial artist against a world-class sniper out to shape the presidential election."},{"Title":"EMC for Product Designers, Third Edition","review":"If you can only afford 1 book on EMC make it this one.

The time is World War I and Poirot is one of a small group of Belgian refugees who has come to live in a rural English village. With his egg-shaped head and his well-groomed moustache, Poirot enters and soon becomes one of fiction's best-loved detectives. Also in this novel, the reader is introduced to his cohort, Captain Arthur Hastings, recovering from a war injury at the upper-class household known as Styles Court. The mistress of the manor is Emily Inglethorpe, an elderly woman who has just married a much younger man. The family members occupying the house all become suspects when Mrs. Inglethorpe is murdered and it is up to Poirot's little grey cells to sift through all the red herrings and, in the final chapter, reveal all in true detective fashion. High on Poirot's list of suspects are: John Cavendish, the elder stepson; Mary Cavendish, his wife; Lawrence Cavendish, the younger stepson; Evelyn Howard, Mrs. Inglethorpe's companion; Cynthia Murdoch, her protegee; and Dr. Bauerstein, a mysterious stranger who lives in Essex. All have motive and opportunity but only Poirot can discover the truth.This first novel sets the tone for many Christies to follow. The wealthy family inhabiting a country house, the non-violent method of murder (poisoning) so favored by Mrs. Christie, and the light-hearted but often serious romance all became hallmarks of many of her later works.Have a cup of hot chocolate with Poirot and enjoy the adventure."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"\\"Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" I love the description of Poirot. This is the start of one of the best sets of mysteries ever made - the first appearance of the celebrated Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.Poirot is interesting for many reasons, one of the first that he was a famous detective as a member of the Belgian police force. Due to WW I, Poirot has to move to England as a refugee, and remains. It's also the first appearance of Capt. Hastings, the sometimes narrator of the stories.Wonderful characters, great story.

Very disappointed in the lack of quality in this release."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is Poirot's first case and Christie's debut as a mystery writer. It is an auspicious start to a brilliant career for both the author and her creation. It's a bit over-ambitious; the young Christie was heavy-handed with the clues in this one, and while the ending is a surprise, the last section of the book is just a bit too long for the ending to have quite the impact that Christie would achieve in later works. This is perhaps the only Christie book about which one can say there are &quot;too many clues;&quot; it is nonetheless an astounding achievement for a first-time author. And, of course, any fan of Poirot will want to read the case that &quot;started it all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I have always loved Christie's books for quick and fun entertainment. Although I used to own her entire published works in English, I lost my whole collection years ago to severe water damage. Recently, I was talked into buying a Kindle (reluctantly--I still like the heft, smell and feel of a paper book) and I was pleased to see this book was available at the best price ever: free.However, I was extremely annoyed when I discovered that there is no attempt to reproduce the many diagrams and pieces of evidence discussed in the book; in fact, there isn't even an acknowledgement that they are completely missing. The story will say something like, \\"Below is a diagram representing the layout of the house\\", and below there is absolutely nothing.It turns out that these diagrams are essential to understanding (or solving on your own) the pivotal murder in the story. For shame! This destroys what Christie has always been known for--being completely fair with clues so that the perceptive reader can often solve much of the mystery right along with Poirot."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Many have read Murder on the Orient Express and other classic Agatha Christie books. I probably read my first Christie book 25 years ago.But I had never heard of her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, before spotting it in a library. This book is certainly not her best. But it is certainly worth reading. Interestingly, despite introducing her famous detective Hercule Poirot to the reader, she treats him as a person who people should know if they know anything about detectives, as someone with whom we are all acquainted already.The plot has all the hallmarks of Agatha's later works. A person dies. There are small assorted clues, but nothing like a smoking gun. There are people who hate the victim, and people who love them, but Christie manages to draw suspicion upon both sets of characters alike without making the plot seem forced. The intricate plan for the murder that eventually comes out is similarly within the realm of possibility.The only real problem I had was that when Poirot revealed the final clue, it was something none of us could have guessed beforehand. Still, this was a good first effort in a marvelous career for Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Readers everywhere are grateful to the sister of Agatha Christie for placing a bet with her, claiming that the woman that nowadays is known as the Queen of Mystery would not be able to write a good detective story. That is actually how this novel and the character of Hercule Poirot came into existence. In this first effort we can see the basic traits that later established Christie as one of the best mystery writers ever, though some of her technique is not yet completely polished. For example we get only a brief description of each of the characters, except for Poirot, so it is hard to picture some of them clearly. Nevertheless, the story deserves high praise, and I am pretty sure Agatha won the bet!The story is narrated by Hasting, who gets an invitation to spend some time in the country place of John Cavendish at Styles Court. Upon his arrival, Hasting notices that there is a certain level of tension in the family, since John's mother, Emily, has recently married a younger man, who the family considers to be a fortune hunter. Meanwhile, John and his brother Lawrance are having financial trouble, and a set of interesting characters surround Emily and have all kinds of suggesting exchanges with her. When the lady of the house is murdered it comes as no surprise. There is a main suspect, but also a myriad of possible candidates for the role of the killer.Luckily, Hasting runs into Poirot at the time of these events, and the small man with the peculiar moustache, who has retired from the Belgian police, is more than happy to help solve the baffling case. Those that have read other novels by Christie know that the author has an outstanding ability to mislead us into believing we have discovered the culprit, only to turn the tables on us and leave us dumbstruck. This case is no different...Ahhh, those little grey cells!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The novel itself is a classic and a masterpiece. That said, you should pony up for a better edition. Simply put, the novel includes several diagrams and reproductions of handwritten notes -which are not included in this Kindle edition. So, you pretty much have to get a copy of the physical book, or do without important clues to the solution of the mystery. I have read other Kindle books which include diagrams, drawings, etc., so it can easily be done. This particular publisher/editor didn't bother, and the result is a less-than-satisfactory reading experience. Five stars for the novel; 1 star for the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Agatha Christie began her series of Hercule Poirot mysteries in 1920 with THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES. As the novel opens, it is 1917; the Great War is on, and Lieutenant Arthur Hastings, the novel's genial narrator, has been wounded. To recuperate he goes to the country estate of a friend, John Cavendish, who lives with his wife, Mary, his younger brother, Lawrence, and a girl, Cynthia, who is the ward of his stepmother, Emily Agnes Inglethorp, who owns the estate. Mrs. Inglethorp has recently married a man twenty years her junior, whom no one else in the household likes - least of all her paid companion, Evelyn Howard. Hastings' restful sojourn at Styles is interrupted when Mrs. Inglethorp is poisoned, in a classic locked-room scenario. Hastings then joins forces with Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and former police inspector living in the village, to hunt down the murderer...and a partnership is born.The story's quaint country-house setting and its depiction of the beginnings of Poirot's English career are its most memorable features. The intricate murder-plot is great fun, and in developing it the author uses a technique for misleading the reader which she would repeat in later stories. I can't explain what the technique is without revealing the novel's ending, so I'll just say that THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES is a detective story that should prove just as enjoyable for longtime fans of the charming Poirot as for those new to the character and his creator, Agatha Christie. Also highly recommended, for those who have finished the novel: the superb made-for-TV version of THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES, starring David Suchet as Poirot and Hugh Fraser as Hastings, and available on DVD from Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I love Agatha Christie and this book is no exception.

I gave this a 5 because it surely deserves it and Agatha is so underrated in the professional critical world as many best selling authors are. As one apt reviewer said, have a cup of coffee (and I would add, or an adult beverage) and enjoy. A tip of the hat to Amazon for providing this free Kindle. Thank you from all of us."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES by Agatha Christie.Christie's first novel written in 1916 during the First World War is also the novel that introduces the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Because it is extremely easy to give the plot away in a Christie novel, all one will say is that when a mysterious affair takes place at a lonely mansion called Styles an army officer named Hastings calls in his friend Poirot, who is in a Belgian refugee home in Britain due to the German conquest of his country, to investigate.Christie's construction of the mystery is expert and shows right out of the gate, she had a flair for this type of thing. Her use of red herrings and misdirection is especially skillful and especially treacherous. Her handling of character--and not just the wonderful Poirot--is equally fine and insightful. This novel is not just a clever game but a genuine achievement that should fascinate on multiple levels.With the obsession with TEN LITTLE INDIANS, one is surprised that this novel has not received the same deserved attention. It is a great success. It is great fun. And it is greatly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This was the first book I read on the kindle by Agatha Christie. I really enjoyed it but it seems to be missing information that would help you to solve the mystery on your own. Poirot is a great character!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was not only the first Hercule Poirot book, but also the first book of Agatha Christie's career. Poirot arrives as a a refugee fleeing from the overthrow of his country during World War I. Doing so he arrives at Styles manor where he meets up with a few people he has met and would become a great part of his career in books, Arthur Hastings and Inspector Japp. While the story relies as much on method as motive and psychology (later psychology would play a larger part in solving a murder than clues...the Sherlock Holmes approach), it is still an excellent read. For any Poirot fans or those that think they may like mysteries, the Mysterious Affair at Styles is one for the bookshelf. As far as the book itself goes, the print is larger than some paperback editions and the pages are larger, making it easier to hold with one hand or set down on a table. It doesn't take as much effort to keep it completely open for reading near the spine."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I'm embarrassed to admit that, prior to reading this book, I had never read anything by Agatha Christie. Last week, PBS featured one of her books on their Masterpiece Mystery show, and I thought it was very well done. My interest was piqued as to whether the books were as good as the show. I decided to start with her very first book published, rather than start with a later book and run the risk of encountering spoilers. So, I requested The Mysterious Affair at Styles from my library, and hoped for the best.I was not disappointed! One big plus to The Mysterious Affair at Styles is that the culprit is not obvious. At the end of the book, I was just as surprised as the characters to learn who the murderer was, and what had happened. It was refreshing not to have it be predictable. I also like that the reader is given lots of clues along the way, to try and piece things together. The book moves quick enough that you don't get bored, yet provides plenty of details and complex characters. I definitely plan on reading more by Christie, if this book is any indication to what the rest of her mysteries are like."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"POIROT &amp; HASTINGS introduced to the world.

Absolutely charming period piece on top of a first-rate stumper."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"What can I say? Agatha Christie's first book is also one of her best (although she has done better). She has no holds barred when she twists the plot unmercifully so much that the truth behind the murder isn't apparent until the end. And all her twists are nicely put together and explained.A word of advice: take the first few chapters in slowly - Christie crams all her characters into these few chapters and if you don't pay attention you'll be totally lost."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"For anyone just starting to read mystery novels and particularly anyone who is new to Agatha Christie, I would highly recommend starting with this, the first Poirot mystery. Poirot has recently come to England as a WW1 war refugee. Shortly after his arrival, he encounters an old friend Captain Hastings, who serves as the perfect Watson to Poirot's Holmes. An old lady who had been of great help to Poirot is murdered and he feels an obligation to find her killer. A simple premise but Christie builds a wonderfully complex mystery upon it, with multiple suspects, several red herrings and a lot of atmosphere. The ending is a genuine shocker and the mystery is nicely interposed with comedic moments due to Captain Hastings' various observations about life and love, most of which show his intelligence to be decidedly inferior to that of his little Belgian friend! Definitely do not miss - you will thoroughly enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This book, the first of Christie's Poirot collection is truly an asset. The ending was so surprising that I'm sure it would have stumped everyone who read it..and it's not the &quot;most unlikely one&quot;, either, as tends to be Christie's usual. A well developed plot supports the vital characters in the novel. Perhaps this lacks the sophistication of Christie's later novels, but still a thoroughly enjoyable and thrilling read from start to finish."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK AS ALWAYS BY A.

Too bad she is no longer around to tell us more."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was Agatha Christie's first published mystery, the one in which she introduced detective Hercule Poirot and created the template for nearly all of the hundreds (?) of subsequent mysteries she published in her career. From this very first book Christie established herself as the queen of the whodunit, writing mysteries with solutions that always fool the reader. Although her books aren't deep into characterization or atmosphere -- that isn't the type of book she wrote, after all -- nevertheless she always managed to effectively transport the reader to another time and place. I love her books for that entertaining, escapist quality they have.In The Mysterious Affair at Styles we are transported to the WWI era -- a large estate in the British countryside, where a wealthy elderly woman is murdered and nearly everyone in the household seems to have a motive. Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and retired police officer, just happens to be in the area and in a matter of days his little gray cells unravel the puzzle.The narrator is a British actor who does a fine job with the mens' voice, particularly Poirot's, but doesn't do so well with the female voices. Nevertheless, this is a delightfully entertaining book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Great classic mystery literature from one of the best authors ever.

The story is a little too stilted, with some irrelevant elements thrown in just to \\"cloud the situation\\". Not as tightly woven as her later works. Of course, this being one of her early books, one must read with a level of tolerance and understanding; and it being the first one that introduces Poirot, it still is a must-read for the true Agatha/Poirot fans.

GuittardBook ReviewThe story, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, is based in World War I. The story introduces Hercule Poirot, a famous Belgian detective. In the beginning of the book, the main character, Mr. Arthur Hastings, goes to visit an old friend and his family. Whiles he stays there, the housemistress, Mrs. Cavendish, dies. It is a fortunate coincidence that Poirot is in a nearby village. The assemblage of suspects are mostly from Mrs. Cavendish's family. Poirot is given many clues and racks his brains to find out who is the murderer.Since this is the first Poirot novel, I expected it to be inferior to other novels Agatha Christie has written. I found myself perplexed at some points in the story because of Poirot, his witty comments and how he finds clues. It seemed that some clues were not really relative at the time, but then turn out to get more related to the story. I loved how Poirot was meticulous about everything, and also how he was so immaculate. So, in conclusion, this is a book I would recommend. Although it is not one of Christie's best, it is still a very humorous, motivating and intriguing book!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"English country house murder, limited pool of suspects (mostly, the Cavendish family), lots of zigzagging and backtracking, red herrings and buried clues. In other words, classic Agatha Christie, though I believe this was her first (Poirot) novel, related through Hastings, who is the perfect stolid British foil to the eccentric and excitable little Belgian. Gets a little complicated in the plot, but the style is smooth and engaging. For a modern Agatha Christie (English country house, limited pool of suspects), I recommend the slightly spoofy \\"Christmas is Murder\\" by C. S. Challinor.Christmas is Murder (A Rex Graves Mystery)"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Actually, this isn't Agatha Christy's best, but I give it a five star rating for its importance as her first mystery and the first Hercule Poirot story. All others came from this one and it is a first rate puzzler. Those already familiar with Agatha Christy will have it partially figured out if mot completely long before the end, but this shows the influence she had on the development of the mystery genre. She plays a game with the reader and she plays it fair and square. While doing so, she creates one of fiction's most memorably eccentric characters, Hercule Poirot. He is such an enjoyable character that the book is captivating observing him although the suspects in this one aren't particularly likeable. This is a pure puzzle and doesn't have the sense of tragedy that some of her later books have. It's a fast read and definitely an enjoyable one."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"...I got a hunch about 1/2 way through that one of the characters was the murderer - but could not even begin to see how they did it or were connected.

Unlike other Agatha Christie mysteries, I'm not sure the reader is really given all of the information to be able to deduce the solution themselves. You could guess, true, (though I did not) but there weren't the concrete clues left lying about for the reader to grasp and assemble into a coherent scenario. Still, it was an enjoyable old-fashioned mystery, and I would recommend the Poirot stories to all mystery fans (Miss Marple, on the other hand, grates on my nerves)."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"\\"87 years ago the grande dame created Hercule Poirot to solve with logic and deduction the murder and he has been with us ever since.

Indeed it is a rather ponderous start. That it was written nearly a century ago is pretty clear. The language is clunky and dated--annoyingly so. People don't fall, they come a cropper. Headaches are \\"beastly\\" and people wonder \\"wither he goes.\\" Her matter-of-fact, casual racism and anti-semitism, commonplace for the time, are still rather appalling.Add to the arcane language some equally clunky characterizations and scenes. Hastings, Poirot's later friend and associate starts off as a bit of a dolt--a ten year old could have come to more sophisticated conclusions. If Christie thought he would provide comic relief, she miscalculated--he's annoying.And whole sections could be excised. I always thought Christie's habit of gathering everyone in the drawing room to expose the killer was hackneyed, however it is absolutely riveting compared to her courtroom \\"drama\\" scenes. Talk about a snoozer. You could cut 50 pages and condense them to five.Part of the good news is there are glimmers of what's to come. One can't help but smile when Monsieur Poirot's \\"little grey cells\\" get going. Or when Hastings inadvertently says something that turns the lightbulb on for Poirot. The rest of the good news is that having written more than 100 books, it will be a long long time before any fan has to read this one.

I'm obviously a fan of A.C., but I'm even a bigger fan of the classic style evident in this book:The confined setting, the uncomlicated, yet tightly woven plot, the intimacies amongst the suspects, and an almost invisible veil of pressure for the crime solver to expose the culprit. A.C. served up heaping helpings of this and then some. I'd be redundant if I replicated the description of the plot, but I will say that the formula would not be unfamiliar to the common reader: The weatlhy heiress is murdered, the would be benefactors of her inheritance become the obvious suspects, and the sleuth steals the show to tell whodunit.The only reservation I had was that A.C.'s prose could have been a bit less heavy-handed. The dated English vernacular was a bit much at times. Also,there were a few severely politically incorrect references made that could possibly dissuade a sensitive reader (keep in mind that the book was written in 1910 and pub'd in 1920),however, the die-hards of mystery/A.C. will take them w/ a grain of salt.I highly recommend this book to readers who've never read A.C. before. In doing so, the reader will kill two birds w/ one stone:They will read the 1st book ever written by A.C.(introducing the extraordinary Hercule Poirot),and experience the phenomenal and undisputed A.C. style that has become one of America's favorite age old pleasures."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"First published in 1920 (though written a few years earlier), \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" isn't just Agatha Christie's first detective novel, but the book that introduced the world to Hercule Poirot. The result of a bet in which Christie vowed to write a mystery in which the reader would be presented with the same clues as the detective, \\"Styles\\" was to be the first in a long line of detective novels (about eighty) that spanned several decades, and kick-started Christie's reputation as the Queen of Crime. Though not Christie's best, and not necessarily the novel for a newcomer to start with, \\"Styles\\" is classic Christie. Narrated in first-person by Hastings (acting as a reader-proxy), the story includes what would become the staple ingredients of mystery: a country manor, an upper-class family, an exchange of wills, an array of suspects, red herrings, and the final twist in the tale.Captain Arthur Hasting is staying with his old school-friend John Cavendish and his extended family during the war. Mrs Inglethorp is the family matriarch, a somewhat domineering figure who controls the family fortune and the lives of those who live in the house. However, tragedy strikes when she dies in suspicious circumstances, and Hasting suggests bringing in a retired Belgian detective that he knows is lodging nearby in a refugee house. Hercule Poirot enters the scene, and at once takes control.Poirot is facetious, methodical and secretive, driving Hastings to despair many a time (it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship) as he carefully investigates the household and the strange circumstances that surround Mrs Inglethorp's death. Christie's love/hate relationship with her most famous detective is captured clearly in Hasting's voice: at the same time he's admiring of the little man, he can't help but be frustrated at his infuriating mannerisms and arrogance.Christie's prose is not as sophisticated as it would become in later books, being instead quite blunt and straightforward, but her gift at foreshadowing and hidden agendas is as strong here as it is in later years. Having read many of her later books, I was expecting to be able to figure out the culprit in what I assumed would be a \\"less polished\\" story.

Still, this edition gets you convenient delivery of an excellent book, and the illustrations omitted (so far I've noticed the lack of the floor plan and a scrap of handwriting, both referred to in the text) are not really that necessary to enjoying the plot - I just feel that it is wrong of them not to be up-front about the absence of these small things, though I note that they do not claim that this edition is unabridged."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"It's exciting to read the first published novel of the world's best selling author of all time.

Poirot and a group of fellow Belgians have resettled in an English village, after displacement from their homeland. Poirot has already retired from Belgian police work, speaking fondly of turn-of-the-century cases with friendly Scotland Yard detectives.This is a standard issue murder case with the ancient mansion dweller as the victim. She is recently remarried and has also recently broken with a long-time friend and companion. Filling out the list of suspects are two step-sons who would benefit financially from her demise and several house guests, including a young pharmacist and a German spy. Poirot is called in the day of the murder and follows his standard practice. He sends cryptic messages to suspects to gauge their response, tracks suspects across the county, and even does primitive forensic studies. The book is written by a resident wounded veteran who was a long-time friend of both Poirot and the family at Styles.There are two features here to recommend this book. The first is the mystery within the mystery structure in which the obvious suspect ultimately turns out to be the guilty one, albeit with an unexpected accomplice. The second is the deliberately researched poisoning mechanism employed. Dame Christie received a positive review in the 1920's from a leading British pharmacology journal for her efforts. For those who enjoy the complex, this book is wracked with it. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters and their myriad interactions with Poirot and each other.

There are a number of different suspects who all seem to have a pretty good motivation for killing her. There is John Cavendish, Mary Cavendish, Lawrence Cavendish, Alfred Inglethorpe, Evelyn Howard, Dorcas, and Cynthia Murdoch. I was in suspense through the entire book. The only thing that seemed to frustrate me about the mystery was the way Agatha Cristie would give you many clues leading you in the complete opposite direction everytime.

It heralded the start of the Golden Age of detective fiction. The book does not yet have the great, easy to read prose that would be a hallmark of the author in the years to come, but is near it. The very ingenious plot, the use of one of the great ploys of classical detective fiction, the various subplots, and the many sympathetic characters are all elements of Dame Agatha's later justly famous novels and are handled here very skilfully.

A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged around her, powerless to help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until she appeared to rest upon her head and heels, with her body in an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer some brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in a peculiar fashion. At that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the room. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure in the bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\"Alfred, Alfred-\\" Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\"Where was Mr. Inglethorp?\\" I thought.In the book \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles,\\" Hercule Poirot is examining a murder of an elderly woman at Styles Court. The woman, Mrs. Emily Inglethorp, has been poisoned with strychnine, a very deadly poison. The only question is, who did it? Throughout the book, Poirot is trying to figure that out. He examines Emily Inglethorp's bedroom, taking everything into notice... something even as small as a tiny scrap of cloth. Poirot also questions everyone in the house about the murder, matches handwriting samples, digs through old chests, and tries to put everybody's stories together so he can paint a picture of what happened that day. He also does a LOT of thinking. In the end, after many twists on who you think is the culprit, Poirot determines that Mrs. Inglthorp's husband and his cousin killed her. This is truly a good book. It is filled with a whodunit mystery, unique characters, and, above all, a storyline that kept you wanting to read.This book was a whodunit mystery, because the author keeps changing your mind on who you think the culprit is. First, it is thought that Mr. Inglethorp commits the crime, but then, the suspicions change to Doctor Bauerstein. It changes to John Cavendish and then to Mrs. Cavendish, but in the end, it is really Mr. Inglethorp and an accomplice.This book had unique characters all over it. Hercule Poirot was unique because he takes note of anything suspicious, doesn't immediately give away the culprit, and can make people talk and talk, sometimes making them change their story (which proves that they are lying). Mr. Inglethorp is very unique, because he is good at faking his feelings. He pretended to be so sad about his wife dying and he also pretended not to care about anything else. But that was all false... The last unique character is Lawrence Cavendish. He is sort of all over the place, in a sense, because he believes that the poison stuff is fake and he just has an odd personality. He is in love with Cynthia, but won't admit it, which is sort of strange, and he had touched a bottle of strychnine, which led him to be thought of the murderer (although his name was cleared).This storyline just kept you wanting to read and read. This was because the book is suspenseful, such as the part where everyone awoke the night Mrs. Inglethorp was dying and they couldn't get into her room. The book also kept the reader wondering about what would happen, which keeps your head all up inside of the book. Finally, the big thing that kept the reader hooked to the book, was because of the characters. We already know that they are unique, but also their arguments, personalities, and actions influence how much a reader would like to read.The reasons are clear why anyone would like to read \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles.\\" It was an engaging storyline, unique characters, and it is a whodunit mystery.-From the Desk of E.

There were a couple short \\"bonus runs\\" several years later that added a few extra titles so it is hard to say what a total set really is.These are not currently available in (new) book stores and can only be found via used book stores, online, or private party sales as far as I know.The books were typically bound well, hardcover in a navy blue (almost black) faux leather padded cover with gilt imprint on the cover and title on the spine. The end pages (inside of the covers) had an attractive pattern, although some later editions had the pattern marred slightly by mass printing errors.This specific item listing is not anything like an official one (i.e. listing is NOT made by Amazon). Buyers should be aware that the sellers likely do not know what a \\"complete set\\" looks like (as little information on the whole collection seems to be available). I would advise contacting a seller and asking how many books, and which titles, are in the set they are advertising before buying. Especially if there are no details for their item under Comments. The image shown was likely only the FIRST item listed here and would not match anything currently listed.The books are fine, I am not reviewing the works of Agatha Christie either. The vagueness of this listing and the potential for the buyer not getting a \\"complete set\\" as advertised is what generates the low review.However, it is possible a seller could have a large collection of the books here for sale and that could be of interest to someone wanting a great looking set of matching Agatha Christie books for a display shelf or as the starting point for a collection.The books are available on Amazon individually also, usually listed as \\"Mystery Collection\\", \\"Bantam blue\\", or \\"leatherette\\" in the title.Be aware that many copies were purchased by libraries so conditions can vary greatly and buyers who are building a nice collection should exercise due diligence. Some sellers are better about describing their copy than others, as you will see."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is another enjoyable Poirot mystery, but I do not recommend this particular paperback edition. It is a text-only copy which means that there are at least 3 different images referred to in the story that do not appear in the book. It's very frustrating."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Christie's first mystery and we are introduced to the Belgian detective extraordinaire- Hercule Poirot. I've never been able to decide which of her detectives I liked the best- the sweet old Miss Marple or the sometimes insufferable Mr Poirot. Several of her later works have made the transition from books to movies and stage plays one of which, The Mousetrap, has run on a London stage continuously since 1952, so her work definitely has staying power! It is worth your while to give her a try- or try several."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Agatha Christie was living with her Mother and sister Madge in 1916 in her home town of Torquay, when Madge bet her sister that she could not wirite a detective story, a new art form at the time.. Agatha got half way through and was stuck, when her Mother said \\"go away to the moors on a hiking holiday, clear your head and finish this \\"it's good so far!\\".Out of this holiday came Hercule Peroit, Captain Hastings and Inspector Japp who were to be in Christie novels for the next fifty years. It took four years to find a publisher for \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" and the novel was evenutally published and copyrighted in 1920. During world war II Christie wrote Poirot's last adventure \\"Curtain\\". He's now a feeble old man living in Styles St Mary once again for this his final case. \\"Curtain\\" was kept in a bank vault and published after Dame Agath'a death in 1976. What is fascinating to me is this is early example of English detective fiction, coming as it did right after Sherlock Holmes. The art form was developing - this is a grand audio production with a large cast - \\"Styles\\" is timeless and historically important."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"fine reading, Agatha christe is great!

I've been a fan for years and I'm in the process of re-reading her books after several years. Entertaining and with the plot twist that make a good mystery. A fun read and just the book to relax with and forget the outside world for a time."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This book is a bit different from other Christie's that I have read in that the detective, Poirot, doesn't appear until several chapters in and almost seems to be a secondary character. It's a point of view that I found intriguing, and hilarious!The narrator absolutely cracked me up! He is so dismissive of that 'funny little' Poirot, sure that the man is either crazy or absurd and equally sure that he himself will solve the crime.The mystery takes place at a country manor home that is complete with servants and where no one seems to have to work for a living--so very British! The murder suspect seems to be ironclad guilty but leave it to Poirot to find that sliver of doubt. There were so many red herrings in the book that I totally gave up on trying to solve the mystery. Poirot certainly does nothing to help, agreeing with every ridiculous notion that the narrator has and leaving the readers to wonder what solution is untangling in his genius brain or if he is indeed the nitwit the narrator makes him out to be.Still, I was shocked by the ending. Truly never even saw it coming and that is what makes Christie, still, the Grandest Dame of them all! Jolly good show."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"eBook downloaded from Gutenberg A wealthy and generous but demanding woman is murdered, and it seems most of her relatives and hangers-on are relieved.Painfully slow start, and Poirot's little mannerisms are annoying even in this, his first book.

His character and her descriptive workings of buildings and people into the narrative helps you get a feel for the time period in addition to enjoying a mystery."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This wasn't my first Agatha Christie book but it was my first Poirot and, as it turns out, is the first Christie book in which Poirot is featured. Written in 1920, it reminded me much of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, but with a beefier plot and a little more twisty misdirection. I enjoyed the book and will definitely read more."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I enjoy these type of mystery books. Holds your attention the whole way through. Unable to determine who the culprit is until the end of the book."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"It is always odd to look back at beginnings. No one, surely not Agatha Christie herslf, could have guessed what a long run Hercules Poirot would have. He was already of a certain age when he took the stage in The Mysterious Affair at Styles.When she wrote this book Christie was still acquiring her voice and her main characters, Hastings and Poirot had not yet developed into the full formed personages they were to become.Nonetheless, The Mysterious affairs at Styles would be a perfect introduction to someone about to embark upon The cannon of A. Christie and it is a treat to go back and read it again now that I have read all that I can find of her work. Christie was my light reading while completing my M.A. and remains a fond favourite. Not all of Christie's books are great tales. This one is. See also my comments on The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.N.B. I want to make it clear that I am commenting on the story, not the binding or production values of this edition."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I am not sure if I downloaded this or another Kindle edition, but my version was missing a few maps/plans and reproductions of letters. However, I am not sure if it had any bearing on my ability to identify the murder - I got the right answer, but it was more an instinctive guess than a logical deduction. My little grey cells are obviously not up to the standard of Poirot (although they are arguably no worse than those of the narrator Hastings). This book is quite literally vintage Agatha Christie - her first published novel ever - so if you have read any of her other books, but somehow missed this one, then you will know exactly what you can expect - a limited number of possible suspects, each of whom could be the villain until you assemble the clues and dismiss a few red herrings. Christie defined the genre, and this book defined Christie. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I read this specific work because I am one those people who, when approaching a new series, likes to start at the first work and continue chronologically. This old-fashioned mystery is a good one for those looking for an alternative to the Sherlock Holmes stories: goes just as well with a blanket and tea on a rainy day, but not quite as stuffy. Avid mystery readers may find the pace to be glacial compared to the more complex works that are standard now, but I really avoided focusing too much on the plot and getting more absorbed in the language and descriptions of the surroundings of the time. The book is fairly short and straight-forward -save the heavy-duty analyzing for loftier books. I look forward to Christie's other works!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. The first published book by Agatha Christie and introduces Hercule Poirot in all his fussiness and attention to detail. Very satisfying."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Agatha Christie's first Hercule Poirot mystery is the ever-delightful The Mysterious Affair at Styles. All of her trademarks are right here from the beginning in the character of Poirot and his brilliant gray matter and the delightful Hastings (before he become completely stuffy, as in the later books). There are red herrings aplenty and everyone seems to be up to something suspicious, much like one would want from an English country house. I have taken a summer vow to re-read all of the Poirot books that I read over the past four decades but this time to read them in the order they were written. The sole advantage of memory loss may be the ability to read these books again without a clue as to who did it. Maybe growing older will not be so bad. This book makes a perfect start to the series and to my summer. A bon-bon of Belgian chocolate."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Thirty-year old Mrs Agatha Christie turned a nice little profit with this, her first book, in 1920. It introduced Hercule Poirot. Wisely, she gave him many flamboyant, eccentric characteristics to leaven the depiction of detection work, but unwisely she created a character of advanced age that she subsequently needed to preserve for a further fifty years.What became the regular Christie recipe for a whodunit is found here. Perhaps there is a tad more reliance on the dispensing of medicines, reflecting the author's occupation during World War One. A formula that she later discarded was the use of a narrator - Hastings - who presents one of the \\"cases\\" of his friend Poirot. 1920 and the publication of this book marked the opening of the \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\". Expect that there are plenty of servants, plenty of drinks at bedtime, much making and re-making of wills, and characters - including Poirot - who walk everywhere.This rates highly in the Christie collection for classic charm, readability and ingenuity. Few of her books from the 1920s excel it."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Agatha Christie's sister once boasted to her that she had never read a mystery in which she didn't know right away who the killer was. Agatha answered her by writing her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It was quite a start to a brilliant literary career. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well plotted and the characters are great to read about. Hercule Poirot and Hastings are really hilarious together. Poirot has to be the greatest crime-solver in literature. The entire cast of characters in this novel is interesting. This probably isn't Christie's best work (my favorite is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) because her characteristic clean prose hadn't quite developed yet, but this is an extremely important work and is, like all of her books, entertaining. The literary critic Edmund Crispin summed Christie's work up best when he wrote: &quot;You know, relaxing with a Christie, that for an hour or two you can forget the authentic nastiness of life and submerge yourself in a world where, no matter how many murders take place, you are essentially in nevver-never land.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"due to ebook formatting issues, some pictures and passages are missing. specifically at the end of chapter 4, poirot finds a note that says \\"I am possessed, he is possessed.\\" it's confusing not to have the information, but if you don't want to search online to find the missing pieces, you can infer most of what is happening by how the characters react"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This version of the book is center-justified, making it very hard to see which lines of dialogue are spoken by which character. The good news is that it's free - but still, I am going to buy a different version."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Captain Hastings is invalided home from World War I, and while on leave comes across an old friend, John Cavendish. When Hastings is offered to stay for the duration of his leave with the Cavendish family, he immediately takes up the offer. Arriving at Styles Court, instead of having a relaxing and pleasant stay, he gets involved in a murder! The victim is Emily Inglethorpe, mother of John Cavendish, murder by poison. It is then that Hastings brings in the famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, a refugee from his homeland. Will the detective be able to sort through the clues, use method and order, and exercise his 'little grey cells' to bring the killer to justice?This is truly one of Agatha Christie's best Poirot novel! My father, my sister, and I are the proud owners of almost all of Agatha Christie's mysteries. All of her books are just so enjoyable to read that the best atmosphere I recommend you read them in is when you're either curled up on the couch or relaxing on your bed. Very hard to put down, I can almost guarantee you won't take as long as a week to finish one book!The story and plot of \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is ingenious, with lots of clues, happenings, twists and turns which never seem to come together or make sense! Agatha Christie has that writing style where she seems to be giving you everything, all of the hints and clues, but at the same keeping you in the dark, guessing and suspecting but never actually knowing. Then she gives you a finale which just leaves thinking, \\"Of course! Absolutely brilliant! That's how it happened!\\"The character of Hercule Poirot has a personality all of his own. Yes, we have our Sherlock Holmes and other well known and well liked characters, but Hercule Poirot himself is a remarkable character. With his system of method and order, gathering all of the clues even the most significant ones, then putting them all together with the help of a little imagination, he is quite brilliant. Then there's Captain Hastings, so incredibly gullible that though at times you'd like to ask him whether he's keeping up with everything, you can't help but like him.Then there's the array of other characters for this mystery who all seem to have a motive for murder: John Cavendish, Mary Cavendish, Alfred Inglethorpe, Evelyn Howard, Lawrence Cavendish, Cynthia Murdoch, Dorcas, and more. Everyone is under suspicion, who do you think is the murderer?I recommend all of Hercule Poirot's mysteries. And besides Poirot, Agatha Christie has written stories on numerous other heroes and heroines, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, Parker Pine, and others. Other mystery writers whose work I enjoy reading are Lillian Jackson Braun and Dick Francis.Also, don't miss out on any of the TV series and movies of Hercule Poirot. Starring as Poirot is David Suchet, perfect in his role! Plus, the movie, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is on DVD!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is the first published book of Agatha Christie's and the first book where she introduces her well-known private detective Hercule Poirot.The fact that the book is Christie's first effort is apparent. It definitely lacks the finesse of her later works. The main thing that drags down this otherwise standard Christie story is the trial proceedings. It would have been wiser to edit out that part of the book altogether as it added very little to the investigation.However, the signature marks of Christie's books (that I personally enjoy so much) - the murder in a rich upper-class English home, family secrets, minute clues and a murderer you can never guess - are already present. Plus, the narrator of the book - Hastings - is a lovely storyteller - very straight-forward, albeit not too smart, funny, and always in search for the next girl to fall in love with. Reminded me of P.G. Wodehouse's Berty Wooster, actually.A nice book, not Christie's best, but enjoyable enough."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was the first novel to introduce the great Hercule Poirot to the world. It also introduced Arthur Hastings, who appears in a number of other Poirot novels. The story begins with Hastings arriving at Styles Court to visit an old friend and his family. While he is at the estate, the Mistress of the house is killed. By a lucky coincidence, Poirot is in the nearby village and free to investigate the matter. The cast of suspects is largely drawn from the woman's family. Poirot interviews them all in his unique style and his little grey cells are put to the test as he attempts to untangle the mystery as many twists and turns ensue.Because this is the first Poirot novel, you might expect that it would be lacking compared to the later efforts. It is often the case that characters become better developed in later stories, for example. In this case, you will find a very typical Poirot novel, with no real evidence that Christie hadn't yet found his voice. His little witticisms and eccentricities are present, the upper class suspects, the relatively remote \\"bottle\\" location for the murder... all of these are typical elements in a Hercule Poirot novel and all are well executed. Once the story gets going, it moves along very well and the mystery certainly held my attention to the very end. The suspects were all pretty interesting and Poirot himself is pure gold. The only sour note for me was Hastings who is a bit too dense for my taste as well as being too pure of a Dr. Watson clone.Overall, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well worth reading. If it isn't the best Poirot story, it is still far from the worst. While I might recommend a first time Christie reader to look elsewhereDeath on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), orEvil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery, this is definitely worth trying for those who have read several Poirot novels and are looking for their latest fix of the little Belgian."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"In The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Poirot is at his most delightful, Hastings at his most cocky-turned-bumbling self, and the cast of characters the epitome of classic mystery.The Mysterious Affair at Styles also proves that Christie knew from the start what made a mystery shocking and complex. The plot structure is one of the more ingenious takes on mystery writing. It is only second to that which was used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night.I can find nothing wrong with this book. This is certainly a very good example of Golden Age mystery, it virtually defines the term. A perfect example for those searching for Golden Age and all Christie/mystery lovers."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"For lovers of 'cozies', this first adventure of the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, is mother's milk. It is such an entertaining, such a comfy novel; that even though Agatha Christie has created others much bettter, one can still appreciate her masterful techniques from the very begginning.The place is Styles Court, a great English country house in the village of Styles-St.-Mary, in Essex. The victim, Emily A. Inglethorp, the matriarch of the Cavendish family who has recently re-married. The suspects? Well, there are many, but her infamous new husband, Alfred Inglethorp, heads the list. The story starts with a re-telling acccount given by Captain Arthur Hastings, an old friend of Poirot, who ultimately brings him into the case to elucidate the murderer. As soon as Hastings arrives at Styles, he clearly senses that not all is well. His old friend John Cavendish tells him he is in financial trouble. John's wife, who conveys to Hastings \\"the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilized body\\"; is entirely enigmatical. Emily's assistant, Evie, is a practical and matter-of-fact woman who \\"had a large sensible square body\\". Although we never really learn what such bodys look like, we can immediately picture them. Here, I find, lies one of the secrets of truly masterful character description. Even very early in the book, we come across the famous description of Poirot: \\"...hardly more than five feet, four inches...\\", with \\"the head exactly the shape of an egg\\", which \\"he always perched a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" He was so incredibly neat that \\"a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.\\" The description of the characters is unique, and so is the great amount of interactivity among them. They are not a huge lot, but there's enough of them to give us a supply of good complications and 'red herrings': the sinister Mr. Inglethorp, the unimaginative John Cavendish and his perhaps too imaginative brother Lawrence, the servants, even the townsfolk. All the characters play their roles in due course, with none overshawing the others.This is a very complete novel and, as such, is also very graphic. There are at least five illustrations created by the author, among plans of the house and handwritten letters. The reader has - apparently - all the clues at hand. This was very common at the time, as well as the titling of each chapter. It all works to provide us with the whole picture. Poirot displays his wits to no end (with quite a bit of activity I must say that we don't find in later novels), and the story - typical of the rules of a good mystery for the 1920's - ends happily for everyone involved except, maybe for Hastings; who seems to be looking for a wife but has no luck in finding the right one. Ah! No problem, mon ami, perhaps in the next adventure?"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is the first appearance of Christie's brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, and his friend Captain Arthur Hastings. Like a good deal of Dame Agatha's work, it is as much a novel of manners as it is a mystery. The interaction of the egocentric Poirot and the highborn British residents at Styles is delightful, and the puzzle of the book is characteristically well done, and scrupulously fair. The only flaw in it lies in a purely ideosyncratic desire to have more exposition of the character of Poirot and less of the mechanics of the puzzle itself. All in all, a fine place to begin meeting Poirot and his grey cells."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles\\" was Agatha Christie's first mystery novel, in which she introduced her enigmatic and eccentric Belgium detective, Hercule Poirot. She often later lamented that she should have made Poirot younger to begin with as he was to be the star detective in many of her mysteries afterward. But her retired police officer began his magnificent orbit with this intriguing mystery full of the twists and turns that would soon become Christie's trademark.Wounded at the Western front, Captain Hastings is invalided home and has a chance encounter with his old friend John Cavendish. John invites him to his family's estate for a visit, which Hastings gladly accepts. But Styles, the family's home, is hardly full of happy characters. Both sons are disturbed by their stepmother's behavior - for she has married Alfred Inglethorp, a man twenty years younger than she. Almost everyone is convinced that he is solely after her money and when Mrs. Inglethorp dies suddenly one night of strychnine poisoning, her husband is the immediate suspect. But there are others within the household who would have benefitted from the old lady's death, especially when a fragment of a freshly written will is found burned in her bedchamber. Could someone within her own family have cleverly carried out her murder? Only Hercule Poirot can find all the missing pieces to solve this puzzler of a crime.Agatha Christie's name is forever cemented in the echelons of mystery writers, and with good reason. Her varied background helped to make her a near expert in matters of poisons, which have played an important role in many of her novels, and her travels to exotic locales have created heightened settings for some of her best mysteries. Her first novel must certainly have been a tough act to follow with its quick pace and plot twists; it fails only at times through its slightly weak narration by Captain Hastings. \\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles\\" introduced the world to Agatha Christie, and readers have never looked for better, returning time and again to each mystery she ingeniously crafted."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" can only be categorized as a classic among classics. In 1920, on the strength of a dare, Agatha Christie penned a cozy mystery that introduced a grateful reading world to Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings, the detective and sidekick duo who hold their place in literary fame alongside such luminaries as Holmes and Watson or Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.Captain Arthur Hastings, a guest at Styles Court, the family manor of long-time friend John Cavendish, finds himself hip-deep in a locked room murder mystery when Cavendish's mother, Emily Inglethorpe, is found poisoned by strychnine inside her locked bedroom! Hastings, who fancies himself a competent amateur sleuth, suggests the Cavendish family engage his friend, Hercule Poirot, a recently retired Belgian detective of no small skill and reputation, to find the culprit. There is certainly no shortage of possible motives, clues and suspects - John and Lawrence Cavendish, the victim's sons who are suffering from pecuniary difficulty and constant financial embarrassment; Alfred Ingelthorpe, the blackguard, money-grubbing husband who stands to inherit the entire estate at the expense of the rest of the family; Evie Howard, Mrs Inglethorpe's companion and long-time family friend recently dismissed from the estate after a bitter argument with the matriarch over the intentions of her new husband; Cynthia Murdoch, the chemist with access to strychnine; or perhaps Dr Bauerstein, a renowned expert on poisons entangled in an affair with Mary Cavendish!A thoroughly enjoyable novel, easily read in a couple of sittings, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" introduced us to all the hallmarks of typical Poirot mysteries - the quirky, vain fastidiousness of the little Belgian detective and his love of method, order and the use of \\"the little gray cells\\"; the loyalty, charm, unfailing gentlemanly behaviour and decidedly humorous upper class character of the ex-military man, Hastings; the liberal sprinkling of clues and possible suspects; and, of course, the much-loved and often imitated stereotypical congregation of the entire cast in the single room climax in which Poirot outlines his deductions and reveals the culprit for the edification of all!If you've never read an Agatha Christie mystery, this would perhaps be THE place to start! If you've read her work before, then pick this one up again, re-read it and discover why you fell in love with Agatha Christie and Poirot in the first place.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is the first Christie and the first Hercule Poirot novel. The action opens with Hastings describing his first adventure with Poirot. They become involved in solving a death in a locked room with the most obvious suspect being the husband. Many twists and turns later Poirot prevails and justice is served.Hastings circumstances (invalid army officer alone in the world) are very like Dr. Watson. The relationship between Hastings and Poirot is similiar to Watson and Holmes in that Hastings is the bumbler, always leaping to the wrong conclusion while Poirot, like Holmes, drops little hints but by in large keeps his companion in the dark until the last minute.Christie began her pattern here of going against established mystery conventions (most obvious suspect being innocent) while playing fair, (all clues are fairly laid out for the reader). The trademark Christie twists and turns are here as well.This novel was originally published in 1920 and many of the details show its age. There are references to things that the modern reader will not be familiar and some comments are absolutely not politically correct but these do not detract from the story and in fact enforce the WWI English country house setting.This is a 'must read' for any Christie fan, and highly recommended for any fan of 'cozy' mysteries."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I hate to say anything disrespectful about the greatest mystery writer of all time, but to be quite honest, I found this book as somewhat of a let down. The first two I read, Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, absolutely blew me a way. The mysterious affair at styles was nothing less than frustrating to read. All of the characters seem tainted and by the end of the novel, I didn't care who killed her as long as he/she suffered greatly. The plot was heavy and slow and the case was not only unsolvable from a reader's stand point, but a bit lagging and dull. I hate to be so cruel, but that's my honest opinion!

Why should I buy it now?I know my review is inappropriate (not being about the book, which I haven't read) and will be removed. But I really hope Amazon.com removes your review or at least the part where you describe who the killer is. What were you thinking?"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair At Styles is my first reading of an Agatha Christi book. I chose this one only because it was her first book and the initial introduction of Hercule Poirot. If I had to choose again, I would probably not choose this book as my first introduction to her, because her later works presented a much more refined and talented form of writing.This work, despite its presentation flaws, did establish Poirot as a detective to be admired and respected for his talents. It was for this reason that I never figured out why he would be associated with a character like Arthur Hastings, who appeared, in this book at least, to be little more than a stupid, ridiculous person, a dummy, and an idiot with an IQ that would barely match the low end of normal. I ended the book with the distinct hope that Ms. Christi would kill that character off.One of the other things I found difficult with this work was that it presented too many clues and overwhelmed the reader with so much information that it was difficult to follow some of it. Even so, I found that I was pretty close to the correct solution in the end, though not completely dead on and not for the right reason. Maybe my intuition was working.Since I am reviewing the Kindle edition of this book, I should take the time to point out that the conversion to digital format was very well done. There were no misspelled words or words that were run together. The one thing that was missing, however, were the sketches or pictures that were referenced in the story. While an annoyance, this was not a big problem as they were not really necessary to understanding what was happening.All of that said, I feel no particular need to review the story line itself, because I don't want to take away the pleasure of reading the book for yourself. Suffice it to say that the murder is done, the clues are presented, the possible suspects are many, and poirot gets his killer. It is for you now to see if you can solve the case along with him. While you are doing that, I will see if I can find another of Ms. Christi's works to enjoy."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The first \\"grownup\\" novels I recall reading were those of Agatha Christie and P.G. Wodehouse, and while I periodically return to Wodehouse with great enjoyment, I haven't revisited the Christie books until now. I figured this, her first published work (written in 1916, published in 1920), would be a good starting place. As well as being her first work, it introduces my favorite of her recurring characters, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.To my surprise, the story takes place during WWI (not after, as many suppose), a detail that plays a minor role in the story. The story is told by Poirot's occasional sidekick (he only appear in eight of the Poirot novels) Captain Hastings, who has been invalided home for the duration of the war. The specifics of his injury aren't explained, but he has gone to the Essex countryside to spend some time at a friend's family mansion (the Styles of the title). Things there prove to be rather tense, as the elderly matriarch has married a much younger man, whom everyone suspects of being a golddigger. Meanwhile, Hastings' friend and his brother are in tenuous financial circumstances due to the provisions of their dead father's will. Of course, the old lady ends up dead, and there are plenty of suspects to go around.Fortuitously, Hastings runs into Poirot in the local village, where Poirot and some fellow Belgians are living as refugees from the war. The two had apparently met years before, and soon Hastings has enlisted him to investigate the old woman's death. Found dead in her locked room, she appears to have been poisoned, but by whom and how is a mystery. Clues abound (as do plenty of red herrings) in the somewhat complicated story, which finds Poirot already in full form. Alas, he is the only fully developed and lively character to be found, with Hastings already his usual naive sappy self, and none of the rest of cast particularly memorable. As a story, it's somewhat clunky, although all the elements that made Poirot such a popular character are there in abundance (except his mustache mania). Not a great read, but not a bad one either."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I went back to this book, re-read it and enjoyed it again. The writing, the characters, and the solution are what make this mystery a classic. I have not read all of Christie's work, and I don't know if I ever will, but being reintroduced to Poirot was a pleasure. His busy mind, his decisive judgments and his meticulous nature make this diminutive Belgium interesting to know. Solid armchair mysteries are difficult to find especially since this book is THE standard."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I've always preferred Agatha Christie's early mysteries to those published late in her life. Somehow the most recent works feel cranked out rather than thought out.&quot;Styles&quot; reeks with atmosphere, and the characters, stock though they may be, are quite good. The English country house, locked room murder tale has been overdone a bit (I eschew hyperbole), but it seems fresh-born here. Perhaps it is because this is the author's first-born mystery novel and she cared about what she was doing.Other reviewers have described the actual plot, so I will not repeat that. Suffice it to say that the plot works, and the surprises are indeed unexpected. The logic and denouement are fair to the reader. The plot doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to...&quot;work,&quot; for lack of a better verb. Mystery readers, often without knowing it, read this genre not for the ingenious plot but for the feel of place and for the characters. If feel and characters are your thing, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I think this is the best book, or one of the best books, by Dame Christie.

I'm not optimistic about either happening. I really kind of surprised that Amazon would overlook this sort of thing. Very disappointed with my purchase at the moment."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is both the first novel for Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot. As such, it is an excellent place to start for Christie's fiction. She was only 26 when she wrote it, but it certainly does not read like the work of an amateur.One of the pleasures of reading Christie's fiction is that it is like a time machine for traveling back to the upper class of England between the World Wars. Not that society was ever REALLY like this, but it is how that society saw itself. In the usual Christie fashion, a rich person is murdered in a small town. Hastings, the narrator, involves the retired Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot to help solve the case. As usual, everyone involved thinks that Poirot is an idiot, until he brings the noose around the murderer's neck.While this book may not qualify as \\"literary fiction,\\" it is an involving read. Mysteries are all about plots - not characters. In fact, if one knows too much about the characters, it may spoil the mystery. In this book, we witness the birth of a master plotter."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The famous first Hercule Poirot novel is in good Kindle format,BUT there are substantial spaces (linrs) between paragraphs. No typos."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"My word! It seems there are plenty of pseudo-intellectuals and masculinists hanging around waiting to insult Agatha Christie's books as \\"sentimental,\\" and \\"derivative,\\" and prescribe a Rex Stout novel as an antidote. I understand that to the millennial reader this, and much of Christie's other work will feel pat and formulaic. Before we debate how much of the work out there follows in her footsteps, leaving her the original, let's ask ourselves what's so terrible about a book that is familiar and warm.There is a special way Agatha Christie captures the past. One of the things I love about her books is the view of another era. In The Mysterious Affair at Styles, we are still in the midst of the Great War. Poirot asks Cynthia about her coffee, \\"No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\\" All I've lived to see are the Gulf War and Iraq, and voluntary war conservation still seems terribly romantic to me.Over her fifty years of novel writing, we will see many things come to pass in the lives of the characters we love. Here, a young Hastings, whom we call Mr., not Captain yet, is only thirty, and has yet to meet his wife. He is simple, loyal, and a fool for a pretty girl (and, to him, nearly all girls are pretty); all things he will never quite shed, but that will develop nuance over time.People are very prone to criticizing British authors for their obsession with race and class, and Christie hasn't escaped those criticisms. Hercule Poirot is a comic foreigner, strange, fussy and effeminate. Um, and also smarter than everyone else. Although the modern interpretation of racism is strengthened by Christie's own admissions of not being so fond of his character, I remain uncertain, feeling this is in many ways a very anti-racist world Christie creates. Hastings, as a rough-and-ready man's man seems as much a joke.And here we are at Styles, where someday, ever so long from now, Poirot will solve his real last case in Curtain. In a world where everything is stuffed into two hour movies, and we've no sense of history, I find the relationship between these two men over fifty years very moving.In Styles, we have what has now become a classic mystery. Who poisoned the lady of the house, when each one wants her money more than the last - husband, stepsons, servants? Why doesn't anyone have any tears for a woman who supported them their entire lives? Evelyn, the assistant says \\"You know, Emily was a selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for them - and, that way, she missed love.\\"It's not a bad debut."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I've been reading Agatha Christie books now for a few years, and oddly enough, I hadn't read the first in the Hercule Poirot series until a couple of months ago.

Agatha Christie's first novel introduces her famous detective Hercule Poirot, he of the little black mustache and meticulous habits, who misses no clue and whose analytical brain races several steps ahead of everyone else (particularly his befuddled friend Hastings, who fancies himself a clever person, but is flummoxed by Poirot time and time again).Christie's deft handling of the plot left my head pleasantly spinning. Much of the fun of reading Christie comes from trying to spot all the important facts and keep up with Poirot's deductions. I had a couple of good hunches, but I'll admit, I did not guess the murderer's identity or anticipate the final twist.Dame Agatha must have had to sketch timelines of her novels in order to insert all the little clues in the right places and not to miss any during the d&eacute;nouement. In this first outing, I caught a few clues that were left unexplained and thought Christie's ambition might have outpaced her storytelling skills. However, my imagination filled in the gaps, and the omissions did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.All in all, an enjoyable romp to spend the weekend with."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is Agatha Christie's first book and through the characters of Hercule Poirot and Hastings one can see how clever she is at weaving a story of suspense. I cannot give her more than three stars because I didn't think the other characters in this mystery were well developed. I would have liked more back story on the life and especially the love between the three main people. If you're looking for a light suspenseful story, Christie will fill that bill."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"For lovers of 'cozies', this first adventure of the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, is mother's milk. It is such an entertaining, such a comfy novel; that even though Agatha Christie has created others much bettter, one can still appreciate her masterful techniques from the very begginning.The place is Styles Court, a great English country house in the village of Styles-St.-Mary, in Essex. The victim, Emily A. Inglethorp, the matriarch of the Cavendish family who has recently re-married. The suspects? Well, there are many, but her infamous new husband, Alfred Inglethorp, heads the list. The story starts with a re-telling acccount given by Captain Arthur Hastings, an old friend of Poirot, who ultimately brings him into the case to elucidate the murderer. As soon as Hastings arrives at Styles, he clearly senses that not all is well. His old friend John Cavendish tells him he is in financial trouble. John's wife, who conveys to Hastings \\"the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilized body\\"; is entirely enigmatical. Emily's assistant, Evie, is a practical and matter-of-fact woman who \\"had a large sensible square body\\". Although we never really learn what such bodys look like, we can immediately picture them. Here, I find, lies one of the secrets of truly masterful character description. Even very early in the book, we come across the famous description of Poirot: \\"...hardly more than five feet, four inches...\\", with \\"the head exactly the shape of an egg\\", which \\"he always perched a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" He was so incredibly neat that \\"a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.\\" The description of the characters is unique, and so is the great amount of interactivity among them. They are not a huge lot, but there's enough of them to give us a supply of good complications and 'red herrings': the sinister Mr. Inglethorp, the unimaginative John Cavendish and his perhaps too imaginative brother Lawrence, the servants, even the townsfolk. All the characters play their roles in due course, with none overshawing the others.This is a very complete novel and, as such, is also very graphic. There are at least five illustrations created by the author, among plans of the house and handwritten letters. The reader has - apparently - all the clues at hand. This was very common at the time, as well as the titling of each chapter. It all works to provide us with the whole picture. Poirot displays his wits to no end (with quite a bit of activity I must say that we don't find in later novels), and the story - typical of the rules of a good mystery for the 1920's - ends happily for everyone involved except, maybe for Hastings; who seems to be looking for a wife but has no luck in finding the right one. Ah! No problem, mon ami, perhaps in the next adventure?"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book I ever read! I have read most of her books, but this remains my favorite one of all time! Excellent! You must read it!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"For those of you like me, a person who has read almost all of Christie's work and just now turning to the book that started it all, you will feel a sort of nostalgia. Poirot is at his most delightful in this book, Hastings at his most cocky-turned-bumbling self, and the cast of characters the epitome of classic mystery.The Mysterious Affair also proves that Christie knew from the start what made a mystery shocking and complex. The plot structure, one that has been used in at least one other book, is one of the more ingenious takes on mystery writing. It is only second to that which was used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night.I can find nothing wrong with this book. While not the best out of her work, this is certainly a very good example of Golden Age mystery--it virtually defines the term. A perfect example for those searching for Golden Age and all Christie/mystery lovers."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The novel Mysterious Affair at Styles: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie is the perfect staring point for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.

Within a night of his arrival, the matriarch of the family is dead, locked in her room. Arsenic poisoning is determined to be the cause. But, was she murdered? And if so, which of the many people who inhabit the estate is the guilty party? Her thoroughly hated second husband? Her spendthrift step-son? Her niece, a nurse with access to all manner of poisons? While Hastings considers himself an amateur sleuth, he soon learns that one Hercule Poirot, formerly a detective in Belgium, has taken refuge down the road. Poirot, one of the most gifted minds in the amateur detective business, takes on \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles.\\"So begins Agatha Christie's first novel. This is the second of her novels I have read, the first being \\"And Then There Were None.\\" Since I've read only two, it's hard not to compare them, even if it's unfair to do so. \\"And Then There Were None\\" was written many years and many books after \\"Mysterious Affair,\\" so it is naturally a more polished and confident book.This isn't to say \\"Mysterious Affair\\" is a bad book. It's not. It is actually quite enjoyable. The mystery is compelling, as there are so many suspects, all of whom have any number of motives. As suspects are eliminated for their alibis or lack of evidence, Poirot and Hastings find themselves faced with choices that make very little sense, or are flat-out impossible. However, Christie never writes the proceedings in a way that makes the reader feel the sense of urgency the characters feel. The mystery is intriguing, but there isn't any sense of danger to the well-being of Poirot or Hastings.Poirot and Hastings as characters happily make a huge difference. In a way, it's their rather flawed natures that make them enjoyable. Hastings, quite vain about his abilities, is actually rather obtuse when it comes to actual sleuthing. In contrast, Poirot is extremely capable, and never lets the readers or the characters in the book forget how gifted his \\"little grey cells\\" truly are. Granted, Poirot if legitimately gifted. He just isn't always easily suffered.While not a \\"gripping\\" or \\"suspenseful\\" read, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is an entertaining one.

This is not the best edition; however, the book itself is rightly considered a classic, as the retired Belgian police detective appears for the first time. The book was written because Agatha Christie read a detective novel she considered inferior, and said, \\"I can write a better one myself.\\" A relative challenged her to do so, and she did. The rest is literary history.The most important plot elements involve a hospital dispensing area, in which Christie worked as a volunteer during World War I. The inside glimpse would be unforgettable, even if it weren't part of an unforgettable novel. Fittingly, for the final Poirot novel both Poirot and Hastings return to Styles, which is now a guest house. Christie wrote both the last Poirot novel and the last Miss Marple novel long before her death, and stashed them in a safe deposit box to appear posthumously. She then proceeded to write many more novels in both series, so when the final novels appear they seem somewhat dated in terms of their publishing dates. But it was thoughtful of her to do it that way, as she provided closure to both series."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I have read many Agatha Christie novels since I was a teenager, there is something charming and intelligent and witty about them, with this novel I finally got to read the one that started it all. Book one was actually quite good, I was entranced the whole time I was reading it, the story appears to be quite simple and the obvious is suddenly questioned, the suspect count rises and the real murderer slithers unnoticed, that is until the little Belgian super hero, Hercule Poirot gets involved. Invited by his friend Hastings, he's joined at the great mansion at the Styles Court where Emily Inglethorp runs the house, along with her new husband and her friends and relatives she lives of the riches her deceased husband has left her. On what seems a random evening she suffers horribly and ends up dead, with her current will in question and some strange things happening between the quests and the family members, there is sudden distrust of some of the members, but those who seem guilty and those are actually guilty are two different things, it's up to Poirot to stretch his little legs and big brain and get to the bottom of things. There is greed and jealousy and hidden feelings that surface only to explode in everyone's face, the fun has began!The book was a lot of fun, not only is it a fast and captivating read, it makes the reader think quite a bit. I took my time reading it and loosely going over the clues in my head. Upon reading the ending I was off in my decision of the guilty suspect but never the less I loved the ending and the final explanation, some clues might not be as crystal clear as others but there are many of them; reading is fun when the field is wide, not when it's thin and obstructed by lack of ideas and this novel certainly had me guessing all over the place. Agatha Christie is one of my favorite authors because every time I read her books I feel a jolt of joy, I get so much out of them and nothing written in these days will ever compare, so to me they are relics from the past that shine even brighter than many brand new books written these days. The mystery is fun but the whole feel of this book is even better, the old fashioned ideas and culture adds something whimsical to all of her works. Every time I pick up a Hercule Poirot novel I know I will have a nice time, so far I haven't been disappointed as I have read them half my life and will continue to do so. Currently I had to start book number two in the series, I am on such a happy high from the first one that my thirst for mystery hasn't been quenched yet, so I'm off to read \\"Murder on the links\\" and see where the adventure takes me, from what I head it's Paris and the crime is quite good..- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Agatha Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) by Agatha ChristieThe Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's first mystery novel, introduced Belgian detective Hercules Poirot to what has grown to be legions of readers in the intervening years since its publication in 1920. Poirot springs onto the pages fully formed. The retired Belgian police detective is quirky, not to say eccentric, but brilliant. He is that \\"odd little man\\" who uses \\"the little gray cells\\" to solve cunningly hidden crimes.Christie's typically complicated plot keeps the reader guessing along with Poirot's friend and narrator Lieutenant Hastings. Clue after clue leads us down one blind alley after another. Reading tip: If Hastings thinks he has figured something out, you can be sure he has it backwards. Christie adheres to this rule without exception - almost.By the way, I highly recommend the TV series in which David Suchet captures Hercules Poirot perfectly For example: (Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection). Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov have also given entertaining portrayals. Christie's Miss Marple, on the other hand, has been tackled by numerous actresses, but none has succeeded like Suchet has with Poirot. My favorite Marple is Margaret Rutherford who played the role in four movies made in the 1960s (The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)).The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a delightfully entertaining mystery and a \`must read' for any fan of the mystery genre.

No, this is not &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle, and the narrator and detective are not Watson and Holmes.I had enjoyed several of Christie's later Poirot novels before reading &quot;Styles&quot;, and I had never suspected that Agatha Christie patterned Hercule Poirot so much after Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. I've already noted the similarities in the plotting of Poirot's and Holmes' debut novels, but there is more. Holmes was tall, thin, bohemian, and utterly British. Poirot was short, fat, fastidious, and decidedly un-British. Holmes' examination of the crimescene in &quot;Scarlet&quot; was very similar to Poirot's in &quot;Styles&quot;, but Holmes would never have flinched at examining the contents of the dispatch box. Holmes solved his mysteries by logical deduction, Poirot by the exercise of the &quot;little grey cells&quot;. Both could get so involved in the work of detection that they cut quite comical figures. Both labored mightily to keep the detectives from Scotland Yard on the right track. Both men's confidence in their abilities bordered on arrogance, and both held their cards close to their vests before dramatically divulging the villian.Holmes was always one for a pithy aphorism on detection. Poirot also: &quot;Imagination is a good servant and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.&quot; &quot;Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory; let the theory go.&quot; &quot;It is always wiser to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they are innocent.&quot;There are similarities, but we cannot press them too far. Differences abound. Christie writes a much more Byzantine plot that Conan Doyle ever did, and in this case she arrives at the simplest explanation in the most complex, convoluted, contrived, and circuitous route imaginable. She also likes to play tricks on the reader, so beware! I occasionally wanted to cry foul during the course of the book, but her storytelling was so delightful, and the ending so satisfactory, that I had to applaud even as I felt somewhat betrayed."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This is Agatha Chritie's firt novel and Hercule Poirot's first case. It's also a great read. I was first introduced to Agatha Chritie in sixth grade by my gifted teacher, and have been a Poirot fan ever since--I did a book report on a Ms. Marple book, but decided later that that funny little Belgian gent was more my type. Christie creates a wondeful and entertaining character in Hercule Poirot. He's conceited in a funny way, immaculately groomed, and brilliant in solving crimes; he also has a way of dropping subtle and interesting crumbs along the way and not revealing all he know until the end. Christie never fails to surprise, either, as to who the perpatrator is. This ending is truly the last you'd expect. The Queen of the mystery genre (says who? me, that's who) is at her most wonderful prime in this delightful first novel. It's inriguingly written, the characters are great, and it is short. A must read."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Meet Hercule Poirot. This is the story that introduces Christie's most represented character. Poirot is certainly one of the most preferred of her characters and Christie returns to to him many times over. This mystery occurs in a slower part of the countryside, where the recent Great War is still felt. We also meet Captain Hastings here, recuperating from wounds received is the war, visiting with the family of an old friend. His friend lives with his wife in the home of his mother, her recently acquired much younger, and rather poorly liked, husband, a brother and other assorted guests of the family. Once the tensions in the household become more pronounced, it should come as no surprise that murder follows. While everyone seems stunned, most have their own suspicions about who \\"done it.\\"From the village nearby appears the Belgian wonder, Poirot, and what happens next is what you might expect. Hastings seems sure he can solve this case easily, and it's great fun to see the little man with the \\"gray cells\\" show him that there is more than meets the eye. It's no wonder that Agatha came back so many times to use Poirot is so many stories."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Very enjoyable. Keeps you guessing to the end! The use of a third, less intelligent character to observe Poirot and get frustrated with him was a nice touch too."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This first story of Hercule Poirot is excellent. You really get a feel for the character of Hercule Poirot that is going to carry through the rest of his mysteries. Agatha Christie will always be my favorite mystery writer and this book shows why. Unfortunately, this Kindle edition is missing the illustrations which are somewhat necessary to understanding the book. Since I have read print versions many times, this didn't matter so much to me but it will to those who have never read it. That is the only reason I didn't give this version 5 stars. With or without the illustrations, an excellent, excellent story!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Great characters, great mystery. Loved the glimpse of old England.

Keeps you guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I have been reading Agatha Christie novels since I was a kid. This is the first of her many Hercule Poirot mystery stories. I wish I knew more about Poirot before she wrote her novels. But she takes the cake on character developments with the narrator writing in the first person after the \\"mysterious affair\\". She uses simple logic and hands on detective work to solve the crime, while keeping the reader hanging on to each word. Old English idioms are a kicker...it's interesting to know some phrases are coming back to me. Check out the book!! You won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I am always amazed at the characterizations in the writing of the early part of the 20th century. The character of Mr. Poirot and the use of first person in the novel pulls one into the story."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This book is one of many by this author. If one enjoys Hercule Poirot, this is another good book. We have this in \\"real\\" book form and wanted to check out the kindle my wife was given."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I finished this novel yesterday once I saw that it was free on my Kindle. From other reviews I have come to understand that the hardcover or other versions of this novel comes with illustrations that are missing from this version. From my point of view not having the illustrations is no detriment to the overall novel. It was a fast paced read that had me guessing until the end. Just like all of the other Agatha Christie novels I have read.\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" was Christie's first novel that introduced the character of Hercule Poirot. The novel is told in first person by Lieutenant Hastings which many fans of Christie will recognize as assisting Poirot in later novels.The novel is set in England during World War I at the home of a very wealthy widow, Emily Cavendish. Mrs. Cavendish an older woman marries a fairly younger man named Alfred Inglethorp. Emily's stepsons from her previous marriage, John and Lawrence Cavendish, all believe that Alfred is up to no good and taking advantage of Emily. Hastings is a friend of John's and goes to visit the family at Styles while recovering from being wounded. While there one of the servants quits due to her mistrust of Alfred. Shortly afterwards Emily is found dying in the middle of the night.Finding out what killed Emily Cavendish and who was behind it causes Hastings and others to come upon Poirot. Poirot a former Belgian police officer now residing in England as a refugee decides to help catch Emily's killer in order to thank her for her hospitality to all of the Belgians she has hosted during the war.Having Hastings narrate makes you feel all of the confusion and annoyance that he feels at Poirot. I was surprised to find that this case would lead to them both having a life long partnership with each other since Hastings shows dislike to Poirot in several instances.Several times I thought Hastings had solved the murder or at least knew who had done it but was found to not be the case when Poirot would point out several problems with his evidence.Eventually you will come to find out who murdered Emily Cavendish but after a long and merry chase.All in all a great read that will leave you wanting to read more about Hercule Poirot!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Story moves along with the usual \\"family\\" of suspects and local villagers to help solve the mystery. Really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"While I adore all things Poirot, this particular publication leaves much to be desired...mostly the essential images. Literally, images of clues (scribbles on paper, bits of burned documents, maps of the house) that should appear in the reading are absent. Some do not affect the storyline but others make it impossible to follow the conclusions of the characters because the reader is missing vital information. Aside from that, the pages look like simple bare internet printouts. If one cares little for aesthetics in his/her reading experience, this should not pose a problem. For others (myself included) it is a deterent to a truly enjoyable read. I suggest anyone seeking an inexpensive version of this book to choose the Barnes and Noble publication. Also inexpensive, but featuring all the bells and whistles of which Hercule Poirot himself would approve."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"This book required learning new characters and a new dectective for me. I found it entertaining and the ending satisfying if not typical.I would recommend it to any Agatha Christie fan. Good read."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I have read everyone of Agatha Christie's novels, short stories, plays, etc. and truly, nobody writes a better mystery. Classic and always interesting, I re-read this book whenever I just need a good read."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"Once again an incredibly intriguing mystery from the Queen of Mysteries. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Her endings always delight and surprise the reader. Characters are well defined and her story line entices you to keep reading."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"H. Poirot is such an iconic character. This book is interesting, with well-thought out charactersand plot twists. Christie is an excellent mystery writer, and I am sure her works will entertainfans for years and years to come."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"I love mysteries! I'd read all types of Nancy Drew books and wanted more. So, I picked up The Mysterious Affair at Styles at the library, expecting a writing style similar to Carolyn Keene's. How wrong I was! Agatha Christie writes wonderful, mysterious plots that twist and turn in every chapter! I'd reccommend this book as a first read to someone who's never read Agatha Christie. Even though it was Christie's first, it must be one of her best.
