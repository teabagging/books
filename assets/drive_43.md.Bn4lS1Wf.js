Could Mr. BeauSeigneur keep it up? Book two was fantastic, so I was worried this one would be a letdown. Rest assured, this isn't the case. Book Three was a great conclusion to the story.The Anti-Christ finally makes his appearance(of course, he's been there all along, but you'll see what I mean when you read the book) and, undoubtably, his true plan is finally revealed. For those of you who were wondering just where the author was going with all the new age stuff, be faithful. It will all make sense in the end.I particularly liked the theme of redemtion in this novel. I don't want to give too much away, so I will not say more, but I think you will be as pleased as I was.Finally, I enjoyed the way BeauSigneur handled Armaggedon and the appearance of Jesus. To be honest, this is a point at which the author could have overdone it, but, as always, he hit the nail on the head. If you enjoyed the previous two books in the series, you will enjoy this one as well. Rating:4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I saw the Left Behind movie, which interested me in &quot;end of times&quot; books. I then bought the entire Left Behind series, up to &quot;The Mark&quot;. While I enjoyed it at first, by the last book the writing was extremely redundant and seemed the writer was stringing the series along to make as much money as possible. While reading reviews on the series, I saw a remark that the Christ Clone Trilogy was much better. One I read this series, I was blown away! It is by far the very best books I probably ever will read. Amazing is more like it. I have since forwarded the series to my mother who is currently reading it and totally enthralled in book 3. What I truly appreciated was that this was only a 3 book series and thus I knew an end would be reached. I would recommend this series to EVERYONE who has any interest in revelation/ the bible/ or just good reading. Two Thumbs Up!!!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I got interested in this book when I read about it in Amazon's Left Behind review section as it was mentioned there and received glowing reviews. This is one of the finest books I have ever read and I couldn't put it down. While the first book had a steady pace and introduced most of the characters, the second and third books were intense. Mr. BeauSeigneur uses character point of view to great advantage, and he puts great detail into this story. It is a brilliant and inspirational book."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"If you've read the first two books of this series, you are probably getting anxious to see where this trilogy is going. Well get ready!!! You will not be disappointed!!!! I will warn you, there are some pretty graphic sections of this book, and Mr. BeauSeigneur pulls no punches. But this book, number three of the series, is the absolute best one, and will have you totally enthralled and at the edge of your seat till the very last word. The best end times fiction that I have read!!!! Any fan of the Left Behind books owes it to themselves to read this trilogy. You will be glad that you did!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I have read the CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur. The &quot;3&quot; books are extremely well written, they cover the entire Tribulation period and they do keep you on the edge of your seat. I was amazed at the level of detail James was able to convey with the written word alone. I'm extremely impressed with his style of writing. I loved the series and I recommend it highly to all. In fact, I looked forward to riding the bus to work so I could get additional reading time.The Christ Clone Trilogy&quot; as a bit different from other end-times because it's written primarily for a non-Christian audience. In a few places the language might get a &quot;PG&quot; rating and the descriptions of violence during the tribulation are incredibly detailed and spine-chilling. The books are definitely written from a Christian world view although that does not become obvious until you get to the third book.I highly recommend these SUPERB books to anyone interested in end-times prophecy. I guarantee you'll find them every bit as interesting as the Left Behind Series - actually, MUCH MORE!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This series is absolutely flawless. Last semester I took a class in apocalyptic literature. We read bits and pieces of more than a dozen end-times books and series. After each, we would discuss the positive and negative aspects of each. The folks in my class were pretty sharp, so we found many flaws in each of them. Finally, the professor had us read THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY. When we did our class discussion, we spent more than two hours on all the positives, e.g., EVERY prophecy was masterfully covered by BeauSeigneur, the characterizations were rich and full, the plot was riveting, the research was perfect. Class was nearly over before the professor stopped the discussion to ask about any flaws. No one had found any. The professor agreed and said that was why he had saved THE CHRIST CLONE for last. I'm buying the full set for everyone on my Christmas shopping list!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"James BeauSeigneur has done some very unusual things in his apocalyptic thriller, The Christ Clone Trilogy, and he's done all of them well. First on this list is that (until the third book) he gives no clue who's good and who's bad, who's right and who's wrong. Instead BeauSeigneur acts as an unbiased reporter of the events, and the reader is left to evaluate and discern the truth for himself. This makes for a very good mystery, but it will make some readers very upset as their own beliefs are so cleverly challenged. One word of advice: do not make the mistake of thinking you know which characters speak for the author.Second on the list of unusual approaches the author takes is that he has built his story so closely on carefully researched real events, real science, real politics, real belief systems (when was the last time you read a fiction series that included footnotes?), that you have a sense that you may be reading a non-fiction book written in the future and sent back to our time for publication.One final thing that makes this series so extraordinary is BeauSeigneur's use of well-developed minor characters and vignettes to give the reader a view of the global scope of his story. Unlike so many authors who try deal with global issues with contrived attempts to put the story's main characters in close proximity to every important world event, BeauSeigneur draws on a boundless stable of rich characters from around the world to give every page a full measure of realism and depth.I highly recommend these books to all."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The Christ Clone Trilogy is easily one of the best fiction stories I've ever read. The final book in the trilogy, Acts of God, ends the story with the force of a knock out punch. BeauSeigneur slowly increases the tension to the breaking point, culminating in the final battle between good and evil. And what a battle it is! Sides are chosen and only the people who chose wisely prevail. The last book hurtles the reader to the final confrontation at a breakneck speed...and the reader gladly goes along for the ride.A fantastic ending to a stunning series of books. Who is this guy James BeauSeigneur and why isn't he writing more books!!!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"All I can say about this book is &quot;WOW!&quot;The first book &quot;In His Image&quot; was a bit too dense for me. What with all the explanations on how officers are elected to serve in the United Nations, I was bit overwrought, but I saw it through.I can't really say much about the first and second books, but boy, was I sitting on the edge of my seat with book three!The scenes are beautifully orchestrated and the fact that the author gives biblical references in his footnotes is very helpful, unlike the Left Behind series where the author assumes every reader has in-depth knowledge of the Bible. It's nice to be able to pick up the Bible and find the references the story is referring to."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"ACTS OF GOD is a gripping and wonderful conclusion to the riveting Christ Clone trilogy. These three novels are three of my favorites of all time. As an avid reader I count Cussler, Clancy, Demille, Crichton and Pat Conroy among my favorites and I welcome James BeauSeigneur to the list. As a Christian, I've been quite disappointed with much of the Christian fiction on the market, until I devoured this awesome series - full of great characterization, dialogue and suspense. Written from the perspective of Antichrist this book (and series) is frighteningly realistic but wonderfully Biblically accurate. BeauSeigneur paints and the story without being in-your-face evangelistic which is refreshing. I can really see end times events unfolding in exactly this way. I recommend The Christ Clone trilogy to all my friends, Christian and non-Christian alike!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"An excellent reading experience!!!Most Christian fiction works that I have read seem more interested in covertly proselytizing than telling a story. Not so with these books of The Christ Clone Trilogy. So well developed is Mr. BeauSeigneur's descriptive writing style that reading this book allows you to \\"live\\" it. A reader's imagination is powerful, and this author knows just how to stoke it to shift it into high gear.As I began this book, I was prepared for an alternative version of the Book of Revelation. But his abilities as a master architect kept the plot rolling at a very fast pace. His short vignettes throughout the story were effective and subtle in illustrating his points. I appreciated the cited references in the text and his scholarly approach.It was hard not to develop a relationship and feel camaraderie with Decker Hawthorne, a key player in the trilogy. Poor Decker...resourceful, optimistic, heroic, loyal, sensitive, and thoroughly duped.I am pleased to add this trilogy to my library and highly recommend the experience."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I remember when I was young my parents had a book that was called, &quot;Guide to Survival&quot; and it was designed for people who were &quot;left behind&quot; after the Rapture. As a child it terrified me,the prophecies foretold in the Bible. Reading this trilogy brought it all back to me. BeauSeigneur's narrative which flows so seamlessly from one book to the next, reads like vintage Stephen King or Tom Clancy with his spiritual message coming through in the third book with a deft touch and poweful resonance. The final chapter in the ultimate battle for man's soul is continued to be seen through Decker Hawthorne's eyes,an every man questioning everything he knows when faced with a horrible dilemma: Could the boy he raised and help propel his career actually be the Antichrist?This book had me questioning the strength of my own beliefs, and how firm they are. The realism with which the author describes the horrible last days is enough to make anyone make the right choice so they too won't be left behind."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"If you liked the Left Behind series you will like this trilogy on the end times. James Beauseigneur has an excellent writing style that pulls you in and draws you along with well told stories, plausible scenarios, and thorough descriptions of catastrophic events. His writings appear to be well researched and Biblically based. You may not agree with some of his theology, timelines, or conclusions - as you may not have with some things in the Left Behind series - but you will like his storytelling.In order to enjoy these books, you must read all three in order. In the first two books I would sometimes think \\"that's not the way that would happen,\\" but in the last book my eyes were opened. I realized that Beauseigneur has such an ability to write from different perspectives that you actually begin to believe something different about the \\"villain\\" of the story. The last book is the best of the three and you will look back and say \\"he really had me going there for a while\\". That's probably why the author says in the front of the first two books - \\"I would ask for your patience and remind you of the words of Ecclesiastes 7:8 \`the end of the matter is better than its beginning.'\\"I read all of the Left Behind series and started several other series. This is the best written series I've read so far.If you're a Christian fiction end-times enthusiast you will love this trilogy."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This is Book Three of an end-time Trilogy. I consider this to be the most well-written, Scripturally accurate, and exciting books written on the subject, and I have read a LOT! James BeauSeigneur has great imagination to tell a story that the Bible says clearly is beyond imagination, and in fact, un-knowable. Many have tried to say what it will be like, but most are either incredibly boring, or too melodramatic, even \\"cheesy,\\" IMHO. The days preceding THAT DAY of the return of Christ are spoken of in the Old Testament, and by Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament... however, we are also told that He will return \\"like a thief in the night\\" and \\"just as in the days of Noah,\\" i.e. everyone will be surprised! I think that this trilogy gives us insight to have faith, to be aware, to share the Good News boldly, and to serve the Lord fervently as the only means of being ready for His coming!He who testifies to these things says, \\"Yes, I am coming quickly.\\" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. Revelation 22:20"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The first book in this trilogy was an engaging and thoughtful thriller, a what-if change in history. The 2nd and 3rd parts after Christ clone veer more towards preaching without the hook of a good novel. Too bad."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Ahh what a wonderful trilogy. I was totally satisfied with the ending, and was amazed at how skillfully BeauSeigneur was able to lead me down one path, then totally change directions. I suppose if I knew my Bible better he would not have been able to do this, but since I dont I was lead through the trilogy and the ups and downs of the characters. I thought this was a great, fast and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"BeauSeigneur accomplishes a difficult task--ending this sophisticated, urgency-packed end times trilogy. Those familiar with Christian end-times fiction know how the book has to end. The author exposes evil, applauds righteousness, and mourns the multitudes who are deluded by the most ancient of enemies.While the author does better than most, in this genre, I found the first two books moved at a better pace than number three. This conclusion had slow spots, and occasionally was more obvious in exposing the author's viewpoints, than the previous two had been.In the end, I loved this series and hated to see it end. My sense is that the author felt the same way. I hope BeauSeigneur is discovered by the big publishing houses. Who knows, maybe he will do a similar series on the Tower of Babel?"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"For so many years, a Christian's only real option to read quality Christian literature was to read the marevelous C.S. Lewis. I feel blessed in the the last couple of years with the outpouring of quality literature now available. What's more, the different books are all very different. Left Behind is a wonderful introduction to the theology behind the End Times and a great series for all ages. We All fall down is a great book for more mature, intellegent Christians who wsnt to explore the individual ramifications of the End Times and the one on one relationship of a man who has fallen away from God. The Christ Clone Trilogy is a thrilling, Tom Clancey like look at these events, full of unexpected twists and turns. I know some people like to argue the various merits of these books as compared to each other, but I think they are all worth reading and feel lucky to finally have such a wide variety of GREAT Christian literature available."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Great to read and really close towards what can be reality tomorrow"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This is some very well written fiction.

What a disappointment. The character construction and development from the first 2 books was almost totally forgotten in the final installment.

After about the middle of the third book however, the whole thing turns out to be nothing more than Judeo-Christian Mythology. Very disappointing. An insult to human intelligence. If you can digest evangelical propaganda, read this book. What a waste of time..."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Having read the first two books in the series, I was looking forward to what fresh ideas the author might surprise us with. The idea of the God we know not being the &quot;real&quot; God was scary to me, albeit not unknown. The gospel of Thomas also alludes to this theory. Sadly the final novel was a rehash of old ideas from a fundalmentalist viewpoint. I wish I had known this before investing my time in the series. Nothing new or revealing here."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I've been reading Christian oriented fiction for years now and thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in the series.For the Christian who needs affirmation of their faith (I'm not one of them) perhaps the third volume \\"redeems\\" the first two, which propose an enjoyable \\"alternate\\" theory to existing religious dogma. However, for someone who was seeking an entertaining perspective on the \\"end of the world\\" the series took a notable turn for the worse The series is, pretty much, destroyed, with this third volume.The first two volumes build on a certain premise (no spoilers here) and we, the \\"suspending disbelief audience\\" are called on to go along with whatever the author is purporting to communicate, taking any pre-conceived ideas and putting them in a closet (Without suspending our disbelief and with a bit of knowledge regarding the scriptures, we are a frustrated audience screaming at the book \\"But what about this, and this, and this?!!\\") With this third volume, we are given the author's true motives and have that suspension broken into pieces.As readers, we are manipulated, and unfairly so. We are treated as unintelligent whelps at the whims of the author who feels justified by including a preface that excuses what he is writing and advises the reader to withhold judgment to the end of the series. Having done that, I am ashamed at the bold facedness of this manipulation. Shame on you, Mr. BeauSeigneur!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I feel like i got cheated. The first two books were bearable but this third one undid any value in the first two. Unless you are a fundamentalist Christian (with a very narrow interpretation of the Bible) these are not for you. As one reviewer already noted, the characters are weak. Additionally, the end of this third book is a complete let down. Contrary to the reviews printed on the book jacket, there is little erudition and the author's interpretation of many of the referenced passages in the Bible are highly questionnable. This is not fiction, this is propoganda with a false hook."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I got hooked on this trilogy from the very beginning. Having an extensive biblical background I knew what the author was talking about and referring to, and I was in total shock with the twists and turns. But, for me the ending was pure disappointment. It was too fast, short, and extremely fictional. I wish he had developed a better ending."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Wow, do I feel sucker-punched!! I really enjoyed the first two novels in the Christ Clone trilogy about the rise of Christopher Goodman, cloned from cells found on the Shroud of Turin, as told by his friend and mentor Decker Hawthorne. What an awesome premise! Beauseigneur is a good writer and Decker is a fine narrative protagonist. The books were exciting and interesting, and by the end of the second novel I was really anxious to read the ending. What happened?SPOILER WARNING: Where there had been imagination, suddenly there is just a spouting of Revelations. I swear, there is a 53-page section that is just one character telling Decker stuff straight out of a Bible-thumper's visit to your front porch, and just as welcome. Suddenly, all the intelligence that we had seen from this author is replaced by Christian dogma. I had really hoped that this talented author would find a way, literarily at least, of reconciling the Good/Evil Christian/Everybody Else dilemma, or of saying &quot;both views have problems and this is the reality&quot;, but instead we get straight dogma shoved down our throats.If you are a Christian who wants to read a narrative version of Revelations, this is for you. Anyone else, read the first two (very good) books and make up your own ending. You could not do any worse than Beauseigneur has done here.Very VERY disappointing."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I agree with Stephen King's comments on this series: BeauSeigneur is a master!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I was moderately optimistic that the third book of the Christ Clone Trilogy, Acts of God by James BeauSeigneur, would continue to improve much like the second title improved over the first. Fortunately, it did, and I can say it wasn't a waste of time...The seven year tribulation period is nearing the end, and Christopher Goodman (the Christ clone) has truly become the anti-Christ. He is leading the world in rebellion against God and his followers, and the ante to refuse the mark continues to climb. Robert Milner, Goodman's \\"prophet\\", is posing as the person responsible for stopping the judgements being sent down upon the earth. Goodman's last effort to rid the earth of religious zealots is culminating in an attack on the Petra enclave, where most of the Jewish believers are holed up. All the armies of the earth are converging on that single spot with hopes to usher in the new millennial age. Meanwhile, Decker Hawthorne, Goodman's guardian when he was younger, is starting to question the motives and reality of Goodman's rule, and he disappears for an extended period of time. While hiding out, he starts to read Revelations and understands what is really going on. This leads to a personal confrontation in Goodman's office with an unfortunate ending...As I mentioned in the first book review, I wasn't real excited after the initial installment. But at the urging of friends, I kept going. Book two was better, and started to bring together the story line that I was expecting. This final episode was a great read, and stands up well against other \\"end times\\" series such as Left Behind. The Goodman character had some twists I didn't expect, and it forced me to think through some scenarios that I hadn't thought about before.All in all, a good series. Definitely a case where you should commit to reading them all, and not be put off by a slow start. It does get better, and it ends very well..."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This series opens the door to some very interesting, biblicly based speculation that mixes with modern science. At first you wonder where he is going with this but then he draws it all together very nicely."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"These are amazing books! Everyone knows than when you read fiction you have to be prepared to suspend disbelief and tell yourself: &quot;Okay, it's just a book. Everything doesn't have to make sense.&quot; This would be especially true for something like a book about cloning Jesus.And yet, James BeauSeigneur has done so much to insure credibility and accuracy in all the broad range of areas he's covered, that you'll find yourself believing it could all be true. And the way the story depicts the fulfillment of end-times prophecy will have you convinced that the author's got that nailed too."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I WAS READY TO THROW AWAY ALL THREE WHILE READING BOOK TWO OF THIS TRILOGY, BUT FELT LED TO CONTINUE ON TO THIS ONE, THE LAST IN THE TRILOGY.

The books are well written and build towards something interesting, but in the end I felt duped and slapped in the face with a fish! It felt like the author pulled a fast one on a segment of his readers. I was told about this book by someone in Amazon who wrote \\"if you like Dan Brown you'll love James Beauseigneur\\". They are NOT similar! If you think you're going to get something like that, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The author of the Christ Clone trilogy is obviously a very intelligent man. I've always been amazed at how a truly intellectually gifted man can be a fundamentalist Christian, which means he/she takes everything in the Bible literally, and thereby misses much of the deeper message and beauty, since spiritual literature of all kinds uses poetry and metaphor.Well, nonetheless, the author has written a tight and fun FANTASY series about the Christian End Times, although I doubt the author sees it as fiction, but as a warning of what is to come.A few problems I have with the book:1. At one point, the author describes one of the \\"bad people\\" as a gay man. Now obviously the author has never really known a gay man as a friend or he is intentionally smearing what it means to be gay. In this book, the gay man is described as loving his lacy white underwear. EXCUSE ME, BUT GAY MEN DO NOT WEAR LACY WHITE UNDERWEAR! Perhaps transexuals (men who wish they were women) enjoy lace underwear, but all the gay men I have known (and I lived in San Francisco many years), love the masculine. So you'd be more likely to find a gay man wearing black leather than white lace! I interpreted this as an intentional slam against gay people, since fundamentalist Christians, especially men, seem terrified and very intolerant of gay men.2. The author pretty flatly states that Satan works through the New Age to mislead humankind. He even mentions certain series of books, such as the SETH SPEAKS (Jane Roberts) and COURSE OF MIRACLES. Ironically, the Course of Miracles is part of my Christian CHurch curriculum, and I don't think Satan is teaching the class! The New Age is not a coherent movement, it is merely a marketing category under which a lot of music and products are placed that don't fit anywhere else! Acupuncture was once considered New Age, along with any type of alternative healing like chiropractors and essential oils. In summary, this was another intentional slam by the author against a classification of product that has very little meaning in and of itself.3. I was annoyed that the author would go to excruciating detail about some things, e.g., the setup of the UN, streets in Jerusalem, but left us in the dark about WHY a clone of Jesus Christ would be evil? I know 2 identical twins (natural clones) and one is not evil while the other is good. They are both middle of the road guys, basically good but self-centered at times like the rest of us. But since science played such a big part in this story, I just did not read a convincing reason why the clone of Jesus would naturally be the anti-Christ, and that this clone would secretly know this from a very young age. You can't call it demon seed, since the clone was made 100% from Jesus cells. So the story crashes at that point, and you have to set asside reason. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention a character named John, who was 2000 years old. The author keeps this figure a stick person without any real flesh around him. What has he been doing for 2000 years, buying Microsoft stock?4. I think the author should have ended the story BEFORE attempting to describe eternal life in the New Earth, where Jesus was going to rule for 1000 years. Evidently, his rule will not be enough to keep the saved in line, since the author claims that Jesus has to create this entire governmental bureaucracy! Imagine heaven having a post office! I just thought this ending of the book, showing all the saved congratulating each other and floating around the New Earth like hummingbirds was a bit much. I think such times should be left to the imagination of the reader, since I found them rather silly. For example, the earth was a wonderful garden like Eden. Well, what about people with pollen allergies? What if I am a city slicker and hate gardens?Well, except for the above points where the author's rather stinky fundamentalist odor crept out of the pages, the book was a fun read. If you are a fundamentalist CHristian, you will probably enjoy it much more than I did."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Well written, but the story is getting worst as more you read.

Finally, in the last few years, two authors have produced amazing books about Revelations. Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down is the first truly mature look at Revelations. It's not a book for people looking to stand at a distance, as it is an emotionally devistating piece of fiction. It is raw and uncompromising, a book that will grab you by the throat and shake your soul. I don't think I have ever read a book that challenged me to examine my faith so strongly. BeauSeigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy is equally impressive, if in a different way. While Caldwell's book focuses on the spiritual psychology of a single character, Beausigneur tackles the big picture. His novels are intellegent and incredibly well-researched. His novels make you believe that the end of the world could happen, not just spiritually, but intellectually as well. The two authors complement each other quite well, with BeauSigneur tackling the big picture and Caldwell zeroing in on the personal.What both writers have in common is a perfect ear for dialouge, a scathing intellegence, and an insight into spiritual matters that was exciting to read. After suffering through so many second rate novelists tackle revelations, it was an incomparable pleasure to read these magnificent books."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I'm 57. In my entire life, I've only read six novels from cover to cover and they were all less than 250 pages. I'm a skimmer, not a reader. I couldn't even bring myself to read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. But a friend of mine strongly urged me to at least page through The Christ Clone Trilogy. Once I started, I found myself reading almost non-stop and finishing the third book less than three weeks later. BeauSeigneur has changed many of my views about the return of Christ."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The back cover of this book tells us that the author, James BeauSeigneur, was a former intelligence analyst for the National Security Agency, a newspaper publisher, a political science professor, a contender for a seat in Congress in 1980 (he ran against Al Gore), and a writer of numerous speeches, manuals, and articles. What this description doesn't tell us is that BeauSeigneur is a fundamentalist Christian as well. This is important to note because this series of books, of which \\"Acts of God\\" is the final installment, is a fundamentalist Christian view of the end of the world. Some people will have a problem with a fundamentalist based view of the apocalypse. They shouldn't worry, however, because these books are exciting and about as \\"unputdownable\\" as you can possibly imagine.\\"Acts of God\\" is the boisterous conclusion to the Christ Clone series, and BeauSeigneur pulls out all the stops with this one. Plagues right out of the Book of Revelations roar through the world, killing millions upon millions of people. Water turned to blood, extreme heat, and sinister darkness ravage the globe. People turn to Secretary-General Christopher Goodman for help, and they get it when Bob Milner, his New Age guru, performs miracles to clear up the plagues. Goodman and his coterie of officials operate out of the new United Nations headquarters located in Babylon, Iraq. It is here that Decker Hawthorne, Goodman's confidant, suggests marking the hands of the faithful when they receive doses of Christopher's blood in the \\"Communion.\\" The only people organized to oppose Christopher is the KDP, located at Petra, in the wilderness of Jordan. Needless to say, the book ends with a bang, and yes, Jesus Christ himself puts in an appearance.In this volume, I am most impressed with what I see as the process of Christian conversion involving Decker Hawthorne. Christopher Goodman's opposition, the KDP, kidnaps Hawthorne, the main character of the series. At the KDP compound in Petra, Jordan, Scott Rosen, a minor character who appeared in the first book of the series, confronts Decker about his belief in Christopher. Rosen launches into a lengthy exegesis on Christianity, trying to prove to Decker that it is the only true religion in the world. Decker, upon his release, spends a month agonizing over what Rosen told him, while biblical plagues sweep the world. Decker ultimately converts to Christianity (it's a close one, as you'll see) and rejects Christopher's New Age world. BeauSeigneur dramatically shows how many come to convert to Christianity, and also tries to get some of his readers to convert as well.BeauSeigneur's use of New Age religions as a conduit for the Anti-Christ is also a relevant detail of the story. New Age religions encompass two important aspects in the rise of the Anti-Christ; the first is humanism, or the emphasis on man as the center of spiritual development; the second is moral relativism, which allows humanity to engage in any type of deviant behavior without fearing consequences. Bob Milner, the false prophet who serves the Anti-Christ in the story, is a practitioner of New Age quackery. When the Anti-Christ is preaching about man becoming a god, he uses the language and techniques of New Age religion to accomplish his goal.I guess my only concern with the trilogy is the lack of character development. It may be successfully argued that the main character of the book is the apocalypse, but there is no reason to ignore the other characters. BeauSeigneur rarely provides adequate descriptions of his characters beyond their words and actions. It is an uneven process; Decker's internal thoughts are described, but others are completely ignored. It is also difficult to sympathize with characters when you have no idea what they look like.I also take exception to the fundamentalist interpretation to the apocalypse. Every event that happens is right out of Revelations, as though the plagues are a checklist. It's funny that many characters never seem to notice what is happening as the events unfold. Perhaps BeauSeigneur is commenting on the lack of knowledge most people have today with the Bible. Personally, I think I would have bowed out long before the UN relocated to Babylon.Get out there and pick these three books up as quickly as you can. I originally bought \\"In His Image\\" without getting the others. I finally picked up the other two when I realized they might go out of print before I read the first one. I am glad I did this because I wanted to start reading the next book right after I finished the previous one. These books are so engrossing that the pages fly by at lightening speed. I think I finished the whole trilogy in about three days. Get going!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"In this third and last book in the series, the author wraps up all nagging questions and creates the \\"Final Battle.\\" It seems that all things just resolved themself way too quickly. The author has a good grasp on Christian theology and seems to explain the things that happen well. His explaination of the coming of Jesus to defeat the anti-christ is one example. I just found, and I find this a lot with series, the resolution to be too convenient. On the whole, I enjoyed the series and would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in end-times fiction. It is an interesting \\"what if\\" kind of book."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"So here we are, the end of the Christ Clone Trilogy. Just to quickly recap the first two books:Book I - Was kind of disappointing, too much U.N. political rambling. Excellent premise, the actual cloning of Jesus Christ.Book II - I took a chance, and decided to read the second book, and I wasn't disappointed. This book was a wild ride describing the asteroids, locusts, and the plagues.Book III - The plagues are not over, and things are not what they seem. This book is full of violence and blood and gore, and I am not kidding here. The blood and gore are necessary to describe the level of death and carnage that was inflicted on the earth.Those of you out there that are not particularly religious, but like to read an excellent story, I believe you will not be disappointed with these books."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Read the first two books of the series just to get to this book. This final part of the trilogy brings everything together. References to the bible and other books make it all the much better."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This trilogy now ranks as one of my favorite series ever. I was awed by the premise of the first book \\"In His Image,\\" blown away by the pace of the second \\"Birth of an Age,\\" and absolutely floored by the payoff of the third \\"Acts of God.\\"James BeauSeigneur starts this book in the middle of the Anti-christ's deceptive maneuvers. Once again, we follow the false messiah's aide (and father-figure), Decker Hawthorne, as he works for the United Nations, helping bring promised peace and prosperity to the planet under the guise of the New Age.BeauSeigneur dives straight into the action in this final book of \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy.\\" He unravels the truth behind some of the characters' backgrounds, gives a rousing defense of Yeshua as Messiah, and then leads us straight into the terror of the plagues of Revelation. The biblical accuracy in this fictional setting is superlative. With passion and no-holds-barred writing, BeauSeigneur exposes us to horrors beyond what we might've imagined while thumbing clinically through the prophecies. He brings these ideas and truths home, slamming them into our heads after having tickled our ears. When we reach the climax, the moment of Decker Hawthorne's confrontation with his own son, the author tells the story with unsettling and stunning clarity. Even the cover photo will send chills down your spine after concluding this novel.This series, while entertaining me, renewed my interest in the end-time prophecies and my commitment to 'stand firm.' To bypass \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" is to miss out on a treat. To skip this final book is to miss the whole point. Simply put, you can't afford to avoid the \\"Acts of God.\\""},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Because of the translations involved, the Bible is often obscure to the average reader. With directed assistance, it makes much more sense. In this book, Mr. BeauSeigneur has created a vivid, detailed exposition of the events in Revelations that are prophesized to precede the second coming of Christ. Many readers will find their interest in Revelations rekindled from reading this novel.In this book, Christopher Goodman proclaims that the New Age of man is at hand. Man will move beyond needing God to become God's peer. With the aid of a blood communion, the rate of expansion in human powers rises at a fast pace. Just as progress seems the smoothest and most certain, disasters begin to occur all around the earth. Christopher denounces these as being psychic manifestations of those who are resisting the New Age, and vows to wipe out the people who encourage them. The war between the new and old beliefs quickly shapes up into a culminating battle between good and evil in the minds of both sets of people. What will happen? Who will prevail? What will life be like in the New Age? The suspense around these questions is nicely developed.Where the first two books in the trilogy display much moral and doctrinal ambiguity, this book is squarely in the Christian tradition. Mr. BeauSeigneur uses a fine knowledge of science to provide some fascinating insights into what the Scriptures mean.I thought that this book was by far the best of the three. One of the characters is nicely developed in this final book, while another one who could have been is not. I felt that missing the chance to give a more complete psychological perspective of Christopher Goodman was an important flaw in this novel. That area is explored, but not adequately for my taste.You should realize that the last days as described in Revelations are pretty horrendous, so much of this book reads like a Stephen King novel. If death, violence, and gore bother you, this book will be very upsetting. It takes humanity's potential inhumanity to humanity to new lengths.The action is particularly well developed in this book. I found it compelling, although I was able to resist the temptation to read into the night.I especially liked the plot devices that allowed the reader to understand the perspectives of both the New Age and the &quot;Old Age&quot; people.I have long been fascinated by Petra, and was glad that much of the story was centered there.I felt rewarded by the conclusion offered here. It was worth the trip through the three books to get the author's perspective on what the conflicting beliefs in modern society mean for a Christian. Mr. BeauSeigneur has clearly thought a lot about these questions, and created a thought-provoking series that will cause most to reexamine their behavior, and some their beliefs. Yet the result is &quot;non-preachy&quot; and will be accessible to those who are interested in knowing more about what the Bible tells us.After you finish this book, I suggest that you do use the many Biblical references here to direct you to parts of the Bible or Torah that you would now like to reexamine. With this fresh perspective, your understanding of the Scriptures should be much better.I also encourage you to see ways in which belief differences can be bridged, rather than become a source of intolerance."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"There are a lot of books out there, but I've never read any where the author has gone to such lengths to present a totally believable story. He blends science, history, politics, sociology, psychology, entimology, astronomy, military science(and lots of other stuff) with an incredible knowledge of world religins and the Bible to give us a story that will absolutely knock you off your chair. Either BeauSeigneur is one of the most knowledgeable people in the world or he really did his research."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Yes, I've finally read all three and I'm relieved. It was a test of fortitude to look past the filler introductory chapters, the poor dialogue, the tendencies to overexplain, the weak character development, and focus on the story itself, which was its usual addictive self. Great story. Each review I've written for each book says &quot;great story&quot;. I wondered why my reviews were so similar, then it occured to me that this trilogy should've been a single book. Cut out the filler, move the story along a little faster, and there's no time to focus on the weaker aspects. Yep, a good editor would've gotten this trilogy another star. I will admit to one shining moment: our protagonist's final encounter made me smile, as it is probably a dream encounter that many of us wish to occur. My advice, ultimately, is to buy them used or check them out at the library. They're not worth the frustration."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"After painstakingly getting through 11 Left Behind books, I picked up this series as it was recommended by other reviewers. All I can say Christ Clone Trilogy is everything that Left Behind is and more, plus it's handled in 3 novels.Told from a non-christian and unbiased perspective, this series really allows the reader to feel what these times may be like and how the world will be so easily deceived by the anti-christ. This is a must read for Christians and non-Christians who are interested in understnding Revelation and the last days."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Well, you knew the sleight-of-hand, the literary legerdemain, couldn't continue forever. The author kept us pretty much in suspense for more than two books. But it all comes to a screaching halt in book three. Finally, all the chips are on the table. Everything's out in the open. The cat's out of the bag.What we get instead of red herrings and blind alleys is powerful, straightforward storytelling of the first water. What we also get is a quite harrowing--yet entirely plausible--picture of the last days of Planet Earth as we know it. We also get some more Really Scarry speaches from you-know-who. When the mask is finally peeled away, we get a picture of a creature more nightmarish than Weston, the Unman from Perelandra--someone who makes Freddy Krueger look like St. Francis.But we get something even better--a picture of redemption that is truly moving.Did BeauSeigneur deliver the goods here in book three? You bet, and in spades. This is it. The real thing. You'll be sorry if you miss it.Well, this is my last communique from the front. I'm going to miss sending out these dispatches. Hope they were helpful."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I'm impressed. I was sure that I would never read a book about the end of the world as powerful as We All Fall Down, but Beauseugneur has done it. Perhaps it's the fact that Beauseigneur had more time in three novels, so the end result is more cumulative, whereas Caldwell only had one book, but whatever it is, these three novels form an amazing trilogy. Read these books. You will not be dissapointed"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"My husband and I both loved this book. We found ourselves putting everything else aside to finish the book. We could hardly wait to get books 2 &amp; 3. You'll get hooked too!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This is the first trilogy I ever read that each book could stand alone on it's own merits. Each book was great and really gives you a more realistic view of the end times than the Left Behind Series could even begin to.But if you're just a big sci-fi fan you won't be disappointed either. The author has done his homework, as well as has a resume that lends to insider knowledge only guessed at by most.I'm not much into sci-fi at all. My husband reads little else & yet we both were engrossed from the first chapter, first book onto the last page of this one. The only disappointment was there weren't any other books by this author. But you can bet when the movie is finally made we'll be front row & center. Even C.S. Lewis would be impressed."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"&quot;Acts of God&quot; is the longest book of the Christ Clone Trilogy. The final book of the series covers the last 3 1/2 years of the Tribulation period, but the bulk of the book focuses on the final months leading up to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The rendering of the &quot;bowl&quot; judgements are quite intense! I doubt most horror books can out perform Beauseigneur's graphic portrayal of the Wrath of God. As with the previous two novels, &quot;Acts of God&quot; delivers an intriguing plot, well-developed characters, and pain-staking research. One of the most fascinating aspects of this series is the portrayal of the Antichrist. You really like the guy up until the end of &quot;Acts of God.&quot; This book (as do the others in the trilogy) reads like a mystery, a techno-thriller, and a science fiction novel all rolled into one. I'd give it five stars except for the mild profanity. You'll probably want to think twice before using the Christ Clone Trilogy in a Bible study."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"James BeauSeigneur shows himself to be a master at keeping you on the edge of your seat! His plot twists keep you guessing, even if you're familiar with the prophetic end-times. Even though the Trilogy is a work of fiction, the scientific, medical, and political scholarship is extraordinary. BeauSeigneur has certainly done his homework! And while the technical detail in the book is incredible, it does nothing to bog down the story. In fact, it enhances the story all the more.The Christ Clone Trilogy never strays outside of what Scripture tells us, though it does take some very unexpected twists. While the trilogy may not follow the usual &quot;party line&quot; on all subjects, BeauSeigneur never, ever violates Scripture. In fact, he documents Scripture more than any other end-times writer I've read.This book is a must-read. If you haven't read it, you're missing out on one of the best reads of your life."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"While the left behind series is very good. The Acts of GOD trilogy is puts an awesome twist on the end of times, and how the antichrist came to be.This is a must have"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This last book in The Christ Clone Trilogy is, not surprisingly, built upon the foundation of error that was laid in the first two. I cannot emphasize enough that Mr BeauSeigneur lacks almost completely a true understanding of prophesied events and therefore must rely on his significant talents as an imaginative writer to incorporate the scriptures into this self-proclaimed work of fiction. Having said that I must admit I enjoyed the series because of its fast-paced and suspenseful nature but also because of some of his insights into the root necessity for the Tribulation and particularly his descriptions of the raw experience of some of the plagues, most notably his interpretation of the fifth vial plague. In Rev.16:10-11 it says:v.10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,v.11 And blasphemed YAHOWAH of Heaven because of their pains and sores, and repented not of their deeds.BeauSeigneur interprets this darkness comparable to the darkness that was one of the plagues of Egypt and I'm not sure if that is what it means but his description is so great it bears quoting. \\"Decker\\" is someone who has not repented to YAHOWAH but he hasn't taken the mark of the beast either and he wakes up to an inexplicable fear,\\"Drawn by the light, Decker rose from his bed to open the window. But as he looked out from his second-floor bedroom, the faceless terror that had awakened him took on a loathsome and ghastly form. Seeping upward out of the ground below his window and everywhere he could see, a hideous evil oozed like black puss, obscuring everything it covered. In only seconds it grew from simple puddling in the low-lying areas to a depth that obscured the ground completely. Decker's curiosity, normally one of his strongest drives, was utterly silenced by the stark panic that consumed him. He did not want to know what the darkness was; he did not need to know. He knew already. It was evil ---the sum total of all the evil that had been done upon the earth----every murder, every lie, every rape, every torture, every act of cannibalism, every beating of an innocent, every human sacrifice, every brutal mutilation of a child, every gulag, every pogrom, every death camp of every war, every slaughter of the blameless, every cruelty to a helpless animal, every destructive act upon the earth itself, All of it had been absorbed and held in by the earth until it could be held no longer, and now it gushed forth like nefarious vomit.\\"No wonder YAHOWAH says \\"the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now, and not only they but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope........\\" Romans 8:22-24The next few pages describe the unimaginable torment and terror which accompanies the blackness. Though no outside force attacks or threatens it is the very darkness itself that feeds the imagination to the point of paralysis. I saw a woman on TV once who had experienced a \\"near death\\" event where she had wound up in hell. She described the torturing demons, the unrelenting screams and the fear and darkness but she said nothing compared or could describe the absolute horror of the utter hopelessness. She said there was nothing that could torture the human soul more than an eternal and complete absence of hope. The darkness described in Exodus and here is one of complete absence of light and we know from YAHOWAH's Word that light is truth and that YAHO-Hoshu-WAH is the Way the Truth and the Light. He is our hope and salvation. Without Him we have no hope only darkness. BeauSeigneur continues:\\"When the darkness subsided after three days, its black murkiness seeping back into the earth just as it had arrived, Decker found himself lying on his bed unharmed. Dried feces lay smeared on the bed around him and caked on his hips and back. The room stank from the feces, urine, and sweat, but having been in the room with it for so long, he did not smell it.There was no thought of getting up to wash. Now that he no longer feared to move, he did not have the strength to do so. His jaws and teeth and head ached so badly from three days and nights of clenching and grinding that he was not certain he would survive the pain. Gently he moved his tongue along the inside of his cheeks trying to assess the damage. Loose flaps of flesh and deep ulcers revealed the pieces he had unknowingly bitten off in his torment. His tongue, too, was badly gnawed, and he could only assume the missing bits of flesh lay scattered around him on the bed or had been swallowed, washed down by the warm blood that still seeped from the wounds.\\"Powerful stuff.If you are looking for a biblically accurate and historically verified version of the true story of the cloning of the Messiah please email me at b.jeanpearce@shaw.ca"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Reading the Christ Clone Trilogy was a very emotional experience. I did not realize how much so until months later. Illusions were shattered. Although I enjoyed it, I did not recognize how angry it made me. I felt duped and regretably took it out on Mr. BeauSeigneur. He actually did such a magnifigent job that I didn't recognize it at the time. If hindsight were 20/20, we'd never make the same mistakes twice! My apologies."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This is not a bad series, but I think perhaps I was going into it expecting too much. The reviews here have been so strong and so overwhelmingly positive that I was expecting a masterpiece. I didn't get it. The only two End Times novels I've ever read before this was Left Behind and We All Fall Down. This is certainly better than Left Behind (To be fair, I've only read the first one)but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of We all Fall Down. I baught all three books at one time and wished that I hadn't. This is a facinating premise, but that's all. There's no real exploration of Christian life and I certainly don't feel like I have a better understanding of my faith. This certainly didn't illuminate me or help me in that area. The characters are also fairly unengaging. Again, this is quite a bit better than Left Behind, but that's not really saying much. Perhaps if you read it with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"By condensing the trials of the Tribulation into just a couple of books, it has a lot more impact. This set of books is a nice illustration of the book of Revelation without becoming tedious.In this last book, we finally see Christopher as the bad guy, and it's amazing just how bad he is. I could not believe what happened to Decker, our protagonist from the beginning. Wow! It's nice to see everyone reunited at the end after Jesus come to the rescue.Again, if you've read the book of Revelation these books shouldn't exactly surprise you, but it's always interesting to see the different spin different authors put on it."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This entire series is great. For me, the detailed approach to explaining prophecy made it all so believable. The plot is fast-paced and enthralling, and the writing style is smooth and pleasing to read.

It will staisfy your fantasy that there is a god. If your just plain into a good story with fascinating characters, intriguing plot and dramatic endings you love this trilogy also. If you fancy yourself at all intellectual this may seem a little &quot;da&quot; to you as it is very easy to guess the next chapter. In that case may I highly recommend Glenn Krier's book &quot;The Last Day&quot; which will keep you guessing where it is going.

The story brings our own recent history into play and helps to envision one way the Tribulation may play out.The footnotes are a great source for biblical references and the author's explanations for certain story points. The author has put a great deal of research into these books and explains it all along the way. Don't let the title turn you away as I almost did.

I have to admit the trilogy made for an interesting read, but I found myself skimming a lot of pages without actually reading them. The author puts so much background info, that I get bored with it. Maybe I went into these books looking for the entertainment value, so the &quot;information overload&quot; seemed too extensive and unnecessary to the story line.Don't expect these series to have any similarity to the Left Behind series, other than the biblical research.

Unfortunately he is killed by the Christ Clone about 2/3 of the way through the book only to be brought back in the last chapter. Another powerful attraction of this story is the subtly of the Christ Clone himself; a subtly that is shatter right before he kills Hawthorne, again, weakening the overall impact of the novels in my opinion. Regardless the details of the plagues and struggle at the end of days are well-written and intense. As with most of these ventures into the End Times there seems to be a warning about combining religion and politics yet I wonder if those who write these can see the danger that some Christians today who wish to combine the two are risking? Are those who want to install their religions into politics playing into Satan's hands?"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"We've seen all this done many times before and far, far better. The writing is terribly amateurish and adolescent -- like an angst-filled teenager trying to wax intelligent.

If you're into Hanger 51 and Roswell, you'll just love the ridiculous ending. A waste of good trees."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The first two books of the triology were extremely well writen and did not give away the end in advance. They had one thinking that some good might come from the new age. Acts of god gave away the end too soon, shortly after the middle one could know that it was hopeless for the Antichrist and his followers.One other thing, while it would seem that the author himself believes what is writen in the bible. The end in Acts of God highly suggest an exclusive view as to who would go to heaven."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I am so impressed with the Christ Clone Trilogy. The characters and events in this books will stay with me for a lifetime. Never have I felt that I was more a part of the action.

The situation was complex enough. Instead, I got another great part of the story, it kept the pace (page turner) and wrapped everything up wonderfully.Do not start reading the trilogy with this book. This is a Lord of the Rings kind of trilogy: books have to be read in order to make sense.I am thinking about reading the book of Revelation now to see where the author got the inspiration from. The characterization was good from start to finish, and it was not clear who was lying and who was not until the very end.A great trilogy."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Granted that's not hard to do, but this truly is a spiritual thriller with seemingly outlanding interpretations of Bible prophecy that BeauSeigneur makes convincing with his writing style (a truly novel view of the Rapture that's really chilling). Also, the POV upsets the usual good guy/bad guy stereotypes that mar most End-Times novels."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The entire CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is very well written. I simply couldnt put them down. I suggest you read this series with a highlighter nearby so you can mark things and research them for yourself. This is made easier by BeauSeigneur's use of footnotes.The Christ Clone Trilogy will surprise you with nearly every page. I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants to understand biblical prophecy and the book of Revelation. BUY THESE BOOKS, READ THEM, GIVE THEM TO YOUR PASTOR TO READ, AND BUY COPIES FOR YOUR FAMILY!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"After reading the first two books of this trilogy, I wondered whether BeauSeigneur was going to be able to keep the pace and keep me interested through to the last. Much of what intrigued me in the earlier books was the ambiguity over good and evil and where the characters fell across the divide. Given that he is dealing with the Apocalypse, BeauSeigneur was going to have to reveal who was who pretty soon, and then where was he going to go to keep me interested? Where he goes is to the heart of questions of faith and redemption as his characters struggle to reconcile their hearts and minds with the events through which they are living. Love, loyalty, betrayal, hope, doubt, faith, fear...emotions run high as the characters endure BeauSeigneur's truly original vision of the torments preceding the End. As a theological statement, BeauSeigneur stays true to his convictions and presents his case clearly and without apology. But this is not a religious tract thinly camouflaged in a story. BeauSeigneur has written a thriller that stands on its own with intriguing characters facing difficult choices. I could certainly list a few criticisms or argue some points, but BeauSeigneur has written such a page-turner with a serious message that it would be petty to nitpick. Regardless of whether you agree with its message (and perhaps even more so if you don't necessarily agree), at a minimum, this trilogy is fun to read, interesting for its science and biblical scholarship, and worthwhile in its statement of religious belief."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I thought that the Christ Clone trilogy was incredible. I could not put it down. I am not a Christian, but found the books to be riveting fiction, and far superior to the Left Behind series. If you are contemplating reading the Left Behind series, I urge you to read the Christ Clone trilogy instead!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Talk about a book that you will have set aside 14.87 hours to read uninterrupted for. This is it. Once you pick this book up, you will not put it down.You have to read the first 2 books of the Trilogy, In His Image and Birth of an Age, to understand what is going on at all.The author has set up the Christ Clone trilogy with the age-old question, \\"Who is the Monster and Who is the Man?\\" Is Christopher Goodman the Beast of Revelation, or is he is the Savior/Leader who is going to usher in the New Age of Mankind?My friends and I have read all of them: the Left Behind dodecology, The Age of the Antichrist, the Frank Peretti series, and Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down.This Christ Clone series and this book, Acts of God, are the best of the bunch.Aside from some differences in theology; and the reader must remember that this is fiction, even though much is drawn from the Bible, the structure of the story is sound.There are no stupid plot lines, a/k/a the main protagonist in Left Behind spends over a year piloting the AntiChrist around, but the AntiChrist can't figure out the protagonist is a Christian.There are no strange plot lines as in We All Fall Down, a/k/a when the protagonist escapes from jail when a Revelation-like earthquake strikes the United States.This story is taut and even, and believable. There is no rampant cursing, no vivid description of the vices of a decaying civilization, and no senseless description of violence. That is left to imagination.Plus, the story has a happy ending."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This is the best book I have read to date, anyone who is contemplating buying this book...BUY IT...it will have you at the edge of your seat to the very end. I stayed up all night reading the entire book."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I truly loved the story telling of the author, the book arrived on time and at a great price!

I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Christian-SciFi and would recommend Amazon to anyone looking for a safe place online to make purchases.. Thank You!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The final book of the series is very disappointing. I thought that there would be an interesting turn of events but in the end the story was just ordinary. On reflection, I should have stopped at the first book."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I just love this triology and I feel this book ended the series well. Definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys Christian end times fiction!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I happened upon the Christ-Clone trilogy by accident- I was searching for another Christian fiction series. After reading an excerpt of the basic premise, I knew I had to give it a try. This series is unbelievably well written, mixing an exhaustive knowledge of history, politics, and Biblical prophecy with an edge-of-your-seat thrilling plot. This trilogy is what the Left Behind series should have been- there are no frivolous sub-plots that bog down the pace. In describing the writing style, many people have commented that these books sound like a Christian Da Vinci Code, but this trilogy is better! I've told everyone I know to check these books out and now I hope this review convinces you to as well. Be sure to begin with the first book of the series, In His Image and then also read Birth of an Age, which is the second book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"This is book three of the Christ Clone Trilogy. The books are amazing. Really make you think about the world around you. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"WARNING: The chances of you enjoying ACTS OF GOD without previously having read the first two novels of the Christ Clone Trilogy is lessened greatly.The author's finale is grand picking up the action where he left off in IN HIS IMAGE, the second entry in series. Christopher is busy as the Secretary General of the UN preparing a de-populated humanity for the New Age. Decker Hawthorne his left hand man (and ironically posible betrayer) gets kidnapped again this time by the KDP and fundamentalists just before he can receive the communion. (The communion is taken to expand human's lifespans and decrease disease and all who have partaken of this treatment bear a mark as predicted in Revelations.) Doubts begin to stir in Decker Hawthorne's mind as he is treated well by his \\"captors\\" and has debates over religion with them.This last title is full of action. Many things happen heralding the dawn of a New Age, and the Apocolypse. de Beauseigneur narrates in the same style sa his other novels as an objective observer stating the action as signs permeate the story. He also very clearly reinforces his warnings written prefacing each title by ending his dark, mysterious trilogy in a very Christian manner. Disposed are some of the controversial ideas espoused in earlier titles. He does not preach to the reader yet very clearly states that his characters reflect his own religious beliefs and seems to use his novelization as a platform to critique where society is heading, (away from faith in powers greater than themselves.) So on this score I would pat him on the back and call him successful.My quibbles are similiar to the first two volumes. While the story telling is overall exciting, there are moments when I felt a less detached narration may have been useful. One of his footnotes was wrong, and almost made me put off reading this thrilling conclusion indefinitely. Luckily for me I lay to rest the miffed reference and enjoyed the action reach its stunning and worthy finale."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I struggled reading this series, expecting it to come alive sooner or later, given all the great things said here about it. To my lasting disappointment, it never did. These are merely so-so books. The writing drags, as does the story. I cannot recommend this, and advise you to save your money. As with anything, let the buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"After an interesting set-up in the first two books in the series, this last entry was tremendously disapppointing. I can't imagine anyone who is not a (devout, born-again and/or fundamentalist) Christian liking it very much. It is nothing more nor less than a recap of the book of Revelations from the New Testament, decorated with some modern special-effects type descriptions of the various plagues and disasters that are prophesied to accompany the end times.The writing is, as in the first two books, serviceable, but nothing more. Still, that's not so bad. But the first two books promised (or at least implied) so much. There was the potential for a real story there. But it was not to be. Probably I should have been warned by the silly disclaimer by the author at the beginning of the first two books, but I foolishly ignored it and read on.*****SPOILERS AHEAD******That Christopher will turn out to be the Antichrist is not much of a shock. But how that relates to the rest of the set-up is simply ignored. How does the clone of Christ turn into the son of Satan? Where was Jesus in all this? What about the alien theory? Who is Robert Milner and why is he so powerful? Was John really the biblical John? Where's he been and what's he been doing for the last 2000 years? How and why does that work? And so on. There was no logic, no story, no novel ideas, just a hackneyed re-telling of Revelations.The sections where one of the believers tries to convince Decker of the evil nature of Christopher and his new age paint a very simplistic and distorted picture of the early Christian religion and the relationship of Christianity and Judaism, and sound more like the espousings of a door-to-door proselytizer than of an authentic Jewish or Christian religious scholar.From the average score of the other reviewers, I conclude that most of the people who reviewed this were practicing Christians. Perhaps for them this book was viewed as Church-approved fiction and fulfilled a particular literary niche. But for your average reader of SF or fantasy, this was trite, predictable, boring and very disappointing."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"The first two books were great and so was this one. That is up until the end. Worst possible ending. I was so dissapointed that I almost threw the book away, but I didn't think my trash can could hold that much garbage... ergh!"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"Book three of the trilogy was about as good as the preceding books. I found it long on Biblical verse myself. If you enjoyed the first 2 you'll enjoy this. If you were losing interest after the 2nd book, you won't find the 3rd volume to be more enthralling. At one point I thought the author was putting a very unique spin on traditional religious thinking and I wanted to finish the series, but that turned out to not be the case,and I must admit I skimmed a few pages to get through it."},{"Title":"Living and Working in America: A Survival Handbook (Living & Working in America)","review":"Previous to my move to Spain I bought David Hampshire's &quot;Living and Working in Spain&quot; and found it to be an invaluable aid and an excellent source of information. I'm contemplating a move to the US and so was very pleased and interested to see that David Hampshire has published a similar book for America. I wasn't disappointed with the book and again found it packed with useful information, and important time and money saving tips. this edition looks as if it too will prove invaluable to me as I find my way around America and the Americans. At least with &quot;Living and Working in America&quot; I've had all my questions answered so far and I feel I'm as prepared as I ever will be!"},{"Title":"Living and Working in America: A Survival Handbook (Living & Working in America)","review":"I've read all the books on living and working in the States and this is probably the best book there is! The amount of information it contains is staggering - not only is there information on all the essential stuff - like visas and finding a job etc. - but everything else you might need to know, such as shopping, driving, finding a school for the kids, banking - even what to do in your time off. If you need to know anything about the US you will find it in this book. The book is also very truthful - telling you good as well as bad - and also very amusing in places, which might not suit everybody. Generally though I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Living and Working in America: A Survival Handbook (Living & Working in America)","review":"When David Hampshire wrote his first book &quot;Living and Working in Switzerland&quot;, he had some very good practical information for foreigners new to the country. There were a lot of prejudices and distorted views (most Swiss are rich, the country is sort of made of chocolate, banks and cheese, etc.), but there were so many practical information not easily found elsewhere in the country. With this new title the good practical information is now almost completely lost among his prejudices and negative views of America. The book will certainly almost scare the naive reader. The data is not always accurate and he seemed to have ignored the current economic boom in America (albeit his updated version). Worse, he seems to be totally ignorant of many aspects of life and work in America and of the American society itself. He has now also written books about buying homes in some southern European countries and about living and working in Australia and Britain (Canada was skipped...). Hopefully the good things of his Switzerland book will prevail somewhere in his writing, while the others will eventually disappear. Yet this one book on America shows quite the opposite. It should have instead been titled &quot;What every patriotic and single-minded British person thinks of America, the ex-colony.&quot;"},{"Title":"Living and Working in America: A Survival Handbook (Living & Working in America)","review":"A really useful, practical guide giving realistic and balanced views of what to expect from the States.Invaluable for those with no previous knowledge on which to base important decisions."},{"Title":"Living and Working in America: A Survival Handbook (Living & Working in America)","review":"This book does have some bits of good information (usually these are practical information like &quot;How to...&quot;) contained in it. However when you reach the sections on American culture it is very easy to find out biases creeping out of the book. These comments are written from a largely British or Commonwealth perspective (which is not surprising since Mr Hampshire himself is British). In the assessment about the American electoral system Mr Hampshire thinks the (continental) European proportional representative system is superior to &quot;Winners take all&quot; system that America uses. Ironically in his home country the Parliament (forget the Scottish and Welsh assemblies) is elected using the &quot;First past the post&quot; system - which is identical to the American electoral system.The bottom line is: provided you are from New Zealand, Australia or Britain have a look at this book. If you are from countries with minimal British cultural heritage such as Russia, Germany, Indonesia or Taiwan, forget it. Many books about practical tips to live in America has been published in many EFL and ESL (English as a Foreign/Secondary Language) countries (using English or their own languages) without this type of naked biases. And secondly you won't have to figure out what cricket is before you understand life in America!"},{"Title":"Human Resources Kit for Dummies","review":"I'm surprised by the poor reviews this book has received.

With the growing social and economic crisis in the world, with the need for anti-imperialist struggle in the Mid East, Korea, and Venezuela, Che's ideas are needed today as much or even more than when he lived.

She is devoted to her writing and does catering parties to help make ends meet - it is at a party she and her friend Dee Dee are working where she meets Sam, a great dream guy and picks up her first &quot;case&quot;.As I said, the plot intricacies might leave a bit to be desired for those looking for a hard core mystery but for me this was a fun read. I like Jennifer, her wonderful dog Muffy and her unborn (and unconceived ) child Jaimie (could be a girl or a boy).As whole - this was a great premise and a fun book."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"The first in a planned series of six novels (now close to completion at five published), Dying to Get Published, is Judy's Fitzwater's spellbinding debut book. Jennifer Marsh is a struggling writer, doing everything she can to get her murder mysteries published... and she means -everything-, right down to planning a real murder to help her write her fictional ones.Everything goes sour, though, when Jennifer's intended victim turns up dead, and she's left cheated out of her crime! But not exactly... since guess who appears to be the perfect suspect? You guessed it.The most notable aspect of Fitzwater's writing is her incredible ability to make her characters -real- and extremely identifiable. Whether you want to shake them, hold their hands, or stop them on the street, the constructs of Fitzwater's mind are an amusing bunch-- one you're not likely to forget in the near future.If you're a mystery fan looking for a quirky, fun read, try Judy Fitzwater. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"I personally found the book to be one of the best I've ever read. It's fast-paced, amusing, well-written, and has lovely characters and dialogue. Jennifer Marsh is a great character that I relate to and who makes me laugh. She's perfect to carry a series. I've recommended DYING TO GET PUBLISHED and its successors to everyone I know. I enjoyed them all immensely. If you're looking for a great mystery and a charming novel, you should definitely find a copy of DYING TO GET PUBLISHED. Judy Fitzwater has created clever, interesting plots and a wonderfully entertaining cast of characters. Her manner of writing is crisp, clear, and the woman can certainly turn a phrase. This book gets my highest praise as will all of Fitzwater's future books, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"This was a very readable debut mystery novel. I like the fact that Jennifer Marsh was an *unpublished* author, rather than the typical successful author pursuing mysteries in his/her spare time. It was also nice to see the workings of a reading group. So often authors thank their reading groups on their dedication pages, and I always wondered exactly what the group did for them. Now I know.The plot seemed a little silly at the start, what with Jennifer setting herself up as a murderess in order to gain publicity. It seemed to me that she had to be on the verge of madness to let things go as far as it did, and I found that to be unsettling. Who sends out threatening letters on their own letterhead? She is supposed to be knowledgeable about crime but doesn't know about current stalking and harassment laws? Perhaps it was supposed to be funny, but it didn't make sense character-wise, especially since the opening pages mentioned that she was a &quot;good Baptist girl&quot;. That's really my only quibble with the book but it was a big one, dropping the rating from four to three stars.Contrary to the other reviewers' opinions, I found Jennifer's mental conversations with her unfertilized egg, which she named Jaimie (being a non-gender-specific name) really funny, especially when she felt that Jaimie was putting pressure on her to hurry up and choose it a daddy. All of the secondary characters were nicely drawn, each with a distinctive character, and her potential love interest was suitably gorgeous. I'll definitely continue reading this series."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Many aspiring writers will do the most inane things just to see their manuscript published. For instance, Jen Marsh has a closet filled with her eight rejected novels and a draw loaded with rejection letters that could wallpaper her home.A television talk show sparks an idea in Jen's mind on how to come to the attention of the publishing world. Jen decides to set herself up as the person who killed infamous agent Penny Richmond. She figures on obtaining several weeks of high profile media coverage before her innocence is pronounced. This will surely be the impetus towards having her eight murder mysteries published. Her plan works too perfect as she is arrested on suspicion of murder. Now, she has to find the real culprit before she spends the rest of her life writing novels from behind bars.Anyone who is considering authoring a book should read DYING TO GET PUBLISHED, which is a humorous primer on the tricks, tribulations, and traumas confronting an aspirin! g writer. This insider's view of publishing is fascinating yet frightening even as it serves as the basis for making Judy Fitzwater's debut novel a success. The characters seem genuine almost as if Ms. Fitzwater has a want other work from this talented newcomer.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"The author takes an old plot line and extends it beyond credibility. Her plot lacks any semblance of problem solving technique. There is no logical progression from crime to criminal. The book hardly qualifies as an organized entity. That said, I have to add, that I enjoyed it. The enjoyment rests on her handling of the heroine, an unpublished novelist, and her primary interactions in the book: with the man on the scene, her novelist support group, and her newly made patron, an elderly matron.In the end, what mattered was the congenial nature of the writing and characters; for me this overcame the fragility of the plot. Understandably, others will have quite legitimate negative responses. It is for the reader to choose what is most important."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Jennifer Marsh is a part-time caterer and a mystery writer. Or at least she wants to be a mystery writer, but just can't seem to get published.After eight rejected manuscripts, Jennifer is getting desperate and angry. Especially with agent Penney Richmond who after receiving Jennifer's latest, took a year to reject it.Jennifer decides she will plan the perfect murder, which should help her writing. And Penney's going to be the victim.When Penney winds up dead, Jennifer wonders if she maybe carried things a little too far.Highlights:Jennifer's relationship with Sam Culpepper, a reporter. She can't decide if she does or doesn't want a relationship with him.Her writer's group. This group of women write a variety of different genre's and are very funny.It's an interesting premise. Trying to see if you were a murderer, could you get into a secure apartment building, could you pick a lock, etc.Jennifer's conversations with Jaime, her not yet conceived but hoped for future baby.Lowlights:Jennifer is kind of stupid. Three stupid things she does:1. Writes threatening letters to Penney - background for the book.2. Takes a real gun with her when she goes to Penney's apartment, the night she's going through the make-believe murder. Penney is, of course, murdered that night.3. Giving anyone sleeping pills in wine to knock them out, to give you an alibi.She's lucky she didn't go to jail.Jolene Arizona, the lead character in her new book. She's a left-handed, blind-in-one-eye, bareback-riding circus performer turned Hollywood detective and who sleeps with EVERY client.And Jennifer wonders why she's not published.Not a great start, but an easy, quick read, and good enough to go onto the second book, Dying to Get Even."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Deeply rooted in its surroundings, this novel is full of the flavor of the south and southern personality and charm.

I admire Jennifer's perseverence, with all of her unpublished novels on a shelf in her closet... And her poor unborn child... actually, yet to be conceived unborn child... at least she had goals!

I was surprised by the ending. I'll be reading her books in the future."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Any struggling writer can understand the thinking behind Jennifer Marsh' s 'plan' to get her mystery novels published. They go unnoticed in the world because of bad apple literary agents like Penny Richmond. So, she sets herself up for the murder of the wicked literary witch, knowing that she will be exonerated in the end. Or will she? It seems that someone else wanted Penny badly also; from there begins a hilarious string of events that lead us through her 'investigation' for the truth.The story was well written and the characters were believable. Some of the situations were 'out there', but it only added to the humor and fun of the story.Definitely a recommended read."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"This is the most fun I have had reading a mystery in a long time!

The book is professionally written, which I am sure most of you are trying to ascertain by reading these reviews. The characters are interesting and you really feel like you are hitching a ride with the main characters brain. Sure, its not some massive literary achievement, but it's a free book and I think you owe it to yourself to read it.As an aspiring writer myself, I think this book really tapped into the psyche of someone trying to get that all important publishing credit.

Some of the technical details about the publishing business might have been unduly complex, but, overall, this was a well-crafted book."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Although it begins shakily, by the end I really enjoyed the story. The characters are fun. The plot seems predictable at first, but it has a nice little twist you won't see coming."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Gosh, what can I say? This book in my opinion was not a good read. I went thru the first couple chapters, trying to get into the story, but it was just too ridiculous, corny, and plain old not interesting. I found the storyline just really ridiculous. Honestly? Really? I couldn't get interested, so I deleted the book from my Kindle, since it was free. Thank God I did not pay for it. I don't want to be mean. I wouldn't say that I wouldn't read anything else by this author, I would just say that this particular book wasnt worth my spare time to read it."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"I am always on the lookout for books and movies on the publishing world in general so was quite delighted to see a new series on the matter.Equally disappointed in the content of this first one in the series, I am going to keep looking.Although the story is based on a really good idea (heroine plots a murder, someone else carries it out and she gets arrested for it without an alibi), the characters are underdeveloped, the story drags on like really bland chewing gum and the eBook version of the book is peppered with mistakes, typos, bad typesetting.The most disappointing to me was that I could not even chuckle once and had to constantly flip back a few pages wondering \\"who said what when\\"."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"This book was free and worth every penny it cost. There was no way I could relate to Jennifer. Neurotic really does not begin to describe her. I am not sure there is a proper term to describe her weird personality disorder.I found one passage in the book that actually amused me and made me laugh, but it didn't make enough of an impression for me to remember it. Most of the book was just silly, as opposed to humorous. A mystery, nah.Unless you are really bored and don't have anything else to read, don't waste your time.David F.

I was disappointed. This book was no where near as funny or interesting as Ms. Evanovich's. I had to struggle to finish it. While it was a good attempt, I thought it just wasn't interesting enough and the characters weren't fully developed. And as some reviewers have stated, the constant mentioning of Jaimie was not funny. I guess if you're bored with no other new books to read, this is an okay book to read, but don't start reading it with too many high expectations because you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"This is clever and funny and based on a brilliantly original idea.

It's hard to put down; you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"The first half of the book is slow in reaching a point where the plot starts to make sense. I find the main characters obsession with her unconceived fetus distracting, tasteless and unnesessary. The portion of the book where it is tied into the story (ackwardly) could have been reworked so that the amusing qualities wouldn't seem quite so forced. HOWEVER, the last half of the book almost makes up for the stilted beginning. The murderer came as an almost complete surprise (I guessed though, the clues were a little obvious).

Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"The only trouble with the Jennifer Marsh series is that the author can't write the books fast enough to keep me satisfied.

I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the others in the series."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"An interesting opening which initially shocks but makes you want to read more to discover the writer's motives for such a bold beginning."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"This is one of just a few books that I could not bear to finish reading. I appreciate that this was a debut effort from the author about 14 years ago and I'd be willing to try another of the author's efforts but this was so achingly hard to read that I had to delete it from my Kindle, unfinished.I have been downloading quite a few of what I call \\"quick and dirty\\" murder mystery/police procedurals. I don't have much in the way of expectations. Engaging main character, unusual element to keep my interest, a not too obvious ending. And they have to be cheap (free is best).I purchased this ebook for $0.00 and got my money's worth.I couldn't help reading my \\"heroine\\" as some schlumpy social misfit, even though I'm pretty sure she's not portrayed that way intentionally. She is a failed novelist (I'm sure she's not based on the author at all) and has a support group comprised of other writers (I'm sure they're not based on the supportive people who left glowing PR-type reviews here). The catalyst for planning our murder is an Oprah-type book of the month segment on TV, in which a woman, who did not kill someone, explains that she was charged with, and then exonerated of, a murder. The guest wrote a book about her ordeal. She presents her new best selling book. Our delusional main character decides to actually murder someone so she can be found innocent at trial. (?) She then plans to write a book about the trial that will be irresistible to publishers and agents. And hopefully bring her what she feels is well deserved fame and success. Insert plot hole too large for suspension of disbelief.I thought I had missed some pages when the plot lurched forward suddenly a few times. I kept flipping back and forth until I was convinced that the development of the character relationships and the evolution of the murder/investigation was published as the author intended.The main character is simultaneously planning a murder AND becoming involved in a different murder investigation within the first few chapters. A local television news personality hits on our negative Nellie while she works a party as a server. He asks her to a dinner (during which she mentally compares the cut veggie tray from the party to the fine dining experience... the snacks win?)and he invites her to help him investigate a high profile murder. For no apparent reason.I didn't find any of it funny, as I see some of the reviewers are claiming it is. I believe I have an adequate sense of humor, so maybe that came later. I sure wouldn't pay for a copy. I guess every author starts somewhere. I would recommend starting with an editor."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"The fetus angle was silly and overdone. The fact that the mystery writer practically steps on someone near the scene of the crime who was outrageously attired and doesn't make the connection later was irritating. The humor was pretty good as was the way the author moved the story along (at least towards the end of the book). I found it unreal that an attractive woman like the protagonist seemed to view dating with the jitters of a woman who had just ended a 20-year marriage. Geez, she was only twenty-nine years old, surely she'd gone out a few times since high school!"},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"An enjoyable, fun mystery. Finally, no cops or PI's, no dames, not even a trench coat. &quot;Dying To Get Published&quot; is a satisfying read that would be great for a long plane ride or a day at the beach. I particularly liked the way the book tapped into Jennifer's dark side. I mean who hasn't thought about sending threatening letters or killing someone? (Oh, like YOU haven't!) This was my first Judy Fitzwater novel, but I plan to read them all."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Follow a crazy wannabe novelist as she spins a story that lands her in a heap of trouble. Fun, flirty, and full of laughs, Dying to Get Published will hold your attention and leave you ready for the next book in the series.Note: I found this in the Christian section ... However, I would not classify it as such in the traditional sense of the Chrisian romance genre because there is occasional language and a few situations that are more than PG (no sex actually happens, but some steamy scenes are described, almost for laughs)."},{"Title":"Dying To Get Published","review":"Light reading.

Certainly Chomsky himself has more recently both complicated what he wrote here (his emphasis on government and binding theory, which are covered in the book of the same name and also available here), and also simplified. I think that the overcomplication argument is actually invalid, whether or not Chomsky supports this criticism himself, unless one implies that universal grammar can somehow be delineated more simply than a full grammar of any current language (the latest on English is incomplete and still run to over 1,000 pages).I read this as an undergraduate and was absolutely spellbound - his clear division of linguistic structural categories (phonemes, morphemes, words, syntactic categories, phrase structure and, most radically transformations). He was the first person to describe how linguistic competence is generated by a series of transformations; &quot;We take a grammar to be a sequence of statement of the form: - Xi-Yi (i=1,...,N): - interpreted as the instruction &quot;rewrite Xi as Yi&quot;, where Xi and Yi are strings&quot;. Actually, the rest is reiteration and amplification - how simple can you get? (Except for those people for whom even this is too &quot;mathematical&quot; - but there is no hope for these.)The first three chapters remain essential reading - and remember that this was presented as his thesis and was initially rejected simply because there was no-one competent enough to review it! Imagine rewriting linguistics in your thesis!It seems a shame that he is probably now better known for his political writings, cogent and urgent as these are. If you are looking for a rigorous, complex, blazingly original rewriting of grammar, of language, of the idea of linguistic generation, and a precursor for all his later ideas on linguistic acquisition devices and universal grammars, from the man who rewrites linguistics with every publication and, like Wittgenstein before him, forces others in the field to rethink their whole paradigms regularly...(like Wittgenstein before him) - Chomsky's your man. Read the first three chapters, even if (especially if!) you aren't a linguist - I'm not, and it changed the way I think. (Can you tell I'm a fan?) I haven't nearly done it justice, but I couldn't believe there had been no reviews of this."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Great book, but if Mr. Scott would have listed the progressions in a I-IV-V type format then trying to force everything to E it would have been better. You have to take the root of e and &quot;transpose&quot; out of e if the song was written in another key. If you would call out the chords in number format relation to the KEY THEY ARE WRITTEN IN, not just E and having to work around to find relationships, it could be easier for novices. Tons of info and great effort, but needs to be a bit more elementary for the general populous. Then you may see great sales. I feel this is a good book and I am a very well-schooled musician/teacher educated enough to see what he is trying to say, and it IS perfectly logical, but a highschool wanna be would not buy this book if he saw it first. I would have loved to have been able to reccommend this to my students.Sorry, but not user friendly enough..."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Wish I looked inside this book before buying it. This book is just a giant unorganized list of chord progressions. I'm sure it's a valuable tool to someone but certainly not to me. I think the book \\"Chord Progressions For Songwriters (Paperback)\\" would be a better choice. I am a bit weary now of ordering a second book from this author.It is sloppy, poorly structured and quite frankly a waste of paper. The text in this book is in need of cosmetic surgery. Wish I spent my money on something else instead of contributing it to the negative impact this 450 pages must have had on the environment.Blasphemous."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"This book is more about listing pages and pages of title songs and the years they were published than anything else. I believe you can get more instructive info on chord progressions from other books."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Just got my copy. Wish I had taken a look at the book before I bought it. Sure, it's a hefty 450 pages but once you scan through the book you come away with the same thought you do as a guitarist thumbing through a book promising 20000 guitar chords (realizing that there are, at most, 20 different chord forms that are mechanically and unnecessarily incarnated in every key): What's the point?Here, the author does a similar thing by presenting all of the progressions with respect to specific keys (E for _half_ of the book and then a retelling of a subset of those progressions in the other keys). What's the point? It would have been MUCH more useful -- and, frankly, obvious -- to present each chord progression in the key-independent numeric form (e.g., \\"I-ii-V-I\\"). The publisher would have killed 50% less trees going that route and would have produced a book with immediate and lasting value.And if not purely that approach, the author could have at least accompanied each progression with the key-independent equivalent. That's a no-brainer. And given that each page is 80% white-space it's not like the publisher was scrambling for content space!Had I known that I could have charged [for] a book for reading off and reprinting the exact verse and chorus chord progressions from a bunch of different songs (granted, hundreds) I would have gone to the library and done so myself.I had very high hopes for this book but it falls way short of what a songwriter/composer REALLY needs--of what I need. I wanted a book that facilitates spontenaity and fuels the creative spark. That's what the book promised, but not what I received.Despite the sheer volume, it's a lazy effort. The book lacks the level of exposition, analysis, and insights that 450 pages would seem to indicate. And, content aside, the book's design, presentation, typography, and organization are EXTREMELY poor (I'll go so far as to say stark, ugly, sophomoric, and unusable as well considering the powerful desktop publishing tools available to anybody with a computer; one would think by this book that Writers Club Press only has a single manual typerwriter at its disposal). Bottomline is these deficits successfully short-circuit the promised usefulness of this book. The book is a disappointing effort and I cannot recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Money Chords is the book to turn to when the other Songwriting Books tell you to study the chord structures of the best songs. Money Chords is the first comprehensive popular chord progression dictionary that I have come across and it is sure to become an essential companion to a Rhyming Dictionary and Lyric Book in every songwriter's library.Money Chords introduces the 80 most popular chord progressions (plus all common variations) and the 12 tools used to create them without resorting to confusing and complicated discussions of music theory.The book includes thousands of examples which are arranged in a manner that allows you to identify progressions common to a specific time period and the evolution of various progression types. It also allows the reader to study and compare how the best songwriters and performers have used the same or similar progressions to create different hit songs.Money Chords is the real deal and gets my Five Star rating."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Say you're working on a new song or arranging an old one that uses a Basic I-IV (E-A) progression and you want to see how the best songwriters have used and dressed up this progression, the \\"Money Chords\\" book is your place to find out. There are at least forty examples of chord embellishments including E-A6; E-Amaj7; E-A11; Emaj7-Amaj7; Emaj7-A13; etc. The book shows you variations on the most popular progressions including the Folk (I-V7); Rock (I-IV-V7); Rock Ballad (I-VIm-IV-V7); Standard (I-VIm-IIm-V7); Ragtime (I-VI7-II7-V7); Classic Rock (I-bVII-IV); Blues progressions as well as Ascending, Descending and Static (Pedal Point) progressions. This book should help you create more interesting chord progressions for your new songs but also breath new life into other songs as well. I rate \\"Money Chords\\" a solid Four Stars."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Chord Progressions cannot be copyrighted which is a fact well-known by jazz and blues songwriters over the past hundred years. This book takes you beyond Blues and Rhythm Changes progressions to reveal popular progressions used in Rock as well as the Standards.This book not only shows you the basic progression such as E-A-B Rock progression but gives numerous examples of how the world's best songwriters have embellished and changed it to create a new song. In the above example, it shows many possibilities such as &quot;With A Little Luck&quot; where Paul McCartney transforms the basic E-A-B progression into the following great ascending bass line progression: E-E/G#-A-B11.If you're looking to move to the next level, this is a good place study the chord progressions that have gone before."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Take your lyrics and put them in time-proven chord progressions, or take chart topping chord progressions and put your own spin on them.

Also, ... that has even more useful information on Popular Chord Progressions that is of interest to songwriters."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"This book is the best source of information on popular chord progressions that I have found. You don't need to have any music theory knowledge in order to gain useful insights into chord progressions to help improve your songwriting skills. This book has thousands of examples all transposed to the guitar-friendly key of E so that the reader can easily see commonalities instead of the complicated Roman Numeral or Nashville System. Progressions are logically organized and presented in a dictionary-like format. If you're looking to advance your knowledge of popular chord progressions, this is your one sourcebook."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"Great title, but no real &quot;money chords&quot; here. I was extremely disappointed. My impression was it was equivalent to some music graduate student's thesis on the statistical analysis of how often chord progressions are used - in the author's sampling of about 2000 songs.I was expecting more of an evaluative examination, some insight, some relative importances, and some categorization. Maybe I was expecting too much.It doesn't separate the chord progressions into any useful categories such as pop, rock, country, gospel, etc., it just lists out chord progressions and how often they appeared in this sampling of about 2000 songs. How is this useful?It's collecting dust on my bookshelf - Virtually zero usefulness, and I have about 10 books on songwriting, and another 15 or so on music theory and composition."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"The introduction alone was worth the price of admission. What separartes this book from others I've seen is the discussion of descending, ascending, and static (pedal point) progressions. The appendix included nine pages of common and uncommon descending bass lines alone. These were categorized by bass note runs so any budding songwriter can review what has been and can be done with this type of progression that is used to create romantic moods. Good Stuff."},{"Title":"Money Chords: A Songwriter's Sourcebook of Popular Chord Progressions","review":"I LOVE this book. I even bought a copy for a singer friend.

We have had this book for years now, and my 8 year old still loves it. He is a very advanced reader, reading chapter books already, so I think it may be mostly nostalgia that he still enjoys it. He was reading it to my 9 month old the other day. A flap or two is missing, but it's just as fun. It's sweet to see him share a book that he loved so much as a baby with his little sister now. Highly recommend this very simple but fun book."},{"Title":"Open the Barn Door (A Chunky Book(R))","review":"My daughter loves lift the flap books and, had I known this one was so adorable, I would have been reading it to her much earlier. The flaps are a little more challenging to open than other flap books, (some of them lift to the side, down, up), and they're made of cardboard with a little notch on the opening side. However, my daughter can not get enough of this book! She plays with it all the time! Maybe it's because it's a tiny board book and fits perfectly in her tiny hands, I don't know, but she really loves this book. I will buy another one if this one gets lost or destroyed."},{"Title":"Open the Barn Door (A Chunky Book(R))","review":"This book is very small but thick - the perfect size to bring along in a purse or diaper bag.

There are cats, a dog, goat, pig, pony, ducks, owls and a cow...the tabs are very durable and part of the book (NOT the flimsy kind that are just glued in.)

However, my daughter loved flipping each page and making the animal noises then guessing which animal would be uncovered. The Flaps aren't easy to find, but this only added to the delight.Other then the size, my only dislike was the duck page. The flap on this page seemed to be glued shut and we were unable to get it open. I was able to open a small corner of the flap and bend it back a bit, but any further attempt would result in a torn duck and no flap.I assume this is an issue with my personal book and mention it because it IS our experience with the book.

The location of the flaps with-in the pictures is very well done... it's just a shame they are so small. I'm sure my son will really enjoy this book in 5 months or so.*** For a better young age appropriate lift the flap book, try \\"Hide and Seek Farm\\", by Grandreams books.

Once read, the book's pages don't lie flat but stand up like an open accordian.The flaps are nice, adding an element of fun to this chunky board book. Initially the flaps are not easy to open and require more dexterity than any one or two-year-old could muster. At least the flaps go back into place neatly, though I imagine that with some rough handling those flaps might have a short life span.Open the Barn Door features bright colors and eye-catching illustrations that make it worth the low asking price."},{"Title":"Open the Barn Door (A Chunky Book(R))","review":"I've been trying to get my 16 month old son to learn more words, and this has been the book to do that. The page on the left asks a question about which animal makes a particular sound. The page on the right has a flap and underneath the flap is the answer. My 16 month old loves to open the flaps. I've found this book to be really helpful in teaching him more vocabulary. He lifts the flap and I repeat the name of the animal several times.

The book is small (about 3.75\\" high and wide), but I had no issues with reading the font size like one reviewer mentioned. Because of its small size, it was perfect for stuffing into our bag for a long flight or in the diaper bag. The text centers around the different sounds animals make; it simply goes \\"Who says ___\\", and then you lift the flap to find the answer. So, I feel like it offers the child a chance to practice fine motor skills in locating and lifting the flap as well as learning what sound each animal makes. There are also a lot of objects on each page to point out to a child or ask your child where specific items are.

He completely wore the first one out. I originally purchased this book for my 4 month old grandson when I gained custody of him. He played with the book all the time. I would read the book to him daily and imitate the animal sounds to make reading more interesting to him. My grandson is now 14 months old. This is still his favorite book. He would rather play with and read his books than he had play with a toy. He has had no trouble opening the little doors or windows in the book and he has been doing that since he was 5-6 months old. We have worn out the original book I purchased for him. I've had to maskin tape the spine twice to keep the book together. My grandson adores this book. He attempts to imitate the animal noises himself now that he is a little older and more interactive. It is a great size for my grandson. Easy to handle and hold with his little hands when he opens it. The book is solid and put together well. The flaps are good and sturdy- not flimsy and easily torn like some of the more expensive yet cheaply made books.

My first, took almost 8 months to interest him in books, and being my first, I wasn't sure if that was normal, or if the norm was my nephew. This was the book my sister shared with me. It has little flaps that you open or lift to show a farm animal, and kids just love it. It is a small simple book. Not much to it really, but kids just love it. The small size allows them to hold the book themselves to lift the flaps on their own. Ours came with a couple of broken \\"doors\\" but our son still loved it.When our second one arrived, he was even less interested in books than our first. He had no patience with any books and just flipped through the pages as if that was the purpose of books, giving us not even enough time to read the first syllable of the text. This book held his attention longer than any book as he would at least spend some time flipping the flaps before turning the page. He learned all the animal sounds from us reading this book to him. He eventually liked it so much he would take it to the car on our commute to daycare/work. Unfortunately, our commute is very long and one evening, he was bored enough that he decided to rip all the flaps and even managed to eat a few. So I would say, this book has captivated 3 very different children and provided some ripping exploration to the last child; not bad for a $4 book."},{"Title":"Open the Barn Door (A Chunky Book(R))","review":"This is a great, chunky, little book for little hands.

She states that the use of the masculine pronoun in such cases is \\"offensive\\". This is a change in the rules of English grammer. She has allowed her feminist views to influence the book.

It now uses the Bedford Handbook. I found Rules for Writers to be very full and useful for every aspect of teaching, not only grammar and punctuation, but for composition and research writing as well. It tends to have fairly exhaustive explanations of most points of grammar. It has an especially good section on ESOL problems. All in all, it is a practical useful book that I keep on my writing desk for my own use, even though it is no longer used in our classes.I was usually able to teach my courses without using any other text other than this book and the required reader. Before we had Rules and currently with the Bedford Handbook (also by Daina Hacker), I had to rely on handouts taken from the internet to emphasize areas like MLA documentation and developing cohesion in paragraphs and essays or to provide remedial materials for students with problems. With Rules for Writers, and also with the Little, Brown Handbook, another good handbook, I found better supplementary materials right in the book than anything I found on the Net.The biggest problem with Rules for Writers is its spiral bound soft cover format. This book does not hold up. Pages fall out, the cover falls off, and the book gets banged up. I would have to replace it every semester, if only not to be embarassed by the wrecked appearance my copy would have when it was time to display the textbook on the first day of class!Now as a professor who gets free textbooks, that is not a big problem. However, for students who are simply robbed blind paying for text books and may be required to use a handbook like this in a series of classes--and should always keep a handbook like this for reference in and out of school--having a book that falls apart and constantly needs replacing can be financial murder.Still, I prefer this book to the Bedford Handbook. The Bedford Handbook is handbook in name only and does not have as many features or as deep coverage as books like Rules for Writers or the Little, Brown Handbook. It is a kind of dumbing down of the information here. Visually the Bedford Handbook is better as a visual object and has nice illustrations, charts and pictures. It is also well integrated with Diana Hacker's maze of web sites. However, if any professor is trying to decide between the Bedford and Rules for Writers, get Rules for Writers."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers: 1999 Mla Update","review":"When I was a freshman in college (circa 1979), the official reference book for my honors English Comp class was \\"Rules for Writers, 2nd ed.\\" And I still have that book on my bookshelf.

He depicts them with depth and sympathy and you can't help feeling sorry for the plights their own follies bring upon them. Trollope knew the life he wrote about from his own eventful and long remembered career as a postal worker! Romance and vivid scene painting combine with social comentary to make Three Clerks a classic worth reading for pleasure as well as for the cultural history education it offers."},{"Title":"The Three Clerks (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I've been reading Trollope's works, and coming across the Three Clerks, thought it might be as interesting and as exciting as the novels I had already read. Not so. Generally, Trollope takes his time at the beginning of his books, setting up characters, situations, locations -- so for about one hundred pages or less, you have a rather slow-paced, dull introduction. Then the suspense tends to emerge and the books become difficult to put down until the very satisfying (in most cases) ending. However, The Three Clerks lacks suspense. Partly, this is due to Trollope's negligence in fleshing out his characters; otherwise, it is the result of concentrating on his exposition on the civil service and less on his characters and their private situations. The book becomes Dickensian in some respects, and Dickens isn't exactly known for clarity or excitement. There being no suspense about the characters, and in fact no great interest in any of them, the book is more of an endurance test to read than a pleasure.One problem could be that Trollope tries to handle too many characters. The Three Clerks of the title are Harry Norman, his best friend and eventually worst enemy Alaric Tudor (who steals his promotion and then his lady-love), and Alaric's cousin, the dissipated and indebted Charley Tudor. Of these young men, Harry Norman in his innocence, having much to learn about the ways of men, women and the world, would have been the most interesting to pursue, but Trollope concentrates on Alaric and his ambitions which eventually get him into a courtroom and jail -- though with a surprisingly light sentence for a man who swindles a client's fortune. The young men are matched to three young women, the Woodward sisters. Gertrude, the eldest, is cold-hearted and ambitious, and though Harry Norman loves her greatly, makes a heartless but intellectual decision to unite herself with Alaric, whose ambition she admires. She pays the price for this, but she does so in the typical female role, always viewing her husband as something near to a god, never blaming him for his failings and his crimes, and standing by her man through the trials that will follow for her and her children. Gertrude, like Alaric, gets her comeuppance, but she is also symbolic of the dependent woman of her time and often of our times, sticking to a man through all insult because the world has convinced her that not only can she not stand on her own, but she deserves no better than to be the support of a man whose ethics and behaviors are questionable. Linda, Gertrude's younger sister, who is loved and romanced but then dumped by Alaric, who cold-heartedly and ambitiously wants the oldest daughter rather than the one he professes to love, is like Harry Norman an interesting character who should have been explored but who gets little mention in the pages of the book. She is superceded by her baby sister, Katie, who falls for the useless rogue Charley and thus falls into an hysterical wasting-away that is so annoying that you almost wish . . . Well, never mind what you wish, but all six of these characters are dissatisfying and foolish, victims of their era and their stations in life. Add to that, we have Mrs. Woodward, mother to the three women, who is very nice but ineffectual and though having the opportunity to succeed, succumbs to being helpless without a man to take care of her. She is of no benefit to her daughters and actually far too negligent in her mothering of them, leading to the disasters and potential disasters in the book. Lesser characters include Undecimus Scott, the villian who leads Alaric astray, who is not as evil as he is expected to be but merely manipulative and conniving, essentially a bore. There is also Uncle Bat, a retired sea captain who makes a home with the Woodwards and generally drinks himself into a stupor. Or members of the civil service who both support or compete with Harry and Alaric in their rise in their careers. Everything ends well for Harry, at least, and Linda -- two good people get their just reward. Charley Tudor turns into a Trollope himself, writing stories for the literary magazines of his day, although the author reproduces his stories within the context of the book, which introduces just another method of dulling the pace and the action of the novel itself. Plenty of pages here to skim or skip, the book could have been half the size but still have retained the essence of the story -- on the other hand, if the author had only developed his characters and followed the important ones more closely, we could have had a finer novel of psychological and moral import."},{"Title":"The Three Clerks (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"If you like Jane Austen, you'll like Anthony Trollope, and this one is hard to find at libraries--though one of the author's own favorites. I think it was John Updike who said he envied Trollope his way of putting real life \\"under glass\\" to convey every detail of his characters and their world."},{"Title":"The Three Clerks (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Great book if you are a Trollope fan & are attempting to read all of his books.

He was certainly one of the greatest SF writers of the XX century - but he simply was one of the greatest writers of anything. And probably not just XXth, too...In my mind I only compare him to another XX century titan - Thomas Wolfe. Sturgeon's writing leaves the same impression - the words roll and toss you like waves, sometimes creating a feeling that he had used 1700 more words than was necessary - but when you try to cut out one or three of them, it is impossible to do. Or something opposite happens - he writes about 10 words and by those 10 creates a huge universe of emotions and ideas. Both Wolfe and Sturgeon could write about incredible cruelty and incredible love with stark clarity that sometimes is more horrifying than any number of horrors other authors pile on pages.How did it come to the point when one of the greatest authors of XX century is nearly forgotten? Just compare the number of reviews of his books with the number of reviews of some n-th boring book about some black elves, space wars, and other such trash. In a way, Sturgeon is himself responsible for that. Writing profound analysis of human emotions and souls under the label of SF.... how many modern readers of SF or fantasy ever suspect that there is more to it than blasters, space explosions or some morbid killer clowns nesting in morvid caves?It is a pity that some of the most profound, gentle, deeply intelligent and compassionate literature is quietly slipping away into a forgotten corner of \\"SF classics\\"..."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Damon Knight in his review at the time of the original publication said &quot;It's a single story that goes from here to there like a catenary arc, hits one note like The Last Trump when it gets there, and ends.

I received it amongst other vintage sci-fi paperbacks and was going to pitch it due to it's condition, but after reading all the hype in Amazon reviews, (as well as the fact that this book won some award)...AND because Ted Sturgeon is my favorite sci-fi short story writer--I read it. Seriously..I love Sturgeon. But seriously..what's so great about this novel? Nothing that I could see. He writes lyrically, that is true; the first part of this book (about Evelyn and Lone meeting her) had me crying the entire time, it was so poignant. The book slowly lost it's emotional edge as I continued reading. The ending was ok, but I still finished the book saying, \\"BIG DEAL.\\" My personal, humble opinion is Sturgeon excelled at short stories but wasn't so adept at filling out an entire novel. I read the Cosmic Rape (by Sturgeon) a while back and didn't think that was so great either. No pun intended here-- on the other hand, his story Bianca's Hands is one of my all time favorite short stories."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"A lone man wanders between streets and alleys not knowing how to speak and think in words. He is at the mercy of the passers-by. He is an idiot. Two sisters and their father, who live in a old Victorian house located at deep inside the forest, never meet outsiders. Food and other goods are delivered to the gates of their mansion. Father's puritan views about sin restrain girls from reaching their puberty and their womanhood. One day the idiot, wandering in the forest, hears a call inside his head. A girl's call, words that he don't comprehend, because he doesn't know what language is, but which draws him closer like siren blowing in a horn. Meet the start if Homo Gestalt, group mind, where one person is not a whole, but group of persons.The different people presented in the story are alone, they have no purpose, until they get together. At that point their various mind abilities, like telekinesis, ESP, mongoloid autistic computing-brains make them connect. There is nobody in the world to talk to, even if they are group, they are alone. The Homo Gestalt doesn't have purpose, like homo sapiens, individuals, do. This is the story of new evolution, mind's evolution.Written in 1953, would you believe it? There is no other book like it even today. The book is slow to start and the 2-star reservations are understandable. This is the old school of science fiction, where ideas and their implications are far more important than the science. What does it mean if the *mind* mutates? What agonizing inner complications arise, when the evolutionary leap is something like a hive? What philosophical and sociological impacts the new race would revolutionize? The writing is heartbreaking at times, elegance in simplicity, captures the inner emotions and how persons perceive the environment. The pictures are vivid, unique, something dream like. It was hilarious to read how one of the Homo Gestalt group lay down on a couch at psychiatrist's office to psychoanalyze his mental blocks. The book is something that touches the core of humanity: the morality, the ethos; how the new Homo Gestalt does not posses it, but will require it to evolve.Five (5) stars. This is one of those books that are, and continue to be, one of the classics. Considering the 2-star reviews it is important to note that this book is not for everybody; those who enjoy development of concepts and ideas, rather than development of plot and characters, are likely to find sparkling moments. In today's supply of SF, this book would be categorized as fictional future, more than science fiction. The books leaves you in a state where you picture an old maple tree at autumn in a gentle breeze, with leaves falling to the ground, in all colors imaginable. Delicate story. Great read for thinkers."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"\\"More Than Human\\" is a strange book indeed, filled with evocative prose and provocative ideas. It is a stretch to call this book science fiction, but that's where it's usually classified because it deals with \\"supernatural\\" phenomena and contains technology-based plot developments. But it's really a book about the human condition, especially at the edges of humanity. There's no other work quite like it; imagine a bizarre version of Catcher In The Rye with an idiot-savant Norman Bates as the central character, and you'll have a vague idea... but even that's not really close. I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were possible on Amazon."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"...but the plot was good too. This book might suffer a bit from character bloat. There was potential here for a series of books and far more character development; some actors are given short shrift which is made even sadder by the fact that the author has managed to make each and every one interesting and engaging.While our view of a very intriguing world is narrowed to just a few points in time that hop about a bit, there's still a lot to be had. This book does a great job at evoking the feelings of isolation and contempt for greater society the standard mutant outcast fiction never quite accomplishes. We are made to feel the fear of normal humans as well as the barely-containable desire for revenge and untapped and perhaps unlimited power of our heroes and anti-heroes.Great execution and wonderfully written prose had me turning the pages as fast as I possible could.

The first describes the completely coincidental meeting of supporting characters. The relationship of Lone and his adoptive parents is very sad and wanting. Part two, the best part of the book, introduces the self-absorbed antagonist of the story, and really picks up the pace. Then part three crawls out of the gate. A slow, empty plod, only picking up halfway through before addressing any elements introduced in the first two sections. More than once I wanted to abandon it out of bored frustration.The novel wraps up nice enough, but I feel this book is very much of the moment.

And a vastly superior organism at that. All alone on this earth, and not understood by the human society, how can this organism have ethical and moral boundaries? Why would it not kill for a whim?I've read this book with a growing sense of horror, as Sturgeon develops this concept further and further, shifting the perspective in each of the 3 parts, but always skillfully pulling the reader inside the protagonist, to make his point. Now I've finished it, some of my uncomfortable feelings are desolved because of the twist in the last paragraphs, but some still linger. A powerful book."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"I picked up this book over the summer based on the rave reviews of my amazon colleagues. I'll admit to being surprised at first, for the cover (which looked modern) distracted me from the fact that this book is over half a century old.I'm a contemporary sci-fi fan, I think authors can use modern-day technological topography to look \\"so far out\\". That's just my thing. Well, I'm glad I gave this book a chance, because while it's more fantasy than sci-fi, technology took a back seat to the philosophical and sociological impacts of tech. In this case, a major human evolutionary leap.Sturgeon describes the origination of a new breed of man. A man that's not one man, but a combination of parts, each serving a distinct and specialized function. Most of the book is dedicated to the gestation and organization of this species. I think I'd be more interested in More Than Human 2...I'd love to see the social, technological, and moral impacts to a world filled with \\"Homo-Gestalts\\" as the author calls them.That aside, this book is a worthwhile read.

However, I found it to be somewhat disjointed and I was disappointed how the author concluded Lone's role in the story.

I have a strong suspicion this book highly influenced Dean Koontz's \\"The Bad Place.\\""},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"More Than Human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.The writing is often compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection having read a few of Faulkner's works. Sturgeon uses many of Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like As I Lay Dying.I love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously. This results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books. More Than Human is slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending nor would I recommend it to others. So the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (Asimov) and since. This book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages. This book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004) The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored. Besides More Than Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi. Needless to say, More Than Human did not win (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)Bottom Line: I wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.

The multiple characters had a compulsion to meld in the beginning, and in the end it is not even the characters we expected and they do not meld at all in my opinion, only mish-mash into a single character with a weak explanation of \\"themselves\\" as humanity.

There are no interplanetary battles or light saber fights. Instead, the story follows a small group of humans have evolved psychic powers. This group explores what it means to be a community, how their powers might let them work together as a single organism, and how they will interact with humanity.The story is divided into three sections. The first section looks at how evolved humans are treated by human society. The second section details the evolved humans' rejection of human society. The third section looks at if and how traditional moral codes apply to the group of evolved humans.Overall, the story resembled a Psych 101 case-study more than I would have liked, but the characters feel like real people and the ethical dilemmas are deeper than most science fiction stories. The story was slow at times, but when I reached the final page I was glad to have read it.If you want to purchase this book, I would suggest looking into the following collection of science fiction from the 1950s:American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s"},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Edward Waldo, whose name was changed to \\"Theodore Sturgeon\\" after his divorced mother remarried, began his writing career in the late 1930s; he was a close contemporary of the other greats of science fiction's Golden Age, like Heinlein, Asimov, and Clark, though rather more highly regarded by literary critics than they were. He also had an enormous influence on the next couple of generations of SF writers. Sturgeon turned out a huge number of short stories, almost all of them considerably better than the professional average in the genre -- for a time in the 1950s, he was thought to be the most anthologized author alive, and the canonical \\"Complete Short Stories\\" runs to thirteen volumes -- but he also did half a dozen novels, of which this is his most famous. I first read it in 8th or 9th Grade, not too many years after it was first published, and it has stayed with me ever since.There are three sections to the book. The middle section appeared originally in GALAXY as \\"Baby Is Three\\" and is narrated in first person; the first and third sections, told in third person, explain \\"how it all came about\\" and \\"what happened as a result.\\"And what is it about? First, there's Lone, who is an idiot. But he's also an empathic telepath; anything you know or feel, he can know or feel. He just doesn't have sufficient intellect to do very much with it. Second is Janie, age six, who is telekinetic. She can move things from one place to another without touching them, without even having to see them. Third and fourth are the four-year-old twins, Bonnie and Beanie, who are teleports. They can move themselves from one place to another without crossing through the intervening space. Finally, there's Baby, an infant with Down Syndrome (what used to be called \\"Mongoloid,\\" as it is here). Baby is an enormously powerful human computer. Any question you can think to ask, he has an answer for, though you may have to supply him the vocabulary to explain it to you. Of course, Baby can't talk in the usual way, but Janie can understand his subtle semaphore system just fine. Gradually, each of the kids comes to live with Lone in his shelter in the forest. Gradually, they learn to \\"blesh,\\" to bond. Separately, as Lone describes them, they comprise \\"a part that fetches, a part that figures, a part that finds out, and a part that talks.\\" Together, they form a single, symbiotic being -- a gestalt.And then Lone is killed by a falling tree -- but all is not lost, because a couple of years before that they also were joined by the last member of the group organism, Gerry, eight years old, a runaway orphan, and with no concept of morality, who turns out to possess the same control-talent Lone has -- but in his case, it's driven by an intellect at genius level. And the world had better watch out. Because, when asked \\"What are you going to do?\\" Gerry's reply is \\"What can an electric motor do? Anything. It depends on where we apply ourselves.\\" But there's one thing they/it can't do, and that's be anything other than *alone*.A key point in the story, though Sturgeon never explicitly says as much, is that all the main characters, all the kids, have survived damage at the hands of adults. Even Miss Kew, though she's an adult, was nearly destroyed by her maniacal father when she was just Alicia.Finally comes the closing section of the story, in which Hip Barrows, with Janie's help, tracks himself back into his own past and discovers how it was he went insane, and how it involved Homo gestalt, and what he can do about it. And why ethics is more important, and more useful, than morality. All I can say is, if you've never read this book, you owe it to yourself to do so. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"More Than Human explores what it means to be human, a question made relevant by the evolution of an entity that Theodore Sturgeon calls Homo Gestalt, a group of individuals who reach completeness only by functioning together as a single being. The 1953 novel is written in three parts. The middle (and weakest) section first appeared as a novella in Galaxy magazine. Sturgeon, whose writing career focused on short stories, turned the novella into a novel by adding the first and third sections. Of the few novels he produced, More Than Human is by far the best.The first section introduces most of the principle characters. Lone is feeble-minded but has the ability to control the minds of others. Jane can move objects with her mind. Mute twins named Bonnie and Beanie can teleport. While appearing to be developmentally disabled, Baby has the intellectual capacity of a supercomputer. The characters can barely survive as individuals; linked together they constitute a superior form of humanity.In the first section, Sturgeon uses lush and riveting prose to remind the reader, primarily through the character of Lone, what it means to be human: to know the joy of anticipation and the pain of reality; to accept the necessity of loss as a condition of growth; to be loved and reviled; to lose friends and connect with strangers; to experience the awakening of compassion and empathy after years of comfortable numbness. There are deeper and more profound lessons in this novel than in any ten self-help books. One of my favorites has to do with the continuing struggle for self-realization: \\"So it was that Lone came to know himself; and like the handful of people who have done so before him he found, at this pinnacle, the rugged foot of a mountain.\\"The second section takes place several years later. It introduces Gerry Thompson, a disturbed sociopath with an impaired memory. Thompson, like Lone, has the ability to control minds, but it is not an ability that has served him (or humanity) well. He becomes involved with the Gestalt in a less than positive way, losing much of his identity in the process. This section begins and ends with Thompson in the office of a psychiatrist who is trying to help him recover his memory.Section three takes place after the passage of another several years. It focuses on Hip Barrows, an Air Force engineer who (like Thompson) has lost his memory. Barrows is in jail and likely to be insitutionalized when he meets Jane. With Jane's assistance, Barrows begins to remember the events that led to his incarceration, and ultimately the event that triggered his memory loss -- an event that relates back to something Lone and the Gestalt did in part one. Barrows and Thompson come into conflict when Thompson decides that the Gestalt's behavior need not be governed by human standards.The third section gives Sturgeon an opportunity to explore questions of ethics. He posits that traditional laws of morality cannot apply to a vastly superior entity, any more than human morals apply to ants, while new concepts of morality cannot arise to govern Homo Gestalt when only one such entity exists. Yet how can Homo Gestalt be complete without a conscience? Sturgeon steers the characters on a path toward self-awareness, much like a Brahmin might act as a spiritual guide to the ways of the universe. There is, in fact, something of a Buddhist or New Age philosophy at work in More Than Human, or at least one that is deeply humanistic (an ironic term, perhaps, to apply to an evolved entity that is more than human).In many respects, More Than Human is nearly perfect: the dialog is particularly strong, the prose is some of the finest that science fiction has produced, and the message is inspiring. The supporting characters are drawn in finely detailed strokes: a farmer who endures despite losing everything that gave his life meaning; a innocent woman who has been sheltered from life by her deranged, ultra-religious father; a psychiatrist who exemplifies the caring empathy that should characterize his profession.More Than Human reflects an optimism about the future of humanity that was a common trait of 1950s science fiction, before the genre succumbed to postmodern bleakness. Sturgeon envisioned a destiny for mankind that is not \\"guided by an awesome Watcher in the sky ... suffused with the pale odor of sanctity,\\" but one that humanity achieves as the inevitable result of progress. Perhaps twenty-first century readers, awash in novels that envision the \\"posthuman\\" as a mechanical blend of brain and technology, are too jaded to consider humanity \\"sainted by the touch of its own great destiny.\\" Jaded or not, the ideas that Sturgeon develops in More Than Human deserve a twenty-first century audience."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Theodore Sturgeon was a true artist in the way he approached his writing.

Freaks will love it and everything by Sturgeon..."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human is, quite simply, one of the best and most original science fiction novels of all time; it is also one of the more neglected classics in the field. This magnificent example of literary science fiction belongs on the same shelf as Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land and Alfred Bester's first two novels. I was already a Sturgeon fan before reading More Than Human, but even I almost scoffed at comparisons of this novel with the work of William Faulkner (my literary hero). Much to my surprise, though, there is indeed a Faulknerian aspect to this novel. The narrative radiates traces of stream of consciousness and moves quietly back and forth in time from place to place as it approaches the essence of a philosophical revelation from multiple levels. For this reason, you will most likely either love or hate the book, for its greatest strength is very likely, to some readers, its greatest weakness.More Than Human is such a unique novel that some individuals may not consider it science fiction at all; the science wrapped into these pages is of the most abstract and philosophical sort, centering on the question of the future evolution of the human race. The novel is broken up into three very distinct sections, each division marked by a shift in both emphasis and viewpoint. Initially, it can be a little difficult to get your bearings after one of these jumps, but all of the pieces of this giant puzzle come together in the end; I would qualify this by saying that the ultimate resolution happens in the reader's mind and is not necessarily spelled out by the author on the final page. The novel features some rather surprising plot twists along the way, and sometimes the reader may think Sturgeon has wandered far off the beaten track. In a sense he has because More Than Human marks the birth of a new kind of science fiction; rest assured that Sturgeon knows exactly where he is going from page one.The novel opens with a self-described and self-acknowledged idiot living the only life he has ever known, one of utter loneliness and nothingness. His one gift is an ability to make people do things for him by looking at them in a certain way. His encounter with a unique, incredibly over sheltered little girl in the woods leads to an early scene of great tragedy and a turning point in the young man's life. Lone, as he manages to name himself, is taken in by a farming couple and introduced to the life he had never known. Elsewhere, a young girl named Janie lives a life of unhappiness under the roof of her unfit mother. She has her own special gift, the ability to move things with her mind, and one day she comes to know a pair of black children who can disappear and reappear at will. All of these characters somehow find each other and begin to see themselves as something more than human after a mongoloid baby is added to the strange little family. Taken together, they are one person: Lone is the head, Janie and the twins are the legs and arms, and Baby is the brilliant thinker that only Janie can communicate with telepathically. What forms out of these interconnected lives is a new type of human being: Human Gestalt. Individual weakness is subsumed by group superhuman strength, but this new type of human is lonely and prone to make mistakes as it struggles to understand itself.The three sections are all remarkably different, yet they work together in much the same fashion as the children to become something incredibly powerful. In broad terms, the first section describes the birth of Human Gestalt, the second section describes its search for a purpose in life and a reason for being, and the third and most important section addresses the ethical and moral ramifications of such a new type of superhuman. The novel is told with such subtle power and mind-numbing beauty that any description I attempt to make will not do it justice. This is thought-provoking science fiction at its best."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Okay, how many science fiction novels from the 50's have REALLY stood the test of time? \`More Than Human' is devoid of slimy aliens, ray-guns, faster than light travel, time machines, robots, or any of the other \\"stereotypes\\" non-sf people associate with 50's science fiction. Well, what DOES it have going for it? How about:GREAT WRITINGSturgeon was a thinker with a tremendous imagination. I caught myself grinning often at several of his lines, at how he avoided clich&eacute;s and gave fresh ideas to simple scenes and concepts. In the first section, \\"The Idiot,\\" I was reminded of the opening of Faulkner's \`The Sound and the Fury.' (Yes, comparing Sturgeon to Faulkner is NOT a stretch!) The way Sturgeon gets inside Lone's head and lives there is amazing. Wonderful writing that still reads with freshness 50 years later.GREAT IDEASSix misfit outcasts, each with a unique gift, form a new step in man's evolution, a gestalt of unbelievable power. I won't go into the social, political, and moral implications of such an idea (Read the book), but the concept by itself is interesting. What Sturgeon does with it is fascinating.GREAT STORYTELLINGI have not researched Sturgeon very much, but from what I have gathered, he was somewhat of a rogue who loved to examine the dark side of the human psyche. This and his inability to be confined to a nice neat label come across in the writing to present a story that is exciting, awe-inspiring, and most important, honest.If you've only read a few sf writers from the 50's (such as Asimov, Clarke, Bradbury, Bester, Simak, etc.), expand your horizons with Sturgeon. You won't be sorry.233 pages"},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Imagine the X-Men with superpowers confined to extrasensory gymnastics--no storm-summoning, no fire-throwing, and no metal claws--and you'll have an idea of the team that makes up the leading cast of this tale. (I note that other readers have seen the resemblance to the X-Men; the comparison is apt in many ways.)We are first introduced to Lone, an intellectually incapacitated young man with the ability to hypnotize telepathically. After witnessing a murder and escaping death himself, he lives untamed in the forest, gathering other social outcasts who gravitate toward his cave. There's Janie, with a seemingly unlimited faculty for telekinesis; Bonnie and Beanie, two toddlers who have learned how to teleport themselves; and Baby, a mute whose body is stunted but whose brain is structured like computer. (Sturgeon's insistence on incorporating different races and both sexes as equal partners living together as a new evolutionary species was, in 1953, years ahead of its time.)This history of this team--the newly evolved Gestalt species--is recounted in three extraordinarily different stories. Even the prose style varies: the opening section has the feel of a Gothic horror story combined with a Jack London tale; the middle is written entirely as teasing banter between a new member of the Gestalt squad and his shrink; and the final chapter could be a Depression-era tale by Steinbeck (or, more precisely, an episode of HBO's \\"Carnivale\\").The book's shortcoming--and it's not insignificant--is Sturgeon's tendency to hammer home the import of his stories. Each of the three endings abandons subtleness and representation for bluntness and pontification; it sometimes seems that the author presents each resolution in the same manner he would reveal a mathematical proof. Thus (and I'll phrase my criticisms without exposing the book's secrets), the group of misfits discerns how they can work together as a team; thus, the team learns how they are a cohesive whole; thus, the totality endeavors to develop their own morality. Nothing is left for the reader to interpret or even to imagine.In spite of its overly meticulous endings, \\"More Than Human\\" has much to say about human society and ethics. Part adventure story, part psychological novel, part realist saga, the whole of its parts--like the species it portrays--is unlike anything else you'll find in science fiction."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"A very good tale. According to Sturgeon ,the next step in human evolution is not only about having mental powers ,but also functioning on a sinergetic level.That is ,a number of psychics ,all with different powers such as teleportation ,telekinesis ,hypnotic-telepathy and human-cumputer abilities (idiot-savant etc') ,all becoming one entity who looks upon itself as Homo-gestalt ,and upon the rest of humanity as a herd of sheep.the book is divided into three parts. The first depicting the Homo-gestalt's forming ,the second ,the replacment of it's &quot;head&quot; ,the individual who makes everyone be one ,and the third- how and why that man becomes moral though no human rules aply to him. He is superior ,not only in his own mind but truly in every aspect. why should he obey our rules? if you were all alone would you conform to the social rules and mores of mice?But there is something ,and the few last paragraphs turn the whole story into really wide-scale ,optimistic and exciting science fiction.Very modern concepts there ,by the way ,on mental powers ,such as I would not expect from a 1953 book. recommended."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"This book is deserving of the absolute highest praise. The Washington Post said that More than Human &quot;marked a quantum leap in the development of science fiction as an art,&quot; and they are absolutely correct. This book, as well as all of Sturgeon's works, has a strong, involved plot which alone is enough to read the book. However, also true of all of Sturgeon's works, the focus of this story is on the characters. Deep, sensitive, intelligent, hurt, scarred, wonderful characters which you will without a doubt see some part of yourself in. This is not a great science-fiction novel, it is one of the most powerful novels of this century."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"I was so excited about this book. A unanimous five star rating! This is unlike most science fiction books in that it is not set in the future, thus there is no futuristic technology (except for one item), and the science fiction deals purely with the evolution of the mind. That's interesting enough and the story is a good one. It is the manner in which the story is told that bothered me after a while. Sturgeon has a way of dragging you through page after page, without giving a clue to what in the world is going on until the very end of each section. Sort of like a more sadistic Steinbeck. It's constant through the book that way and I found it agonizing. This book would be complex enough without the mysterious literary style. That aside, the concept is great and the characters are interesting."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"\\"More Than Human\\" by Theodore Sturgeon is a ground-breaking novel and the winner of the International Fantasy award in 1954 for fiction. It was also recognized by the fans in 1956 when it tied for 3rd on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1966 when it was rated 19th on the same poll. It ranked 9th on the Locus All-Time Poll in 1975 for All Time Novels, 12th in 1987 for All Time SF Novels, and 13th in 1998 for SF Novels before 1990. It was also nominated for the Retro Hugo in 2004 for works published in 1953.Sturgeon tells his story by using three shorter works. They tell the story of the next step in the evolution of man, which is named \\"Homo Gestalt\\". As separate people, Lone, Janie, Bonnie, Beanie, and Baby do not fit into society, but when they are together, they are a fully functional being. There are some tells in my description of the three parts of the story, so skip the rest if you don't want to risk any spoilers. The three parts of the story are:\\"The Fabulous Idiot\\" is a novelette which was first published in this book. It is the story of the creation of \`Homo Gestalt'. It focuses largely on the story of Lone, who is the \`idiot' from the title. For most of his life, he is largely ignored, although he does have telepathy and mind control powers that he uses, unknowingly, to get people to casually give him food or money so that he can survive. We also learn about of Janie (telekinesis), and the twins, Bonnie and Beanie (teleportation), and Baby (super-intelligent). This story jumps around from group to group, giving the reader the back-story for the characters, and eventually brings them together, and at the end they learn their roles in \`Homo Gestalt'.\\"Baby Is Three\\" is a novella which was originally published in \\"Galaxy\\" in October of 1952. This story takes place a few years in the future, from the viewpoint of Gerry, who is seeking help from a psychiatrist to help him understand who he is. While exploring his past, we learn that Lone brought Gerry into the group and that when Lone died, the group stayed together seeking help from an old acquaintance of Lone, whom we met briefly in the first section. As Gerry gains understanding and recovers memories, we ultimately find that he is Lone's replacement in \`Homo Gestalt', and while Lone's simplicity was a handicap for the group before, Gerry's lack of morals is the new challenge to their survival.\\"Morality\\" is a novelette which was originally published in this book. This part of the story follows Hip Barrows, who is desperately trying to recover his lost memories. Somewhat similar in style to the previous section, it takes place a few years farther in the future, and it is a character reconstructing the past. Hip is aided in his attempts to reconstruct his past by Janie. We learn that Gerry decided to destroy Hip's life and that even while trying to remember, they are being pursued by Gerry and the rest of \`Homo Gestalt'. Hip's only chance for survival is if he can make Gerry understand the need for an ethic for the new species."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"I was told off by my English teacher for reading this, 'trash' she said.

I recently found it again and re-read it and it is even better written than I thought. Sad, funny and poetic. Remember Ted Sturgeon."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"Havine read the much-anthologized &quot;Baby Is Three&quot; multiple times, I've just read this entire &quot;novel.&quot; Coming right on the heels of a very impressive revisit with Bradbury's _Martian Chronicles_, this book's dark and violent tone is very striking and well-crafted. Within the first 40 pages or so, there's incest and child abuse, S&amp;M, suicide, telepathic idiots, child geniuses, and a young telekinetic girl. Set in what I take to be the 1950s, the book strikes me as what the X-Men would have been like if created by William Faulkner .... perhaps channeled many years later by David Lynch. This isn't typical science fiction of ANY era, much less the 1950s, when the genre was struggling against its pulp-action tendencies. Rather, this excellent book should appeal to readers of horror, gothic, and quality literature of the Burroughs and Bowles sort."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"This early-50s SF classic from Theodore Sturgeon somewhat resembles \\"Childhood's End\\" by Arthur C. Clarke, in that seemingly weird kids actually herald the next step in human evolution. However, Sturgeon uses this concept for much more chilling and disturbing ends. Here, kids with psychic powers have been rejected by society and their parents and are branded as troublemakers and halfwits, when they are actually searching for others who can complement their powers and make them feel complete. The strange youngsters of the story have suffered their way through neglect and hatred until finally finding each other, and proceed to merge their psychic powers and become a mental superbeing that surpasses current humanity. But since they're just kids, they don't realize what they're doing or that they're different. They also lack morals and ethics, and use their powers unwisely until realizing that they still need that crucial connection with regular people. This thematic backdrop results in a very melancholy and disturbing atmosphere to the story. Note that this book is put together in a fashion common for golden age SF, in the form of interconnected short stories that were originally serialized in fan magazines. This makes the flow of the overall story a bit fragmented and disjointed, while believable character development takes a back seat to exercises in plot and theme construction. But Sturgeon still delivered a decidedly haunting treatise on what it truly means to be human - or more than human.

Sturgeon weaves a tale of rare wonder, populated with tragic, human, and fully realized characters that fairly leap from the page and into your heart. The first two-thirds of this novel can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with anything ever written, in or out of genre. The book's only flaw lies in the last third of the book, which is anti-climactic and a little too pat.

Expanded from the novella &quot;Baby Is Three,&quot; which makes up the second of the novel's three parts, it tells the story of the evolution of _homo gestalt_ -- thereby introducing a &quot;group mind&quot; theme that is also taken up in the work of one of Sturgeon's biggest fans, Spider Robinson.It is not, by the way, an accident that Spider is both a Sturgeon fan _and_ a more or less unreconstructed hippie. Some readers of this book may not know how profound an effect SF had on the ideals of the 1960s -- and may, for example, be surprised to learn that the introduction to _Baby Is Three_ (Volume 6 of Sturgeon's collected works) was written by none other than David Crosby. (Another volume -- the fifth, I think -- is introduced by Kurt Vonnegut, who based Kilgore Trout loosely on Sturgeon.)But in fact this is one of two SF books you _must_ read if you want to understand what motivated (and still motivates) those ideals. The other is Robert Heinlein's _Stranger In A Strange Land_. It wouldn't be too much to describe the entire '60s &quot;counterculture&quot; phenomenon as an attempt to do some grokking and bleshing on an unprecedented scale.For &quot;grokking,&quot; see the Heinlein book. &quot;Bleshing&quot; -- blending and meshing -- is what individual humans do when they make up a single &quot;gestalt&quot; being. They don't lose individuality; they just combine to make a whole greater than the separate sum of the parts. You know, like a '60s rock band . . . (My own favorite example is David Crosby's own _If I Could Only Remember My Name_, but his recent work with CPR bleshes pretty darn fine too.)Anyway, for my money, this volume is one of Sturgeon's finest works (not that any of it was _bad_). If you like it, check out Crosby's aforementioned introduction to Volume 6, and you might also like Spider Robinson's _Time Pressure_ (now available only in the combo volume _Deathkiller_, which also includes _Mindkiller_, the book to which _Time Pressure_ was the first sequel)."},{"Title":"More Than Human","review":"The title of this review says it all. If you haven't read this book, your life is incomplete."},{"Title":"The exile","review":"Published in 1936 and cataloged as a biography in Buck's bibliography,The Exile chronicles the life of Carie who at a young age feels called to be a missionary. The story unfolds as Carie tells her story to the writer. Who the writer is is not clear though she is Chinese and knows Carie for 30 years. Carie comes from a Dutch family who immigrates to the US for God and liberty. Continuing in the family tradition of being a exile, she and her husband become missionaries to China. Carie always loves the US as home, influencing her children in the same way. Ultimately she is an exile in China though she has chosen to be there. Ironically as she returns to the states for her last furlough (which were very few and far between), she is no longer at home there either and returns to China where 3 small graves remain. A woman of courage and ingenuity, she finds her place of usefulness in her called life, committing herself to those in need, mending physical bodies, bringing beauty to a difficult life, and struggling with the suffering around her. She views her husband's call as the real call because it is focused solely on the spiritual. This brings a sadness (my perception) to the whole story as I considered how different her life might have been if she had understood her life as partnering in value with her husband's call. One of the best episodes in the book (p. 155-162) which reflects her faith and pluck recounts her response to the threat of violence against herself and her children. During a long period of drought some of the Chinese begin blaming the foreigners and there are threats made on her life. She prays \\"if it is Thy will, save us, but in any case, help me not to be afraid. If the time comes to die, help me to have the children go first.\\" When darkness falls and midnight comes, she and her helper/friend Wang Amah set up for tea, cleaning and preparing for guests. She opens wide the front gate to the street with all the lights in the house on. She awakens and dresses her children, bringing them downstairs to play. She sews and waits. When the voices draw near she goes to the door inviting the men with sticks, clubs and knives inside, saying \\"Come in, friends, neighbors! I have tea prepared.\\" A few come forward; she serves them as if royalty. When she hears one of the men say \\"strange she is not afraid!\\" she responds \\"why should I fear my neighbors?\\" Some leave, some stay to try the organ, play with the children. Eventually the leader announces \\"there is nothing more to do here. I go home.\\" She and her children have survived another day. The daily lives of missionaries, especially women, have not received significant attention. That is one of the strengths this book has to offer. Honest in recounting her inner most spiritual struggles, Carie lives the life of a servant for the Chinese people. The book ends with her death and the writer's appraisal of her life: \\"But if she judged her life fallen short, to us, among whom she lived, what a life it was! I do not think one of us would have called her a saintly woman. She was far too practical, far too vivid and passionate, too full of humor and change and temper for that. She was the most human person we have ever known, the most complex in her swift compassion, in her gusts of merriment and in her utter impatiences; she was best friend and companion to us.\\" The last statement is \\"to all of everywhere who knew her this woman was America.\\" (This is a far cry from the blame and poor press given to some missionaries today, unable to grasp the love that impels Christians to share the love of Christ.)In reading this book I came to care for the main character, both respecting her and wishing greater joy for her spirit. After doing some research on Buck's own life, I am guessing that this book is about her own mother named Caroline."},{"Title":"The exile","review":"I read this after Pearl Buck's classic, \\"The Good Earth\\". As much as I adored The Good Earth, I loved The Exile even more. It's the true story of Pearl's mother from her childhood in the United States to her marriage and move to China. The story of her courage during the Boxer Rebellion was inspiring. Her sorrow over the loss of children was almost unbearable. Her strength through it all was a triumph."},{"Title":"The exile","review":"Beginning with an image of her pretty mother, strong, sturdy, hard at work cultivating an American garden in China where she is shown impassioned with pity for a distressed mother bird whose nest has been destroyed, then moving to an account of how the liberty-impassioned Dutch and French parents of Carie Stulting came to America to escape religious intolerance in Holland, Pearl Buck begins the process of drawing readers into a loving, in-depth memorial of her mother's life as missionary wife and mother. (The story picks up about 30 pages into the book when Carie takes up the story strain herself.)In this biography of Carie Stulting Sydenstricker, Pearl Buck repeats again and again but in differing phrases one underlying theme. It is that her mother and father were Christians of two opposing temperaments and that their marriage was lacking. Seemingly, Carie suffered most from this circumstance. She agonized also because of a lack of confidence that her own response to God's call was wholehearted and adequate.Actually, however, the story of Carie's life seems to show that she was a veritable saint, even if a practical, earth-interested one. She was a vibrant, brave, and gifted woman, always unrestrainedly responsive in an effort to relieve sick and suffering people, which service she performed out of a wellspring of pure natural instinct rather than out of premeditated piety. This immediacy and spontaneity were key character traits of hers. Her impetuous, unpremeditated, feelingful response-ability seems to have derived first from natural, inborn qualities backed up secondarily by her dutiful Christian ideals. Although she was fastidious, artistic by temperament, and cared to have beauty in her surroundings, always remembering and longing for the lovely life of her American girlhood, she was heroic in bearing living conditions almost entirely devoid of beauty, cleanliness, healthfulness, or comfort (except for a get-away place late in life in the cool mountain wilderness of Kuling). Her husband, who was fixated always on the work of God and evinced little concern for family life, was absent most of the time and Carie was left to deal alone with dangerous and harrowing threats in Chinese life that arose to confront her and her little children.Carie raised and lost to disease four out of seven children in China, yet she overcame bitterness. She fought out of the heritage of her own brave spirit and her own determined renewed effort of blind trust in a God who was always inexplicably unresponsive to her plea for a sign from Him that she was pleasing Him in her works and life choices. She repeatedly rose up bravely from overwhelming disease, loss, sufferings, enduring these great blows to her strongly emotional nature. Too, it seems clear that however much her husband may have seemed like a stranger to her, she consciously and willingly tried to serve as helpmate to him.I wanted to think there may have been more depth of meaningful relationship for the out-of-sync temperaments of her parents than Pearl, who greatly favored her mother over her father, liked to admit. Sometimes the conversations that she recreates seem merely typical of many ordinary marriages which are basically devoted and loving despite the misunderstandings and clashes of temperament involved. I'll give an account of just one such conversation [in which I've used slashes to indicate paragraphing in order to save space]. It occurs after an incident in which Carie realizes that a Chinese woman who chose to devote herself to Carie as child-care maid, an abused woman Carie befriended and brought to live in her house, is dying of cholera. Instantly Carie throws herself into nursing the woman. For a week she spends herself furiously and determinedly caring for this friend in a little hut set up apart from the family for quarantine purposes. Pearl states that Carie did this because she was moved by an immediate battle call of anger toward disease and death itself. When the very sick servant recovers, the following account of an exchange occurs between Carie and Andrew:\\"Carie, with troubled eyes, said, 'I am afraid I did not do it for the Lord's sake.' Somehow she was always forgetting that. /'If you would just remember to do things in His name,\\" said Andrew, anxious for her soul./ 'But, Andy, I don't have time,' she protested earnestly. 'When somebody is dying you haven't time to think why you save them--you have to start doing it right away!'/ But there was the world and all between these two and they looked at each other uncomprehendingly. Andrew was never without thought of God in all he did. To Carie life was so nearly enough in its own richness.\\"As if appropriate to the two different personalities, it seems to me that Pearl Buck's writing style in the two biographies about her parents differs. The style of her father's book is plain and almost dry. There's a great deal of humor which reflects on the one hand the simple and spare wit of Andrew's direct, quiet personality. There's also Pearl's subtle poking of fun at her father's idiosyncratic ways. By contrast, there's little humor in this book about Carie, although there is a good deal of Merriment which Carie is shown creating with her very great talents for making a pleasant home, for music and singing, rhyming, story-telling, and for an outgoing gift for friendship. There's also a rich, almost lyrical descriptiveness in this book. Carie loved life in a \\"sensuous\\" (or down-to-earth) way, according to Pearl, and Pearl is eager to defend the Natural loveliness of her mother against the strictures of the type of religion that would denigrate her for taking joy in the loveliness of earthly life, earthly people, and the beauty of earthly things. (A descendant of artisans who crafted fine furniture and jewelry, Carie had no nice things in her married life except that she once discovered and purchased in China a fine old secondhand table that reminded her of a family table in her distant, longed-for, felicitous, American home. Although Andrew disdained it as unnecessary, the table that Carie cherished and enjoyed served to renew her desperately flagging spirits and to hearten her over many years.)I disagree with Pearl's characterization of Andrew as \\"mystic\\" in his religion. (I guess she may have chosen the term as conveying her father's interest not in things of \\"this world\\" but in matters relating to the \\"other world.\\") His religion was a purely intellectual approach to the Word of God, to Presbyterian doctrines, and to the evangelical work of saving souls. He could be described as \\"passionate\\" about the object of his intellectual religious devotion, but this book makes even more clear than Pearl's book about her father, \\"Fighting Angel,\\" that he gave himself to his missionary vocation entirely out of a sense of Duty. Duty was his passion. It seems to me perhaps that for him there was little sense of the Love relationship with God which is also a factor in religious \\"mysticism\\". Actually, Carie's personality and temperament, although basically practical, appear to have been more typically capable of mysticism, but a deep relationship with God never developed in her because she threw herself so fully into a selfless active life, spontaneously caring for her family and all others in the range of her human capacity for love.Carie's last years, her illness, and then the details surrounding her death do clearly depict the pain and disaffection experienced by Carie in eventual reaction against Andrew's attitudes which Pearl several times characterizes as puritanical. About the last phase of Carie's life, when Carie admits to herself how far apart she and Andrew are, Pearl writes: \\"She had married a man for the stern puritan side of her, but as life had carried her on it was the rich human side of her that had deepened and grown....His somewhat pedantic speech, his slow rare humor, his complete absorption in his task, his inability to face or to understand the practical difficulties in human lives, his own ascetic and rigorous life which held no place for beauty or pleasure, came to repel her, even while she admired his self-control and his exaltation of spirit....She had had visions once of working with him side by side in a comradeship full and invincible....[Once the children were grown and gone,] she plunged with all her old gay vigor into this new period of her life, joyously, never questioning whether Andrew wanted her help or not....She said to herself that surely Andrew would gladly use her strength, as she could use his, each supplementing the other. But she was wrong....[He didn't like her remarks or efforts to share with him spiritually.]... He was imbued, moreover, with the Pauline doctrine of the subjection of the woman to the man and to him it was enough if she kept his house and bore his children and waited on his needs....Through man only could she approach God. So the Scriptures taught....What--was she not to go to God direct because she was born a woman?....It was as though she had come bearing in her two hands her rich gifts of brain and body, giving them freely and as touchingly sure of appreciation as a child--and her gifts had been thrown back at her as useless....she shrank into herself in those days and lived alone in spirit as she never had before in her days of busy motherhood.\\"Carie subdued herself after this realization to an attempt to grow in religious and spiritual devotion, but she was very lonely in the effort. In response to the painful spectacle of her mother's loneliness, Pearl expresses her one single blast of religious rebellion in the book.Carie continued up until she knew she was would soon die to do joyful spiritual and physical ministrations for people. Although she had poured out her life in Christian service to China, she began to wish toward the end that she were able to do more for her own land. She had always loved and revered America longingly from a distance--whence comes the book's title, \\"The Exile\\".Once Carie accepted that her death was imminent, she decided that she would be selfish and do some things to please herself. She said, \\"There are so many things I have not heard of or seen--so many pleasures. Not one of you knows how I love pleasure! I want a victrola. I want to hear music of all the kinds I have not heard.\\" So, her grown-up daughters sent to a far city and got a victrola for her and Carie listened to music by the hour, but to none that was mournful. One daughter brought her mother a new lavender dress that had long been a desirable figment in her imagination. A professional nurse who knew how to lift and care for Carie's weakened body had to be hired and although the nurse turned out to be a worldly, disreputable woman, Carie was kind and made friends with her. Being curious to see dancing, Carie asked the nurse to perform for her the new thing called a fox-trot and commented afterwards: \\"Well, that's a pretty thing--so graceful and light. I should not be surprised if Andrew is all wrong about God. I believe one ought to choose the happy, bright things of life, like dancing and laughter and beauty. I think if I had it to do over again I would choose those instead of thinking them sinful. Who knows?--God might like them.\\"This is a good, delightful book--because it's about Carie, whose personality and character were delightful. For lack of a better metaphor, I'd liken her to condensed sunshine--and she shone on one and all alike. You have to read the book to really appreciate her through Pearl Buck's gifted re-creation of Carie as she alternately shines and flags beneath the weight of the crosses in her life. The detailed account of her last days is particularly moving.The book also offers some vivid glimpses of late 19th and early 20th century missionary life in China.(I feel thankful that Carie and Andrew were given a child who grew up to be an excellent enough writer to tell both their extraordinary, heroic stories so well.)"},{"Title":"The exile","review":"As wonderful as \\"The Good Earth\\" is... was... is..., no dedicated Buck reader should pass up an opportunity to delve into this Poignant biographical work about her mother.I was a young newly wed when first introduced to this novel, and for several days could think of nothing but this book, and the amazing woman upon whose life it was based. Pearl Buck's father was a missionary in China, and she spent several years of her young life there... thus her intimate knowledge of the ways of the Chinese people. Her father was totally dedicated to his life there,and his work of translating the Bible into a Chinese dialect. Her mother Carrie, on the other hand, was dedicated to her children, and trying against all odds, to give them a normal upbringing during a very turbulent time in China's history. Carrie had been born and raised in Hillsboro, WV. (Pearl Bucks birth place) and desperately longed for the stability of her old home place in America. (I believe Bucks novel,\\"Portrait Of A marriage\\" is loosely based on the marriage of Carrie's parents, Pearl Bucks maternal grandparents.)

Thomas Henry Tibbles devoted the later half of his life to fighting the federal bureaucracy which was systematically murdering the remanants of the Ponca Indians. The book tells Mr Tibbles story from his youth as farm child in Ohio and Illinois, his adventures in bleeding Kansas before the civil war, the years he spent with several tribes in Kansas and Nebraska and finally his winning fight to free the Indians from the corrupt reservation system. The story of his time with the Indians is well worth reading. Mostly, this is a great story of a man devoted to a worthwhile cause."},{"Title":"Buckskin & Blanket Days","review":"Thomas Henry Tibbles was 67 years old when he penned these memoirs in 1905; they tell the story of a man very involved with Indian-white relations in the West as well as other \\"reformist\\" issues. Basically a newspaperman most of his life, he began writing for newspapers in Omaha in the 1870s. Before the Civil War, however, he was a close associate of John Brown in Kansas, and relates a story how Brown told him all about his plans to attack the armory at Harpers Ferry and declare Virginia a free state. Tibbles appears to have tried to talk him out of it, obviously to no avail.In 1878, he participated in the famous trial of the Ponca chief Standing Bear in which it was ruled once and for all that Indians were indeed people (some in government thought otherwise and therefore believed Indians were not protected by the law). Moved by the miseries suffered by the Poncas, Tibbles became their unofficial representative, writing frequently about their (and other Indian tribes') plight in various publications. He married an Omaha Indian woman (Bright Eyes) in 1882, continued to do newspaper work as well as farming, and founded various publications in which he promoted his reformist views. He was even nominated VP on the People's Party ticket in 1904. But his memoir doesn't go that far and ends with the disaster at Wounded Knee in 1890. It's an appropriate time to stop, for Tibbles was primarily concerned with his dealings with the Indians throughout the book.Tibbles's writing is strong and objective; his years writing for newspapers and magazines obviously show in this autobiography. He employs a good deal of dialogue, and all of it is effective. After years of living among the Indians, listening to their stories, observing and participating in their customs and ways, it's clear from his tone that he is not overawed by them or fearful or distrustful: he sees the Indians as equals and worthy of anyone's respect. The book is excellent and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rasputin The Holy Devil","review":"This study of the \\"starets\\" Rasputin is both cinematic and visceral. The reader is shocked by the pre and post coital scents that linger in his shabby rooms, unwashed linens and unwashed body to which the fanciest women were drawn. He had an animal-like hunger for sex, food and drink. He consumed huge plates of fish and was often drunk and not in the condition to respond to the Imperial call for his company. His notorious debauchery was transformed into a religious event by the respectable ladies who even gave their daughters to the sacramental ecstasy. These women and many men as well gave money as well as their bodies to this Siberian giant, wearing soiled clothes, with hair and beard atrociously unkempt.There is little doubt that Rasputin had some superior powers, be they demonic as history has suggested or from some other plane, his ability to mesmerize and predict is too universally aclaimed to have been untrue. His reputed miracles of healing with the suffering Tsarevitch are well documented for their medical as well as political implications. And Miller's study, closely lifted from many primary sources, substantiates the claim of influence he had over the foreign and domestic policies of the Tsar. The picture of the anguished Romanov, Nicholas, and his unpopular foreign wife; suggests more that their historical doom was as much a feature of their own misfortunes and personal failures as they were from exploitation from the holy father. It was true however, that the weak Nicholas did listen to the advice of the peasant who was so despised by police and royals alike. However the author points out that Rasputin often gave good advice despite the opinions published in the underground pamphlets that circulated throughout Moscow. Miller published this book in 1929 while there were still many living witnesses to refute the misinformation that was disseminated by the Bolsheviks. He researched diaries, publications and police reports as well. Rasputin spoke in defense of the Jews and impacted decisions to halt pogroms. He was the voice of the peasant to a Tsar who was otherwise deaf by virtue of distance not lack of compassion. And it was Rasputin who denounced Russian involvement in the fatal World War, about which he had projected great suffering upon the land. That foreboding we know became horrifyingly true.Rasputin was indeed a remarkably craven figure, lustful and drunken, but not, we discover, alone in his sin. He was the subject of several murderous plots and hated most vehemently by a religious power figure, Iliodore, who had been displaced in his position with the royal family. If Rasputin were from fiction, where he seems to belong, there would be some way to decide about the true nature of his soul, but this is life filtered through time and so we will likely continue to remain unsure. I recommend this book as a clear and relatively unsubjective account of the times. It certainly is superior to Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra."},{"Title":"Rasputin The Holy Devil","review":"A good book to discern what are the facts versus the drama-hype. I purchased this for a scholarly project and enjoyed it immensely. Of special interest was the detail on the Russian Khlysty mystic sect. This book left me believing that Grigori Rasputin was probably less psychic than hypnotic, but certainly fascinating. Holy? I'm still out on that one. If it had been a fakery, it was a good schtick that gave him great power, riches and fame. If it was real, it really makes one wonder if we've got our traditional ideas of God all wrong.Rasputin's legendary power over women made sense in context of the times, as the Russian women of all classes believed what they did with him was \\"holy,\\" and they were otherwise culturally quite sexually repressed. Husbands even approved. The Khlystys believed one had to know sin to be free of it--an interesting perspective that caused great scandal, but explains a lot as to his social behavior.The details of Rasputin's death are less dramatized than where I've read elsewhere. There is nothing of his penis being cut off, nothing of his body sitting up in the funeral pyre. For me, this just solidified that author Fulop-Miller was sticking to the facts only. I liked that Fulop-Miller refused to write the book from anything but actual state records, diary entries, letters, and things that he could verify. This is why I chose a book written in the 1920s over one that's been colored with all the legend and mystery. After all, this book was written just a decade after his death!\\"Rasputin The Holy Devil\\" stops just before the exile and execution of the Romanovs. To me, it ended on a surprisingly beautiful note, with the Empress and little Alexei looking over the tulips on the steppes of Siberia from their train car, as the Empress quietly pondered Rasputin's words of their fate.I can find little about author Rene Fulop-Miller, and that's going to be my next academic tangent, as he has written a great deal on subjects that interest me."},{"Title":"Rasputin The Holy Devil","review":"This story on Rasputin is a recommended read for those who like history. It is inconceivable how such a mysterious character can come from peasant stock yet be known and respected as an Emperor. In the beginning of the story, a stranger comes from Siberia and has the ability to cure the sick of their maladies. This news reaches the Emperor, who has a handicap son. Thus, begins his life in high society. The biggest challenge was Rasputin always clashed with members of this upper echelon. I can not imagine such a holy man existing now in Washington, or London, or even the EU. It could happen but it has not yet been publicised. His reputation for being a womanizer and drinker catches up with him. Yet he was so shameless about it, even spilling state secrets in moments of drunkenness. This all led to his expected murder by members of the court. Rasputin was mysterious from where he came and the book ends with the fulfillment of his prophecy which compliments this real life mystery."},{"Title":"Rasputin The Holy Devil","review":"Unfortunately, having done a lot of research on the subject, I find that this book only furthers the gossip and myths surrounding Rasputin, rather than expounding on the less sensationalist reality of his life."},{"Title":"Rasputin The Holy Devil","review":"It would be hard to give a full and satisfactory account of the life of Rasputin. His exploits -- from duping the Romanov family into thinking he had magic powers, to holding marathon orgies -- were astonishing in their breadth and weirdness. This book, whose title is taken from an anti-Rasputin pamphlet published near the end of his life, does as good a job as any of explaining who he was and where he came from.

Moments before General Smith arrives, a man identifying himself as Dr. Bush warns the boys to beware of General Smith. Shortly thereafter a woman calls to warn the boys about Dr. Bush. While the boys are discussing the phone calls a person calling himself General Smith shows up at the Hardy home. The boys are concerned about General Smith's animated behavior and act strangely themselves. The boys' behavior becomes more bizarre when Dr. Bush calls again and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton rush off to see if they can intercept Dr. Bush. After Joe and Chet return, the tension between the boys and General Smith threatens to erupt when Fenton Hardy arrives and greets General Smith as an old friend.Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton have become involved in a Smith family mystery that dates back to the Civil War. Beauregard Smith, a cousin of General Smith's great-grandfather, promised to bury his gold and the local bank's gold if enemy troops got too close. Three generations of Smiths have unsuccessfully attempted to discover the hiding place of the gold. General Smith asks Fenton Hardy to take on the case. However, Fenton has other commitments and sends Frank, Joe and Chet to begin the investigation.The boys and General Smith follow a series of clues, hoping that the clues will eventually lead them to the treasure. The boys soon encounter mysterious Professor Randolph and other suspicious characters, including Junior, Hank and Smiley, who may also be searching for the treasure. As the search for the treasure progresses the danger increases. Frank and Joe are kidnapped, Chet is ambushed and someone shoots at the boys in one of the most exciting and interesting Hardy Boys books to this point in the series.The first 29 Hardy Boys books have been a bumpy ride in quality. However, this book fulfills the promise of the teaser and is a thrilling book that even many teens might enjoy.The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. However, this book in the series contains many interesting moments and will keep most readers guessing the answers to the mysteries until the author reveals the final solution."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Lost Tunnel (Hardy Boys, Book 29)","review":"This review concerns the original 1950 edition. Frank, Joe and Chet travel to the southern U.S. to help a retired general find a fortune lost during the civil war. This was a really good book; it was well written and had a lot of action. Two things that I liked about this book were that unlike some books where Frank and Joe have little contact with the criminals until the last chapters, in this book they were constantly running into the crooks, also, there was actually a mystery to solve in this book (the location of the treasure), instead of some other volumes where Frank and Joe are merely trying to capture a certain gang.

With a name like \\"The Incredible Journey\\", you would assume that the animals got somewhere. The reality is that they got lost and had to have the humans find them. The author had to deal with a disadvantage in writing this story as the animals can not talk.

Seriously."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"Thanks to two major motion pictures this story, The Incredible Journey, is pretty well known, but while the movies are well known, many younger kids do not realize that the movies actually began as a book; this book. As much as I hate to admit it, the movies were actually rather well done and I have to admit to having enjoyed both of them. But as I am old I still enjoy the written word more than I enjoy the silver screen. (Sigh, I fear I may be a dying breed). Anyway, I first read this book to my children when they were small and I enjoyed the book then and found, after a recent reread, that the book has lost none of its charm over the years.This work was first published around 1960 or 1961. It has become what is considered a children's classic. Interestingly enough, Sheila Burnford had not originally written this work for young people, but rather as an adult novel. We have so many \\"cross over\\" books now days though that it makes little difference as to who the original targeted market was for.This is the story of three animals, an older dog, a young dog and a cat that has been separated from their beloved home and begins their incredible journey to find the place and family they love. They cross miles and miles of Canadian wilderness and for the most part, survive on their own. When I first read this work I questioned whether or not animals such as this, in particular the cat/dog combination would actually, in real life cooperate such as these animals did. I have learned a lot since that time and have come to the conclusion that, under the proper circumstances, yes they could indeed. About 25 years ago we had a dog/cat combination that hunted moles together and were quite effective. We have two Boston Terriers at present that make a wonderful little hunting team as they ravage our brush piles for rodents.As one or two reviewers have already pointed out, the author has given us a rather sophisticated text here; her writing skills are wonderful. Yet at the same time she has written this story in a form that can be read and understood by the younger reader, and further more, she has done this without having dumed down the text as we so often see in some of the current work being published.I must admit that at first I was dismayed at the negative reviews this work has received; particularly from apparently younger readers. Many of these reviews seem to have been written by kids who were \\"forced\\" to read this work as part of their schooling. This is always a problem and is one reason I always hate it when a book is deemed a \\"classic.\\" Also, reading between the lines on some of these reviews it is apparent that since nothing is blown-up in this work and there is no screen or buttons attached, it holds little interest for them. This is sad, but hey, I was not overly fond of being \\"forced\\" to read books at that age either but thank goodness I was. As I have grown old I have discovered that those mean old teachers were actually right in most cases! Go figure.This is an excellent read, particularly for those who love a good animal story. It has aged rather well and is just as good now as when it was first published.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"This book and the associated Disney movie was the talk of my elementary school.

They were dropped off at a farm to be taken care of when their master was gone. They wanted to go back home so they escaped from the farm and left to go out on an adventurous journey home.

I just cant seem to like it."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"Sheila Burnford's story of three beloved family pets (a Labrador retriever, bull terrier and Siamese cat) who make a cross-country trek across Canadian wilderness to reach their home has an undeniable appeal for animal lovers. The book is written in a realistic style without anthropomorphic overtones, and each animal's personality is developed in line with the characteristics of its breed.For parents who wish to cultivate a biblical view of humans stewarding the environment in line with the Creator's dominion mandate given in Genesis 1:28, this story holds a particular appeal. Rather than being coequal with humans or returning to some ideal state of nature during their journeys, these pets are thoroughly domesticated. They brave the wilderness only to return to the family to which they are loyal and beloved. Furthermore, at each point when the animals' adventures take them beyond their ability to cope, they find help from kind humans that cross their path and so are able to continue.It is not only in the pets' relationship with humans that Burnford's view of dominion is revealed. In chapter six the author describes a Finnish family who lead livesas frugal and orderly as the fields they had wrested from the wilderness. They had tamed the bush, and in return it yielded them their food and their scant living from trap lines and a wood lot, but the struggle to keep it in subjection was endless.This positive description of people subduing their environment for the benefit of their family (while extending benevolent help to the obviously needy cat who crosses their path) is clearly in line with the biblical mandate to rule over creation and care for it on behalf of its Creator.One flaw of this book is an encounter the animals have in chapter four with a group of Ojibwe. In this scene, the white dog and his companion cat become omen-bearers to the tribal people, fulfilling a traditional legend which seems to be entirely made up. This is an unfortunate plot feature, like being kidnapped by gypsies, that often appears in literature of this era, but the final paragraph in chapter four, in which the \\"legend\\" is described, can be skipped without doing great harm to the story.Burnford's writing style is magnificent, and her precise use of uncommon vocabulary makes the book best suited for confident readers, although if read aloud with interpretive help from adults it can be appreciated by younger listeners.

There is captivating action and very good development of the animals' \\"personalities.\\" There are 12 or 13 illustrations in my edition (the one pictured here), all set at the beginning of the chapters and providing a little foreshadowing. I'm a good one for reading a couple of chapters, showing the next illustration, and then closing the book until next time.It's summer, so I had the kids keep a vocabulary list -- this book uses beautiful language, and the repetition of some adjectives and verbs makes it a little better for young readers -- they see the same words once or twice in a book, they learn them better. I also had the talker-child illustrate some scenes for us, and the tinkering-child write up some sentences each day. Etc.

I like it because it has lots of adventure and lots of different points of view. The beginning is pretty boring but gets exiting soon, like around the setting change. The things I don't like are the excessive phone-talk, and I-know-what-will-happen-feeling that it gives you. Overall I would rate it between Harry Potter and your barely-better-than-average book that you will find. The fun of it is that you never know the detailed parts outcome which has great effect in this book. I think it is very original to make the characters split up for some time and rejoin the others. I like the lazy feeling that I'm not interested. See you later -- don't care about friendship. These parts are very amusing. It may sound predictable of the ending but it is so exiting that you never consider thinking of a different part of the book because it's so addicting.

I recomend it for people ages 10 and up."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"A classic children's book - or is it? Sheila Burnford (1918-84) has said she never wrote it to be a children's book, and indeed it's written in a very realistic manner - no talking animals here. The main theme is loyalty - pet loyalty to their masters, to one another, and human loyalty to animals. It's all very saccharin sweet. A more believable story would have shown the animals internal struggle between returning to the wild (going feral), versus the safety and comforts of remaining captive under human care (one of the great themes of literature). Alas, Burnford is not that kind of writer, and anyway Jack London did it best inThe Call of the Wild. Interestingly though, Burnford did adopt London's technique of describing the dogs actions and mannerisms as a third party observer, and not delve into the animals thoughts (such as inBlack Beauty). The more I think about it, the more London's influence seems apparent, Burnford is sort of like London's better half (who was somewhat dark). For what it is, the story is appealing, love conquers all, it was Burnford's most famous work and spawned at least 2 well known movie adaptations."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"Did you ever have pets that try to go to their own home.

The wheat-colored Siamese and Labrador tried to get him up but he wouldn't move. When' a bear cub attacked him the Siamese and Labrador attacked the cub. After a few days he got up and moved on. Later the cat fell down a waterfall but is okay that was a sad part. I liked it when the Labrador tried to save the Siamese because he cared about him. When he left a girl who found him he was okay.

The animals are supposedly not his and they go out searching for their original owners. I would not recommend this book to any human beings alive. This book is very boring."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"The Incredible Journey tells the story of three animal companions - a young Labrador Retriever, an aging Bull Terrier, and a feisty Siamese cat - who embark on a dangerous journey home through the Canadian wilderness. They had been staying with a family friend while their real owners were temporarily residing in Europe, but they lit out for home on their own after their current keeper left for vacation. The plan was for the couple who took care of the house to look after the pets, but fate conspired to make them think Mr. Longridge had taken the animals with him. Thus, as the animals made their way west toward their old home, no one at all knew they were missing.Sheila Burnford's narrative is surprisingly realistic. Animals can't survive for weeks without food, and the only food available in the Canadian forests in early autumn is other animals. The cat is especially good at snaring warm snacks, and the Lab is capable of chasing something down from time to time - and luckily, both are willing to share with the old Bull Terrier whose age is catching up with him. It's a little sad to read about the demise of so many birds and rodents, but this book describes the animals' captures and kills rather straightforwardly. Of course, the trio also benefits from a few encounters with humans (although the Bull Terrier learns that his charms don't always win over the person on the other side of the door). These make for some emotional passages of their own, but the trio only stay in one place long enough to refresh and recover themselves.The woods hold many dangers, which the animals could never survive on their own. Indeed, each one of them suffers trials that threaten to end their journey altogether, and the friends are also separated at times. Whatever happens, though, the drive of the young Lab as he leads his friends ever westward toward his image of home overrides individual pains and fears. The commitment and bravery the animals show toward one another in the face of several very real threats is inspiring and heart-warming.If you love pets or animals in general, this is a really emotional story - not only the ending, but several sections throughout the whole book. The friendship and teamwork of these three very different animals is touching and wonderful to watch and experience. The Incredible Journey is nothing less than a classic that all animal lovers should have in their personal library."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"The Incredible Journey is mandatory reading for all kids and pet lovers. The book is on equal par with other classic animal tales such as Sounder and Old Yeller. It has a good combination of exciting action and emotionally-charged drama. Many young readers will be moved to both tears and cheers.Through a series of mishaps, a trio of pets--a Labrador retriever, bull terrier, and Siamese cat--are left stranded in a cabin over two hundred miles from home. These three anthropomorphic characters assume the responsibility of saving themselves by journeying home by instinct and foot. What follows is a fantastic series of challenges and accomplishments. Their trek leads them through the north woods where they face wild predators, the elements, starvation, and incomprehensible distance. Along the way they learn lessons of love, loyalty, and perseverance. Wonderfully entertaining. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"The book I read is a Weekly Reader Book, hardcover, with a copyright 1960, 1961 with the cover illustration copyright of 1986.

Also she had a hard time keeping straight which dog was which but she did enjoy the book very much.The last chapter is the best and I almost cried when two of the animals found their owners and then again when the old dog was reunited with his owner after everyone thought he did not survive The Incredible Journey.I would like to know if this was any way based on a true story. You will enjoy this book very much but it is not a casual read."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"Have you ever heard of 2 dogs and a cat traveling through the Canadian Wilderness.

This is an awesome book because there is adventure, excitement and the book will make you want to keep reading it. In the book there is a fight with a mother bear and her cub. The animals also meet Indians. The Incredible Journey is even better than Hatchet.The book had no awards. I think that's wrong. I have no suggestions for improving this book.

The owner left them home and had somebody look after them . The person showed up late and the animals went to find their owner. The animals have to deal with wild animals like bears and porcupines. They also nearly starve while trying to be with their owner at the river. All in all, I think you should read this well-written book. You will find out how much animals love people and it teaches us to work together. There is so much more in this book. So, if you like suspense this is a great book to read!"},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"Our names are Amiee and Nicole and we are from North Broward Preparatory School. We read the book,The Incredible Journey for an English Project. It was a good book. The beginning of the book was little boring. Other than that, it was pretty exciting.

When he finally does the dam breaks and Luath and Tao are swept away. They meet many other exciting dangers that I'll let you read about.My favorite character was Bodger because he was the funniest.I would recommend this book to 8-12 yr. olds because of challenging vocabulary. I would also recommend this to animal lovers and adventure readers."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"The Incredible Journey is a great and heartwarming book. It is about three animals (an old Bull Terrier, a young Labrador retriever, and a feisty Siamese cat) who set out to find their master and family. It was a dangerous but wonderful journey. This book made me feel like I was actually there in the Canadian wilderness. I think anyone who loves animals and adventure would like this book.This long journey through the Canadian wilderness was dangerous. The three animals encounter many obstacles. While in the wilderness the terrier heard some wrestling in the leaves. When he turned around he saw a baby black bear. He was not afraid until the bear started to tackle him. The bear's sharp claws made deep wounds in the side of the old dogs shoulder. When the Labrador heard the fighting he came from behind the bear to help the terrier. The Labrador started to growl at the baby bear and then the bear left. The cat also encountered danger. He was chased by a Lynx who seemed very hungry and looking for food. The Lynx almost captured the cat until the cat found a small burrow and hid from the Lynx. The Lynx was too big for the burrow and after many attempts to get the cat he did not succeed. While the Lynx was making this noise to get the cat a young boy who was hunting with his father shot the Lynx because he thought the Lynx was going to eat him. While the Labrador was hunting he found a porcupine and went to go eat it but the porcupine was to fast and shot some quills at the lab's cheek. As a result the lab caught an infection. Through all these obstacles the animals survived because they stayed together and watched out for each other.The wonderful part of the book was the companionship of the animals and their love for each other. They seemed to have human like qualities. The Labrador helped the cat and dog across a river, the animals shared food, and comforted each other. They made sure that they would all end the journey together.The animals also encountered many people along their journey. Some people did not help the animals like the farmer whose dog attacked the Labrador and the old terrier. Mackenzie and Nell were farmers who helped the dogs. Mackenzie took the quills out of the Labradors face, cleaned out the infection and gave him soft food to eat. They also gave the terrier food and milk to fatten him up because his ribs where showing under his fur.This book was truly an inspiration. I would recommend The Incredible Journey to anyone over ten years old. The book has many adjectives and hard words which made it difficult to read sometimes. I hope if my animals ever went on a journey they would stay together and come back home.- Samantha- LA- 6"},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"I first saw this movie on Disney when I was about 9. Recently, over 20 years later, I was in Half Price Books and spotted the book so I bought it. I was intending to give it to my 10-year-old niece, but then I started reading it. I had tears in my eyes. It was so inspiring.This book is very symbolic of the Christian walk--through the wilderness, into the \\"Promised Land\\". We all need each other--nobody is an island. We cannot go it alone. Like the animals in this book. They stay together and help each other all along the way. You can learn so much from this book!"},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"I just finished reading aloud this book with my 11 year old son and we both loved it and found it an absolutely delightful story. My husband overheard us reading it aloud and was also immediately hooked on the story.I am dismayed to read so many negative reviews on this book and suspect, after reading their comments, that a number of them were written by children who may not appreciate good literature and may possibly have been required to read it (oh the horror!!). Some of these reviews are simply ridiculous and I wish amazon would better screen some of the obvious frivolity as it is unfair to the book and to those of us who read the reviews with expectations of serious and well thought input from others.This book was copyrighted in 1960 and is a great example of timeless literature with an enduring story. It is full of beautiful writing and extraordinary vocabulary -- a number of words new to me, and as well to my 11 year old, which increases the value of the book for educational purposes. The writing style is sophisticated, not \\"dumbed down\\" which I find most welcome, and rare among much of the more recent/modern literature put out for children. Though, I'm not sure if this book was originally intended as a children's book or not, perhaps just a good story for all to enjoy.The author's obvious intimacy with the world of dogs and cats, their idiosyncrasies and endearing traits, was charming and well communicated throughout the story. We laughed at the incredibly accurate descriptions of \\"cat\\" behavior and delighted in the personalities she created that seemed so authentic. This is a well told, well written story that brings a smile to your heart."},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"I was reThe Incredible Journeyminded of this little treasure when a patron asked me to help identify a movie that she had seen a child. Since she was a little younger than me, I was the most likely candidate to solve the mystery. The movie turned out to be \\"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey.\\" It turns out that this cute movie was actually based on the book The Incredible Journey by Sheila Burnsford which was originally written in 1960. The book was based on a true story.Three household pets - a young Labrador named Luath, a Siamese Cat named Tao, and a senior Bull Terrier named Bodger - misunderstand their family's intentions when they are left behind with a friend during a vacation. So they set out together to find their family, crossing 200 miles of Canadian wilderness.*While this may sound like a boring story, the interactions that accompany the story, and the journey the animals take, are the key. Who could possibly expect that a Bull Terrier and a Siamese Cat could be the best of friends because they share the same loathing of other cats? I can imagine these three sticking together, through the best and worst of their journey, to make their way home to their family. Even though I doubt it could ever happen again, I think Burnsford would be the best to write about it. Her descriptions of the surroundings and the animals' mannerisms are so vibrant that I could actually imagine watching it play out before me even before I saw the film.If you like feel-good, happy books, this is your ticket. I truly enjoyed the very relaxed nature of the book and like to re-read it when I need a pick-me-up.

It is the best suspense book, too. I think Sheila Burnford is the best descriptive writer I've ever read.This book is about two dogs and a cat . They have to go two hundred and thirty miles to find their owner at a river canoeing . The owner left them home and had somebody look after them . The person showed up late and the animals went to find their owner. The animals have to deal with wild animals like bears and porcupines. They also nearly starve while trying to be with their owner at the river. All in all, I think you should read this well-written book. You will find out how much animals love people and it teaches us to work together. There is so much more in this book. So, if you like suspense this is a great book to read!"},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","review":"This book is about 2 dogs and a cat that set out to find their master and human family.I was impressed with their instincts for survival and loyalty to their family.

Marshall Cartwright sells a pint of his 'type O negative' blood (sounds like a band name or something, doesn't it?) to a blood bank for a fifty dollar bounty. Later, his blood is given to a dying eighty year old billionaire, Leroy Weaver, who not only miraculously makes a full recovery but loses years in a matter of hours until he appears to be in his twenties. Much to everybody's chagrin the change is temporary and Weaver is back to his original state in forty days (enough time for the donated blood to wash out of the body). Weaver's doctor, Dr. Russell Pearce, figures out what happened and traced the blood back to the transient Cartwright, whom he figures out to be immortal.Thus begins the greatest manhunt in the history of the world. A foundation is set up by the world's wealthiest and most influential elders, lasting almost a century, whose main task is to track down Cartwright and or his descendants, with a secondary purpose of funding research for the synthesis of Cartwright's blood globulin.The Immortals was written in the fifties and has been updated with the twenty-first century technology. The story covers a period in excess of a hundred years in five parts. It sometimes seems disjointed and that may be because the book is an assemblage of related short stories that the author, James, over fifty years ago.Overall I found the book a little hard to follow, especially Part IV \\"The Medic\\" which was fairly confusing at first. The novel purports a future in which the medical establishment effectively takes over the economy of the world, sometimes in direct conflict with established and renegade governments. With each succeeding part, the world degenerates more into a Mad Max style anarchy, with roving gangs and marauders, street wise poor, fortified estates for the elite and local governments, (sometimes the same thing) and lastly the Citadel like Hospitals, sometimes covering several square miles in area, usually within the most dangerous urban areas.There are some even more gruesome parts like when someone defaults on a prohibitively expensive Health Contract, they are taken into custody and put on life support and kept alive in a harvesting warehouse, where their bodies are harvested for body parts. Also, their seems to be two types of roving gangs - head hunters which kill and take heads for a bounty or body snatchers, (my term) where they capture humans alive to use for body parts for an even larger bounty.ConclusionThis book certainly paints a dreary picture for the future. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the inspiration for doomsday movies like the aforementioned Mad Max/Road Warrior, A boy and his Dog, The Postman and Waterworld.We never get to meet the Immortal Marshall Cartwright but we do get to meet three of his female descendants. The protagonist of the story seems to be Dr. Russell Pearce, who keeps popping up throughout the book. I like the fact that the book was updated and had things like DNA and computers that weren't really around in 1955.The book consists of 301 pages of fairly large type of which I estimate less than eighty thousand words, so it is a pretty quick read. I picked up this book because it was written by James Gunn who had also authored one of my favorite sci-fi books \\"The Joy Makers\\". I don't think \\"The Immortals\\" compares that well with \\"The Joy Makers\\" but it does have some very interesting aspects and is well worth a quick read, despite some confusing parts.Final rating 3.6 stars"},{"Title":"THE IMMORTALS","review":"Like most people, I first became aware of James Gunn's &quot;The Immortals&quot; through the old TV series, &quot;The Immortal.&quot; When I found the book (a collection of short stories written in the 1950's), I noticed that while the TV pilot episode followed the first tale fairly closely, none of the material in the other stories (set in a medical dystopia unfolding over the next 150 years) was used. Not only that, but Gunn did not focus on the immortals at all in his stories, but on the rich who wanted to use their blood to gain immortality, and on those in the medical profession who either fought it or went along with it. Marshall Cartwright, the first of the immortals, probably had fewer than a half-dozen lines in all of Gunn's stories, and is only a shadowy presence in the last of them. In a way, this leaves the reader somewhat unsatisfied. We want a detailed interview with these fascinating people and their view on the unfolding of history. But, Gunn saw them as ordinary people who just happened to live a long time, people who were hunted down and ultimately used to provide life for those with the most money"},{"Title":"THE IMMORTALS","review":"James Gunn's book from the 50's is amazingly rescued in the 21st century by the author, himself. Subtle changes from the original don't keep me from enjoying this book.I wish I had been able to find it years ago."},{"Title":"THE IMMORTALS","review":"An emergency blood transfusion from a nameless donor results in bodily rejuvenation and immortality. The donor and his progeny go underground while a syndicate funded by malevolent oldsters attempts to locate the supply of blood.Author Gunn's crisp writing style, reasonably believable subject matter and attention to character development resurrects this book from premature obscurity.This novel, first published in 1962, consists of four related stories fixed-up as a novel. The titles of the stories are, in the order published, \\"New Blood\\", \\"Donor\\", \\"Medic\\" and \\"Immortal\\".This was a noteworthy novel in its time. It was the source for an \\"ABC Movie of The Week\\" in 1969 and a 1970 television series \\"The Immortal\\"."},{"Title":"THE IMMORTALS","review":"The Immortals can be dropped into a lot of latter-day categories of literature: realistic fiction, science fiction, speculative fiction, future imperfect, allegorical fiction, the list can potentially go on for pages. Personally I've found that the style exhibited in The Immortals falls neatly into the Adventure Fiction genre that was especially prevalent in the 50s straight through to the 70s.Before I go on I should tell you that there are a lot of amazing ideas in The Immortals' well-devised and very thoroughly-constructed universe, and in a few instances Mr. Gunn anticipated technology in the 50s and 60s that would actually exist and be quite prevalent in some of his stories' then-futuristic settings. The Immortals is an incredibly impressive piece of speculative fiction... but it's also a creature of its times.If you've ever found yourself struggling to read another title from 40+ years ago you'll know what I mean. For his part James Gunn manages to avoid a lot of the pitfalls of writing a book about the future from an already aging perspective, but every so often something will slip in (antiquated turns of phrase like \\"don't flip your wig\\" or \\"that's a gas\\"). This probably couldn't be helped, but little glimpses of the past like that in otherwise timeless stories are distracting.If I'm parsing old expressions and thinking about when the story was written that I'm obviously not absorbed into that story, and unfortunately The Immortals contained just enough of these mental detours that I found myself distracted from its amazing ideas. It's a great set of stories, but it's just not for me."},{"Title":"A Dolphin Day in Hawaii","review":"A Dolphin Day in Hawaii is a delightful story about a bear who, on one of his free days surfing, meets a playful dolphin and has a day of adventures exploring both the ocean and land.

It begins with a chapter on how to become a Christian, and ends with a chapter on how to become a Presbyterian. In between is a well done description on what the Presbyterian Church is all about. There is an excellent history section. The doctrines are explained through the church's symbol or seal, and are well connected with the Bible and the Book of Confessions. There is also a wealth of material about the worship and ministry of the Presbyterian Church."},{"Title":"The Presbyterian Church Welcomes You: A Handbook for Church Members and Inquirers","review":"This is a wonderful resource! At our church we give this as a gift to all new members. It provides them with not only a quick summary of historical and theological nuts and bolts in the PCUSA, but answers a lot of questions folks from other denominations have regarding worship, marriage, and structures in our churches. A lot of new members page through and say, \\"Oh, I have always wanted to know that!\\" From understanding what Presbyterian Disaster Assistance is, to One Great Hour of Sharing, to the Presbyterian News Service, this is a shmorgasboard of good information. Two drawbacks...there is no index or table of contents."},{"Title":"Smouldering Fires","review":"his book covers some of the territory the author covered in her best selling novel, \\"Green Darkness\\", that of past lives. The trouble is that the author is unable to capture the magic inherent in her best seller. While this well researched book is of some interest, due to its subject matter, there the similarities stop. Those who have read the other will be somewhat disappointed with this readable, though somewhat tepid, fare.Here the book revolves around a young New Englander, Amy Delatour, a teenage girl of French Acadian-English lineage, who often goes into a fugue stage where she believes she is a tormented soul named Ange-Marie, a French Acadian in exile in eighteenth century Connecticut who had been separated from her beloved husband, Paul. The shy and bookish Amy lives in a state of anguish and uncertainty, until one of her high school teachers, Martin Stone, takes an interest in this unusual, highly intelligent young woman. Together they will try to get at the bottom of her mysterious dream states and her fire phobia.The novel starts out promisingly enough, but it never quite reaches its promise. It has a feel of needing to be further fleshed out. While parts of the book are quite interesting, the reader feels as if one where given a delicious appetizer to tempt the palate, only to find that the main course is not forthcoming. Still, there is enough in this novel to make for a pleasant read. Those who have an interest in past lives regression will surely find this book to be of interest."},{"Title":"Puerto Rico 2006 Calendar","review":"Puerto Rico is very beautiful and the pictures you will find in this calender are worth seeing and having in your own home, the 2006 Calender pictures are very nice and detailed, and there huge too!

Usually the answer lies somewhere in the middle. The best translations aim to be true to the spirit without violating the letter more than necessary.David Young, a poet himself, hopes to be true to the spirit of the five poets from the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-906) while at the same time trying to create poetry in a different language and period. The impulse that lies behind his book is to rescue the poets \\"from the often wooden and dogged versions of the scholars\\" and to recreate the beauty and dignity of the poetry in a language used by an American poet at the end of the 20th century. The results are marvelously readable, beautiful translations that I enjoyed more than any other translations of Chinese poetry I have read before or since.Preceding the translations, Young has written a short introduction to each of the poets. These include a discussion of the special qualities of the poets' works and a selection of recommended translations by other English authors.The five poets represented in this book are (1) Wang Wei, a devout Buddhist and the Chinese poet of landscape par excellence who wrote poems of a deeply religious sensibility; (2) Li Po, the Chinese archetype of the \\"bohemian artist and puckish wanderer,\\" a poet beloved for his Taoist unconventionality; (3) Tu Fu, China's greatest poet according to a widely held view because of his technical brilliance and \\"vigorous poetry that manages to transcend unhappiness and melancholy by its enormous range and immense humanity\\"; (4) Li Ho, a poet usually not ranked with the Big Three because he is too innovative and defies classification; and (5) Li Shang-yin, who has a reputation as a decadent versifier but, as Young shows, is a \\"human and humane artist who feels deeply and sees deeply into mysteries of our common existence.\\"One of my favorite poems in this collection is \\"Returning to my cottage.\\" It is a good example of Wang Wei's ability to capture stillness and movement in a landscape, to balance observations of things distant and close by, and to create from these images an atmosphere of serenity tinged with sadness. It is a good example for David Young's style of translation, too:A bell in the distancethe sound floatsdown the valleyone by onewoodcutters and fishermenstop work, start homethe mountains move offinto darknessalone, I turn homeas great clouds beckonfrom the horizonthe wind stirs delicate vinesand water chestnut shootscatkin fluff sails pastin the marsh to the eastnew growthvibrates with colorit's sadto walk in the houseand shut the door.Bottom line: This is one of the few anthologies of classical Chinese poetry in which the English versions of the poems really sound like poetry. There is nothing of the stiff formality and awkwardness of most other translations that disable the lyric voice of the verses. These translations are full of the beauty and dignity of the Chinese originals."},{"Title":"Five T'ang Poets","review":"My best friend in this world (outside of my wonderful family) is a guy that I only get to see every few years. He's like the wind. He blows in and out of my life. But he's always in my heart. We are poets.Being a poet is not a choice. It is a life sentence.My friend and I are dissimilar in so many ways that it is remarkable that we don't break out in a fight the instant we come into each other's presence. Yet...and yet...Hearts touched by the flame always find warmth in good company.Imagine my joy then, at finding a new brother (one from over a thousand years ago) when I picked up this book and met Li Po.I won't bother you much longer with my words.

In reading many translations, you won't find many as clear and right."},{"Title":"Five T'ang Poets","review":"This is THE book of translated Chinese poems which opened my eyes to the art of poetry.

Tu Fu is sad and poinant, talking about the scenes of war. Li Po talks of drinking and intoxication in a way that seems that it is a way of lifeYoung translates in a free verse form using simple words and goes for the feeling of the poem. The poems are not 100 % literal translations but they are jems. I feel like I am having some of my chinese friends translating a poem for me and they say this is the best I can do you will have to read Chinese to fully understand the poem completely. Young takes us as far as one can go in our language. He took on a difficult task to bring these poems so simple in language and so complex in context and emotion to life, Young has done an excellent job with the tool of the English language"},{"Title":"Five T'ang Poets","review":"I rarely read poetry, but there's something terribly appealing about an ancient culture where bureaucrats routinely wrote poems. And so I occasionally buy books like this one. The five poets sampled here wrote in the eighth and ninth century, the richest period of Chinese poetry.I liked everything about the book, from the engaging preface to the last poignant verse. Translator David Young starts out by sharing his creative process with us. He's a poet himself, on a mission to save his T'ang poets from the wooden translations of dry scholars. And amazingly, he's contrived to render the poems without footnotes!Young carefully selects the poems he wants us to enjoy, writing a mini-introduction to the works of each poet. Here he succinctly sums up the poetic personality of the writer, his preoccupations and events that influenced his style.I was delighted with Wang Wei, the devout painter-poet wandering in a vast wild landscape, finally kneeling by a lake...meditatingto chase awaythe poison dragon of emotionLi Po I found witty and winsome, inviting the moon to be his drinking companion.Tu Fu charmed me with his candor:I wanted my picture to hangin the hall of fame, the Unicorn Gallerynow in old ageI waddle with the ducks and snowy heronsAnd I was intrigued by the lives and methods of Li Ho, young poet of extremes, and Li Shang-Yin, clever wielder of allusion.With this captivating collection, David Young has inspired me to read more T'ang poetry."},{"Title":"Five T'ang Poets","review":"I mean here are these guys living in the 8th century (western) who are as erudite and insightful as any poets to follow.

And there is nothing worse for a woman being ugly. So one day arrives Giorgio, a handsome officer, who just left his lover, a married woman back in Milan. To Fosca is love at first sight, but for Giorgo is not. He tries to be kind because she is ill. But her desperate love is more than he can endure.The PASSION she feels for him is agressive even in the physical sense of the word. Fosca wants him so desperately that you can do nothing but understand her and also feel what she feels. Unrequited love here is a powerful force out of control.The darkness in his relation with Fosca has its reverse with the clarity in his relation with Clara. She is beautiful, sensual. The &quot;usual&quot; object for a man's affection. But through the novel this oposition is changing in a subtile way. Because finally what Fosca offers is pure love. With total surrender, yes, but giving everything in exchange.I always recomend to read the book in Italian, but this translation is a good one. And if you want to make this reading a memorable experience listen Stephen sondheim's musical &quot;Passion&quot;. His adaptation is perfect.If you like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre this book wil be one of your favourites"},{"Title":"Passion: A Novel","review":"This book is one of the most sensual pieces of literature out there. I cannot think of another book that reads so much like an operatic aria. It is not so much a meditation on love as on all-consuming attraction, obsession, and eroticism. The story takes you into the mind of Giorgio, who is torn between two women who could hardly be more opposite. Clara is beautiful, healthy...and married. Fosca is sickly, desperate...and alluring. The two best things I can say about reading this book are:1) It challenges each of us to get in touch with the light and dark sides of human sexuality.2) The translation is absolutely outstanding.

While most of the essays are correct, \\"Science and Morals\\" is completely - and erroneously - missing from this collection. It is replaced by an essay called \\"Natural Selection not Inconsistent With Natural Theology,\\" and simply slipped in under the title of \\"Science and Morals.\\"To compound the difficulty with this edition, there is no formal 'Table of Contents.' To get to a certain essay, one literally needs to scroll through the entire book. One cannot simply click on an essay title in the table of contents and go to that essay. (One would really suspect that, as this is simply a copy of the Gutenberg Project's file, amazon might have put some work in and created a table of contents in order to justify that $1+ hike in price. (Why not just get it from Gutenberg for free?)Other than that, this is an interesting essay collection and I must confess that the second essay - in which Huxley works at convincing us that the \\"secondary cause\\" of evolution does not rule out belief in the \\"primary cause\\" opf God - is interesting. Like the rest of the collection, it is just-as-relevant today as it was when first published.The rest of the essays deal primarily with Huxley's desire to seperate himself with the then-in-vogue philosophy of social darwinism. Contra this, Huxley argues that while nature is, by itself, morally neutral, we must not see human morals as artificial, but as a legitimate part of the natural fabric. And so much about our moral sentiments and laws of civil society show us that our morals often contrast sharply with the social darwinist ethic of \\"survival of the fittest,\\" and the brute struggle for existence.This seeming contradiction only arises because, unlike Spencer and Sumner, Huxley was unwilling to regard our moral sentiments - even those that contradict the evolutionary struggle for existence - as unreal or unworthy of serious consideration. Instead, Huxley prefigured sociobiology and group selection theory by suggesting that altruistic sentiments are just as much an evolutionary product as selfish ones; which one is the morally correct one is the domain of philosophy rather than science.Unfortunately, this essay collection does not contain SCIENCE AND MORALS. If you can get hold of that essay - supposed to be read with EVOLUTION AND ETHICS - it takes on a similar theme. There, Huxley is concerned with distancing himself from social darwinism in another way: denying that he is, like Spencer, a crass mateiralist. In this essay, Huxley defends the view that the 'intangibles' such as morals, the joys of art and music, consciousness, and free-will, are just as real as material things. Will science be able to explain consciousness one day? Perhaps, but that does not mean - as many present theoriests say - that consciousness is reducible; it simply is. In this sense, Huxley even goes so far as to call himslef an idealist of a Berkleyan bent.These essays, I think, are supposed to be read togetehr because the view of EoE is simply an outgrowth of the thoughts in SaM. Huxley sees evolution as amoral, and only sees society as somewhat 'transcending' evolution because he is unwilling to suggest that morals that contradict the 'laws of evolution' as illusory, unreal, or not worthy of being considered seriously. He is not as scientistic as Spencer and the like in that.This is a great work for anyone fascinated, as I am, in the history of the moral controversey surrounding evolution and sceintists' reactions to social darwinism and deriving moral conclusions from amoral facts. But I cannot give it any more than two stars, as it is missing SCIENCE AND MORALS which I think is essential for unnderstanding why Huxley takes the stance he does towards evolution, ethics, and why the latter need not be gotten from the former."},{"Title":"The Book of the Few: A Secular Interpretation of Biblical Creation","review":"For those who have questioned or pursued knowledge, this book is for you. A thoughtful and insightful look into the first book in the Bible to be read as an allegorical tale not as a fundamental verity. Moss gives us hope that knowledge is to be our salvation and the passing on of what we have learned of our immortality. I thoroughly recommend this book and reread it often to reassure myself that perhaps there are others are out there who will join the Few whose prayer of &quot;I don't know&quot; to the God of Knowledge will one day apply to all mankind. Excellent and spiritually uplifting book. Should be recommended reading."},{"Title":"In the Fast Lane: A True Story of Murder in Miami","review":"Carol Soret Cope does a pretty good job with this real-life murder story. Unlike some other ones I've read, such as those by Ann Rule, there's not much \\"suspense,\\" but for the most part this is made up for by lots and lots of details; you won't put this book down feeling like it was a poorly researched rush job, like those \\"crime of the week\\" books that pop onto shelves immediately after something happens."},{"Title":"In the Fast Lane: A True Story of Murder in Miami","review":"IN THE FAST LANE by Carol Soret Cope is a typical work of true crime. The story is that of the murder in Coconut Grove, FL, in March of 1986 of Stan Cohen and the involvement of his wife, Joyce. It is set up in the standard crime, investigation, and trial format. The story itself is reasonably interesting, though probably more so if you are from the Miami area.It centers on a group of friends who are typical of a type of people one encountered in the 70s and 80s. These are the people many of you may remember who made sure they hung out and were seen at whatever were the trendiest places of the moment. The men are the stereotypical guys who wore the top two buttons on their shirts open to display a gold chain, often dangling a coke spoon, around a generally flabby neck. They squired around their wives and girlfriends who dressed classy-casual in the daytime, but who at night morphed into overdressed, vulgar appendages to the men while sporting garish jewelry and often-ridiculous fur coats.These were nouveau riche devotees of excess, of tasteless conspicuous consumption, whom the book does not portray as ever having entertained any substantial thoughts other than those concerned with making money. But they did party a whole lot, partying which involved drinking to excess, drug use, and infidelity.ITFL is a relatively easy if unspectacular read, and Cope is a relatively decent if unspectacular writer. I had several problems with the book. There is no real background material on anyone in the book other than Joyce McDillon Cohen, and while the information on Joyce is interesting and thorough, it is inexplicably presented on pages 312-330 of a 354-page book. This material would have added massively to the enjoyment of the book had it been provided early on. I read the whole book wondering what the woman was about.The other failing of this book, as I perceive it, is a fault that seems to be the province of the women who write mediocre or worse true crime, overwrought melodramatic soap opera. No one in this book gets annoyed or irritated or angry. They are, rather, always \\"steaming\\" or \\"fuming\\", often in the same paragraph. At least Cope didn't describe anyone as \\"self-immolating\\" or \\"spontaneously combusting\\", but there's always next time.Some other examples of the melodramatic as well of another gambit of weak true crime, the fabricated thought or quote: Prosecutor Kastrenakes \\"...turned the problem over in his mind, and for the thousandth time thought about Stanley Cohen. Sometimes he almost felt he could communicate with the dead man, the man whose life and death had been his preoccupation for nearly two years. \`Stanley, damn it! We know she did it - and we're trying to prove it for you. But we just can't find the link. Help me Stanley! Give me something! Show me something!' Kastrenakes waited, feeling foolish. He didn't really believe the murdered man could somehow help him....\\"It's fortunate for the citizens of Miami that Kastrenakes didn't really believe that Cohen could help him, but do you think any of this actually happened? Nah, me neither.Is there filler? Sure. Does it often consist of things that, were they interesting, the author could not know. Sure: \\"'Well, son, tonight you just met your first international fugitive,' Stan told Shawn with a smirk. Well, Stan being dead and all by the time this book was written, Cope would have had to have gotten this information from Shawn, a teenage drug addict at time of the alleged quote. Did Shawn actually tell her this? Did he actually mention a smirk? I don't think so. Did she even interview Shawn? Well, Cope thanks a long list of people who helped here write the book. Shawn Cohen is not one of them.Which brings me to another irritation, the international fugitive in question, one Frank Diaz, is mentioned occasionally throughout the book and at one point it is broadly hinted that he will somehow be involved with Cohen's murder. But that never materializes and I was left wondering, since he had no other role in the story, why he was being mentioned at all. Maybe Cope was just giving a shout-out to a friend.There is considerably worse true crime out there, and ITFL would be okay to read on the beach or on a plane if it was all you had, but on the other hand there is no reason to go out of your way to read it. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, but I can't."},{"Title":"In the Fast Lane: A True Story of Murder in Miami","review":"I love these true crime books especially when they hit close to home. I like to know what is living next door! :)"},{"Title":"She - A History of Adventure","review":"Oh, thou-who-hast-not-read-this-book, you know not what you're missing! H. Rider Haggard's &quot;She&quot; is one of the best adventure novels of all, and it is one that inspired some of the best adventure stories of all, like, say, the Indiana Jones series.A mysterious iron box that cannot be opened for twenty years... a 2,000-year-old quest for revenge... a lost civilization in the depths of Africa... and a mysterious queen called &quot;She.&quot;The story covers a vast landscape that will delight your imagination, and the main characters are distinct and likeable, sturdy partners in this most thrilling of adventures.The story is so exciting and full of action, it's tempting to write it off as pure pulp fiction, hacked out with little intellgence or deeper meaning. You can read the book this way and still come away having a good time. But, if you're looking for that rare adventure novel with a meaningful subtext, &quot;She&quot; delivers on this level, too. I won't give too much away, but I think it's one of the greatest books ever written that demonstrates the total control desires have over man. Arthur Schopenhauer would approve.Sigmund Freud called it a book &quot;full of hidden meaning.&quot; C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien read it and loved it. Give this one a try, and you, too, might become forever fascinated with &quot;She.&quot;"},{"Title":"She - A History of Adventure","review":"_She: A History of Adventure_ by Victorian novelist H. Rider Haggard is a tale of adventure and suspense set in the dark continent of Africa which reveals the archetypal nature of the female. H. Rider Haggard was obviously influenced by spiritualism in his younger days, and his belief in reincarnation is revealed in this novel. The novel shows an obsession with death as well as with the feminine principle revealed in the queen, Ayesha (referred to as \\"She-who-must-be-obeyed\\" or simply \\"She\\" or \\"Hiya\\" by the natives). The novel has been called imperialist because it shows the travels of several British adventurers in the dark continent of Africa.This novel begins when L. Horace Holly receives a visitor in his home in Cambridge. Mr. Holly is told that his visitor Mr. Vincey is to die and that he must take care of his son Leo Vincey and protect the family secrets. Mr. Vincey provides Mr. Holly with a manuscript and a chest containing a sherd with words written on it from the long dead Amenartas. Once Leo has reached twenty-five years of age, the box is opened and it reveals the sherd. This contains writing that leads Mr. Holly, Leo, and his caretaker Job to travel to the dark continent.While sailing towards Africa the group encounters a squall which wrecks their ship and they are forced to sail onwards on a smaller boat with only one Arab, Mahomed, to guide them. Once they have landed they encounter a rock in the shape of a human head. There they meet the Amahaggar, the dark cannibalistic tribe, who live in the city of Kor. The Amahaggar inform the group that She-who-must-be-obeyed awaits them. They also meet Billali, who becomes a second \\"father\\" to Mr. Holly, and Ustane, the African girl who falls in love with Leo.This begins their adventure as they travel to meet She-who-must-be-obeyed. It turns out that She is a queen who has lived for thousands of years. She sees in Leo the reincarnation of her lost lover Kallikrates. She sees in Ustane the reincarnation of the Egyptian who she believes stole her love, Amenartas. Along the way, they encounter many dark secrets and discover the many corpses which litter the caverns in which She resides. As part of a special festival these mummies are set afire. The story plays out the long forgotten tale of Ayesha and her lover along with Amenartas who is to capture her lover's heart.H. Rider Haggard was obviously influenced by spiritualism and the dead play an important role in this novel. His belief in reincarnation is seen in many places throughout. This story was popular with many including Freud and Jung, who saw in it the archetype of the feminine, as well as Tolkien and C. S. Lewis who incorporated elements of it into their own stories."},{"Title":"She - A History of Adventure","review":"Books don't usually show up on your kitchen counter uninvited but this one did with a note tucked inside saying all in the family must read this.

Mine didn't care for it at all."},{"Title":"She - A History of Adventure","review":"\\"The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines\\" includes a fiery scene in a subterranean chamber. \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" requires our hero to make a leap of faith from a rocky pinnacle above a seemingly bottomless chasm. \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" features Sean Connery as Allan Quatermain leading an uneasy alliance of unusual heroes to foil a fiendish plot. J.R.R. Tolkien has Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gange pass through dark passages inhabited by a devouring creature by the name of \\"She.\\" Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" glimpses a mysterious and powerful queen dwelling on the Dark Continent, Each of these fantastic scenes excites the viewer's or reader's senses, stirs the adrenalin, and captivates the imagination, yet none is original. Each may owe its inspiration to Haggard's amazing novel SHE: A HISTORY OF ADVENTURE.It seems as though H. Rider Haggard not only created a thrilling tale of adventure bordering on the supernatural but also sowed many seeds that later blossomed into additional captivating tales by authors and film writers who followed him.Considering nothing more than its plot, the novel SHE offers the reader an intriguing, suspenseful, galloping, action-filled story enhanced by a goodly measure of shadowy and mysterious characters--as well as a strong but human hero, Holly; a courageous but fallible quasi-hero, Leo; and a loyal but destructible servant, Job. The non-stop action and the mystery of what may befall our protagonists around the next bend of the river or the next summit of the mountain or the next turning of the tunnel make the novel a true \\"page turner\\" from cover to cover. There is, of course, absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying this story at the plot level alone, for it provides an enjoyable, entertaining read, but there is far more to this book than just its plot, for it is filled with symbolism and allegory that can add to the reader's enjoyment.In her introduction to SHE, Margaret Atwood, an excellent author in her own right, points out a number of possible symbolic interpretations of some of the names that appear in the work. The Amahaggar tribe of followers of She suggests the word \\"hag\\" and \\"also conflates the Latin root for 'love' with the name of Abraham's banished wilderness-dwelling concubine, Hagar....\\" The name of the ancient, ruined city of Kor brings to mind the French word \\"coeur,\\" or heart, as well as \\"corpse.\\" Holly is a particularly interesting character, physically ugly but strong and resolute. In heraldry, holly is said to symbolize truth, and Holly seems to remain the most truth-seeking character in the story. His character is constantly seeking the truth of eternity, of the meaning of life (and its cognate, death), and of whether man should attempt to control Nature.Obviously, one can also analyze the story from standpoint of Freudian psychology and can surmise what he wishes about whether or not Haggard is expressing a deep internal conflict concerning male/female relationships. If one takes the protagonist Holly as the author's avatar, it is only a short leap to say that the writer is expressing the hopelessness, longing, and emotional pain of loving an unattainable woman, although it strikes me that is too simplistic an interpretation.In brief, the novel SHE offers the reader an engrossing story line as well as the opportunity to interpret the characters, settings and actions as symbols with deeper, more universal meanings, not to mention the opportunity to see the source that has inspired quite a number of subsequent books and movies. I should venture to say that anyone who enjoys a fast-moving adventure with a touch of the supernatural or at least of the inexplicable will find SHE a very entertaining read. I have only one quibble with the text and that is that I wish the dialog, which is ostensibly a translation of Arabic and Greek with now and then a touch of Latin, had less \\"thou\\" and \\"thee\\" in it. Haggard's desire to make even the translated dialog sound antique results instead in a measure of artificiality. However, even with that criticism, I enjoyed the book and heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys The Lord of the Rings, the Indiana Jones stories, and books or movies of such genre."},{"Title":"She - A History of Adventure","review":"It is a wonderful adventure, written in a very clear and straightforward manner with all the beautiful description the passages entails.

And SHE is really one of the best: compulsively readable, it lingers in the imagination long after you're done--you see why it has attracted critical commentary or adaptations from everyone to Jung to Freud to Elizabeth Bowen to C. S. Lewis. It seems to rework into all the most infamous fin-de-siecle obsessions (the New Woman, decadence, male bonding, imperialism) into something wholly new and original. Haggard was not the best writer in the world, but nonetheless somehow he managed to produce a novel as fascinating and rich as even such other fine fin-de-siecle works as DRACULA and THE ISLAND OF DR.

I think it will be my Christmas present. I don't hang on to many material things, but this book will be with me the rest of my life.

We see the workings and wonders of the nineteenth century mind. You may also find some interesting attitudes towards the other people in Holly's crew.I have read some different versions of the book and found the Barns & Noble books New York (ISBN 0760752400) to have the best introduction (by Clifton Ganyard) that falls just short of Cliff's Notes in explaining Haggard's background and writings. The illustrations are the same as in the Modern Library version but are clearer and larger. You get to see the writing on a potshard that I have not taken the time to see if it is a real language. Of all the versions I prefer most the recording with narrator Fred Williams; at first he seems to be monotone and out of breath. Then as he approaches the adventure he picks up a bit. By the time he comes to the cliff hanger he is huffing and puffing. He actually has the sound and feel of some old person recalling a long past adventure.His dying friend in the middle of the night visits Holly. He is sworn to secrecy and given a mysterious chest to hold onto and asked to take charge of the friend's son (Leo). When the time came to open the chest and find the contents, the adventure began. I will not relate the story as it is the unfolding that is a good part of the mystery.

Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, and even on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.But don't expect this book to be all good. Haggard's stereotypes about Africans are painful to read. Civilization, culture, and nobility are strictly the qualities of the &quot;white&quot; people; and the &quot;black&quot; people are cannibals, superstitious, and cowardly. In Haggard's story, even the mosquitoes won't bite Africans if there are white people around (apparently the insects are also racist -- they think white folks taste better).This is still an exciting story, and historically interesting for its popularity (written in 1887 and still published today), but the flaws are serious. I would recommend this book to my kids only if we could discuss it, and they were old enough to think critically about it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I remember reading and really enjoying this book many years ago and was looking forward to re-reading it when I recently came across a copy. This time around the story didn't work for me, and I think it's because the premise - young adults have single night of passion, are forced to marry, live together celibately and eventually discover that they are in love - doesn't ring true for today's audience. Other authors have made this work in more recent books, for example Susan Elizabeth Phillips, but it's just too simplistic here. Spencer is a very accomplished writer and I continue to enjoy many of her books, but this one hasn't stood the test of time. However, I do think that it might appeal more to younger readers who are just discovering romance novels."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I tried my hardest to finish this book, but just couldn't. I gave it until half way through the book to see if it would start picking up, and it had still failed to gain my attention. To point out a few reasons - This book supposedly takes place modern day, but the characters still talk like it's the 1800's. Also, the main character, Catherine, was just so unlikable to me. She doesn't even give Clay a chance and decides to take matters into her own hands when he is ready and willing to be there for her. I understand she has had a bad past with her alcoholic father, but when Clay is there to man up, she still refuses and is selfish. It bugged me to tears.The book just moved at a horrible pace for me. Clay continuously picks Catherine up at the home for girls, they go out and discuss things, and he drops her off. I did notice some progression of their relationship, which is why I'm not going to give this book a one star rating. I just couldn't finish. There wasn't much character development and the female main character was obnoxious and annoying.I'm usually a big fan of Spencer's books, but this one is probably the lowest on the totem pole."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I realize this is a book written in the mid-1980s. However, one of the things I judge a romance by is how well and realistically I feel the male dialogue is written. Generally, female authors do just fine with women's dialogue, but can be hit or miss with the men. WHen is the last time you heard a 30 year old man use the term \\"davenport\\"?? I was about the age of the hero in this book in 1985, and I swear that the only person I ever heard use that term was my grandma and she was born in 1900. I also got annoyed with the heroine--you love the guy, quit giving him such a hard time, especially when he's being really nice. For me, the book was way too long in the build up and way too short on the resolution."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I love all of Lavyrle Spencer books, however I have two favorites.

I was sad to read in her last book that she is no longer writing. That is a huge loss to romance readers everywhere."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I've never read a book by this author before and probably never will again. First off, a pregnant woman would NEVER (in real life) be doing all that drinking of alcohol while pregnant. 2nd, Clay has to be the most selfish person I'd ever read about. Seems he's not very interested in his daughter even toward the very end of the book. 3rd, What's with his parents anyway? Grandparents don't just go away because a couple separate. Why didn't they attempt to even visit Melissa? Way too unrealistic for me and a total disregard for the realistic facts when pregnant."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This was a gripping novel, one I didn't want to put down, as the characters were so realistic. But there were so many problems:-If Clay and Catherine had been any younger I doubt I'd have read this book. I have no interest in teenage love.-I commended Catherine's values at first, but then it became frustrating. It was so obvious she and Clay were beginning to care deeply for each other, yet Catherine continued to reject him, and not just in the bedroom.-Then I worried these two weren't compatible at all because there were so many awkward silences between them; they could scarcely think of a thing to say to each other, and often it was forced.-And Clay, this nice, handsome guy, was so emotionally tortured it hardly seemed fair. I'm glad he had to eventually work things out with Jill; otherwise we would have been left wondering about the past love between these two.-Clay's parents and grandparents were great. I didn't like to see them hurt. Although I don't think Catherine purposely kept them from seeing the baby, she should have offered them a chance to see their grandchild on a regular basis.-Like his parents, Clay was a very affectionate person and it seemed out of character for him not to have held his own newborn baby.-Catherine's mother, Ada, was a pitiful case. I know she was afraid of Herb, but I despised how weak she was. Short of shooting the creep, which he deserved, she should have put her childrens' welfare first rather than neglect them just to keep the peace with her idiot husband. Although she lived in the same house with her kids, for the most part she ignored them throughout their entire lives, and certainly never offered them a hug. What a disgrace!-I was appalled the author had Catherine drink at the wedding, and very heavily too, when just a month or so before she was drinking orange juice!-I was shocked when the author didn't have the baby placed in a car seat. Come on, this book was written in 1985!!! My child was born in 1983 and he was in a car seat! It was the law!!!-And finally, what exactly was Catherine going to college FOR? I was never sure what she studied.Anyway, believe it or not, I loved this book, despite the heartache to so many people. This book was so realistic that, in the end, even though happiness prevailed, you hated the heartaches that had attached itself to so many nice people."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I found it interesting how the author used an incredible amount of realism.

It had possibilities, but after getting halfway through with it, no progress was being made. The hero and heroine just can't seem to get past their problems -- specifically, her problems -- and move on with the romance. I especially disliked how he only seems to love her when she has dealt with her problems and changed as a person. If they were really in love, he should have been able to accept her problems and help her deal with them. The entire story just seemed depressing to me. There were too many parts where they were fighting, and even the &quot;happy&quot; parts didn't sound romantic. I think the author has real potential, but this book just doesn't demonstrate it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This book is a constant arguement! I read the first hundred pages, and skimmed the rest of the book. I got so tired of the argueing between the two characters. My friend loved the book and said she has read it several times, but I was very bored with the bickering."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"One of my favorite books. I read it once or twice a year. It is a classic romance."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This romance tale of a bickering couple finally coming together to let bygones be bygones has the required happy ending but the stubbornness of Catherine Anderson leaves a bad taste. The young woman makes an unappealing heroine because of her intractable, inflexible and inforgiving nature, making it difficult for a reader to side with her, in spite of the bad breaks she's had in her life. Clay Forrester's every attempt to support the unwed mother with emotional support and financial aid is rebuffed at every turn, and her only concern is to maintain control over a difficult situation. Ms. Anderson seems determined to punish her suitor to get back at her abusive and alcoholic father and gives little thought to the consequences of her behavior. Ms. Spencer is a great romance novelist but she stuck by this heroine a bit too much, giving her an undeserved happy ending."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I can't say enough good about this book. Catherine and Clay's story was bittersweet and sad for the most part, but it had a happy ending and I cried. What can I say? It's a keeper. I read the paperback and then later bought the hardback just so I'd always have it and I've NEVER done that before. The only thing I would have changed was Catherine's overly pessimistic attitude, which wore thin at times. I kept wanting to be able to shake her and say &quot;give the poor guy a break&quot;. She did have a pretty sorry childhood though, compared to Clay's glorious one, so I gave credit for that. Buy it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Great read. I've read this book about a dozen times. I have to say I have a soft spot for novels with a herione that has a big issue to overcome, and finds love at the end. Clay seems like such a great guy. He cooks and does the laundry!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"There was a blind date. They came from \\"the other side of the tracks\\" - Clay Forrester, the rich little spoiled boy and Catherine Anderson, the poor little working girl. He was on outs with her girlfriend/lover. It was a \\"first time\\" for her, but that didn't matter. The unexpected/unwanted still happened. What were people going to say, how could they keep the talk down. Then Catherine reluctantly agreed to Clay's \\"marriage of convenience\\" for the family's sake and she and the child would be taken care of in the end. They became husband and wife... in name only. The wedding of Clay Forrester and Catherine Anderson was the social event of the season. It seemed like a page out of a fairy tale. But everything about it - from the formal vows to the magnificent reception - was a lie. But then feelings got in the way, changes started taking place. And love's face threatened the \\"agreement.\\" Good story, hard to put down. There will be times you will feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster. Highly recommended to read.

This book made you go through a range of emotions.

As a romantic at heart, I enjoyed this book tremendously and highly recommend it to readers of romantic fiction."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This was the first of Lavryle i have read, and it was a wonderfully romantic, moving story.

She takes an almost unbelievable &quot;what if&quot; situation and makes a strong workable romance. My only complaint would be that the pregnant heroine drinks alcohol while she is pregnant within the story. I hate to think that a young fan might think that this would be Ok for her too. I know that perhaps one drink is fine from a medical viewpoint, but the heroine drinks more than one time. The hero of this romance is realistic, even though he is incredibly wealthy. I'm sure that's not an easy character to create. Kudos to Lavyrle Spencer"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I really love the way Lavyrle Spencer wrote most of her novels--too bad she is retired. Although the subject matter and some content is a bit out-dated in \\"Separate Beds,\\" I still thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read it twice and both times I was completely entertained. If you enjoy well-written romance than this is well worth the read.The story is about a lower middle class college student that gets set up on a blind date with a wealthy (hero) college student. He gets her pregnant during the date and they wind up marrying, with the intention of divorcing after the child is born.The plot is nothing out of the ordinary but Ms. Spencer really knows how to draw the reader in. This is the kind of book that you hate to put down."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I discovered LaVryle Spencer when I was at the tender age of fifteen, and my grandmother gave me her copy of Home Song. Well, I devoured it in about two days and never went back to Young Adult books. Since then I own everything that LaVryle has written, and I've read each book at least twice. She is literally on the top shelf of my bookcase, and I don't think that anyone is going to bump her from that position.Seperate Beds was a wonderful book. I just could not stop reading it. The characters were just so wonderfully developed. Even Catherine was so loveable by the end, even if she was a little bristly and prickly to start with. I just identified with her so much. Granted, I didn't come from an abusive household, but I had struggled with feelings of inadequacy, and even worthlessness for most of my life. I could completely understood how she felt. Her love for her unborn child was so touching, considering how much her life was being derailed because of it.The scene when Clay comes to her bed when she's crying and holds her and tells her that she's not worthless . . . (sigh) I was crying so hard that I could hardly see the page enough to read. I must have gone through half a box of tissues that day. It still brings me to tears every time I read that scene, even if I don't share Catherine's feelings any more.Granted, this book is a little dated with its fashions, etc, but keep in mind when it was written. As a child of the 80's, I cringe at the memory of how we used to dress, but the reminder doesn't at all detract from the book.I highly recommend all of LaVryle Spencer's books (except maybe The Fullfillment), especially Years, Forgiving, Morning Glory, The Endearment and Vows."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I loved this story! LaVyrle Spencer is an awesome romance writer. Whenever I'm looking for a book to just take me away, something to really entertain me or something fun, I read one of her books. The stories are usually simple enough, but they just pull you in.It's about a one night stand that turns into a marriage of convenience. It's only for show and for the baby, and it's set to only last a year. That's until they discover maybe there was something to the one night of passion they shared. Both Clay and Christina are likable characters and it's easy to sympathize. The ending might be predictable, and some of the problems along the way annoying, however the love story is heart-warming."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. The characters were well defined and I found myself wanting to know more and more about them and what would happen next. I don't like to give away any details, I just like to put in my two cents about whether or not it is worth someone's time. This book was definitely worth the time. The characters were realistic and the story line was not at all predictable. I was not distracted by anything and the writing style was very clear."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I agree with the one reader about Catherine's alcohol consumption. Perhaps Spencer had a reason for including this, but if she did it remains a mystery to me. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It ranks as number two on my list of all-time favorites (Spencer's &quot;November of the Heart&quot; first, Ann M. Matrin's &quot;Winter Dreams, Christmas Love&quot; third, Danielle Steele's &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; fourth). Every scene between Clay and Catherine was extremely well-written and flowed beautifully; the characters were real and believable. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Separate Beds was the first novel of Lavyrle Spencer's that I read. It was absolutely breathtaking and by far my favorite. (Like many of her fans, I've read them all!) I couldn't escape any emotion...I laughed...I cried...and yes, even got angry!!!! Immediately, I shared this book with my mom. I anxiously awaited every year for Lavyrle Spencer's new novel to appear. It's sad to see she is retiring. I will miss her adventurous stories. &quot;Good Luck in everything you do, Lavyrle!&quot;"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I have never fallen in love with a book, characters or storyline, like I have fallen in love with this one.

It is definitely my favorite book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. The herione was completly dumb and it was just unrealistic. They argued all through the book. It was nothing romantic about this book."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"After suffering from one horrible paranormal/vampire series to another, I decided to go back to the good ole best selling authors. I'm more of a historical or paranormal romance readers but there are few contemporary novels that I like. A friend of mind suggested this book to me and I gave it a try. I mean why not? What can be worst then the genre I was currently reading?I have to say it was heaven sent, a breath of fresh air! What a wonderful story and I'm not at all surprise with all the ratings it recieved. I laughed, I cried (I really did!), and at one time my tempers even flared. Seperate Beds is seriously a wonderful story. It's one of those story that can actually happen and when it does, you really do pray for happy ending. This is one of those stories where you can read anytime of the year. Whether it's during the winter, bundled up in your favorite throw tucked in your most comfortable chair or on a hot summer day out in your backyard with a glass of fresh ice tea or strawberry lemonade.This book will seriously be among my top 10 most favorite romance novels."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I am the same person who wrote the critical review below (the one with only two stars). I picked this book up again this week for lack of anything better to read, and was very surprised. I enjoyed the book much more this time, and decided I was too hasty in my comments before. From now on I'll read a book twice before I review it. I really admired the character of Clay, he really owned up to his responsibilities throughout the book. I just wished he'd fallen in love with Catherine sooner. I think that's what disappointed me about this book before, was that she knew early on she loved him but he was only interested in her for one thing. Also, the first time I read it I got tired of reading about all of her problems, but this time I admired her for overcoming them in spite of the family life she had. I still don't think this is Ms. Spencer's best work, but it's definitely not as bad as the review I gave before."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I read this book the first time like 20 years ago. I remember liking the book but not being too thrilled with hero. Thought he was a bit of a jerk at the time.Now, umpty years later, I find myself loving the story and not really hating the hero anymore. I think my 20 years older self reads a little more critically and find that I can't just fit characters in a 'she's awesome' or 'he's an ass' slot when the author has made them much more than that.Catherine Anderson is a young college student who lives in an incredibly dysfunctional and abusive family situation. Clay Forrester is the son of a pair wealthy and loving parents. After a fight with his girlfriend that leaves them broken up for a hot minute, Clay goes on a blind date with Catherine where they get drunk and have sex that results in a baby. The sex and the girl were forgettable for Clay, but worthy of a dissertation in Catherine's diary.The diary is found by Catherine's drunken, dissolute lazy father and he at last thinks 'his ship has come in'. He plans to bleed the rich Forrester's for all they have in an effort to make them support the baby. But Catherine has other plans. After an awkward and humiliating meeting with Clay and his family, She is determined to be beholden to no one. Clay is freaked out. He doesn't remember Catherine at first but it becomes quickly clear that she is indeed pregnant by him. Clays gets pressure from his parents to make things right, Catherine is determined to thwart her father's plans. The two strike a deal where they will get married just until the baby is born.But things don't quite work out the way they plan.In my earlier reading of this book, I was squarely on Catherine's side. She was after all the heroine who was a virgin and got knocked up by a rich, privileged jerk who didn't even remember who she was. Clay was largely just said jerk in my head.But on this reading, I felt the nuances in their characters and their situations more keenly. They were both trapped in a situation that was of both their makings. So while I blame Clay for being forgetful and casual of his sexual partner, I can also blame Catherine for believing that being a virgin makes it ok to know nothing about birth control.The fact of the matter is Catherine was such a damaged soul, that any relationship she had with anyone was doomed until she healed. This was made very apparent throughout the course of the awful marriage where because of her upbringing she had no idea how to relate to people comfortably. She was aloof, guarded, protective of herself. She constantly pushed Clay away because she felt more for him than he did for her and she wanted to make sure she didn't get too attached. At one point she and Clay are arguing about love. Catherine is adamant about a marriage needing to be based on love and she is determined not to have what her parents have. But Clay point out that 'on order to be loved you have to be loveable'. I had been very frustrated with Catherine at that time and was in full agreement with him because all the time in her head she was blaming Clay for not loving her like she loved him, she was also constantly cold and pushing him away.On his side, Clay's crime was full on egotism. He felt resentful and trapped. He didn't choose Catherine on his own so he felt thwarted and self pitying. This was especially evident with his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Jill. She was the one he wanted and he couldn't have her so he blamed everyone for his supposed loss. Meanwhile he longed for her. Again, it is Clay who makes the correct observation. At one point he and tells Jill that they only wanted each other because they were told they couldn't have each other.What worked really effectively for this book is how each character grows and changes. After the birth of their child, Catherine begins to heal and finally learns what Clay was saying about accepting & giving love. Clay also learns what is it to be guarded and uncertain and protective for of getting too close to someone. They each had to step into the other's shoes for awhile in order to finally come together in the right way.The book was written in 1985 and initially I was concerned about it feeling dated. In some ways it did, with Catherine using a typewriter rather than a computer to write papers. But the story holds up pretty well for the most part. The most jarring thing was the total lack of concern with drinking while pregnant. Catherine had wine for dinner a few times and also drank champagne during her wedding. That, and of course the total lack of automatic condom use, just felt weird to me in this day and time."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Spencer is swiftly and surely becoming one of my favorite romance authors! Her ability to craft real and likeable characters surpasses your usual blonde, statuesque, defenseless heroine rescued by savage, rogue-like, insolent-yet debonair-man of the hour types.This story is one that you won't be able to let go of--not even for a second. You'll want to keep reading each word until the very last page until you can no longer see straight!There are so many things that go unsaid between Cat and Clay because of their insecurities and Cat's inability to show affection. Clay is so amazing for coaxing Cat's initial responses. He shows her how easy it is to love--how good it feels to give your heart to another without fear, distrust, or doubt. Cat, however, doesn't make this an easy feat for Clay; he practically fights her tooth and nail for a simple sign of affection.He is the quintessential example of what love should look like. His love for Cat eventually breaks all boundaries between them, even when he has to let her go. And-although it's extremely cliche-their love is \\"proof\\" that if you love enough to let it go, it's probable that love will always find its way back to you.Kudos, Spencer; yet another amazing, can't put it down, my-heart-is-going-to-surely-break kind of read."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"It was supposed to be a marriage of convenience - not of love. But, someone once said that the heart has reasons reason never knew. Liz Dykhouse gives a warm, understanding reading of this emotionally charged story of two people who learn a great deal about life and love.Catherine Anderson is a rather intense, studious undergraduate student. Clay Forrester is handsome, a law student who turns many a girl's head. It's unlikely these two will ever meet, let alone have a conversation. Fate steps in with a blind date that brings them together.It's a gorgeous evening, the wine is superb, and they spend the night together. Surely a one-time happening - that is until a few months later when Catherine discovers she is pregnant. The two agree to marry, purely for reasons of convenience which is fine with both of them. Or is it?LaVyrle Spencer fans stand in line to read her next romantic opus. They'll not be disappointed in &quot;Separate Beds.&quot;- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This was a pretty good read. I like the idea that both Clay and Catharine come from different social circles. The fact that Catharine was a strong willed, young woman was also great. I like female characters that are strong individuals and can survive without the need of a man although it is quite nice when they do come together in the end. Clay was a person with a good heart. He owned up to his responsibility from the beginning. What I didn't like was that Clay's parents pushed the issue of the marriage. I don't think it was their place to do so. They really didn't know each other at first. I think the parents were being selfish. Also, why didn't Catharine push the issue of her true father's identity. I know I would've if I were her. But, other than that the book was good."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This book was wonderful. I got this book about mid-way through my second pregnancy and hoped that after work this would be a nice relaxing thing to do. Well, this book was so unbelievable it barely made it through the weekend. Also, it did nothing for keeping calm and relaxed, I felt every emotion just as though I was the main character."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I have read many of Lavryle Spencer's books and this is the first time I have really been disappointed. The story starts out great but then just moves too slow, and like the other reader mentioned, Clay and Catherine just can't seem to get around their problems and grow up. And so much of the book focused on her problems instead of the growing attraction between the two characters, which is usually what you get from Lavyrle Spencer novels. Definitely not worth the time I spent on it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"SEPARATE BEDS by Lavyrle SpencerMay 1, 2005(Rating 3.5/5 stars)Catherine Anderson is in her early 20's, and she finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand with Clay Anderson, whom she met on a blind date through her cousin Bobbi. The opening scene has Catherine with her belligerent father Herb Anderson, her mother Ada, and Clay's parents Claiborne and Angela Anderson. Clay's family is wealthy and successful, while Catherine's family can tout Herb as a chronic alcoholic and abusive husband and father. When Herb finds that his daughter has gotten pregnant by this wealthy young man, he decides he's going to get what's coming to him, which is any money he can coerce from the Anderson's. Catherine doesn't want any of the money, but wants her father to drop the whole thing, and let her take care of this situation herself.The book then goes into Catherine's attempt at fixing her mistake. She moves into a single mother's home while telling her family she's run away and moved to a different state. Clay finds out that Catherine is still in town and hunts her down. When he proposes to marry has as a business proposition, Catherine does not know what to think but she does not want to be in a loveless marriage like her parents.Although a lot of this book is dated, I still enjoyed the plot and as always enjoyed Spencer's writing. She always seems to write these stories that start out so-so, but by mid book, I cannot wait to find out what happens next. The characters may at times seem stereotypical, but it did make a good story. As always I look forward to reading another one of her books."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I've enjoyed all the other Lavyrle Spencer books that I've read, but this one just frustrated and annoyed me.Spoiler alert.Throughout the book Catherine is stubborn about resisting love. This goes on for 320 pages out of the 340 page book. Immediately after Clay gives up, she does a 180 within a page or two and suddenly is open to being loved. But it's still not good enough, and Clay has to continue to do all the work. The author does give her reasons for what she does, but let's be honest: just because someone had a traumatic childhood, that doesn't mean you really want to be around them. THis was like spending WAY too much time with a whiner and a bore. I just spent the whole time feeling sorry for Clay; he deserved better than her."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This was great! Awesome book, read it in a day, it was so good! My Best friend had the same experience, could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Separate Beds is well written and the characters and their motivations are well drawn out. My problem is that I pretty much hated the heroine, Catherine. I understand that she had a traumatic home life and feel badly for her in that respect, but the way she treated Clay was basically cruel. Even from the start, she wouldn't even give him any info on her pregnancy and her decision on whether she would give their child up for adoption or not. As if he had no say or input or any rights. He is just as responsible for their child as she is and she kept saying she had made her plans and wouldn't deviate from it and she even hid from him! I was disgusted by her behavior. Clay's parents were wonderful and he was basically a Prince Charming and she could barely bring herself to smile at him.She met a perfectly well-adjusted, happy, loving, affectionate person and destroyed him. It really irked me how at the end of the book she was SOOOO happy without him and just went out with other people. She told him more than once he was free to date Jill and go do whatever he wanted and then kicked him out and asked for a divorce b/c she 'thought' he did hook up with Jill. What a ridiculous hypocrite. Catherine was cold, manipulative, selfish and mean. I could not root for her at all. Clay was ever a gentleman to her and respected her inane wishes and she couldn't ever swallow her pride and let him know how she felt. If she was so crippled emotionally, I didn't understand how she all of a sudden transformed into such a \\"wonderful\\" mother. She told Clay she couldn't love properly b/c no one ever taught her how, but as soon as she had a baby she was 100% cured? I don't buy it. And I just couldn't take her constant rejection of Clay. All the guy needed was a damn hug after everything he'd done for her!Even the first time they met, Clay repeatedly asked her if she was sure she wanted to go all the way, he set her up with everything she needed, was always there for her during all her emotional breakdowns, was kind to her friends at Horizon and her family. And he had dated Jill his whole life basically and then lost her b/c he has to ask Catherine to marry him and still he tried to make the best of it. So I didn't blame him one bit when after months of trying to make the marriage work, he kissed Jill. I didn't blame him one bit. Especially since his WIFE gave him permission to date Jill AND refused to let him come near her. Ugh, Catherine really ticked me off.Lastly, I thought it was out of character that Clay, who is extremely affectionate and loving, had no connection with his daughter. It made no sense. I felt the author was inconsistent here. At the end of the book I honestly did not feel Catherine deserved Clay anymore. She wrecked his life, his career and his relationship w/ his family. All for what? B/c she had the emotional maturity of a 12 yr old and couldn't express that she was scared to lose him? Grow up.I can't believe this book is described as a romance, b/c any romance in here is one sided on Clay's part and she never reciprocates. Even to the point that the only time they even make love is the very last scene of the entire book! I would have rated this 1 star but I did like Clay and his family so I added another star."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Whew!! What a book! I lost so much sleep and my housework went to hell, but wow was it worth it. I could NOT put this book down. &quot;Separate Beds&quot; was absolutely gripping! Clay was to die for I am telling you...first of all he was gorgeous, but his personality..oh!! He was so playful and adorable and polite, and oh my GOD ..did I mention he was to die for? Next came Catherine. She was not as easy to like as Clay, but her character developed in a believable way...simply put...she and Clay were PERFECT together. This has made my list of top faves. I am telling you..stop whatever you are doing now,buy the book, and for goodness sake...READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!A solid story composed of very real, complex and interesting characters, but Clay getting a pass for cheating on wife Catherine with old girlfriend, Jill Magnusson (and moving in with her!), just didn't set well with me. Be a man and get a divorce first. I started out having an enormous amount of respect for Clay for manning up and taking responsibility for his child (despite the absence of DNA as proof back then), but he lost me when he went back to Jill because Catherine didn't know how to love (like Jill did?). I did find it curious that Catherine wasn't at all curious about her real father, who might have wanted to get to know his daughter. Fathers seem to be ignored in most books written by women. Though Catherine was strong, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing. This was a depressing book, the ending bittersweet. I was never fully convinced that Catherine and Clay were in love with each other, but rather they had simply grown together because of their baby. They are the type of couple I can see being relatively happy for a number of years, but ultimately, end up divorcing and finding a greater second love. I thought it would've been more interesting had their baby died and then see if they ended up staying together, for even Jill says something along the lines that it's no so much Catherine she cannot be, but Melissa, his little daughter. I recommend this book only because it is a good read, but falling in love with the characters? Not quite."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 years old,and since I was supposed to be reading Sweet dreams and Nacy Drew at that age instead of reading grown up books, I had to read the book on the sly, my older sister had borrowed the book from her friend and just before I completed it she had to return it, The story stayed in my mind all this time, I didn't know who the author was but I remembered the title and the story line and all this years I have wanted to find this book so I could finally complete it, I ordered this book a month ago through a local bookstore and went to pick it up on Saturday afternoon. I started reading it at around 23:30 Saturday evening and stayed up or night re-reading the entire book needless to say I only fell asleep after completion which was at 10:00 Sunday morning. I loved this book the emotional upheavels of the two characters was so touching and so real you just had to feel for the both of them, though I thought Miss Spencer should have decreased Clays age to maybe 21 or 22 as he came across as being very immature for a man of 25, I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the book does seem to move a bit too slow, also I don't understand why Clay's family didn't see more of the baby or why Clay didn't hold his baby until the end. Just what the heck was Catherine going to college for? The author never tells us what it was she was studying nor what career path she planned to follow once her degree was completed. However all the above mentioned do not take anything away from the story that is why I'm still giving it five stars, this book was definetly worth the 12 year wait and my sleepless Saturday night, I can't wait to re-read it this weekend ( but of course at a much slower pace since I finally know the ending). Buy this book don't hesitate, it's worth the money and definetly a keeper."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This was a really good story. It took awhile to like these characters, but it did come.

I loved the characters in Separate Beds so much that they felt like people I actually knew. I aspired to do the same for others in my own writing. Ms. Spencer's gift for storytelling and creating lovable, memorable characters is what drew me to her writing and made me love every single book she has written. The day I heard she was no longer writing new books felt like a reason to mourn for me. That's how much I have treasured her stories, and I am so glad they are now available on Kindle for new readers to find and no doubt devour as I have! I envy those who will read this for the first time!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I have read this book long time ago remembering I liked it so I decided to order for my kindle. But there were many parts in the book where it seems like a page or two were missing. It was hard to follow some parts of the story but because I had read to book before I could follow it. But I felt cheated out of the whole story. I still liked the book but when I went report it there was not an option to explain problem. Luckly I was able to get my money back considering this is an expensive kindle buy. Unless they work out the bugs with the kindle edition stick with the book."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I saw SEPARATE BEDS mentioned in one of the romance threads and thought I would give it a try. Overall it was just an okay read for me. It wasn't horrible, but it's not a keeper for my bookshelf either. I gave it three stars because it was well written and I liked the plot. It was the characters and the last part of the book that kept this from being a four or five star read for me. They both had issues they were struggling with and that's okay. I like a little conflict and emotional turmoil in my reading as long as there's a resolution and happy ending.I hated the fact that Clay took up with his ex-girlfriend even living with her while he and Catherine were separated. Even though Clay and Catherine got back together in the end I just didn't feel it. It seemed like they had been living separate lives and hadn't worked to resolve their issues. They just drifted back together and it seems like to me they could just as easily drift apart again."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"The story of Clay and Catherine is my favorite summer read ever! I found an old copy when I was in high school and read it by the pool one summer day. I couldn't put it down! I've been reading this book once every summer for the last 13 years and won't stop any time soon. I haven't read many of Lavyrle Spencer's books but this one is definitely worth reading! A great love story!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I have read this book years ago, and I swear I can still tell u page to page what it's about.

The story is somewhat predictable, but touching. I like the author and will read whatever she writes."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Like someone else stated, I too, first read this book at 15 and loved it! Even though it's time set is outdated, I still love the book. I also feel this book is a real eye opener for starry-eyed young girls when it comes to pregnancy. I had a friend who was in a home for unwed mothers about the same time I read this book and the parallels between her accounts of the home and Ms. Spencer's are sooo on point. It's a real tear jerker but worth the read. The only thing that would've made this book better would have been a sequel. The reader only gets to see Catherine and Clay as a truly happy couple once in the entire book! Also, a sequel featuring Catherine's brother Steve would make for a good book, plus tie up a few loose ends surrounding Catherine's father. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This is the first book that my mother and I ever shared reading. When I first read it, I was 15 years old and I knew everything, or at least I thought I had! I read this book while camping with my family in Oregon. It took me a day and a half to finish it off, as it was impossible to put down! I am not much of a romantic reader, but this book has something for everyone. I think that men would even enjoy this read. I purchased this version for my mom's 49th b-day. It was such an inexpensive, yet thoughtful gift! She loved it and I look forward to reading it again and again! Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Separate Beds is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. It is a wonderfully written book about two people and how their lives change when their actions on a blind date result in an unexpected and unwanted pregnancy.Catherine Anderson is a college student who comes from a poor family. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her mother is a frail creature who doesn't stand up for herself. Catherine's life is a struggle and she isn't shown any love by her family. Clay Forrester, however, is the guy who has it all--money, great looks, a fast car, a family who loves him and everything he wants at his fingertips. These two are set up on a blind date and when Catherine shows up at Clay's house with her father Clay doesn't even remember her. Clay's pressured by his family to do the right thing and give the baby a name. Clay and Catherine agree to a marriage that will keep Clay's name reputable and will give the baby a name. Catherine will get a college education and financial support for the baby. They agree to divorce after the baby is born. Their marriage though must look legitimate and not like the business deal that it is. However, they begin to have feelings for each other but their pride stands in the way. Will the marriage work or will they go their separate ways?This book is just incredible. It is written with such feeling that the reader forgets these are fictional characters and begins to care about what happens to them. I found myself cheering Clay on when he tries to help Catherine understand her feelings. The reader can really see how much Clay cares for Catherine and how much she cares for him, even though she won't admit it.This is a wonderful story. I was sad to finish this story as I wanted it to go on. The characters were all well developed and the story was great. This book is a guaranteed page turner as you just have to keep reading to see if these two can put pride aside and let their love for each other show. A book to put on the keeper shelf and read again. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I would rate this book really 3.5 stars. The novel is appreciably realistic and this author really uses the plot well and expands on it (i.e girl gets pregnant, couple struggle to realise their feelings). This is definitely better crafted for a so-used plot that Mills & Boon novels use rather shallowly. The characters however, could use a little work. Clay comes across as rather shallow, materialistic and immature though his compassionate nature and obvious caring (this develops) for Catherine helps balance this out. It doesn't reflect too well on him that he slept with Catherine just because he had an argument with his then-girlfriend, Jill Magnusson but I guess he was drunk and did make an attempt to stop somewhat counts. Readers can really feel for Catherine and her emotional problems (her barriers) but it can be really frustrating as her attitude drags down the novel at times, particularly when Clay is trying to be understanding. You can understand her dilemma - her inability to trust and love Clay because she fears being hurt and she's never really had that. Also her feelings that she wasn't the one he was supposed to marry and the fact they planned to divorce makes her unable to take a risk with her heart. It is a really sad in the story to see how she goaded and pushed Clay out - for him you can understand that a man only takes so much rejection before he turns to someone else. You can understand that she needed total reassurance from Clay (he wasn't able to give her this and admit his love), before she was ready to commit her love. One thing I didn't like in the novel was how Clay returned to his old girlfriend, Jill Magnusson. Firstly it was distasteful for her to be invited to the wedding and doubly so for him to actually kiss her there. Secondly, after her spiteful hurtful remarks to Catherine which really was the last straw that broke Clay & Catherine apart, it really is awful that he could go back to such a spiteful, shallow woman, knowing Jill's behaviour (her lies to Catherine). It was also wrong of him to confide his marriage troubles to her. Granted, they needed a separation, and it suited Clay to turn to another woman but not Jill. Six months or so to realise what she is OTT. However, on a better note it is their separation that help Clay and Catherine grow up. Clay realises his priorities have changed and finally wakes up to Jill's self-absorption. Having a baby and receiving unconditional love from her daughter, brought Catherine out of her shell to realise that she had to give love in order to receive it. Thus, LaVyrle Spencer really shows her talent for creating realistic and emotionally-wrangling plots for her romance novels. It is a great book and has grown on me."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"HI all you readers! I must confess that i do not read lavyrle books that often. I only read about 5 of them and I sometimes find her books a little cheezy and unreal. But not this very ONE. This book reflects on a pregnant girls life and her path in trying to hold on to the love of her baby and it's father . I usually don't find a good enough story behind romance novels and nothing that makes the story romantic enough. The books usually come out unreal and you cant respond to any lame thing in the book. Seperate beds went way past that obsicle and really caught my interest. This is not just a book to read if you are in for romance. It's also an intruiging story about the ups and downs of being a single mother trying to struggle with your own emotions and everything else that comes along with pregnancy. Not only do you feel so much for the characters, you wanna get to know them cuz spencer really succeeded in making them truly lovable people. 5 stars for a book like this anyday!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"Someone recommended \\"Separate Beds\\" to me as a truly great romance novel. She said it was one of her favorites and that she had read it time and again. After reading it, I'm afraid I didn't see what the fuss was all about. I found it to be not so much a romance novel but rather a novel where two people grow up along with their child. There wasn't a lot of romance here.First of all, let me preface my review by saying that I found it difficult to get past Catherine drinking while pregnant and not using a car seat for her infant daughter. My older sister had two children in the early to mid 1980's and I'm pretty sure she knew enough not to drink while pregnant and understood the wisdom of using a car seat. Despite those detractors (or the fact that the young characters didn't speak the way most of their contemporaries would have), they weren't the things I was most bothered by. I wasn't even bothered by the dated feel of the novel, either. In fact, I found some of it amusing and absurd (Clay and Catherine listening to The Lettermen in 1985? Puleeze.).This was a promising tale of a young girl from the wrong side of the tracks who came from an abusive home and married a wealthy, handsome man whose life experiences couldn't have been any more different from her own. The plight of the couple (who had only dated once) and their feelings at the prospect of becoming parents were very relatable and the book kept me quite interested for at least the first half. At that point, Catherine's continued placing of barriers between herself and Clay was understandable but it got old, quickly. Catherine couldn't allow herself to get close to Clay without a commitment so she created all sorts of obstacles to prevent that. For his part, Clay was attracted to Catherine but couldn't feel any strong emotional connection toward her because she never demonstrated any affection whatsoever toward him. I have to say, most of the book was pretty depressing.Also, I just didn't love the two main characters. Clay showed responsibility at first and he was basically a good person, however, some of his actions were reprehensible, imo. First of all, he slept with Catherine while on a blind date after having a fight with his girlfriend, Jill. He invited that girlfriend to his farce of a wedding and kissed her. He made out with her in front of God and the entire country club on New Year's Eve. He went to live with said ex-girlfriend after he left Catherine and after he knew the ex was a complete and utter liar. Finally, this man from a loving, touching family never held his daughter until the end of the story when she was around eight months old. I found that truly bizarre! I understood why Clay left to begin with. Basically, Catherine had frozen him out to the point where they needed to separate and reevaluate their lives. She overcame much, but she was certainly a trying character at times. As an aside, I found it odd that Catherine didn't seem to care much about who her real father was. I know I'd at least be curious.The story ended happily, but I still felt somewhat unsatisfied. For one thing, the sudden, sweet ending just wasn't enough, for Clay and Catherine had been combative for most of the novel. I would have liked a little more, an epilogue or something to convince me they were truly a happy couple at last. This was my main problem with the book. The happily ever after didn't feel totally genuine.Positives: LaVyrle Spencer created a believable story with believable situations and consequences. Her book was rich in detail and made me want to continue reading to see what would happen next. Most impressive was Catherine's emotional journey which showed real growth. Not only did she mature but she learned how to love and be lovable and vulnerable in return. I also really liked Clay's parents for the most part. They admitted they were wrong at first, trying to force Clay's hand. Then again, they were far from perfect, for I surely didn't get why they avoided their granddaughter just because her parents had split up. Still, the connection between them and Catherine was real. You could feel the love and respect there on both sides. In fact, I felt it more strongly than I did the connection between Clay and Catherine!I give \\"Separate Beds\\" 3.5 stars because it was engaging and it did make me think of the story for several days after I finished it. Obviously, I'm not in the camp who adores it, but it's an okay read -- just not an overly romantic one."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I have read this book over and over again! If you are looking for a book that you cant put down, look no further! The story puts you on a rollercoaster of emotions, from joy to outrage and everything in between! I have now read several of her books and this one still remains my favorite. Catherine and Clay make you feel as though you know them persoanlly and make you feel you have a stake in what is happening. Superbly written so that you will not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and I know it is a favorite of many. I read it a couple decades too late and some circumstances and the reactions to those circumstances are a bit out of date now. This book started out with a good plot and realistic reactions to the unexpectant pregnancy. Due to my age, I could actually relate to the time-frame. Initially, I liked both the hero and the heroine and was looking forward to learning how they fell in love.As the story progressed I became weary of the mind games that Catherine kept playing with Clay. I understand that she was emotionally damaged because of her abusive and alcoholic father and her spineless mother. I think Clay deserved a gold star for sticking with her as long as he did and trying to help her with her problems. She really needed some professional therapy or intervention! Then, toward the end of the book; Catherine suddenly becomes the mature and rational one and Clay becomes the flake. This story had a little too much drama and emotional baggage for me to enjoy."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"This book was on such a good track. The first half of it was heavenly - the perfectness of the angst both Catherine and Clay felt was well done, the hardness of her decision, her fear, her desire not to end up like her mother.After their first Christmas together... ugh. The books spirals downward. I understand these things have a set pattern, and I do love romances. They meet, the fall in love, neither can admit it to the other for fear of rejection, they reject each other, are miserable apart and reunite. I GET IT. The problem with this book? NO ONE is as STUPID as Catherine is when it comes to love. NO ONE would live with a man she's \\"married\\" to and not realize he's falling in love with her.I can't STAND stupid heroines and LaVeryle drags out the gawd-awful part of this book for almost half the size of the novel. Boring."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"A modern day fairy tale - Everything doesn't fall nicely into place just because Cinderella meets Prince Charming. The real world intrudes again and again as two flawed human beings have to face heart-breaking obstacles, and their own insecurities and fears, in the course of following their hearts. But there's happily-ever-after in the end - as only LaVyrle Spencer can provide.I first read this book when I was Cathy and Clay's age and I appreciated the uncondescending portrayal of life at that stage - when youre 18-19-20 years old - on the verge of adulthood, but still finding your feet. In this case, the characters are doing it under extraordinary circumstances, but thanks to Spencer's honest portrayal I could easily identify with these two people and I lost myself in their story again and again.Reading it now, years later, I've discovered the story is timeless - despite the now dated clothes and cars and other cultural references (ah, the early 80s!). It still makes me laugh and cry just like it did the first time I read it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"I was gripped by the first sentence. although the book is dated, the situation between catherine and clay is modern. the story is so real i have come back to read it at least 5 times. and the ending could not have been more perfect. i was able to finish the book in one weekend and highly reccomend it to anyone who is in to romance."},{"Title":"Separate Beds","review":"As my first Lavyrle Spencer book, I found Separate Beds a very worthwhile read despite its predictable storyline.Catherine and Clay are complete opposites; from personality to family background and social status. Finding themselves plunged into a marriage of convenience (or inconvenience due to an unexpected pregnancy), they try to make the best of their differences. Obvious troubles occur as well as some unexpected ones.This is a sweet story that I finished in only 3-days. Spencer's writing style is pretty simple to fly through, giving you enough detail and description to keep you interested without boring you with too much of it.

The selections vary in quality, of course, but there are number of charming reminiscences. The memoir by a writer who as a young girl was befriended by Tove Jansson is worth the price of the book alone, especially the joke certificate Tove drew for her."},{"Title":"The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of God","review":"Someone once told me that a book reads well that reads you. In the book's Introduction, Nancy Stafford writes:\\"I need to grasp the wonder of God's love because my own love is found wanting. I do not love as God loves. I fall so short. Too often my heart is slammed shut, crusty tight. Even when I feel love there, I don't always express it, don't follow through with actions that embody true love - forgiveness, long-suffering, sacrifice - the very acts of love that God has demonstrated for millennia\\". Nancy may have been writing her own thoughts, but for a moment, I thought she was reading my mind. Throughout the book, Nancy continues to write many thoughtful pages to which I directly relate.At the end of each chapter (31 chapters) Nancy has included a heartfelt prayer, including the following:\\"Lord, I don't want to speak empty words when I say to others, \\"God loves you\\". I want them to see Your love in action through me. Forgive me for being self-centered. Move me out of my comfort zone. Help me to be more generous and thoughtful and sacrificial in ways that will be most meaningful to others, in ways that will reflect Your incredible love for them. Help me to love as You love. Amen\\". For me, the intrinsic value of Nancy Stafford's heartfelt words in each prayer is a thousand times greater than book's cost.When describing the blessings of God's love, Nancy writes: \\"This is a love streaming from heaven that confounds our every attempt to grasp it\\". I am thankful that God blessed Nancy with the wisdom to grasp His Love. And I am thankful that Nancy shared her blessings by writing this book. It has helped me to better understand God's multifaceted Love. If you have the desire to increase your ability to recognize God's love and increase your own capacity to love, then reading \\"The Wonder of His Love\\" is a great personal investment. I know that the time I have spent reading and re-reading this book will be paying valuable spiritual dividends to me for many decades."},{"Title":"The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of God","review":"This book not only touches the heart it nourishes it as well.

This book is quite extraordinary because it represnts a highly personal journey yet one which helped me learn more about my own walk with God. Each chapter begins with a scripture and deals with a different aspect of love (initiating love, resurrecting love, etc.) For me The Wonder of His Love has been like a spiritual booster shot; it has helped me come to grips with some spiritual struggles that I have been experiencing for some time. I am extremely grateful to Nancy for this book, and I have recommended it to others who I feel have to read it. I cannot recommend the book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of God","review":"Who doesn't want to unconditional love? In The Wonder of His Love is a truly beautiful book by a writer who is fast becoming one of my favorites. Nancy Stafford has managed to convey a sense of wonder about God that applies to everyone.

It helps me to see myself a little as God sees me and that's an incredible gift.

Nancy is a gifted writer with a depth to her that I hope will mean more books in the future."},{"Title":"The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of God","review":"The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of GodWhen I received a copy of Nancy Stafford's first devotional, I was eager to dive into it, my expectations high after her previous Beauty by the Book. And I've no doubt that everyone who has heard her speak at their church, college, association or corporation will feel the same.But The Wonder of His Love should be read one day at a time, rather than gulped down in a sitting or two. It is meant to be sipped and savored, rolled around on the tongue and in the heart and spirit.Unlike the recent spate of self-help literature, the eyes of this little book are fixed upon the face of our Father. And every day, when it tears itself away, it anxiously gathers together the best images it can find so it can share with the reader what it has seen.The original experiences, of course, belong exclusively to Nancy. The best we can hope for is an echo or reflection. But they are more than enough to urge our eyes heavenward to find a vision of our own.That's the power of The Wonder of His Love. It makes us wonderfully jealous to know Him much much better.In order to love, states Nancy's theme, you must be able to receive love. Or, as my old gaffer used to say, \\"Loved people love people.\\"Ours has become a dry and shallow culture. And love, over the past half century or so, has been reduced to little more than plastic and chrome. As a result, we read that \\"God is love\\" and we don't understand. We try to comfort one another by reassuring them of God's love and often fail because we've never learned how to receive it. And we sin against the two greatest commandments, simply because we don't know how to love.The Wonder of His Love humbly and gently instructs anyone who is hungry for more of God. Page by page, Nancy Stafford graciously invites us into and leads us through her own quiet place. Day by day, she presents us to the One she so dearly loves and who desperately loves her.We dare to believe that He loves us the same way. And we hanker after an opportunity to let some of our newfound love spill out on someone else.My only criticism is that the book ends after only 31 days.The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of God"},{"Title":"The Wonder of His Love: A Journey into the Heart of God","review":"I finished reading THE WONDER OF HIS LOVE a few minutes ago, and am still savoring it a bit longer before moving on with my day.

One week into reading this book, I was so moved that I began to give it away to others -- and the list of intended recipients is growing. I am extremely selective when it comes to devotionals. As the mother of four young children and my running own business, my time is very precious. Something that I commit to reading on a regular basis must have immense value. Add to this that I also have a Master of Divinity degree, spent a number of years in pastoral ministry, and have reflected deeply on Scripture and spiritual matters. I can't help but to read these types of books critically; my intellect demands theological soundness and Scriptural integrity, while my heart yearns for transparency, authenticity and evidence of the author's intimacy with the Lord. From the moment I opened \\"The Wonder of His Love\\" these criteria have been met. I am truly impressed. When I first sat down with this little book and a cup of coffee, I thought, wow, it's so short, I'll finish it in no time. After two chapters, I realized that this is not a book to read from cover to cover in one or even a few sittings. So much depth is packed into each short section that this book must be savored one precious, rich chapter at a time -- and I am always eager to come back for more. Yet, even though it has depth, this book is easy to read. The author manages to convey profound truths with simplicity, elegance and beauty. It is rare to find a book that says this much so powerfully, while saying it succinctly and without drowning out the \\"still, small voice.\\" This is truly a work of verbal art. The author gently leads the reader on an inspired journey that delivers on the what the title promises. I can speak from personal experience: My heart is being penetrated anew and my soul is being fed with the wonderful revelation of God's lavish and amazing love. Very few books have touched me both this quickly and this deeply. For all these reasons, I truly believe that this little book has the makings of a classic.

This is a perfect example of her work...."},{"Title":"The Prague Spring and its Aftermath: Czechoslovak Politics, 1968-1970","review":"Kieran Williams has produced the best available summary and analysis of the high politics of the Prague Spring and the &quot;normalization&quot; which followed the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia of August 1968. While the book is of an appropriate length and style for interested readers and undergraduates, its impressive use of archival materials (in Russian, Czech, Slovak, and German) and its careful argumentation make it required reading for historians and political scientists as well. Williams succeeds in unpacking the various components of Czechoslovak reform communism, in explaining the ways in which Dubcek and his allies violated Soviet expectations, and in describing the creep of &quot;normalization.&quot; In so doing, he dissolves several myths. No reader of this book will believe that the Soviet-led intervention was an immediate success, nor that Czechs and Slovaks lacked the idealism needed to resist communism. Williams reminds us that Dubcek was in power for as long after the invasion as he was before it, and that &quot;normalization&quot; began with the voluntary compromises by society which he requested. Williams also demonstrates a good sense of proportion: he uses theories of political sciences, but has clearly selected from a wide corpus rather than relying upon what is presently fashionable; he points up where previous analysis were mistaken, but does so economically; he compares reform communism in Czechoslovakia to that of Gorbachev, but without pressing the point; he describes the brutality of the Soviet occupiers, while letting the details speak for themselves. Some of the book's specific arguments are unpersuasive, and its major flaw is the lack of an introduction that would remind the reader of the major events to be discussed, and of a conclusion which would review the major arguments, emphasize what is new in the analysis, and recount how theories of political science relate to the narrative.

I would have enjoyed more examples of a personal nature, such as when Williams briefly describes the local efforts to resist Soviet soldiers' brutality. This is a minor criticism, however. I found the politics fascinating, but no Czech or Slovak leader, perhaps most especially Dubcek, is left unscathed by the damning record of vacillation, subtle and often blatant deception, and finally capitulation(&quot;realism&quot;) and corrosive accommodation. Williams' ends his book most fittingly, with a quote from Czech students after Jan Palach's suicide that sums up the sorry story of a quest for liberty without commitment or sacrifice.I also found the underlying tension between Slovak and Czech most enlightening, and goes a long way to understanding the always subsurface resentment that ultimately led to the &quot;Velvet Divorce,&quot; which may have its roots in the Prague Spring debacle.This book is a must for anyone interested in the local intrigues in this seminal event of the Cold War, but Williams only lightly touches on many other interesting issues that have yet to coalesce in a definitive treatment."},{"Title":"The Crossing","review":"if you like the A&amp;E movie, this book answers lots of questions left unanswered and is quite interesting--by the same writer as the screenplay"},{"Title":"The Crossing","review":"if you remember freedom road, you'll like this retelling of washington's recrossing the delaware river--with a new introduction by 85 year old howard fast"},{"Title":"The Crossing","review":"I bought this after seeing the A&amp;E movie and I really enjoyed it. It's relatively short and easy to read since it focuses on character and personalities rather than dry facts. The narrative flows so well that you really feel as if you're there in the room or on the embankments with Washington, a young Hamilton, et al. Even though the book is listed as fiction, it appears to have been well researched and the book does contain notes and a bibliography. I was never interested in this period of US history before, but this piqued my interest and now I'm planning to read more &quot;scholarly&quot; works to get a more in-depth understanding of the era."},{"Title":"The Crossing","review":"I read this based on the fact that I enjoyed the movie adaptation so much. The movie credits characterized it as &quot;a novel&quot;, but if it is a novelized telling, I can't say that I cared for the almost complete &quot;third person&quot; way in which it was done. If Howard Fast could write such great dialogue for the screenplay, I'm not sure why he didn't do it for the book itself. I believe it would have had a more readable flow to it. It couldn't seem to decide if it was a novel or a factual narrative. His historical notes in the back were more interestingly told than the &quot;story&quot; itself. I may have thought better of it if I had read the book first, but after the screenplay, it was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Crossing","review":"I've read the historical accounts of the Delaware Crossing and the subsequent battle of Trenton. However, Howard Fast's work puts you inside the head of the characters. Granted some of this can be done with historical documents, but it can be clumsy and certainly less literate than this book.

A couple of years down the line, a professor recommended I take a look at his poetry, which he suggested was equally great, if not greater. He said he was like a British Whitman. Investigating the analogy, I came across this quote of Lawrence's: \\"Whitman, the great poet, has meant so much to me. Whitman, the one man breaking a way ahead. Whitman, the one pioneer. And only Whitman. No English pioneers, no French. No European pioneer-poets. In Europe the would-be pioneers are mere innovators. The same in America. Ahead of Whitman, nothing. Ahead of all poets, pioneering into the wilderness of unopened life, Whitman. Beyond him, none.\\" Hyperbolic? Could be, and I'm admittedly a poor judge of poetry, much of it passing over my head, but there is more than enough in this hefty 1,000+ page paperback edition to convince me of Lawrence's greatness in verse.

But influenced by Whitman he turned to a kind of free verse, and so began his long life in creating a vital poetry. Lawrence's poetry is the expression of his most initimate feelings. The poems which are most renowed are those which express his relation to nature,\\"The Snake\\" perhaps being the most well- known of them. He also has however especially towards the end , poetry which simply argues and derides those who oppose him.His poetry becomes so ' free ' at time that it would seem closer to 'prose poetry' than Poetry itself.His poems are short, and have sudden turns which may spring the lines to life.I find however a shortcoming in what I would call a lack of 'memorable lines'."},{"Title":"Twins Around the World-Paper Dolls","review":"Believe it or not, but I found this book covered in dust at a book store in Philipsberg, St. Maarten in the Dutch West Indies.

We have the Dutch, Mexican, French, Japanese, Irish, Italian, Scotch and Belgian Twins.This paper dolls were drawn by Jessie Louise Taylor and appeared in Ladies' Home Journal in 1922.

The Germans didn?t tell the Japanese until 8/42 about this major breech in their codes, after the Battle of Midway. The Japanese promptly changed their JN-25 codes. Also, it is now known that Nosenko and Fedora were both phony Soviet disinformation defectors and that Dimitri Polyakov and Anatoly Golitsyn were bona fide Soviet defectors. This is a major change in the thrust of this book! But, overall this is the best spy reference book ever written. It includes the American Revolution, Civil War, the World Wars and even long forgotten information about the world's 2nd oldest profession.

It really contains only a fraction of the available Tolkien language material, and there are some languages that nobody even knew existed when this work was published.The chapters about Dwarven names and those of the Hobbits and Rohhirim are good, though. As for the rest of the book, if you want up to date, accurate info, I advise you to go to Helge Fauskanger's excellent web-page, Ardalmbion [online] the biggest and best resource on the net or in print."},{"Title":"The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-Earth","review":"This is a terrible, massively inaccurate book. It is filled with misinformation and egregious errors. These are not simple typos, they are serious problems that will greatly misinform the reader at every turn. There are not just a few errors, there are more than one hundred! The more I look, the more errors I find -- multiple errors per page! I wish I could change my vote to ONE STAR.If you buy this book for yourself or another person, you will only spread misinformation.This book does not include anything from The History of Middle-Earth, but that is not a severe problem, since including all of that would require several volumes.The chapters on Hobbit, Dwarven, and Rohirric names seem fine.But the sections about Elvish languages and the dictionary contain an unacceptable number of serious errors, misspelled words, and wrong information. How can you learn to speak Elvish from a book where the words are spelled wrong? Here is a list of [some of] the errors that I found.1. Consonant mutation, an essential part of Sindarin grammar, is totally ignored. You just can NOT learn or use Sindarin without the consonant mutation.In the Glossary and Dictionary:2. Several words and names are assigned to the wrong language (including aiya, Altariello, And&uacute;ni, Aros, Baran, Bereg, Carn Dm, Golfimbul, kal, khelek, le, Morgoth, oial, omentielvo, Shagrat, Sindarin, tark*, tarkil, Turgon). Many of these were correctly identified in the Quotations Translated chapter, while others are identified in the Silmarillion or Lord of the Rings, so this is clearly a case of sloppy editing.*an Orkish word, listed under Quenya!3. In the Dictionary, Noel lists \\"Hobbit\\" as a language separate from Common Westron. This is plainly untrue, Noel herself agrees that the Hobbits spoke Westron. There is no such language as \\"Hobbit.\\" All of the words identified as \\"Hobbit\\" in the Dictionary are actually Common Speech (Westron).4. Many words and names are spelled wrong (including \\"ae\\" and \\"ai\\" for aeg; \\"Dearon\\" for Daeron; \\"faelivren\\" for Faelivrin; \\"galadrim\\" and \\"gladrim\\" for Galadhrim; \\"gelyd\\" for Gelydh; \\"chil\\" for hl; \\"ivren\\" for Ivrin; \\"luine\\" for luini; \\"blung\\" for lung; \\"ma\\" for mab; \\"mard\\" for mard; \\"nalda\\" for nalla; \\"ro\\" for roh/roch; \\"singe\\" for singi; \\"dil\\" for til; \\"dir\\" for tir; \\"diriel\\" for t&iacute;riel; \\"utuv-\\" for tuv-; \\"val\\" for Vala). Some of these happened when Noel completely ignored grammatical consonant mutation, which is very important in Sindarin grammar. Several other words are written and spelled correctly in another chapter, so this is another case of bad editing.5. Some words are translated wrong, even though Tolkien had provided a translation which the author includes in the Quotations Translated chapter! (including aeg, ambar-metta, oial, le, oio, tathren, &uacute;-chebin, wen)6. The author includes her own translations and etymologies for many names, and gets a HUGE number of them wrong (including Amlach, Amras, Amrod, Aranw, Baran, Boromir, Boron, Caranthir, Caras Galadon, Carn Dm, Carnil, Celegorm, Curufin, Curufinw, Denethor, Dorlas, Edrahil, Elenion, Elenw, Elu, Elw, Endorenna, Ered Lindon, Finarfin, Finarphir, Fingolfin, Finw, Forlindon, Glingal, Guilin, Haldan, Haldir, Halmir, Handir, Harlindon, Helcarax, Illuin, Ilmar, Ilmarin, Imlach, Ioreth, Lindon, Lind&oacute;ri, L&oacute;rellin, L&oacute;rien (Q), Lothl&oacute;rien, Luinil, L&uacute;thien, Maedhros, Maglor, Malach, Mandos, M&iacute;riel (Q), Nerdanel, Ringil, R&oacute;menna, Silpion, Tarondor, Tr Haretha, Valacar). Some of these errors were not apparent before Peoples of Middle-Earth was published, but most of them are not excusable in this way. Sometimes the author ignored the correct translation written in the Silmarillion. Given the paucity of information available in the sources used, Ruth Noel should not have published these baseless, hypothetical translations.7. Suffixes and roots are listed as words, with nothing to distinguish them (including alak, ma, mbar, ndak, uva). This is especially a problem in the Glossary.8. King An&aacute;rion is identified as the son of E&auml;rendil! I have no idea where this came from. An&aacute;rion was in fact the son of Elendil.Other parts of the book are deeply flawed as well:9. In Quotations Translated, one of the quotes is misidentified as the wrong language (\\"A laita te..\\"). This quote is actually Quenya.10. In the English-to-Elvish Glossary and the Dictionary, the author does not identify the language for most of the words and names, making these sections, especially the English-to-Elvish Glossary, almost useless. Noel claims that most Elvish words cannot be identified as one language or another, but this is completely false. Sindarin and Quenya are especially easy to tell apart. She also says that Proto-Quenya words are identified by an additional note, but none of them are.11. In the Glossary and Dictionary, and in the Using Elvish chapter, hypothetical and reconstructed forms are ~never~ distinguished from real (attested) words. This is a serious problem in a linguistic work, and doubly so when working with copywrited constructed-languages.12. There is inconsistent use of diacritics, which are important to the spelling of Elvish, Adnaic, and Dwarven words.These are not simply mistakes, and there are more than one hundred of them. They display a complete lack of editing. Considering the small size and limited scope of this book, so many errors make the main portions of this book worse than useless. Especially now that much more information is available, both in The History of Middle-Earth and in other linguistic publications, you can easily find a book of similar scope that is both accurate and useful. I recommend that you visit Helge K. Fauskanger's excellent linguistic website Ardalambion, which is accurate and continually updated as more of Tolkien's linguistic texts are uncovered. Ardalambion also provides a list of further online resources."},{"Title":"The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-Earth","review":"Do not buy this book. While the effort was commendable, it has serious mistakes and omissions and cannot be relied upon. Far better to visit websites such as Ardalambion, where information is updated as new bits and pieces of Tolkien's languages are unearthed."},{"Title":"The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-Earth","review":"This book is a good attempt to catalogue the languages of Middle Earth, most notably the Elven tongues Quenya and Sindarin. However, since it's publication a lot of material has been released by Christopher Tolkien, including additional information on Tolkien's languages. As a result, the vocabulary in this book is very limited compared to what Tolkien linguists have discoverd and reconstructed. The grammer is even worse - much of it is oversimplified even for what was available at the time, and now there are even more glaring errors. For example, Sindarin consonant mutations, a very important part of Sindarin grammer, are given no treatment whatsoever.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. At best you'll be getting an incomplete picture; at worst, an incorrect one. If you want to learn Elvish in either form, I recommend Helge K. Fauskanger's &quot;Ardalambion&quot; site. It has some decent dictionaries (though there are better ones elsewhere on the net) and very exhaustive treatments of the grammer and syntax of Quenya and Sindarin.

Thus whatever value this book possessed with regards to Elvish at publication is virtually voided now.

I still have a copy of the original hardback dating from my childhood, and it is chock-full of corrections that I made myself--at age 12 or 13. I even wrote a paper correcting the missing verb tense and other errors, for my 7th or 8th grade English literature class. This book is, very literally, so bad that a kid can proofread it. I'll second the various nominations of Ardalambion and some other online resources as far better sources of information, since they are the collaborative work of a large number of fans, many of them professional linguists with Elvish as their \\"guilty pleasure\\" hobby.The only reason to buy this book is as a game: How many of the errors can YOU find?

The claims are the legal heart of the patent, since they will define exactly what is, and what is not, covered by the patent; the application will be rejected if the claims are too broad, or not supported, or fail to be specific in pointing out the invention; on the other hand, the patent will be useless if the claims are insufficiently inclusive, and a product can bypass the detailed claimed invention. This book covers the details of exactly how to write a good patent claim, that will satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Patent office, describe the invention clearly and distinctly point out the novel features, and cover the invention sufficiently to stand up in court.

I had read some descriptions elsewhere, but nothing prepared me for the level of detail in this astounding book covering over 3000 texts of early science fiction between its covers. Bleiler provides very detailed synopses of each text as well as other publication details, plus insightful commentary and cross referencing. There are levels of indexes, which are amazingly simple to parse through, and Bleiler's list of science fiction categories in early sf is beautiful. Many works mentioned here are not in print and will probably not be seen in print anytime soon, if at all, but they reveal the real depth of the fascination with science, technology and the future that permeates this genre. One might quibble about some works included in this volume depending on one's definition of sf, and also about the fact that science fiction outside the European-American world is not considered, but I would say, what Bleiler has done here is not only a marvellous job for all science fiction fans and researchers, but indeed created a monument to humanity's endless fascination with ideas.Content: 10/10Presentation: 10/10"},{"Title":"Spooky Tricks","review":"This book is funny.

It is aimed towards someone new to programming who needs to get basic concepts common to any language (loops, I/O, variables, breaking a problem into pieces, etc.) and covers up throught the beginnings of O.O. It is a well thought out book and has exercises that range from relatively easy to challenging. It will be most helpful (like any intro book) combined with an experienced programmer to ask questions of.

It seems, much of disappointment among public stems from the fact, that Programming for Everyone in Java is not a textbook of the Java language but about very basics of the craft of programming. Introductory programming course may be taught in several ways. Programming for Everyone in Java doesn't suit well the objects-first\\" approach, often associated with teaching the Java language; nonetheless it is a gentle introduction to programming that anyone can accept easily. Examples and exercises are probably one of the strongest features of the textbook. Although they don't require anything more than textual input and output, they illustrate well the lessons, they are intuitive and interesting. The students, who are not oriented technically or mathematically wellcome that this one, unlike other textbooks, takes the examples and exercises from ordinary life instead from just mathematics. The textbook emphasizes several topics that the students always underestimate but that I can appreciate as a teacher, who knows what is going to come in the advanced course, and what skills are desirable to learn in the very beginning: writing source code easy to understand, specifying every task concisely, documenting every program, technique of stepwise refinement of nontrivial tasks, preparing test cases from the very beginning, and last but not least, sense of the beautiful design.

Fifty years is an immensely long time in the history of science fiction. It almost is the history of science fiction. In terms of literature, though, fifty years is nothing. Science fiction has hardly begun its life in human culture. No wonder, then, that it has changed so much since its birth, just like a baby does in its first few years. From mute and helpless infant, to crawler and communicator, to walker and talker.Poul Anderson's writing covers in time most of the life of the genre of science fiction, but the stories in Going for Infinity range less widely in style and substance than the genre as a whole. Anderson says in the Introduction:\\"What [Robert Gleason, my editor] had in mind [for this book] was not simply another collection, but a retrospective - besides stories, something about their origins, backgrounds, contexts, a historical overview of the science fiction and fantasy field throughout those decades.\\"Then Anderson immediately follows with:\\"Of course, this isn't really possible. I have been only one writer among many, and how wonderfully diverse a lot they were and are! \\"Anderson's own stories in this collection are largely the product of a fairly straightforward synergy of contemporary science (contemporary to the time of writing), and imagination. In introducing the first story, \\"The Saturn Game,\\" published in 1981, he recounts his visit to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory a few years later \\"to witness Voyager One's flyby of this very planet.\\" Anderson had also written another story set on the Saturnine moon Iapetus. Anderson wondered,Would my speculation prove completely mistaken? It's a risk that science fiction always takes, a risk that in the long run becomes an inevitability. But would this piece of mine have any run of might-be-so at all?This realism, this concern that a story fit the facts, characterizes most of Anderson's stories in \\"Going for Infinity.\\" These are not William Gibson stories. Most of them are science fiction as a backdrop of unfamiliarity against which the ordinary - but lonely, sad, evil, good, beautiful - stands out in a new and exciting way, or maybe just a simpler, more obvious, less complicated way. Economics, democracy, religion - these are all examined anew under the strange light of an unfamiliar sun.Another mark of Anderson's stories is the emphasis on the writing itself. He tells stories, but even more he paints images and composes music in language. Not just fantasy clich&eacute;s of \`purple mountains on the horizon', but lines crafted from a conscious and deliberate wielding of language and words and rhythm and space. This, I think, is the most satisfying element of Anderson's work here.There is more to enjoy, though. Anderson introduces every story with comments on the story itself, or its inception, context, or repercussions. He mentions other writers, other times, other ideas. For Anderson fans, this will surely be welcomed.Though this collection mostly is of a realistic style, there is some other more fantastic pieces mixed in. \\"Goat Song\\" is one of these. Published in 1972, this story was somehow influenced by another science fiction story, \\"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream,\\" and Cocteau's film Orpheus. It seems appropriate that this story struck me as the most contemporary, regardless of publication date.\\"Going for Infinity\\" is definitely a worthwhile collection to own, and Anderson's stories more than worth reading."},{"Title":"Going For Infinity","review":"GOING FOR INFINITY pays homage to one of the speculative fiction's greatest authors of the twentieth century by providing a taste of Poul Anderson's works as well as his retrospective thoughts over the six decades he wrote. The tales run the gamut of science fiction and fantasy with mystery thrown in showing how diverse a writer Mr. Anderson was. Some of the science fiction seems obsolete, but when looked from a historiographic perspective provides insight into the times the stories were written and into the mind of a creative individual. The fantasies and detective contributions hold up better as they clearly show Mr. Anderson's real talent of turning the obviously impossible into something that feels real and genuine; thus leaving the awed audience celebrating the classic works of a noteworthy renaissance writer.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Going For Infinity","review":"very nice compilation of his stories.... mostly odd bits of ideas, but his writing is so charming they make for very nice reading"},{"Title":"A statistical analysis of the effects of 2450 MHz radiation on the biological activity of enzymes and cofactors","review":"This item is a copy of my husband's master thesis, with which I am quite familiar, since I typed it.

There the narrator and his best friend Luo will be &quot;re-educated&quot; by the peasants. At first there is little to detract from the monotonous hardships, but soon they meet the beautiful daughter of the local tailor. When the men discover a hidden cache of Western classics in Chinese translation, the stage is set for transformation, as the men reconnect to the outside world and the little seamstress is seduced by Luo and his storytelling.

At times, I recalled Fahrenheit 451!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Set in the midst of China's Cultural Revolution in 1971, this debut from Sijie (who himself was sent to be reeducated from '71-'74) tells the story of two urban teenage boys who are sent to reeducation camp and the beautiful peasant seamstress they meet and become enamored of. Through a series of semi-adventures the boys end up with a secret cache of translated popular French novels (Balzac, Dumas, et al). As corrupting pieces of bourgeois culture they are dangerous totems to posses. However as tools to engineer mental escape from the mind-numbing rigors of manual labor, they are worth their weight in gold to the boys.One of the boys comes up with the notion that reading these sophisticated and thrilling stories to the seamstress will help improve and transform her beyond her humble roots. And it does, though not in the way that they (or the reader) may expect. On its surface it's a simple tale told in elegant and simple prose. If that were all there were to it, I'd dismiss it as so much fluff, however... there is too much symbolism involved to leave it at that. From the boy's assigned task of hauling pails of excrement up a hill, to the seamstresses encounter with a snake, there are many many indications of another level of meaning.One could make a good case that the one boy symbolizes China's late '90s headlong rush into embracing Western values, and the other boy is his complicit accomplice. Together they use their gift of gab to fill the uneducated peasant girl's head with visions of a world beyond her imagining, via the stories they tell based on the French novels. The one boy plays a game with her of tossing his glittering keychain (symbolic of the riches waiting back in the city) into the water, where she dives for it, scarring her hand in one attempt. But she doesn't learn her lesson, as the boy and temptation lead her to further suffering (she has an abortion). Finally, she is transformed and exhibits the true selfishness necessary to get ahead in the newly urbanizing China. That's just off the top of my head, but I think there's definitely something there, otherwise it's just a cute little story."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I'm sorry to disagree with the majority of the reviewers, but the truth is that I don't think this book merits any of the praise and publicity it has received. I found the narrative style precarious, to say the least, and the underlying story is, in my opinion, poor and hardly engaging or believable. The purported simplicity that conveys such great truths in this so-called \\"little fable\\" seems to me to be nothing more than lack of elaboration, both in terms of plot and literary craft. There is no fable at all, just an overpraised book that seems to have been marketed to the skies."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I only have so much time to read and was excited to be able to curl up with this book.

While there are indeed funny moments in the book, as a book-lover, what happens to the Little Seamstress, and ultimately, to the two boys and their treasures, tugged at my heart quite a bit...I was quite saddened by the irony of the re-education they put themselves through: the boys, especially Luo, had a certain concept in their minds about books, and about people who are not well-read not being somehow as esteemed as themselves; by trying to change the Little Seamstress into something else, they were re-educated about the idea that &quot;unread&quot; people are somehow less valuable (they're not less valuable), and they lost something they loved along the way to that lesson."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"We had seen the film version of this book but the text added details not included in the movie.

He just let this tale unfold at its own pace, and in the end, I really appreciated that. I often forgot that this story was taking place not too long ago, since it reads like a nineteenth century novel at times. When I first sat down to read this book, I was afraid that it would read like another book that attempted to show the influence of Western literature in other cultures -- Reading Lolita in Tehran.

Here's a lovely story with haunting images that will stay with you. It's a story of oppression reminiscent of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; but it also has some harrowing adventure. It is at once charming and startling as we are plunged into the horror of Mao's &quot;re-education&quot; plan for China. It's a love story, yes, but it's mostly about the love of words, the insatiable thirst for stories, entertainment, and escape of any kind, the enormous revolution your life can undertake when introduced to new ideas, old wisdom, and beautiful language. It's especially delightful for those of us who love Asian literature. This translation from the French is a bit awkward in places, but it still manages to transcend language barriers and relate the magic the author intended. Frankly, I was drawn to the book because the cover is so beautiful, and I love the small size. As a former designer of publications, I immediately appreciated the beauty of the package, including the truly lovely typeface. It's a complete experience. And nothing in the book is overdone. It's like dessert for the soul."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"&quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; does exactly what this type of book should do. It offers us a brief window into a part of the world, and a style of life, of which we will never be able to encounter first hand. It allows to walk a few steps in the shoes of a different kind of citizen of life, and thus empathize with their experience. It also provides a moving allegory for the power of fiction, and lets us appreciate something that is so readily available to us, yet so rare for others. The escape of fiction allows for dreams, and is a powerful force.Being almost ignorant of the Chinese cultural re-education system, this book was educational historically as well. I had known of it in theory, but not details such as the banning of all books other than those written by Mao, or the process behind re-education. I do want to learn more about this chapter in history, of which the world is still feeling the repercussions.The book itself is gentle, with moving imagery and a quiet sense of humor. The characters in it do not rage against the political machine, but instead make do with what life has forced upon them. There is love, of course, because humans will love in the most desperate of circumstances. To highlight the playfulness of the book, my favorite scene is when the tailor, influenced by the hearing of Count of Monte Cristo, begins to dress the village in fanciful pirate clothes and nautical emblems.Charming all the way through, and small enough to be a quick read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Lovely book. Except for two brief shifts in narrative viewpoint, the story is told in a very simple, almost naive way. But that simplicity hides great richness.The story is about the power of dreams, imagination, fables, and the dangers they bring. The Cultural Revolution had forced two teenagers, the narrator and his friend, to relocate to a tiny mountainside village. And though these two young men are hardly shining lamps of erudition and culture, they manage to excite the imagination of their neighbors. Their violin (poorly played) charms the headmaster into accepting them into the village. The headmaster becomes enthralled, almost hypnotized with a clock with a rooster on the face, and its hold over him helps the two boys cope with farmwork. When the headmaster discovers the two can retell movies skillfully, they are sent to the larger village down th mountain expressly to watch films and retell them when they return. These things help them endure the rigors of Mao's reeducation. The story creates for them a kind of tiny paradise.When they find (steal) a chest full of forbidden western classics, they are ecstatic. The stories are themselves dangerous, in Mao's paranoid, anti-intellectual, anti-western culture, where everyone was an informer and the crimes were not defined. But the stories are also dangerous for their exploration of the passions, for their power to excite the imagination, for their sheer craft and knowledge of the human heart. The narrator's friend begins to use Balzac's stories to woo a lovely seamstress.In the very briefest, most evocative possible way, Dai shows how the books bring hints of conflict and danger into this little village. The narrator finds he is jealous of his friend and the seamstress. More disturbingly, he finds he thinks of things as his and mine, where before he never thought to distinguish.Contrary to another reviewer, I find the story doesn't patronize or belittle the seamstress at all. In fact, that is one of the key ironies of the book, that the boy had tried to win her heart, and then make her a sophisticate, with Balzac, and had in fact succeeded. But the stories are the very thing that drive her away to make her own life in the city. They freed her, in fact.Contrary to a reviewer below, the story feels Chinese to me. It has that exuberant, slightly coarse humor and that feeling of localness, like everything is taking place in a minature landscape: mountain, fields, a town (the big one) that consists of two buildings.Dai himself endured \\"re-education,\\" and it must have been a horrific experience. That he can write such a sunny, yet subtle and resonant work about the period is another proof of the power of literature and the imagination."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"You've probably heard by now what this book is about: It is a story of how two young Chinese city dwellers discover a hoard of great European novels (in Chinese translation, of course) in a remote mountain hamlet during the troublous Cultural Revolution. This was at a time that the ONLY acceptable reading material was Mao's Little Red Book and other suchlike politico-economic tracts.To understand why I love this book, you have to understand that I went to France primarily to see Honore de Balzac's house on the rue Raynouard and his tomb at the Pere Lachaise cemetery -- both in Paris. When I first read OLD GORIOT years ago, I felt as if my eyes were opened for this first time. LOST ILLUSIONS, COUSIN BETTE, URSULE MIROUET and the others merely reinforced this love.Likewise, it was the Waverley Novels of Sir Walter Scott that impelled me to first go to Scotland, and to keep returning. And it was the NJALS SAGA and GRETTIR'S SAGA that took me to Iceland in 2001.The point I am trying to make is that the great stories are capable of enriching your life and casting away your blinders more effectively than anything else I can imagine. Balzac, Bronte, Cervantes, Hugo, Stendhal, Dickens, Tolstoy -- these are names to conjure with. I can think of no better way to bring enchantment and meaning to life than a course of the classics, undertaken with the same sense of awe and wonderment as the narrator, his friend Luo, and the little Chinese seamstress felt in their mountain fastness. Try it sometime.The only comparison I can think of is Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451, and -- even more -- Francois Truffaut's film of the same name, with its long tracks and pans across the covers of scores of Truffaut's favorite books as if it were us looking for the last time upon something that was loved, but about to be destroyed forever. Sadly, it's not unimaginable that a day will dawn on which, only in remote areas far from the nightmarish cities, will people of the future will look with wild surmise on the few literary treasures they can find in the dustbin of our civilization.Read Dai Sijie, and then read Balzac. You have to start somewhere. Why not right on top of the mountain named, appropriately, the Phoenix of the Sky?"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I first head of this book when it was initially translated into English. Actually, what I heard wasan extended discussion of the cover, by which a number of people were apparently fascinated. Moreover, everyone who read seemed to rave about it. My curiously led me to pick up a copysoon after it came out.While I enjoyed this book, I did not find it to be quite the experience others did. It is a very good book, but, perhaps because it is more of a novella than a novel, I found myself wanting more information. On the other hand, that may speak well for the book, shouldn't a good author always leave you begging for more?The book tells the tale of two young friends who are exiled to a remote mountain village for re-education during China's Cultural Revolution. There they come in contact with the daughter of the local tailor and discover a hidden cache of Western novels (yes, including works by Balzac) which have been translated into Chinese. Both become enamored with the seamstress as they secretly read the banned works, and find some respite from their status as laborers in both reading and in performing oral movies for villagers.Throughout the tale, we are drawn into the lives of the two friends, although I never really connected with the characters or felt empathy with either of them. I was sympathetic to their situation, but I never really identified with them as I generally do with characters in a novel. But trust me, this is only a minor criticism and, based on other reviews, I am very much in the minority in feeling as I did. Moreover, I guess I was somewhat disappointed that the book did not move me as deeply as I thought it would after hearing about it. Maybe its just a classic case of too much build-up and anticipation prior to reading it; there was no way it could live up to its billing.Whether this book will reach the classic status that so many seem to believe it will, only time will tell. It has fable-like qualities, but somehow I don't see it eventually finding status as a fable. It is an excellent read and do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"\\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" is a sweet, short and whimsical little coming of age story. That it happens to be set during China's Cultural Revolution and revolves around sent-down educated youth is incidental, which is a refreshing change.One of the editorial reviews labels this a \\"moving, often wrenching novel\\"; that it is neither is what makes it so appealing. Dai Sijie's lovely novel is a departure from most the \\"scar literature\\" about the Cultural Revolution in so many refreshing ways. The genre is saturated by epic-length wallow fests, equal parts suffering, self-importance and appeal-to-Western-readers exotica. \\"Balzac\\" is simple, unpretentious, strait-forward and humorous. The tragic overtones of the time are mentioned passingly and straightforwardly, as through the eyes of a youth more concerned with his own affairs than of the nation convulsing around him. Yet its tragedy is so much more moving with such a sparing brush than those that linger morbidly to flesh out all the gory details.The story is told through the eyes of a sent-down youth and his bosom buddy Luo. They are typical teenagers, at once cocky and nervous, at first thrown in over their heads in the small village they are assigned to, but soon figuring things out well enough to manipulate the system, and usually get away with it. Much humor is made through the village headman's infatuation with Luo's alarm clock, the first such thing to ever be seen in the town, and how they use the villages blind trust in its accuracy to steal extra hours of morning sleep.The central characters are not paragons of virtue, and often downright unsympathetic, which makes the plot the more engaging and realistic. With teenage boy duplicity, they both vie to seduce the prettiest girl in the village, the seamstress of the title. Luo's talent for storytelling had won them the task of going to town to see movies and then come back and reenact them for the rest of the village, and first courts the seamstress with his movie tales.After a friend of theirs, another sent-down youth and the child of writers, grudgingly loans them a Balzac book, Luo discovers that French romanticism gets him further with the girl than Korean Communist propaganda. After much plotting, they steal their friend's secret suitcase of banned Western novels, leading to the book's central conflict: Luo's forbidden affair with the seamstress, and the trio's forbidden love affair with literature.In the average Cultural Revolution tale, these love affairs would end disastrously. Perhaps playfully alluding to the cliches of the genre, Dai foreshadows such a romantically tragic ending. What happens instead hilariously cements the book as a solidly realistic and cynical portrait of China and of human nature.It's interesting to note the disparity between the emigrant Chinese writers who went to France and who went to Anglophone countries. While most of the latter, apart from a few notable exceptions, are horrendous writers, those who migrated to France, such as Gao Xingjian and Dai, have honed an elegant literary fusion. This harks back to the 1920s and '30s, when most of the best Chinese writers and artists studied in France. I don't know much about France, but it always does good things to the Chinese.\\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" is also a physical pleasure to read, with its flowing old typeface, small size and the elegant cover that lured me in despite my dislike of its genre.In absolute terms, \\"Balzac\\" only deserves four stars, but compared to the other books in its genre, which get so many undeserved raves from naive readers who wouldn't know China from Cochinchina, it is definitely a gem."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Saw the cover of this book online a while ago and finally just read it based on how beautiful the cover is. The book is entertaining but if you really want to know the real story you should look on Amazon for \\"The Good Women of China: Hidden Voices\\" by Xinran Xue. This book will make \\"Balzac and ........\\" look like a Disney cartoon in comparison! It is one of the most moving and effecting reports by individual women of all ages in China of what it means to be a woman there. Reading this book will change your persective on your own life."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Whenever a novel wins multiple French prizes, it usually exhibits two notable traits: first, its celebration of France's glorious past (in this case, its 19th century romantic authors, especially Balzac) and second, its condescension to the female characters (in this case, an unnamed \\"little Chinese seamstress\\"). This is not to say it is not a good book--it is! But the main characters' expressed desire to \\"civilize\\" and ultimately \\"transform\\" the little seamstress may be a difficult cultural pill for independent American women to swallow, much less empathize with.Set during China's Cultural Revolution, the two main characters, city-dwelling young men of 17 and 18, have been sent to the countryside for re-education, which in this case means hauling excrement down from a mountain ironically named \\"The Phoenix of the Sky.\\" Luo, the friend of the narrator, is a good storyteller, and the village headman eventually sends the two young men repeatedly to the nearest small city, a four-day round trip on foot, to view a movie and then return and \\"tell it\\" to the village. In a neighboring village, they meet the beautiful young seamstress, \\"the princess of Phoenix mountain,\\" whom Luo wishes to improve and with whom he fancies himself in love. When the men obtain access to a hidden cache of forbidden romantic novels, mostly French, they devour them, using them to \\"educate\\" the seamstress and entertain the villagers.Fascinating for its views of Chinese rural life and intriguing for its lovely descriptions of the natural world, its simple style, and its ability to show the universality of emotions-- jealousy, fear, sympathy, self-protection, quirky humor, and passion--this is a very well-written and entertaining novella, too short to allow for significant development of character and theme. Its symbolism will be familiar to most readers--a snake, keys, a narrow walkway between deep gorges, fearless plunges into the water, etc.--and its ending is inevitable. A simple story, simply told.

It transports you to a completely different time -- China at the time of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; where &quot;intellectuals&quot; were sent out to live with peasants to be &quot;re-educated&quot; -- and place -- the misty mountaintops near Tibet.But the story is one that touches the humanity in us all...the close friendship that develops between the narrator and his friend, Luo (both teenage boys); a first love (with the &quot;Little Chinese Seamstress,&quot;; jealousy, hardship, solidarity, you name it.It made me realize how special it is to have literature at our disposal...when you read how eager the boys were to get at Western literature, and revered it, when it was officially forbidden. And the ending makes one think, too, though I think most will find it unexpected.A sweet, honest, timeless story, that should touch any reader.- Julia Wilkinson, My Life at AOL"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Bought this book at a whim and did not wish to read it for a long long time, till I picked it up and then could not stop until I had reached the very last page.Sijie's first novel or rather novella (considering it is only something like 184 pages long) begins with the Chinese Revolution headed by General Mao and the concept of &quot;re-education&quot; - as a result of which two teenagers are transported to an ancient village away from civilization.No one being re-educated is permitted to read any books excepting the little book of sayings written by Chairman Mao. It is when, through a series of events, they obtain a book written by Balzac (the reading of which is now a crime) that suddenly the world of literature and of ideas abruptly opens to them. They are so hungry for more that all they can do is dream (and scheme) about getting other such books. They later meet the third primary character in this book, the very beautiful young seamstress, and, by relating to her the words of Balzac, produce in her too the desire for more such words and thoughts. She is as hungry for new stories and ideas as are the two boys.Luo, now in love with the girl, wants to obtain more books for her, not only to please her but also to raise her up from her lack of education to become something other than the peasant girl she is (albeit a beautiful one). In that desire to &quot;re-educate&quot; the girl he loves resides their ultimate future.This is a wonderful story about relationships and love, about the buoyancy of youthful souls thrown into the cold and potentially drowning waters of very trying circumstances, and, lastly, about the need for those things in our lives that stir our imaginations to life and so generate fresh desires and new dreams within us. It is the stirring of human imagination that ultimately changes the world."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book takes the history of a very complicated and dark time in China and personalizes it with clever, witty and beautiful writing.The narrator and his best friend Luo are sent off to the rural mountains of China to become re-educated by the peasants because they've been found guilty of having middle school educations and coming from middle class families. The narrator is your eye into this world, a world where the China of 1971 is sent hurtling back into the world of the early 19th century.The book speaks to you through a series of hilarious anecdotes. From the opening story of how the narrator manages to keep his violin to the every day objects such as alarm clocks and books that become fodder for the teaching moments throughout the book, these funny moments serve to also give clear examples of just how damaging the Cultural Revolution was.The intense yearning of these two young men, to be free to go back to their old lives and familes in the cities, free from the intense scrutiny and hard physical labor of the mountains, is the personification of what the tens of thousands of young people in their situations must have felt at the time.I read this book in two sittings, it's quick and funny and insightful and the english translation is done in a way that keeps the cadence of the Chinese storytelling."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The author is a wonderful writer but I found the story itself weak.

The reader can identify with the Luo, the Little Seamstress, and the narrator, however feel no closure. Granted, literature should make you think, but this made me indifferent to the characters. I was asking myself, &quot;That's it?&quot; And not really wanting to contemplate the characters any further."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book is wonderfully written and depicts a scene that is only recently becoming revealed to the West. While it was known that life was difficult in China and all the more so under Mao Zedong, not until recently was it known to what extent; how things seemed almost pointless in so many ways.The Revolution took on meaning for Mao in such a way as to try to purge the country of anything 'Western.' But this book shows, that what he did was really nothing, with respect to what he wanted. All he did was to rid the country of speaking about how people are people everyday and all of their lives.In a sense, we see much the same in Gao Xingjian's Nobel Prize winning &quot;Soul Mountain.&quot; A journey is undertaken. Many things are encountered, yet they are on such a basic and visceral level. Probably because in most of China, that is all there is, abject poverty, party officials, and little villages clustered around mountains.How different is the culture of those living in a primarily agrarian society than living in a 'virtual' society. How the concept of making food for the day is no longer something people of the 'West' even consciously think about, mostly, they just think about getting it and eating it. Here the reader is faced with a very different type of life, and a very different type of education or re-education as the case may be.Whatever it may be, the objective of re-education was never realized, because the objective was to change human beings into something that they were not. This attempt was bound to fail from the beginning. And here we see another example of its failure. Western literature reflects societal values and events. They are human events. They will happen in any society. No attempt by any despot to change human nature will succeed. Human nature can only be changed by humans, perhaps one person at a time, but not by anyone other than themselves.Sijie's book makes that point poignantly, and with great aplomb. The book is truly a terrific one, and it reads quickly, but it's point lingers long after the read is finished. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is an ambitious, many layered and fully accomplished novella. It draws you into a world remote from western experience and becoming lost even to the Chinese. By taking me to this unknown yet very real world and playing out universal experiences this book achieves two of my favorite reading experiences.Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is the first book by Dai Sijie. It is a small, ambitious book. Because Dai Sijie lived through the experience of being \\"re-educated\\" during the communist Cultural Revolution it is possible that this is autobiographical, but this is not the true charm of the story.Briefly, two upper middle class Chinese city boys are caught up in the Cultural Revolution. Stripped of everything except a few personal possessions, they are shipped off to perform manual labor in a small hillside village.This village is so remote that the villagers do not know what a violin is. To keep the villages from destroying what might be a force for western decadence our unnamed narrator plays a Mozart sonata which his friend Luo explains is called: Mozart is Thinking of Chairman Mao.Across a narrative of less than 200 pages, the two become laborers, village story tellers and secret possessors of a small library of translated western books.Lou becomes first the teacher to and then the lover of the daughter of the local tailor, the little seamstress of the title. Ultimately the two boys mature. A woman gains the knowledge to direct her own destiny. We get to see the beauty of a remote and fragile China.This book could have been about the victimization of the two boys; instead it is about the life they made for themselves. A short read and a lot of beauty, together a major achievement by a new writer."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: A Novelby Dai Sijie is a lovely gem of a novella, deceptively simple but every page filled with beauty, love and truth. It is a story of depth and nuance, a transcendent tale with a magical quality that is expressed with great delicacy and in just the right tone.It is a spacious window into a time and place about which most Westerners have little knowledge or experience ~ the infamous Cultural Revolution of China. The time is 1971 in Communist China, when older children of the bourgeois elite of the densely populated cities are sent to remote rural areas for re-education among the peasants, in accordance with the mindset of Socialism and to the glory of Chairman Mao.The story involves two teenage boys, childhood friends Luo and Ma (the story's narrator). They are intelligent young men, sensitive and inquisitive, who have been classified as \\"young intellectuals\\" in need of re-education because their parents, medical professionals and intellectuals, have been banned and ostracized by the state as notorious class enemies. Luo and Ma are banished to a remote mountain top known as the Phoenix of the Sky. The boys find themselves in the picturesque but illiterate commune run by a former opium grower/now chief. The first thing that happens to them is all of their city possessions, save Ma's violin and Luo's alarm clock, are taken away and destroyed. Any item which exuded an air of foreignness or civilization aroused suspicion and was therefore denounced. All books in particular were burned (except Mao's of course) and the process of re-education was begun.The friends learn quickly to adjust to the rigors of the hard labor which constitutes their re-education, but only with the support of each other and the rural folk with whom they now live. They befriend another \\"young intellectual,\\" Four Eyes, son of a poet, who is secretly hiding a cache of classic Western books in Chinese translation. But the dearest friend they make while on Phoenix Mountain is the Little Chinese Seamstress, the daughter of the venerated Tailor of Phoenix Mountain. Little Chinese Seamstress, as she is affectionately called, is truly delightful, a pretty girl with spunk and charm and dreams of the world beyond her Phoenix of the Sky.As a result of some clever negotiating with Four Eyes, Luo and Ma obtain one of his secrets books, a real treasure, a slim volume by Balzac. This invaluable book will change the lives of Luo, Ma and Little Chinese Seamstess forever.Ma narrates ~ \\"Picture if you will, a boy of nineteen, still slumbering in the limbo of adolescence, having heard nothing but revolutionary blather about patriotism, Communism, ideology and propaganda, all of his life, falling headlong into a story of awakening desire, passion, impulsive action, love, of all the subjects that had, until then, been hidden from me.\\"This treasured book by Balzac, as well as the others they eventually steal from Four Eyes upon his departure from Phoenix of the Sky, Luo and Ma share generously and passionately with the Little Seamstress. The three young friends are still open to the wonders of life and after being deprived of \\"reactionary\\" literature, these foreign books of great Western writers ~ Balzac, Victor Hugo, Stendhal, Dumas, Flaubert, Beadelaire, Romain Rolland, Rousseau, Tolstoy, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, Kipling, Emily Bronte ~ testify to the tremendous power of words, a power to touch and exalt the beauty of human experience. And under the spell cast by the magic of literature, a deep and tender love blossoms among the three friends, transporting them above their grim surroundings to worlds they could have never imagined.Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: A Novelunfolds gently as a sensitive love story set in a hauntingly symbolic landscape but Dai Sijie also with delicate skill weaves in a subtle political message. With poignancy and understatement he conveys two friends' struggle for intellectual freedom amidst the blight of propaganda and censorship...and the love of the beautiful Little Chinese Seamstress.This poetic and deeply felt tale seduces quickly and can be read just as quickly, yet will produce a long lasting, unforgettable effect. What a joy to be able to enjoyBalzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: A Novelagain and again, during an idle afternoon or a quiet evening! For those who love reading as I do, this enchanting novella celebrates the magic of reading we all so dearly appreciate. I love this gem of a book and hope that by this review I can get other book lovers to experience it and cherish it too."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"There is no need to repeat the many praiseworthy qualities of this book. It is a beautiful printing of a straightforward and compact narrative that illustrates at first hand the process of \\"re-education\\" of the children of the Chinese educated classes under Chairman Mao in the 1970s. The two young heroes of this novel are sent to a remote mountain village to perform hard labor, but worse than any physical privation is the total absence of books, storytelling, fiction, the stuff of romance. One of the boys makes an impression on the villagers as a storyteller, but the transformative event is when they stumble upon a cache of contraband French novels smuggled in by a young man in another village. The first book, a translation of a novel by Balzac, changes their lives. Through them, it also changes the life of the little seamstress of the title, a beautiful girl whom each loves in his own way, and who is inspired by their imagination to nurture visions of her own.So far so good. This is a compelling idea charmingly told, and surely worth at least four stars, whether as a window on a particular time or as fable. But that ambiguity is just the problem. Much of the interest in the book comes from its authenticity, the fact that the author himself underwent such a \\"re-education\\" between 1971 and 1974. And the first part of the book is a fine record of his experience and that of thousands like him. But once the element of fiction comes in, much of that harsh reality evaporates. The young men, who once were able to visit the next village only under exceptional circumstances, now seem to slip over their almost daily, and have time left over for leisurely swims in a convenient pool. Even getting to the distant town seems little obstacle. Descriptions of hardships such as carrying slopping buckets of excrement up a steep mountainside give way to comic episodes such as the improvised drilling of one of the village headman's teeth. It is as though, once fiction enters the picture, all of life becomes a fiction. But the power of the story is that of a light shining in darkness; once lose the dark, and even the pursuit of the light becomes trivial and self-indulgent."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Set during the re-education of the Chinese well to do, this little novel is breath taking.

As our main characters dream of the lives they once had and the world that is waiting for them, their obsession and appreciation of the written word is stunning. The dreams that it unlocks, and the spell that literature weaves on those who are denined it unravels in a most beautiful and interesting way.The book itself is a treasure, with beautifully printed jacket pages and a grippping cover photography..... this book is simple and short, but will leave you with a lot to talk about once it is finished.

Three Chinese teenagers have their junior high school education prematurely terminated when they find themselves exiled for reducation to a remote and primative peasant village during the Cultural Revolution. Their daily lives are preoccupied with onorous work: either risky hard labor in the local coalmines or hauling manure baskets uphill. Their sentences are open ended. There are no prospects of a future beyond their present isolation anywhere in sight. They are placed in a milieu of complete intellectual deprivation, a village where even the most rudimentary reading skills are elitist.It is in such a setting that the delightful discovery and procurement of a stash of forbidden foreign books by classic authors occurs. This fortuitous event enables them to dream and brings them great happiness as they escape from their bleak surroundings. Adolescent love follows as their good fortune is shared and compounded by reading aloud to a beautiful young seamstress. Sijie's prose is simple and effective.

The fact that he also had the opportunity to incorporate his own experiences of re-education in the story made it all the more appealing to me.However, I thought that the ending seemed abrupt, as though Dai Sijie had simply gotten sick of writing and wanted to end the story.

Mao Ze Dong deprived these children, and the rest of the Chinese, such an important part of the learning process.The story traces the lives of a group of friends and examines the importance of literature and what extreme lengths people were willing to go to in order to educate themselves. The children grow throughout the story and are transformed by the end.The words flow magnificently and Dai Sijie's work marvelously details the tragic life of growing up under the corruption of government. The work is a quick read and always keeps the reader interested in the adventures of the boys."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Much has been written about how Chairman Mao's tumultuous Cultural Revolution terrorized much of the world's most populous country with rabid and xenophobic nationalism and forced relocation of city dwellers into the nation's furthest rural corners.This story brings this period to life with the tale of two youngsters sent to a remote village where they discover a hidden trove of prohibited Western literature and fall in love with the heart-throb daughter of the town's tailor.The book achieves in a quick telling what it takes volumes of non-fiction to convey. Like the relocation programs of the revolution that at times created a combination of excruciating forced labor and giddy teenage adventure. The prohibition on all things non-Chinese (as well as much of China's ancient history) that made those turned 19th century European fiction (which most of us think as dull obligatory highschool reading) into fascinating and exotic adventures. And the universal human experience of falling in love for the first time.Several characters are masterfully developed into icons of the Cultural Revolution, like the mediocre well-connected son of intellectuals that climbs his way through the ranks by repeating revolutionary slogans at every turn, or the humiliated middle class parents forced to \\"confess\\" to crimes for having done their jobs.The writing is sparkling and vividly recreates the drama of a century of literature with the backdrop of the semi-fuedal Chinese countryside of the era. Short and sweet and worth the read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I'm not much of a reader, but I could not put this novel down. It was just lovely, a book that puts a smile on your face. The ending was surprising, and although somewhat disappointing, it did work well with the text. The only problem was that there were quite a few spelling mistakes in my version, which were quite bothersome for a person as neat as myself. Other than that, a beautifully poetic novel, a must-read for all who like stories of romance, friendship and the hardships of Chinese history."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Based on a true story, this beautifully written little book is a testament to the struggle for intellectual freedom.Written in a very descriptive , and living way, it tells of the story of two 17 year old boys in Mao's China who are among the millions of Chinese youth, forced to undergo 'Re-education' , a type of deathlike existance in China's re-education camps , carrying excrement up and down a mountain.Their life is given meaning by their meeting up with a pretty , young seamstress , and the discovery of a book full of 19th century novels, in the intellectually stifling climate of Mao's China , where all litereature , other than Communist propaganda, is banned on penalty of death!Based on a true story, it is a testament to the risks one will take for the life-giving force of free thought, and discovery , in an enviroment of the spiritual death of communist dictatorship.I don't think there is anything more evil than Communism -I can think of no other form of government so certain to produce -slowly and steadily, like soil erosion, or the action of the tides-an erosion and corrosion of the human spirit. It cuts man off from all nourishment, from his metaphysical roots, from religious experience, from any feeling of in and as one with the world. It produces a dehydration of the soul , spiritual death.."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"A friend loaned me this book, urging me to read it, which I did in 24 hours and so did my wife. A very good read.The author transported me back in time to 1971 and to a village at the summit of a mountain in China near Tibet where two teenage boys are being \\"re-educated\\" as part of the Cultural Revolution led by the Gang of Four. They are being \\"re-educated\\" because their parents are medical professionals. The narrator's parents are medical doctors whose crime was that they were \\"stinking scientific authorities\\". His friend's father is a dentist who had fixed the teeth of Mao Zedong, Madame Mao and Chaing Kai-shek and whose crime was mentioning their names together in public.The village is surrounded in mist. No electricity, only oil lamps, no vehicles, no commercial activity of any kind, not even a clock--the villagers tell time by sunrise and sunset. The village is illiterate. The villagers work in the paddy fields or the coal mines every day.The teenagers are assigned to a hut on stilts with no furniture other than two beds. Underneath their hut is a \\"pigsty occupied by a large, plump sow\\"The Cultural Revolution turns everything around. The narrator, age 17, has a violin (\\"Wy-o-lin\\") and he plays a Mozart piece that enthralls the village and which he calls \\"Mozart Is Thinking of Chairman Mao\\" so that it will not be considered reactionary.The Old Miller's song, \\"Tell me/What does the young nun fear?/She fears the old monk/No more and no less/Just the old monk\\", becomes \\"Tell me/Little bourgeois lice,/What do they fear?/They fear the boiling wave of the proletariat.\\"The narrator's friend Luo, age 18, is a great storyteller. To the delight of the village headman, Luo tells stories of films he has seen. The headman then sends the two boys on foot to the small town of Yong Jing, a four day trip, so that they can see the monthly cinema shown there and to retell its story to the villagers.The Seamstress is the very attractive daughter of the only tailor in the district. The tailor is so important that he travels in a sedan chair borne by two bearers followed by a porter carrying his sewing machine.Coal is the primary source of heat. For a few weeks, the boys work naked in a coal mine, with passages so low that they have to crawl. Luo contracts malaria, the first cure for which is whipping him with tree branches. When the still sick Luo arrives at the Seamstress's house she brings in four sorceresses at midnight to frighten the evil spirits from his body.In the midst of this total misery, the boys and the Seamstress are able to find some banned books, secretly owned by \\"Four Eyes\\", another boy being \\"re-educated\\" in an adjoining village. The first book is Balsac's Ursule Mirou&eacute;t. Others follow, books by Dumas, Flaubert, Gogol, Melville and Romain Rolland. These books transport them into the nineteenth century where they discover romance and love, emotions banned during the Cultural Revolution.In the privacy of their hut, they tell the story of the Count of Monte Cristo to the old tailor. The tailor then sews blue sailor trousers with \\"fluttering bell bottoms and whiff of the Cte D'Axur.\\" Five-pointed anchors are embroidered on buttons.A dying preacher is surrounded by his family with a tape recorder pleading: \\"If you could just repeat one of Chairman Mao's sayings-that would be perfect. Just a few words, or a slogan, go on, try! They'll know their grandfather wasn't a reactionary after all, that he'd put all that behind him!\\" The only thing the tape recorder catches, however, is a final prayer in Latin.Only after he is promised the Fu Lei translation of Balsac, does the doctor the narrator finds agree to terminate the Seamstress's pregnancy. Fu Lei had been labeled a class enemy.To the Cultural Revolution, Western Culture is like a cancer that must be removed to preserve the Communist Society. As the novel demonstrates, Western Culture has spread too far to be killed. The remnants that remain, however, are indestructible and continue to grow back.Spiritually, the boys are not far from their parents. The narrator uses his knowledge of the medical world to help the Seamstress find a doctor. Luo uses his father's skills to fill a cavity in the headman's tooth.Many of the characters in the book (the boys, the Seamstress, the tailor, the village headman, the doctor, the villagers) are benefited by the transformative power of fiction, whether they read it or hear it from the boys. I too felt its power when I read Sijie's novel."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is a quick book to read and pleasant. Avid readers will identify with the love the main characters have for books. The book also provides a glimpse into an interesting time and place. A good book; not a great book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book is a quick and beautiful read, detailing a brief span in the life of two Chinese youths who have been sent to a remote village to be &quot;re-educated.&quot; The boys discover Western literature and the reader sees the almost magical effect it has on these two boys' lives and the no less profound effect it has on the object of their affections, the Little Seamstress.The story is told almost entirely from the perspective of the unnamed narrator except for the pivotal moment in the story, which is told from the perspective of the multiple participants in the scene. The ending is a bit unexpected, but then again, given the liberating power of literature, it is not a total surprise that Little Seamstress undergoes a metamorphosis and leaves her cocoon. As heartbreaking as it is for the boys, if she had stayed where she was it would be almost like a betrayal to the liberating ideas she learned through Balzac.Sijie blends humor, romance, and beauty together to create a book that is unforgettable and impossible to put down. It is lamentable how short-sighted and misguided China's &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; was, and it is amazing that Sijie could spin this touching of a tale from that hard and unforgiving period. &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; is a must read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is another interesting tail of growing up and living in China during the revolutionary chaos of Chairman Mao.

It was very entertaining and gave me another glimpse into what it must have been like during the Cultural Revolution/Re-Education period of China's history.

I would suggest if you like this book then to try Wild Swans - which is one of the better books I have read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book is a wonderful metaphor for the failure of any totalitarian political leaning, whether it be the mullahs in Iran (see also \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran), whether it be a fictional account as in Fahrenheit 451, the short-sightedness of the religious right in America (see also Harry Potter) or Mao's cultural revolution as depicted in this amazing little story. Ultimately, the state or the despot intends to own \\"the hearts and minds\\" of the people, to control their very thoughts ultimately using ignorance as a tool of said control. But when the power of imagination is set in motion, ignorance no longer becomes an effective means of keeping everyone in line (which is a problematic lesson that Luo and Ma - one would think could appreciate- but, still have to learn the hard way).Opening up this book is like finding a gem in a plain tiny box. Small. Wonderful. Precious. Like the little seamstress herself.The metaphor comes through at the end, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Even in the most repressive of circumstances there is a part of you that they can't touch, but you might have to leave everything you know behind to claim it."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"In a series of little scenes, Dai Sijie presents you with jigsaw puzzle-like pieces that suddenly, in the final chapters, merge into a great picture. Western readers used to a more linear plotline might fumble during the first few chapters, but just let the scenes wash over you and you will find yourself carried to a clever, ironic and satisfying ending. Anyone with an ounce of Chinese history under their belt will appreciate this wry look at China's cultural revolution in action. A quick read - well worth the short investment of time."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I would call this a coming of age story, but yet the narrator and his friend Luo are already 18 years old when they are sent away from there families as part of the Chinese Re-Education program. This took them away from their families and lives with very little hope of ever seen them again. But that is not what this book was really about for me, it was more a story of hope, of love, of lust, of friendship, of betrayal and how books when you don't have access to them, mean the world to you. They can be your savior and your burden, but you are willing to risk everything for them. How when you have so very little, you can still have a whole world available to you."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book was a charming vignette about a most unlikely subject: the re-education of two city boys during Mao's cultural revolution in China. The two young men are sent to a remote mountain called Phoenix of the Sky where they work like peasants in the fields and are allowed no books. But life in the remote mountains is never dull. You will meet Four-Eyes and his mother, Balzac, the tailor, the little chinese seamstress, the miller, and of course the headman and his abcessed tooth. The young narrator's performance of Mozart Is Thinking of Chairman Mao is not to be missed.The book portrays the grimness of life during the cultural revolution with a delightful fairy-tale quality and sense of humor that are both completely unexpected.It was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Set during the cultural revolution this is a simple tale that creates characters we come to know and love.

Timely and a fine read for travel on an airplane."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Story telling is a very important aspect of Dai Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. The West may have tendencies to take for granted the powers of story telling. In the frontiers of communist China during the Cultural Revolution, thousands of books were prohibited by Mao Zedong's regime. Sijie's book brings to his reader's the obvious absurdities in communist embargos. He also reminds Western readers of the power of story-telling and the nearly intoxicating effects it can bestow. Without imagination, there can be no escape from the hardships of everyday life, especially in a re-education village thatportrayedraid in this novel. In conjunction with this, stories can also inspire people to, in clear disobedienceance to the commissar masters, steal forbidden books, take refuge in corrupted cities, and change the very nature of life for a simple agrarian village. Thus, Sijie shows the irony of an oppressive communist government that bans Western books as imperialist opium. While in reality this drug inspires villagers to fight impossible odds."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is a book about reading, enlightenment, inspiration and storytelling. It's beautifully written. It's about thriving despite opression. You will be engaged, disgusted and ecstatic as each chapter unfolds. Don't read the reviews that give away the ending... This book is a gem and I look forward to the movie."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"If you're looking for something enjoyable for your next transcontinental flight, this book'll do it. Most of the time the story is entertaining; the pace is relaxed; and it's easy to put the book down and pick it up at any moment. On the other hand, if you're looking for something to stimulate your mind or inspire you (which is, after all, what a great book does), Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress will disappoint you.One interesting literary aspect of the story is contained in the fact that as readers, we naturally identify with the narrator of the story, and it is for this reason that seeing Luo live the life that the narrator wants is desponding to no small degree. And of course the conclusion where the ignorant little seamstress leaves the village behind in favor of the city while the two boys from the city remain confined in the village is an ironic twist of fate.One other detail worth mentioning is the homage paid by the author to several classic literary figures, thus encouraging us to follow up on their adventures. It could perhaps have been accomplished with greater subtlety, but as it is it is still effective.Bottom line: a lite read, good for a low-carb diet."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Aside from portraying a vivid image of China during the Mao years, this novel is also a very well crafted satire (in the same league as one of my favourite novelists -Somerset Maugham).A young boy (Luo) is exiled to the countryside for &quot;re-education&quot; along with thousands of the undesirable bourgeois class. Luo subsequently meets and falls in love with a beautiful, simple-minded seamstress. After stumbling upon a suitcase filled with a treasure trove of banned classic english literature, Luo hatches a plan to use the books to educate the little seamstress. In so doing Luo believes he is bringing her up to his level. Her education however, takes a very different turn and young Luo is indeed taught a valuable lesson!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Before I read this book, I just knew Balzac from lyric by one of Brit Pop Band. The song title is \`Country House'. Now I really want to know Balzac more because of this book. The story tells us about two hapless city boys who exiled to a remote mountain village for reeducation during china's culture revolution. They have a friend named Four-Eyes, and a beautiful girl lived in mountain called Little Seamstress. The main character of this story is a boy who's clever in playing violin, and his best friend Luo, is clever in telling stories.These two boys have to work in the farm, sometimes go to mines and do other village's rules. Sometimes the headman of the village sends them to the nearest city to watch film, and they have to tell the story back to all the villagers. Then, they met Little Seamstress who also likes their stories, and Luo falls in love with her.Someday their other friend, Four Eyes let them borrow his book forbidden by the government, the author is Balzac. Those two boys get addicted and really like to tell the story back to Little Seamstress, even they try to steal other books from Four Eyes. They find books by many authors, besides Balzac. Victor Hugo, Stendhal, Dumas, Roman Rolland, Gogol, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and some English authors like Dickens, Kippling and Emily Bronte.When the headman is going to the city, Luo goes to mountain visiting Little Seamstress to tell the stories.They don't realize the stories and the knowledge they give to Little Seamstress will make her leave the two of them.The power of Balzac's writing giving consequences more than those two boys can imagine."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Very few modern novels today have truly captivated me in the same way as classic novels and authors have done. For one, what made this novel such a gem was how its slim and yet affective, warm, funny, and descriptive narrative truly puts you into the shoes of the un-named narrator and his friend Luo. At times I felt as if I could relate to these characters. In times of need, I believe literature can truly be the very thing that can release you from the darkness. For me personally, the Cultural Revolution of China is one of those topics in history that has seemed to affect me lately. Most of the authors from books or stories I have read about the Cultural Revolution have experienced it themselves, which makes me envy them more, and look at the story more realistically. It's truly creepy and scary to imagine how one demagogue, or group of people, can turn one whole nation and its people backwards. It's hard to explain. And even if you can't understand, this book still shines such hope in how literature can truly change things spiritually and personally. This is truly a gem. This is a novel that is what it is. It's not an overhyped DaVinci Code, it's not out to be a blockbuster success, etc. It's one of those rare modern novels that makes a message loud and clear without it having to be overhyped and exaggerated. I was not disappointed to buy this book; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"If there ever was a novel about the power of books, ti is this one. The narrator and Luo are teenagers sent to the country in order to be re-educated. In the late 60s in China, it was decided that education was dangerous and that the youth should spend some time doing hard labor in the country in order to adopt good proletarian values. Luo and the narrator were especially in trouble because they came from educated families (doctors and dentists). The work is hard, but much more is the isolation, the boredom and the lack of hope. Books are forbidden objects, and like anything illegal, they become the object of obsession for the narrator and Luo, and they do not stop till they are able to find some.Simultaneously, they befriend the daughter of the local tailor, a girl beautiful and pure. Both boys fall for her. She chooses Luo. Luo sets on a quest to educate the little seamstress of the title, and begins to read to her the great works of Honor&eacute; de Balzac.I am surprised at the many readers that were confused by the ending. To me it is very obvious what happened. In very prosaic terms, Luo \\"created a monster\\". The little seamstress was a country bumpkin, who didn't know a thing about the world. She lived in the mountains, believed in sorcerers, and was completely unaware of herself as a woman. After opening her eyes to other worlds, which is what happens when you read books, she awakened, took charge of her own worth, and grew up.I enjoyed the ending, the simplicity of it, and the heartbreak the reader suffers. I like to be surprised by what i read, so i appreciated it. But in general i was left with the sense that this book has been overrated. It was an OK read, but it was nothing special."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I loved this book on so many levels. It was an engaging, witty story on it's own. But it was also a coming of age story and a compelling glimpse into a moment in history and ends with a wonderful ironic twist. This is a short book, but a gem."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is a humorous (at times, wildly so) story played against the grim backdrop of Mao's Cultural Revolution. Two teenage boys are sent to a mountain village for an indefinite period of &quot;re-education,&quot; but find freedom through storytelling and literature. When the boys start entertaining the village by acting out films for them, their reputation spreads and they come into contact with the beautiful daughter of a tailor who lives on the mountain. The final act consists of an attempted transformation of the mountain girl into a sophisticated girl through the power of literature (which arrives thanks to a stolen suitcase full of forbidden books). The result is like a slap in the face.Dai Sijie is a film-maker, and this is his first novel. Through Ina Rilke's beautiful translation from the french, the story soars with amusing characters and events, touching on darker themes with a light and wistful touch. I found it delightful."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Read it in one sitting within 24 hours of buying. Author has a remarkable flair for storytelling just like other recent English writers of Chinese origin Ha Jin (In the pond, Waiting) and Adeline Yen Mah (Falling Leaves, Chinese Cinderalla). Having myself grown up during adolescence in a remote part of India on a staple diet of western classics including Russian authors like Tolstoy and Chekov, I could empathise with the characters savouring Balzac in translation notwithstanding the cultural disconnect. I also felt guilty that unlike the characters of this book, two boys denounced during Mao's cultural revolution, just for having the wrong parents; I was privileged to be growing up in a free, albeit third world country with access to a decent public library in my own cozy home town. As the Econimist has rightly said in the blurb, this book is &quot;A paean to the magic of literature&quot; and &quot;A true book lover's book&quot; (pun intended). The little Seamstress had the last word in this 21st Century French novel written by a Chinese author, ..she had learnt one thing from Balzac: that a woman's beauty is a treasure beyond price !! This tells us that Dumas,Mozart,Balzac or Beethoven transcend man made national boundaries while pollinating intellectuual curiosity of adolescents of the global village."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, by Sijie Dai, presents the story of two young men moved from the city to the Chinese countryside to be re-educated during Mao's Cultural Revolution. The young men discover and read a number of foreign books (forbidden during the revolution), the contents of which captivate their thinking.BLCS is beautifully written and has an evenly flowing prose. It gives a glimpse into the toils and struggles so many in history have had to endure. For the most part, I found reading it relaxing and enjoyable.As a whole, though, I cannot give an enthusiastic recommendation. First, the plot wasn't overly gripping; while I finished it in two sittings, there was rarely a spot where it wouldn't have been easy to put it down. While the narrative contained some twists and turns, it was for the most part linear and often predictable. Ultimately, the story's conclusion left me unsatisfied.I think a word of warning is also in order for those who are sensitive about mature themes. BLCS contains some crudeness and graphic imagery, as well as some explicit sensuality. Additionally, an important component of the plot deals in a matter-of-fact way with a subject that is divisive and many find offensive."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Although set in the midst of the People's Republic of China's terrible Cultural Revolution, &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; lacks much of the gravitas found in other, more substantial works by contemporary Chinese writers, most notably Ha Jin's &quot;Waiting&quot;. Indeed, the author seems to trivialize the worst aspects of this terrible episode in recent Chinese history by using it as the background for his terse tale of two sophisticated urban adolescent males falling head over heels for a simple country girl. The story is often told too abruptly, without building to any meaningful climax or resolution, as though each chapter represents brief vignettes into their lives. The writing is superb, but it is not nearly as memorable as any I've read from the likes of Haruki Murakami or William Gibson to name but a few, and falls short of the quality attained by Ha Jin. Surely it is a pleasant diversion for a quick read, yet there are other, more substantial works in contemporary Chinese literature that are more deserving of the reader's attention."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress uses simple yet elegant words to deliver a powerful message. The narrator of the novel and his best friend Luo depict the lives of two young men struggling through \\"re-education\\" in communist China under Chairman Mao Zedong. The communist regime sends the two boys to a rural mountain village to dispel any \\"revolutionist\\" ideas that their \\"reactionary\\" parents may have instilled upon them. While working as peasant laborers, the boys meet the daughter of a tailor who is known only as \\"the Little Seamstress.\\" After snatching a suitcase filled with forbidden books from another re-educated bourgeois, the two men take it upon themselves to do some \\"re-educating\\" of their own with the Little Seamstress.The lyrical prose of Sijie allows for the reader to breeze through the novel without any concept of time. With seemingly basic anecdotes, Balzac and the Little Chinese Mistress prompts the reader to go deeper into the text and find meaning. A profound social commentary on communism verses western culture, Sijie's novel exposes the inevitability of human nature and explores the balance between instinct and learned behavior. Comic episodes mixed in with powerful subtext of human nature, civilization, and coming of age make the novel an intriguing and pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I bought a used copy of this book from a local library because I had heard good things about it. I must confess, I was very drawn to the cover art. It looked like a fast read yet sounded very interesting. However, just because something says \\"National Bestseller\\" on the cover, doesn't mean it's terrific or deserving.The book was good enough to finish, but in the words of another reviewer, \\"it was all very pedestrian.\\" Somehow I got the feeling that this book was a small, incomplete part of a larger story. There wasn't enough character build-up...nothing that really makes you care for, or even hate the characters...and that is the book's lethal flaw.It is short, but too safe, nothing stands out as remarkable. As an avid reader, I really look for the books that reach out and grab me, forcing me to remember them. I give this book a B-.

For some reason today when I began I devoured it in a single piece. It can easily be read in a day, and probably should be for full impact. If you just read it a chapter or a section at a time, it too easily loses its force and momentum.The story is wistful and ironic, tinged with a certain hopelessness and regret even as the characters struggle to regain all that they have lost. It reads with the same kind of beautiful sadness that 1984 (George Orwell) possesses, but with the terrible understanding that it's not nearly as fictitious. I know that sounds very depressing...amazingly it's not. The plot and description moves forward with energy and even humor at times.The Los Angeles Times Book Review said: \\"An unexpected miracle -- a delicate, and often hilarious tale.\\"I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This novella tells the story of two city youths sent to the Chinese country-side for re-education. They meet another city exile who has a secret stash of literature.The story is told like a fable substituting a seamstress for the princess and the two ex-urbanite workers for the knights who save her from her daily drudge with stories and literature.I can only guess that the countryside and the experience of the urban ex-pats reflect the time. The narrator and his friend Luo have backbreaking jobs, the live together in a house on stilts. The limited recreational options and the restrictions on marriage (age 25 for males) produce an obsessive desire to access their friend's secret stash and share it with their new friend the (nameless) seamstress.They have a number of comic adventures in this pursuit, including handling the work boss who can mete out punishment and reward.It was disappointing that title character, \\"little seamstress\\", is not developed. While the \\"surprise\\" ending is not really a surprise, more to show who she was and how she grew with her introduction to literature would have made this a better book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book is about a love of books. What makes it different, however, is that it takes place in Communist China in the 1960's and 1970's. This was a time when most books were outlawed and any of the educated class were sent for re-education as laborers in rural China. Mao, the leader at the time, thought it best that these educated younger people be put to work where they could cause no trouble or rebellion. The author is able to describe this extremely well as he himself experienced re-education before moving to France.The book itself involves three main characters; the narrator, the narrator's friend Luo, and the Little Chinese Seamstress. The narrator and his friend have been sent to a rural part of China for their re-education and as such have become laborers in the fields there, and for a short time, workers in a mine.The first part of the book has a lot of detail. We see the narrator's violin come into play, Luo develops malaria while working in the mine, and just in general there is a lot of hardship for them. Somehow, in the last two parts this is lost and their life becomes quite a bit easier and freer despite not being able to return to their families. While this is wonderful for them, it seems a little unrealistic and you wonder what happens to these key elements.The main focus of the novel deals with the books though. Another person who has been sent to their village for re-education has a secret suitcase full of books. And both the narrator and Luo want to get their hands on it. The narrator loves the stories and Luo wants to educate his girlfriend, the little seamstress so she can become more refined like a city girl. They do manage to succeed in procuring the books but it takes a lot of finagling and deceit on their part.They love the tales of the french author Balzac the best. These are the stories in which Luo charms the seamstress's heart. There are other novels of course, but they are not mentioned nearly as much saving for Dumas' Count of Monte Christo. When they get themselves in trouble, and the seamstress too, they question whether the books are at fault.Dai's characters are interesting to a point. I actually found the narrator kind of boring and even in the first chapter, for some reason thought he was female. There is something feminine to me about the way he tells the story. The other characters I did like, especially the seamstress as I found her to be quite independent for what was going on in her country, and just being a woman in an oppressed society.The writing in this novel is very good. While he does make some use of description, Dai doesn't overdo it. Its easy to picture the scenes and places these characters are in, but he doesn't describe every fabric print, speck of dirt, or blade of grass. Since its told by the narrator it is written in the first person. I'm normally not a big fan of first person but I think he did a good job with it in this case. My only complaint on the writing was that I thought it could be fleshed out more, it was a surprisingly quick read.Overall I wouldn't say its my favorite novel. It probably wouldn't even make my top ten. But it is a good book and provides an interesting look into that period of history in China. It was amazing to see that despite what decade it was, much of the living was still very primitive. It was also amazing how much one little book could get you in trouble. The whole thought makes me glad that I can read anything I'd like.Balzac and the Little Chinese SeamstressCopyright 2000197 pages"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, two teenage boys are sent to the countryside for re-education. There they find the pretty little daughter of the local tailor and a forbidden, hidden cache of western novels, which prove very educational to the little seamstress."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Two boys, aged 17 and 18, are sent to the mountains during the chinises cultural revolution. Sons of doctors, they are seen as intellects and in need of re-education. Working in the coal mines, carrying excrement up the mountain, working in the fields with buffalos - they go on about their work in hopes of being reunited with their family one day.Luo, one of the boys, has a gift for story telling and the village headsman is quite taken with this skill. He sends the boys to a nearby town to watch films and then come back and give oral renditions of what they see. The boys are eager to do so; it means 4 days off working in the fields.During their time in the mountain, they meet another young man in the midst of his re-education. Four eyes lives in a village close to theirs, and they find out that he has a suitcase full of forbidden books. When Four eyes gets a job back in Beijing, the boys steal the suitcase knowing that Four Eyes woud be too afraid to denounce them.As they read Balzac, and other authors, the boys enter a new world. Their love for books, for words is apparent. And Luo decides to 'civilize' the girl he loves, the little chinese seamstress who lives close by.I loved the naration of this novella. The historical tidbits, the sweet love story, the humor that crops up every now and then. When I finished the book in the beginning I wanted to know more; but after a while I think its not really important what happens next. It felt right somehow."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Was pleased with how quick the book came from this seller and it was in perfect condition. So, their excellent rating was even mild compared to it's actual condition."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"It's an interesting and unique story, a quick and easy read. The descriptions are strong, especially the graphic tooth-mending scene. If I hadn't read other tales of the Cultural Revolution, I might have given this book four stars. However, in comparison to works by Yu Hua and other authors, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is not as thorough, compelling, or consistent."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"fast, easy read. Liked the characters, made you think, laugh, and smile. Overall anenjoyable read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"It took a little time for me to warm up to this novel but I'm glad I did. Like many authors, whose first language is not English, Dai Sijie wrote in very simple and direct language that appealed to me. Luo and his friend are sent to a village for re-education where they meet the seamstress. They think she is perfection except she is not as educated as they so the embark on a journey to educate her with a stolen bag of books. The irony of the story is only seen at the end when she leaves her village in order to go to the city, leaving behind her aged father and both the boys."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book is focused on the lives of two teenage boys living in China. During a major cultural revolution in which the educated elite are seen as enemies, having parents who are doctors and dentists is a major disadvantage. Such is the case for the narrator and his best friend, Luo. The two boys are taken from their families and sent to live in a tiny village, where they are \\"re-educated,\\" meaning that they are forced to work on the farms, haul heavy bundles, and enter a tiny and terrifying coal mine.Because of the extent of their parents' danger to authority, Luo and the narrator expect they will be exiled to this village for a very long time, and they try to find ways to make their miserable time there more bearable.Luo falls in love with a girl--the daughter of the local tailor. Soon he is spending much of his time sneaking off to be with the little seamstress. Still, these young men need more in their lives. When they find out that another boy being re-educated nearby has a secret stash of forbidden literature, they are desperate to get their hands on it.I really enjoyed much of this story. I liked the narrator, and I especially liked the ways in which he and his friend Luo interacted. They were able to make the best of their situation without getting beaten down, and I appreciated that they used great literature to buoy themselves up through difficult times.I suppose I just expected more of an ending to this story. I felt like I was left hanging, not knowing what the next step for the narrator and Luo would be, and not really getting to explore Luo's or the seamstress' feelings. I felt as though we were leaving the story at a crucial point, and I was cheated out of a true resolution."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"From the violin and the idea that &quot;Mozart loves Mao&quot;, this book tells a story similar to what some Chinese friends who were young during the Cultural revolution have told me. But it is the ending that is exquisite to me. Won't tell but it goes to show that men don't understand women in any culture! It is about control and freedom and the choices one makes when there is suddenly an awareness that a choice can be made."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"During the terrors of the Cultural Revolution, two boys from well-to-do families are sent to a backwater villiage to be educated in the ways of the peasant. However these peasants are just reformed opium growers, and it is doubtful whether the boys will be able to learn anything other than other than pain and injustice. Fortunately, one of the boys has a remarkable talent in storytelling. This captivates the villiaers who have never seen any kind of modern entertainment. This gives the boys an opportunity to go to the city to see movies which they must relate to the villiagers on their return. On their trips they encounter the lovely tailor's daughter. Also they come across a suitcase full of western books. These books are banned, but the boys thirst for them, and in reading them, they become aware of a completely different world. In exploring this different world, they learn some hard lessons in life and love.I have to disagree with the reviewer who disliked the ending. Perhaps the reviewer wanted to get an ending that vindicated the power of romantic love as set forth in western literature. However the reviewer must keep in mind that this is not a western book. And however much you hoped, the ending that you hoped for is not very realistic. What these boys went through is something that every boy goes through in their life. This is just an extreme case of growing up."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I picked this book up on a whim at Borders and man oh man am i glad i did. finding interesting reads for my daily commute continues to baffle the hell out of me, but talk about striking it rich this time! the piece is a great mix of history, culture, love and insatiable lust for the written word. two losers in life, because of the hands their country and timeline dealt them, do their best to endure hard living as a result of \\"re-education\\" at the hands of peasants during the chinese cultural revolution. somewhere along the way they get their hands on outlawed books and find out what re-education really is. a love triangle eventually ensues between the two voracious readers and a little cutie from the next village over. it begins, reads on, and ends exactly like it should and i can't say anything bad about this book. a refreshing change of pace, i call it forgettable merely because it will never rank among the \\"classics\\" this planet holds so dear. feel free to contact me if u have any recommendations for my commute..."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is a book that all librarians should read.

'Balzac' is a poignant tale of discovery and rich in ethno-historical details from the roiling human drama we call modern China.Well-done Mr. Dai!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The initial chapters of this book, about two boys going to live with peasants as part of the Cultural Revolution, were graphic, gripping, and crisply written. Some of the language (chosen by author, or translator) are unusual and pleasing. Frisson, for example. This is not a typical \\"read\\" and has a kind of Buddhist simplicity.About half way through the book, as the author describes navigating a slippery, muddy and precarious slope, he himself seems to fall off one of his own making. The book \\"fast forwards\\" in a rush, and even resorts to a \\"story within story\\" a la Canterbury Tales, then returns to the original style and voice toward the end. All very jumpy.The characters increasingly become \\"architypes\\" in a piece of Communist art of the time. Heroic. Without inner life. Action figures accomplishing mighty things. Daring acts of courage. Sad partings. And finally, the cinematic figure of the seamstress, once churning with passion and love-making, gets bitten by a snake and turns into some kind of communist posterchild, departing into the rising sun of her unknown future. This departure leaves the two boys who dared to find and enjoy western literature gaping in pain, in the dust. Why?I totally don't get it. Did the author get bored with this book and decide to wrap it up with some increasingly formulaic ending? That's what I think."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This story is a sweet piece of candy. A trifle that creates a moment of pleasure and is gone. It gives you a taste of the horrific Cultural Revolution in China in the late \`60s and \`70s. Two city boys are sent to a mountain village to be educated, and there, amidst many hardships, they find two treasures: some books that are literary classics, and a beautiful young seamstress.The books enrich their deprived world, and in reading them to the seamstress they develop a close relationship with her. Unfortunately the books also help bring about a personal disaster for them.The novel provides a fascinating look at life in rural China, and also tells us that Chairman Mao's power reaches deep into the most remote villages.It's a fluffy little short novel that tells an essentially humorous story taking place during a dreadful time. You can read it in just a few hours."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book was just a delight to read. The story was charming, the characters were interesting.

They aquire a suitcase filled with Western Literature. The stories in these books transform the young men and make them question everything about their society. This story proves the power of literature. This book also shows the flaws inherent in the re-education camps. You can change someone, but you can never control how they change. Very good and very quick."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Sijie Dai has offered us a glimpse into chinese reeducation program under Communism with his first novel, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, which was inspired by his own experiences in the early 1970's. His story follows the mini-adventures of two sons of the bourgoisie who are sent into the farm country of the peasants to learn what it truly means to be Chinese. What we as readers are shown is how the effects of the story, any story, in bringing out the humanity in all of us.This is a book about narration, books, the love of literature, and the power of the written word to entice and liberate.While I enjoyed this novel for its fable-like quality, the charm of its characters, and even the slow jealousy that boils between the two protaganists, my favorite aspect of it is probably the book's design. Rarely have I wanted to look at a book more than read it. Its typesetting, cover, and paper are superb. This is a book to read, but also one to keep in a paperback library."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I was engulfed by the time I reached the end of Page 1. It's a superb piece of storytelling: a style I'd characterize as &quot;spare&quot;, but visually and emotionally rich. You can enjoy it on the level of a love story or kick up a notch to a historical novel. Even better, it feels like it must be autobiographical. I felt like I was there.So why not a fifth star? I was swept along with the tide and immersed in the verse, but my deepest emotions remained intact."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this story, read it in two evenings. This sheds a little light on the \\"Great Leap Forward\\"/\\"Cultural Revolution\\". I have a Chinese daughter-in-law, so I've been reading a ton on her home country, although I enjoy history of all types: areas and eras. I never could figure out why someone as despicable as mao could wreak such havoc on his own country (kinda like what's happening to the USA, eh?). Still cannot. What I did NOT like, though, was the seller's description: \\"Very good\\". 'Tis horribly marked-up inside with dark blue marker, not just pen/pencil underlining, even including personal info such as an address, and driving directions! Having something like this in my personal library is embarrassing. The story gets 5 stars, the seller 1."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book takes place on a remote island in china were two boys, Luo and the un-named narrator, are sent to their \\"re-education\\" in the cultural revolution. The village headman discovers their talent for story telling and they are sent to the city to watch a film and present an oral presentation to the village and make it as long as the film. They succeed in doing this and they are sent once a month to see a movie in the city afterward. In the city the boys meet the tailor's daughter the beautiful seamstress as people called her. Luo falls in love with the seamstress instantly and they visit her often. Later Luo steals some forbidden western books from a neighbor in the village and they are wrapped up in the stories of the city and love. Luo tries to educate the seamstress with books by Balzac to make her his perfect match. This is a great book I recommend it to 5th graders and up. The book has a great ending and can be read in a day but you will think about it much longer!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I read this book on recommendation from a friend and because of the glowing reviews.Two pages in and I had to talk myself into continuing. While not excruciatingly horrible, it was bad. Even as I forced myself to read, a rant of the idiocy in the literary world began in my head. Awkward sentences and passive voice littered the page, transitions that would make a five year old shake his head and say \\"I can do better than that\\" ran rampant, antecedents were separated too far from their nouns, and the list goes on.Despite this, I slogged ahead, determined to find _some_ thing that explained the hype over this book.Eventually, I did develop a fondness for the characters, although I never succeeded in quieting the silent scream at the abuse of language. Sijie does a marvelous job creating these two likable, teenage boys and their struggle after being banished to the peasant villages for \\"re-education\\" during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The fascinating glimpse into life during this time period is most likely what captures those who read it.However, I am still baffled that this book became a bestseller. The characters may be interesting, but the writing is not. Even if this is a poor translation from French to English, I am not sure that excuses the multiple errors and sloppy writing. Could this be one of those books that a few literary critics raved about then every one else jumped on the bandwagon just to appear erudite? Because most people I have spoken frankly with about the book agree with my opinion of the author's writing skill.Yet, the list of accolades is so large I wonder if the reviewers read the same novel as I did.Rather than buying the book, I highly recommend either borrowing it from a friend or checking it out of the library. Even eight dollars is too much to spend."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I thought this was an interesting story. But, I am not a fan of the short story or novella so I didn't find it satisfying. For those of you who love short stories you might just love this...?But I would have liked more of everything...I would have liked more details and more character development.I was curious about the time in history and would have liked to hear even more about the politics and the process of re-education. I would have liked to learn more about our narrator and his relationship with Luo...and more about Luo's relationship with the Little Seamstress.More would have been better for me. Short stories often feel like outlines for novels to me and this one did as well. I needed more details to feel the emotions between the characters.Overall, I thought the story was interesting but it just wasn't detailed enough to give me a satisfied feeling when I was done."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I had to read this for my book group and seemed to be one of the only girls who came away disappointed. It was certainly an quick,easy read but I was hoping it would be more along the lines of other 'modern fables' I love ( Silk, Perfume...) and I just couldnt see how it had received millions of glowing reviews. I have also done a lot of reading regarding the cultural revolution and felt that quite frankly the boys in this tale had a pretty easy time of it. Some of the imagery was lovely ie. swimming in the rock pool and as it is being made into a movie I can image the cinematography will be gorgeous but otherwise pretty forgettable."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The author of this book is an excellent story teller.

It was loaned to me by a friend who knows my taste for well-written material and it did not disappoint. I loved reading this little book. And that's exactly what it is: a well-written, fine little book. Read it quickly and applaud yourself for doing so.The titled seamstress is a secondary character in this story of two young men on their forced journey through Mao's reign in modern China. She is, however, pivotal to the plot and quite compelling.

I was enchanted by the stories and characters Sijie presents -- the images of the two protagonists watching a film in order to retell the story to their villagers; of making their way down a trecherous path to share a book with the little seamstress; the old man sucking his &quot;jade oysters&quot;; and the headman announcing the time on the new watch. Each episode is a gem!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This story of two young men who are banished to rural China because their parents are seen as enemies of the state is very simply told, yet conveys the enormity of the supression of the Cultural Revolution.

I did not object to this change of pace, but it was different."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"For such a small book, Balzac and the Chinese Seamstress packs a wallop.

But instead I encountered mediocrity. What I like most about the book is that it pulls you into another world. Being able to get inside such an isolated country, especially at such a volatile time, is a rare treat. We the reader get to experience Mao's Cultural Revolution through the eyes of two of its victims.But other than that I was frankly a little disappointed. There is some nice poetic imagery but the writing is nothing special. It is a translation of a French work, so I will concede that maybe some of the beauty of language was lost in the translation. And I don't want to spoil the book, but it seems the message of the entire story is one that exalts literature and the ideas that it contains. Now the ending of the story seems to completely contradict this solid message and leaves the reading confused and unsure as of how to continue.But it was still definitely a worthwhile read. Don't worry. It won't take too much time."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is a beautifully written novel overflowing with romance, tragedy, comedy, adventure, deception, and -mostly- self-awareness.Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress may not be described as a thriller, jam-packed with great excitement on every page. But is a well-written, thought-provoking, interesting, and educational novel which keeps the reader intrigued and wanting to read more about the lives and adventures of the two best friends sent to Phoenix Mountain for re-education during the height of Mao's rule in China. Dai Sijie marvelously portrays and ridicules, with slick subtlety, Mao's program of re-education through Dai's two main characters who end up learning nothing from their work on the mountain and everything from their adventures with the Little Chinese Seamstress and their illegal books.The only flaw of this novel seems to be the ending which is quite abrupt as though Dai Sijie became tired of writing and just ended the novel. After finishing, too many questions are left unanswered and the reader is left hanging on a seemingly forced ending. Although--now having considered this point over and over, I find that maybe the ending isn't so much out of the blue as it appears. Maybe I was just so engrossed in the young boys' adventures and lives that I didn't want the novel to end and was just so upset when it finally did that I felt the need to blame it on the author, when, in fact, the ending fits perfectly and it is only my complete involvement in the boys' lives that feeds me the need to know what happens next.I definitely recommend this book to anyone able to read. Dai Sijie does such a wonderful job presenting this piece that it works your mind like a strictly educational novel, while it reads like a strictly pleasure-read book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book has been a pleasure to read...It's the coming of age story of two teenage males in China: two \\"young intellectuals\\"(who never attended high school tho:) from the city who are sent to a remote village high in the mountains to be \\"re-educated\\" by the peasants there (re-educated in hard work such as carring buckets of dung up the mountain). In their world any intellectual pursuits are banned, inclunding Western books..& when the two youths get their hands on a forbidden book by Balzac their whole world changes...The writing is lovely, the plot is touching and funny at times & interesting (this is the first book on Communist China that I've read). This book is essentially about books and the joy & power of reading...so I think anyone who loves books will love this one also...I certainly did!!!:)"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This clearly written novel is highly entertaining, enlightening, and creative. Its story takes us to a remote area of China in the early 1970s during the time of the Cultural Revolution, where two \\"city\\" friends are cast away to a forlorn mountainous area to be reeducated, Mao style, by the isolated villagers who know nothing of the modern world. The descriptions of this area are precise, as is the storytelling of the boys' plight. The miracle of this work is its direct narrative, echoing nineteenth-century Western literature, a literary tradition which enthralls both friends as they live out the nightmare of their capture as enemies of the revolution. Also woven into the book is the adolescent longing for love and sex and the joy of living, as both boys become friends with the daughter of the local hero, a tailor who travels like royalty from town to town, making clothes for the peasants.I could not put this book down. It took me on its way from the first page to the last. I strongly recommend it as a fast, extremely well-written, enlightening work of art for any reader interested in good literature that will educate as well as entertain."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This translation of Dai Sijie's novel can be poetic at times but, as is common with translated works, it can leave the reader questioning the cultural context of some passages or even sentences.The information about re-education was fascinating but left me wanting more. Sijie's original manuscript probably made more sense in its brevity, but this translation leaves the reader wondering about unfinished business.An excellent addition to a world literature reading list, though."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"With each passing day I mentally revisit scenes from this spare novel. (Spare in length and style.) The premise--the children of Chinese professionals who have been designated &quot;enemies of the state&quot; during the Cultural Revolution are sent to be &quot;re-educated&quot; by peasants in remote villages--is immediately engaging.The chances for these youths to return to any semblance of their former lives are slim. The main characters in this story, the unnamed narrator and his close friend Luo, wind up sharing quarters in the same remote village on the side of a mountain and they find solace in their friendship and with their love and admiration for the beautiful daughter of the local tailor. They also discover and steal a cache of French novels, literature that has been forbidden by the anti-intellectual Red Guard. Nevertheless, they immerse themselves in the literature and the stories give them hope of better times and release from the hardships of their transplanted lives. The books are also seen by Luo as the means by which he may transform the Little Chinese Seamstress into a civilized, urbane woman. The complications of love and re-education drive the plot. Of course, re-education comes to mean more than what the powers behind the Cultural Revolution intend: it includes what the two boys learn about themselves and their neighbors and, ironically, the consequences of Luo's presumption that the seamstress will benefit from his civilizing instruction based upon the French literature.Dai Sijie's style is clean and simple. The novel is very much about story-telling, and the narrator, in retelling his experiences, provides the model for an effective narrative (without Western Post-Modern self-referential gimmickry). The character's are endearing and memorable, the settings are vivid, and the events are believable and very, very human. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Delightful, entertaining book. I thoroughly enjoyed this little book showing a bit of Chinese history. The irony for me is how two young &quot;educated&quot; young men were sent to the countryside to be &quot;re-educated,&quot; and in so doing it, they actually &quot;educated&quot; the little Chinese seamstress as to the delights of learning and big city life. The humor is laugh out loud, and the storyline unique."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I was given Sijie's book by chance just after I finished Da Chen's &quot;Sounds of the River&quot;. Both books are set in the aftermath of China's terrifying Cultural Revolution of the late 1960's. (This is NOT the Chinese Revolution which culminated in 1949.) If you have Chinese friends or acquaintances, they, their parents or grandparents have been painfully marked by this era. Either of these books will increase your empathy and admiration for the strength of the survivors.(For Westerners the lesson of the Cultural Revolution is what happens when people who have been brainwashed by a fundamentalist education are encouraged to indulge a craving for absolute power.)Chen's book is set later in the era, when the wholesale persecution of the educated classes had quieted down and it was once more safe to study English, though with certain restrictions. The narrator is a country boy who goes to the big city to pursue a dream of studying English.Sijie's novel is set earlier, around 1973 -- most books have been banned and burned. It is a crime to own anything not written by Mao or other communist lights. Intellectuals -- doctors, writers, professors, foreign-language speakers, scientists -- have been sent to mines and farms to suffer and often die in a torture called &quot;re-education&quot;.Although the formal education of the narrator and his friend in &quot;Balzac...&quot; consists of only three years of middle school, their parents are medical professionals, so they are branded as intellectuals. They are city boys, sent to the country to learn how to be good proletarians from a bunch of reluctantly reformed opium farmers.The miracle of &quot;Balzac...&quot; is that it conveys the oppression and terror of its era without itself being oppressive. It is a coming-of-age novel filled with schoolboy pranks, loves, loyalties and animosities. In a context where every breath is high risk, the simple joys and foolishness of growing up are unbearably sweet, hauntingly beautiful and pungently funny. (I am reminded of the zen story: a man on the cliff between two tigers finds the taste of a berry delicious.)There is an additional poignancy to these two books. Each book was written in the language that the schoolboy narrator was passionately obsessed with: English in Chen's book and French in Sijie's. As you read either book, you are aware that you have in your hands a proof of the indomitability of an impossible dream. That knowledge becomes part of your reading.I found &quot;Balzac...&quot; more riveting and more emotionally gripping than &quot;Sounds of the River&quot;. The language also seemed more sure, even in translation. But I recommend you read them both: Chen first, then Sijie. Chen's narrator is more innocent and tender, and the book will give you tremendous cultural context, which will in turn make the Sijie book even more enjoyable.The ending of &quot;Balzac...&quot; is bittersweet. Is the seamstress going off to become Madame Bovary, or is she a dual of the author and the narrator, going into exile to express a new identity forged in hardship and joy?These two books will be among the very few that I return to reread."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book transports you into the Cultural Revolution in China in the 1970s through an eyewitness fictional account. The emotional and physical demands on the main characters are made palpable through Dai's prose. Their transcendence of their dilemma through literature is therefore entirely believable. The ending was sublime."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book was a joy to read. The book centers around the &quot;re-education&quot; of two young men during the Cultural Revolution in China. One is the son of a successful dentist who &quot;dewormed&quot; Mao's teeth, and the other is the son of a pulminary specialist. Because both boys were educated in western style before the regime, they are singled out, along with other fortunate sons to be re-educated in the mountains with the peasants. They work very long days in the fields, learning the ways of the worker. They befriend a young mountain girl, the Little Seamstress, and experience first love. They also meet another boy being re-educated that has a secret suitcase full of Western literature. The young men read every bit of this contraband material they can get their hands on.It is a wonderful story about the love of literature, and the struggles of growing up. It is a short book (only 170 pages or so) and has been a bestseller for months. It reminds you just how wonderful reading is."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This novel is a treasure. Dai Sijie seamlessly (forgive the pun) interweaves some great classics of western literature, such as Pere Goriot and The Count of Monte Cristo, with a beautiful and heart-rending tale. First love, treachery, blackmail, betrayal, friendship, and the struggle to embrace the humanity of the individual are set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution. A must read!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Living in societies where freedom of information is taken as a given; at least as far as general reading material goes, we take literature for granted. We relegate it to \\"spare time\\" or \\"free moments\\". Many people may read novels only during their vacations, and then be content with potboilers or those gigantic novels embossed in fake gold and silver that you can buy at airports everywhere. The real meaning of literature--its ultimate value---is lost, but not to people like Azar Nafisi and her students reading \`Lolita' in Tehran, behind the mullahs backs, and not to Dai Sijie, stuck in some rural podunk where the peasants resented him and his fellow youths from the city, treating them as badly as they dared. China's Cultural Revolution was a time of strong emotion and blind ignorance. Anyone who stood out in any way from the mass was liable to get nailed. Actually knowing anything was considered badly bourgeois. Mouthing slogans about workers, peasants, and soldiers, endlessly praising \`the Great Helmsman' brought you security which was the best you could hope for. Literature and most other forms of knowledge (for instance, maps of the world) were banned and destroyed as far as possible. It was a time of desperation for anyone who had questions.BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS comes out of that maelstrom of violence and stupidity. It surely must be the greatest novel to come out of that wasted ten years from 1965-1975. As such, it is a novel that Westerners cannot afford to miss. Not only that, but it is a great novel, a charming novel, one that you can't put down. The story is not overly-complicated, but its central theme is crystal clear. Literature never has more transformative power than when officialdom tries to suppress it. The lives of two boys sent down to a remote area of Sichuan province in 1971 change when they discover a secret trove of foreign literature, including several books by Balzac. The owner of the books, a pampered city youth, is transformed by literature in a different way--folk ballads are changed into propaganda for him. All those who listen to the literary plots that the two boys subsequently tell are changed too, the little Chinese seamstress most of all. Literature has a surprisingly powerful, but not totally unexpected effect on her. This is one of the great books of our time. Like Nafisi's non-fiction work, BALZAC & the L.C.S. brings some major issues of eternal importance to our attention. This could be a book club discussion selection par excellence. One with a bit of meat on it for once, and in only 184 pages. If you are a school teacher (in a town that won't object to a little sex) or freshman literature teacher in college, you can't go wrong with Dai's novel. Fantastic !"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The good news about this YA novel was the immersion into Mao period culture and the revelation (if you didn't already know it) of the cultural suppression imposed at that time.Also, the book was beautifully crafted writing and in that sense a joy to read. That said, the plot line wandered a bit and had very little tension considering the milieu in which it was set. It was not even close to a page turner, although it was interesting primarily because of the setting.As a character driven novel, IMHO, it falls into a more literary category."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Dai Sijie is a delightful story, although I think that the author could have made this book even better. In fact, at 183 pages, it is more of a novella than a novel.Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress opens when two teenage boys are shipped off to a remote village in the early 1970's as part of China's re-education program. The village is very primitive and doesn't even have a clock. All books have been banned except for books on science or works by Chairman Mao. These two pampered, city boys face severe culture shock. The one bright spot in their lives is the beautiful daughter of the local tailor. They also receive some special privileges when it is discovered that they are master storytellers. When they are able to obtain some illegal books, they make it their mission to introduce the seamstress to these classic works of fiction. But in being re-educated by the Chinese government, they also re-educate the little seamstress to want more out of life than is available in rural China.Sijie writes beautifully of a period in Chinese history in which he has first-hand knowledge. The descriptions of the village are authentic, and what the teens experienced is at times funny, sad, poignant and distressing. He is very convincing when detailing the dangerous mine conditions, being attacked by body lice and performing primitive dental work. But while Sijie can be very precise in his descriptions, he can be vague in other ways. We never learn the name of the seamstress or one of the teen boys, who serves as a narrator for most of this tale. I would have liked to know more about what happened to the boys. Did they ever leave the village? Were they reunited with their families? And what was the ultimate fate of the Chinese seamstress?Through it all, the power of books is the major theme. Books can provide the tools through which doors are opened, knowledge obtained, people are entertained and lives are transformed. I especially love books that teach something new, or peak my interest to learn even more. The Little Chinese Seamstress does just that.Now that I've read the book, I'm anxious to see the movie that is based on this story. I've heard that it's truly exceptional."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I came across this novel when I was looking for a good reading book. My teacher recommended this book to me and I was glad I decided to read it. Usually, I find myself spacing out whenever I read anything other than Harry Potter, but I found that my mind never wandered when I was reading this novel. It's an easy read but insightful at the same time, which made me constantly focused.Balzac becomes a light in the midst of shadows for the narrator and his friend, Luo, who are forced into a re-education program. They are sent deep into the mountains where books aren't allowed; however, they discover a stash of banned books. Among these books is one written by Balzac. These books become treasures to the two boys.Luo and the narrator meet a young lady, a Chinese seamstress, whom they secretly admire and adore. She seems to bring the same value the books present to the boys: hope in a time of Cultural Revolution.I enjoyed this novel most of all because it helped me realize the importance of knowledge in times of trouble. When I face obstacles in life, I'll look back on this novel knowing that there is hope in every situation."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"You know that the two main characters are teenage boys sent to rural China during the Cultural Revolution for reeducation. Reading exotic western literature like Balzac becomes their fortuitous and forbidden passion. As the surprising (but not surprise) ending reveals itself, at first I worried about all the metaphors I had missed (Do I need to read all the Balzac they refer to? What about the relevant Chinese figures and history?) But when you finish, it may be enough to remember -- the book is about reeducation"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's first novel explores the ability of literature to entrance mankind by following the &quot;re-education&quot; of two sons of intellectuals deemed enemies of communist China. In an attempt to ensure that the narrator and his friend Juo will not pursue the &quot;revolutionist&quot; paths of their parents, the government forces the boys to live in the mountains where their seclusion from society will hopefully result in conformity to the communist system. But when the boys discover a hidden stash of forbidden books in a friend's suitcase, they open their eyes to a new world of love and adventure, a world from which they cannot willingly return.Hypnotized by Dai Sijie's lyrical flow, one experiences firsthand the mystical power of literature to captivate one's cognition and emotions. As the narrator and his companion Juo devour Western works from Balzac and Rousseau, among others, and relate the tales to their &quot;little seamstress&quot; friend and her father, one becomes instantly enthralled by their struggles to maintain secrecy, enraptured by their experiences of first love and the hardships of jealous frienship, and spellbound with their innate abilities to recount stories to a variety of audiences. A delightful tale infused with occassional comic remarks and bound with poetic narration, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamtress successfully stresses the importance of literature while touching the soul with compassion for its literature-deprived characters."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I really enjoyed this little book. It was full of enjoyable, well developed characters and really gave a fantastic look at a small slice of the Cultural Revolution. Even though the book was short, it was full of great imagery. I was surprised by the author's lack of anger in writing about such a traumatic (I assume) part of his own past. The whole book has a bright, hopeful tone and leaves the reader feeling optimistic -- even in the face of a truly bittersweet ending."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"A charming tale. After the first chapter, I knew it was going to be a good read, and I was not disappointed. I loved the humorous and touching (but not sappy) storytelling - it definitely took me to a different time and place the couple of hours it took to read the book. Though the author did not go too deeply into the characters' lives outside of the setting of the story (the villages of Phoenix mountain in Mao Zedong's China) he did offer a colorful and vivid look into an exciting and life-changing time in their lives. I highly recommend this enjoyable book if you are looking for a quick paced, lighthearted and entertaining story. This one is a gem!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book was, in every sense of the word, a page turner. I loved how easily Dai is able to lure the reader into the foreign world of the two boys destined for re-education. Although I read this book months ago it has stuck with me. I can still remember, in detail, the vivid scenes from the mountains, farm, and mines. As I neared the final pages I kept wishing for more of the story to magically appear... I hope this book will continue to stick with me for many months more. The writing is exquisite as is the construction of plot and characters. It reads as though a gifted story teller is sitting before you recollecting a memory of their past. The best part of this book is not that it is just a captivating story but that it is also one of those few treasured books that change one's thinking and outlook. It is the sort of book that influences one's personality and infects the spirit. In a word, wonderful."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This lovely book takes place during the Cultural Revolution in China. Some speculate that Mao sent every intellectual he could find to the hinterland to throw the country into chaos and weaken his enemies; others believe he truly idealized the peasants and wanted everyone to return to their &quot;roots.&quot; Whatever his motive, it was a time of tremendous brutality; opposition was crushed, &quot;subversives&quot; were identified on the basis of an accusation by a neighbor or friend, schools were closed, social institutions withered, and teenagers were sent into the countryside to undertake backbreaking, demeaning work for which they were ill-prepared. Famine and complete disintegration of industry followed.The book does not delve into this background, but it is good to know something about it to truly understand the intellectual poverty in which these two young men lived, the power of their discovery of the book, and their feverish pursuit of the rest of the contents of the mysterious suitcase. The author beautifully describes the countryside, the backbreaking labor, the surreal world where the title of a piece of Western music can be changed to include the words &quot;Chairman Mao&quot; and it suddenly becomes acceptable. The body can withstand a lot if the mind stays alive, and although the seamstress escapes and the two young men are left behind, one senses they will survive. This is a lovely, serious, funny and endearing story all at once--highly recommended."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is a book like no other. It tells the story or two teenage boys during the Chinese revolution. The nameless narrator and his friend Luo are sent to be re-educated in a rural village when their families are disgraced by the Chairman Mao. This book tells of how they deal with encountering countless hardships, romance, and temptation.Whilst being re-educated, our duo encounters a third young man, Four Eyes, who is harboring forbidden Western literature. In exchange for certain favors, the boys find themselves submersed in Balzac, Dumas, and other such classic writers who at the time, were forbidden. Luo the in turn uses these stories to woo the Little Chinese Seamstress, the beautiful girl who lives in a nearby village and has captured both boys' hearts.Throughout all of these horrors, however, Dai Sijie manages to keep the reader's hope for the boys to prevail alive, by feeding them on comical sarcasm and amusing awkward situations. A fantastic read for anyone, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress most certainly has the qualities of a modern masterpiece."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's story of the unnamed protagonist and his best friend Luo is one book I can truly say I had a hard time putting down. This review can not possibly describe Dai Sijie's words and descriptions that depicts the story of the two boys and their struggle to beat the \\"reeducation\\" of the Cultural Revolution of China. The book captivates one's mind and soul; you will find yourself constantly searching for what will happen next to these two boys while you cry, laugh and sympathizing with them along their journey. Even if the reader has no concept of the terrible hardships of the Cultural Revolution of China, the reader can grasp the idea from the novel, no former background is necessary before reading the novel. The boys discover love, hope and friendship, a combination that would seem to contrast the horrors and sacrifices made during the Cultural Revolution. This novel is a must read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. When I first started reading, I was a little apprehensive, but as soon at the stories of Luo and that narrator's lives came about, I was hooked. I learned so much about the Chinese Revolution that I had not previously studied in school. The friendship and the eagerness to read, in both of the boys, made the book that much more enjoyable. The comic relief also made the story very interesting. I would have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Don't let the size of this book fool you--there is a big story packed into it.

While trying to survive, they make two interesting discoveries--a suitcase full of classic banned books and a lovely seamstress with a dynamite body and a desire to learn. The books open up a new world for all three of them, dramatically changing the way they looked at their world. Their explorations and self-discovery make for an entertaining and quick read. Even the illiterate villagers had their lives changed by these books. The village tailor, after a dramatic reading of the Count of Monte Cristo over 9 nights, began to fashion garments with naval insignias from the story.My recent trip to China interested me in Chinese history and culture.

Although nothing non-realisitc happens, the narrative has a magical-realism texture and beauty, contrasting nicely with what is usually a grim view of the period. Sijie has a light touch which brings out the human and the absurd. He also treats well the value of books and reading. An easy read with a little, delicate sexual content. The translation is elegant in itself. Would be an interesting follow-on to Red Scarf Girl if read in 7th or 8th grade."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"an online review can not possibly do justice to this beautifully written book. the story is simple and honest and literally transports the reader to a mountainside in china. reading this book has completely changed my view of literature and the power it has to inspire and fuel the mind. this book should be manditory reading (what would chairman mao say to that?!)."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Hauling buckets of human excrement up a hillside would hardly qualify as part of an idyllic coming of age for a teenage boy. But caught in this unappealing fate, the two teenage Chinese boys who are the main characters in this novel, undergo a rapid growing up and discover new worlds during their banishment to a rural community in Maoist China. Sons of \\"bourgeois\\" parents, they are naturally horrified when they first discover the daily routine to which their \\"re-education\\" consigns them. Through their talent for storytelling, they come to entertain and gain favor of the the otherwise autocratic village headman whose whims determine the extent of their toil and drudgery of their daily existence. Soon, they entertain peasants in a nearby commnity.These storytelling sessions with local peasants leads to an encounter a Chinese teenage girl,\\"the little seamtress\\" whose father's frequent absences from home allows ample time for the boys to get to know her better. But the coming of age tale in this novel does not simply revolve around this relationship. It is also their perilous encounter with a trunkful of banned foreign novels - including those of Balzac - which open the minds of these two boys to a radically different universe in which passion and grace became a counterpoint to their dreary rural environs. While living with the risk of being caught with this subversive literature, which they stumble upon in the home of another banished youth, the boys learn to negotiate their access to these books, under the watchful and deeply suspicious eyes of the youth's mother who comes to visit her son in the village.This is a charming, warm and highly readable novel, which adds to a growing collection from newly emerging Chinese novelists on life during and after the Cultural Revolution in Maoist China."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Balzac the the Little Chinese Seamstress is a wonderful little fable about the transforming power of literature.

And when they are combined to make a sentence, a novel, they become even more powerful. They can change lives, minds and hearts.

While they are there, both guys end up meeting a young seamstress whose thirst for knowledge and love for live is heartbreaking. They also come across Balzac. Not the writer himself, but his works and his books will change the trio's lives.Sijie is a moviemaker and as so has a peculiar eye for images. In the book not only are the ideas great, but also the images the evoque are perfectly beautiful. He can be funny while writing about such a dark period in China. His words are light, but not without consistence. the book is short but profund when it comes to show the importance of books in life. More than that the importance of freedom, the possibility of choosing, the right of expressing yourself. The writer has done a great work!

There really was no fluid storyline that felt cohesive here, so I can't say I really enjoyed it. The setting and plot were there, but just not as well-developed as I would have liked.

Sometime after reading the book, I read more about the Cultural Revolution and found that the author's descriptions of the boys' journey to the village where they worked was a very accurate one---and described an experience that many young Chinese lived through during the Cultural Revolution.I enjoy books like this one--books which transport the reader to another place and time and tell a story through which the reader can experience something that others have lived through."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"A good, quick read about two young boys who are best friends sent for \\"re-education\\" into the deep rural provinces of China.

The narrator and Luo get their hands on a book written by Balzac and they develop a thirst for more good works to read. There is only a small amount written about the sufferings and humiliations that the educated Chinese suffered during Chairman Mao's initiation of \\"re-education.\\" There is one hysterically funny vignette where Luo and the narrator drill the decay from a peasant's tooth with the village tailor's sewing machine.

It was enjoyable, but I found that a slight melancholy settled over me after completing the book. What I liked was that the main characters were thoroughly human. At first, their resigned acceptance of their \\"re-education\\" was hard to comprehend. However, detailed (but not tedious) descriptions show that the despair of their situation is in stark contrast to the human spirit that still burned within the two boys. My favorite scene on this count was when they acted as a dentist to the overbearing village leader. My only complaint is that some of the symbolism was a bit much. What was it with that raven, anyway? Overall, however, this was an enjoyable book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The characters in this little book are ripped from their families and their familiar environment. In this situation, fine literature becomes their guide. The characters seem realistic about their current situations. Balzac and Dumas are the only available sources of information about other cultures. Due to their youth and lack of other reliable guidance, it is doubtful whether they were able to process that information appropriately in order to be realistic about their future choices and hopes."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I thought this book was a little bit over-hyped. Thus, while it is good, I am only giving it 4 stars. I was expecting something a little more weighty with regard to the substantive issues surrounding reeducation.At times it was funny; at other times it was poignant and touching. There were two protagonists in the story: the narrator (his name is never divulged) and the narrator's friend, Luo. Both the narrator and Luo were gifted teenage boys who were sent away to a remote village to be \\"reeducated\\" during the Chinese cultural revolution.The overall theme of the book was not really about the reeducation of these two Chinese boys. Rather, the book was about love and the romantic relationship between Luo and a demure, beautiful, sheltered and uneducated Chinese seamstress who lived in the next village. The manner in which Luo courted the Chinese seamstress was to read to her from forbidden books by great writers that had been smuggled into the village in which Luo lived. Works by the author Balzac were among the books that had been smuggled into the village; Luo read some of these works to his love - - thus, the book's name is Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress.Overall, the book was filled with imagery and was poetically written. I enjoyed the writing style, but I was looking for more of a substantive story line about the trials and tribulations of reeducation.The ending was very interesting. I won't give it away here, but the book leaves you wondering - were Luo's attempts to educate the little seamstress helpful to him or harmful? The seamstress does something very surprising in the end that can be viewed as either positive or negative, depending on who you are identifying with in the story.Regardless of whether the end is viewed as negative or positive, the main thought is that the depth of written words and the beauty of a novel have the power to significantly change lives. Balzac and the other authors Luo shared with his love certainly had a direct effect on the little Chinese seamstress.I think the book may have had more of an impact on me had I read some works by Balzac first. Then, I probably would have identified more with the imagery. I would certainly suggest that one start with an overall knowledge of Balzac's writings. Maybe you will get more out of the book by taking this approach."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"During 1966 to 1976 China went through a cultural revolution inaugurated by Mao Zedong attempting to prevent development of a bureaucratized Soviet style of Communism. As a result, schools were closed, teachers and intellectuals were persecuted and people were encouraged to join Red Guard Units which enforced Mao's cult of personality. It is during this chaotic time in China that \`Balzac and the little Chinese seamstress' take place.It is interesting to me the way this book was written. The story is told as if you are sitting with the narrator as he casually tells you his story. Since the novel is written this way, you never get the name of the narrator, only the names of the people involved in his life. The novel vividly paints the story of the main character and his best friend Luo and their trials of their segregated life of \\"re-education\\". The two seventeen-year-old boys are condemned to serve four years of this \\"re-education\\" living in a shack on a remote mountain performing tedious tasks such as carrying buckets of excrement for disposal and working tiring hours in fields.Despite their impecunious living conditions, the boys manage to entertain themselves by story-telling and by the narrator playing his violin. The headman catches wind of their amazing story-telling ability and orders them to periodically go into town to watch a movie, then come back and retell it in graphic detail. The boys encounter a beautiful young girl in town who works with her father as a seamstress. Luo is stricken by her beauty, but will not consider her for a wife until the girl becomes sophisticated and cultured. This presents them with a dilemma until (by chance) they come across a suitcase of forbidden Western literature. The boys devour each book while at the same time sharing the stories with the little seamstress. These books have a profound effect on the lives of everyone involved.The story was very well told and engrossing. It was a very short and easy read (only just shy of 200 pages). I read the book in just a couple hours while on a road trip. I think this would be a great read for young adults. It makes you see how lucky we all are to have such a vast range of books so readily available to us."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"\\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" is pretty significant on all levels. It opened my eyes to communism in China in the 60's and 70's in that although I had heard of the \\"re-education\\" of the youths from intellectual and political families, I had never really considered the harshness of it all.This novel touches upon the humanity of man in ways that, I suspect, are as common as when civilization first began. I was especially captivated by the manner in which myths and legends probably appeared among unsophisticated and rather simple people who are closed off from the communications of the larger cities.I was intrigued that his friend found the beautiful little seamstress \\"too uncultured\\" to love at first, even though he made love to her. And was mesmerized with the actions of the beautiful girl once she is exposed to knowledge."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's memoire is an informative and satisfying description of China in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution. The works as a powerful indictment of Mao's destructive legacy. At the same time, Sijie paints a beautiful and affectionate picture of his land and its people.I was puzzled at first by conclusion of the romantic subplot involving the seamstress. From a western perspective, she places altogether too much importance on the popular French literature with which she is wooed by her intellectual suitors. My conclusion is that the author is using this storyline to emphasize how China's cultural vacuum actually left the country susceptible to the Western influences that Mao most wanted to suppress."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is mainly the story of two city boys exiled to a remote mountain village for re-education during China's infamous Cultural Revolution. (Chairman Mao Zedong altered Chinese history in the 1960s and '70s, forcibly sending hundreds of thousands of Chinese intellectuals to peasant villages for \\"re-education) Once in the village and preforming menial tasks, he boys discover that another boy like them has a stash of western books translated into Chinese, something that would be forbidden in that time, when this boy leaves the village he is in, to go back home the boys steal his suitcase full of books, which allows them to to survive their mundane lives. The book has a lot more to the story, and is very well written."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Like Michael Cunningham's The Hours and Balano's 2666, this book illustrates how life and literature can be tightly woven together. It also shows the dangers of literature both literally (reading the wrong books during China's Cultural Revolution could get you killed) and figuratively (books give us \\"big\\" ideas and can be weapons of seduction).The simple, direct style of the narrator is refreshing given the heaviness of the subject. Rather than interpret the events of their lives as they unfold, the characters accept and embrace them - from relocation, to mine work, to unwanted pregnancies. All without the self-pity that can lead to pedantic musings. They take the same kinds of small risks (illegal literature and sex) that so many of us take without thinking things through. It may be because the characters are naive or simple minded. More likely it is because they are simply young.And the threats of the time do inform the narrative at every turn (forced relocation starts the story). It is just that not every novel set in an oppressive environment needs to be about oppression per se. Most people do not heroically fight or obsequiously acquiesces to the vicissitudes of history. They roll with them - and still challenge the system through universals like falling in love, getting inspired by literature, helping people learn to read, and solving personal problems. Sijie (and Rilke for the English version) illustrates this beautifully, reminding us that \\"life goes on\\" without excusing the evils that may impact it."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Great book!

The book itself is small and thin and for someone who hasn't read a book in a while easy to get into. I loved the way the 2 boys dealt with their daily lives while in a small mountain village being re-educated during the Mao area. The love story that develops between one of the boys and the seamstress is sweet. The setting of the story in the vast mountainous China has a romantic feel to it. The author makes it very easy to make one feel as though you were right there alongside the characters. The seamstress' emancipation at the end seems encouraging for the women as well as the society as a whole in China. I personally would have wished for a nice, warm, fuzzy ending as that was the frame of mind I was in. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Oh, the power of words. This book so powerfullly explores what words/books can do for people. This is my 2nd time through this insightful book, and I found the writing compelling and substantive. Living in China and teaching at a university right now, made me appreciate the people in this story. The characters were absolutely delightful and memorable. The book tells of a very significant time in China's history, so I found it very entertaining and an easy, short read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I enjoyed Dai Silje's \\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress.\\" The story is beautifully written and is both enlightening and engaging.The book tells the story of an un-named protagonist, his friend Luo, and the also un-named little seamstress. Set in China during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, the narrator/protagonist tells of his life in the village where he and his friend Luo are being \\"reeducated\\". In their village, the boys spend their days hauling buckets of filth up and down a hill. After discovering their talent at storytelling, though, the village headman gives the boys a reprieve: they get to take regular trips into the city to watch movies. They are then required to tell the stories from the movies to the villagers. During one trip, they meet the little seamstress, and both Luo and the narrator are charmed.In the course of events, a friend of the boys (whom they call Four-Eyes for his glasses) gives them a book. It is a translation of Balzac's \\"Pere Goriot\\"--Western literature, to which neither Luo nor our narrator have been exposed yet. When they read the book, both are awakened to the joys of taking a voyage via books. They learn of places they've never seen, people they've never heard of, and experiences they've never had. Not surprisingly, they boys quickly become addicted to books. They repeatedly beg Four-Eyes to loan them more, but Four-Eyes refuses, afraid that the government will find out and punish him for owning the books. It isn't until Four-Eyes is leaving the area that Luo and the narrator manage to steal Four-Eyes's suitcase full of books. Once they have the stash, our two young men become enchanted by the spell of books. They share the stories they read with the little seamstress, with whom both boys are in love, but who loves Luo in return. Luo hopes to help the little seamstress learn and become an intellectual. In the end, he meets his goal, but with an unexpected twist. Is the ending happy or sad?\\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" is a lovely story. It was fun to read, and I feel enriched for having read it. The end feels abrupt and left me questioning what the outcome was, but that fits with the novel as a whole. It's a fairly short book, so it doesn't take long to read, but it's a good book to sit and savor. I would have enjoyed more denoument at the end, but I was satisfied despite that."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Two teenage boys are forced to be reeducated during the Chinese revolution. They were sent into the mountains to be separated from their parents, all four of whom were intellectuals, and enemies of the state.While in exile, the boys came upon a cache of western novels that had been translated into Chinese. They relished these books. However, one of the boys, Luo, used them to help cultivate an uneducated, beautiful mountain girl and instill in her a level of sophistication she was lacking.He got much more than he bargained for.This is a tightly constructed, mostly well written novel."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"*NO SPOILERS*So this book is about two boys' re-education in China during the Mao years. Fair enough. Unfortunately there's a lack of tension to drive the novel, and often the author digresses into superfluous description and metaphor. In a handful of cases his sentences are joyously fresh (like when Luo speaks of ginko seeds), but more often that not I felt like I was indulging his nostalgia without being able to experience it myself.If you have anything better to do, even washing dishes, you will put this book down. Luckily halfway through the pace picks up, and the last 40 pages grip you. The flash-in-a-pan ending gives great meaning and complexity to the novel as a whole, and I'd argue this outweighs the burden of getting there.A final gripe, I wish the Little Seamstress's character had been fleshed out more. She was intangible, a prop, something pretty that couldn't be touched, and while I understand her necessity to the plot's structure I couldn't help feeling disappointed by the lack of insight into her motives. Come on man, this book has \\"Balzac\\" in the title and you're not going to give us dynamic and real characters? Even if we're limited by the narrator's voice and views, you'd think - since the novel was written in retrospective - that he could have given more life to her memory.Bottom line: read it."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The narrator and his friend Luo are the privileged children of city intellectuals, until they are sent into the country to be reeducated through work, to better conform to the ideals of Communist China. During their story they meet the little Chinese seamstress, and come across a forbidden stash of western literary works, including by Balzac, which become very influential in their lives. Are the western works really as dangerous as their leaders would have them believe?Quote: \\"At that instant, the glint of the vigilant Communist reappeared in the headman's eyes, and his voice turned hostile. \`What's the name of this song of yours?' . . . \`Mozart is thinking of Chairman Mao.'\\"I really wanted to like this book more than I did, but it didn't work out.

Of course the tragedy of the culture revolution cannot be overlooked; neither can the beauty and stories of the Chinese history.I also thought the story didn't develop enough, especially at the end. Dai very sloppy did not handle the little seamstress' distress nor did he explain what happened between the two friends as a result of what took place.

I always enjoy reading books that have a little history or that gives you a little insight into the customs and traditions of other countries and this one does all of that. I learned quite a bit about the history of China during the period of the 1970's. Well, you might say \\"just take a history course\\" but I really don't like reading history books. What I enjoy are books that incorporate history into an interesting story. The story line is centered around two young adults who have to endure a difficult time through no fault of their own. There is drama and there is romance. The end is quite a bit surprising also."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This book was vivid and different. It had been on my list to read for a long time. The writing was rich, the vocabulary expansive, and the metaphors florid. Taking place during Mao's Cultural Revolution, the main characters are being \\"re-educated\\" by hard labor in the remote mountains, where they make the acquaintance of a lovely little seamstress. Having absconded with a bootleg cache of illegal western literature, they lavish it on her and end up squandering it in the end.I give this book only four stars. This is not because of the gruesome details I hated to hear about, which ranged from raging lice infestation, to drinking warm, curdled ox blood, or drilling a tooth with a sewing machine -- although I could have definitely done without any of that! It is more the fact that the beginning of the book depicted how hard their life was under their reeducation, which was made all the more palpably authentic since the author, Dai Sijie, had lived through this himself. But by the end of the book, there is such free coming and going from the little seamstress' house -- including leisurely, idyllic swims in a hidden, limpid pool -- that it illegitimatized all that you were made to understand about the oppressive strictures of their situation. This inconsistency was distracting and undermined the story for me.The aspect regarding the effect of great literature on starving minds was interesting, but after the extraordinary weight put on plumbing the depths of this, its eventual flippant destruction was not believable. This was to serve, I suppose, as evidence that their \\"re-education\\" was actual and complete, despite having access to powerful and influential material.I am left sad, but with a curiosity about the acclaimed author, Balzac, who I know nothing about, but for whom I now entertain a possible desire to read. I may have gotten more out of this book if I had been familiar with Balzac, as I presume many French readers would be. (This book was expertly translated from its original French and won many accolades there.) What the little seamstress got out of Balzac is a woman's beauty is her treasure. This is a decidedly (and incongruously) French theme for a Chinese book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is the story about two friends who are suddenly sent for reeducation in the new communist regime.

The two boys, at the peak of adolescence, work hard and fall in love with the beautiful \\"little seamstress\\", a teenager in the small town a little bit farther than their village. In the romance between the main character's friend and the little seamstress, encounters ensue that are both creative and very catching. In the book, the author tries very hard to attach us to the little seamstress. But he doesn't do so successfully. There are also lots of quickly inserted bits to make the story fit together: details that aren't mentioned to until the end. Otherwise, this story, which is not the typical novel but a tale without the fantasy, (but no so realistic that it looses its mystical tone)is quite a beautiful read that I would recommend."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I wish Amazon had half-star ratings because truly this is more a two and a half star book. It's a sweet little story, cliched in some parts, charming in others. The writing is not particularly great, but it's hard to tell in a translation.

Thebook has elements of a growing up story, and a commentary on totalitarianism.It succeeds somewhat in the first, but I found it a bit too shallow to reallyconvey the full experience of China in the 60's.I have a distinct feeling that much of the beauty of the book may have beenlost in translation (somewhat ironic, given the importance of good translatorsin the story). The prose strikes me as too pedestrian, given the intent of theauthor, and the poetry of the accompanying movie (the author made a filmwith the same name).I would rate this 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is a delightful tale about the resilience of the human spirit and the power of literature. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, two young men, friends, have been exiled to the hills of an impoverished village for \\"re-education\\". Both their fathers are professional medical men. Even in the midst of back-breaking, mind-numbing labour, the two heroes of this tale grow and revel in the story telling art. They discover a trove of novels and share them with members of the village, as well as the little Chinese seamstress of the story. The Cultural Revolution in China is convincingly portrayed. I understand that the author was also re-educated during seventies.The only drawback to my complete enjoyment of this book was that for some reason I could not really identify with either boy, particularly Luo. Normally with a book of this length and this well-written, I would read it in one sitting. I found that I could lay it aside and get into another book, then come back to it. This is a minor caveat, though. Their story is very real and their art of story-telling and their enjoyment of the novels are palpable. The ending is delightful and surprising."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Dai Sijie's little novel is a masterpiece of subtlety, history, and the resilience of the human mind and spirit. His characters are caught up in one of the most horrifying events of the modern era - the Chinese Cultural Revolution - and are challenged not only to survive in the physical sense, but in the intellectual sense as well. They hang on desperately to their lives, their intellect and their friendship - and their story is both moving and inspiring, and not without some healthy humor. The love story that makes up part of the plot is both a familiar and a singular one - and very touching in many ways, without being maudlin. I read the book in a single sitting, in a couple of hours - but I plan to re-read it, taking more time with it, in order to savor the language and emotions a little further.The story told here is one that is uniquely Chinese, but one that is universal at the same time. Despite (or perhaps because of) all of the attention given to the Cultural Revolution by the media and by governments in the West, little is really known outside of China of what it was actually like to pass through this time. This book is an invaluable look at a huge event that changed the lives of millions of people forever - a look at how grand plans made by leaders (no matter how well-intentioned) can go horribly wrong when put into action.There's a mention on the jacket of this novel that it's being made into a film - after reading it, I can easily imagine it. The writing is extremely visual - I could picture the characters and the action with little effort. In the hands of the right director and writer, it could be done with timeless results. I hope that the author is involved in the process - the gentle power and beauty of his language should be retained as much as possible."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"&quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; is the story of two Chinese adolescents being &quot;re-educated&quot; in a mountain village. Together they perform menial labor, try to preserve their perfunctory city education, and meet the beautiful &quot;little seamstress&quot; who lives on the mountain.This is a short, sweet, enjoyable book. The prose is light and easy to read, although it occasionally bears the mark of awkward translation. The story is advanced in a concise, measured way; few short novels are this complex without seeming overloaded. The book is a delight to read: interesting and a bit dark without being obscure or depressing, and full of joie de vivre.The major shortcoming of the book is its abbreviated length. The author affords so little space to each plot segment that it is difficult to distinguish the important themes, and the ending is so sudden that it leaves the reader unsure of what it is supposed to mean, or whether it is supposed to mean anything. The outcome does not, in retrospect, seem inevitable or even understandable. A fuller treatment of the story, including further discussion of the works of Balzac (a French author whose works are referenced but not explained), would make the ending more powerful and provide a more satisfying experience. However, despite this flaw the book is unusual, enjoyable, and interesting."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"There has been so much hype surrounding this book that I think I expected more. Maybe that's not fair to the book; I haven't decided yet. I do know that when I bought this book, I expected to be plunged into the world of Mao Tse-tung's China, not France, but &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; is about as French, in its attitude and outlook, as a book can get. This really shouldn't be surprising since the book's author, Dai Sijie, has lived in France for twenty years now.&quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,&quot; despite being very, very French in outlook, does take placein the communist China of Mao Tse-tung. It concerns Mao's re-education plan for intellectuals and perceived &quot;enemies&quot; of the people.The book's opening scene is perhaps its very best. The unnamed narrator and a boy called Luo arrive at the mountain village where they are to be &quot;reeducated.&quot; The narrator, who is playing a violin, immediately angers the peasant in charge of the camp, who then proceeds to tear the violin from the narrator's hands. Luo, however, saves the day (and the violin), when he grabs it and begins playing a piece called, he tells the peasant, &quot;Mozart is Thinking of Chairman Mao.&quot; The peasant smiles, grateful that these two errant boys are learning their lesson so quickly!As we read on we find that Luo's father, a famous dentist, had spoken openly against Chairman Mao, something the narrator calls, &quot;beyond belief, an unpardonable, insane crime....&quot; The narrator's parents were almost as bad; they were doctors who had enjoyed a good reputation and income. Because of the &quot;crimes&quot; of their parents, both boys were deemed &quot;tainted&quot; and sent to be reeducated.Life in this mountainous village really isn't about reeducation, it's about subjecting oneself to Mao and the party. And, the more one needs to be reeducated, the harsher is his work. Luo and the narrator are given one of the worst (and most humiliating) jobs of all: carrying buckets of excrement to be emptied. They find almost nothing to nourish and sustain them in this harsh and unforgiving environment until they meet and become friends with the daughter of the local tailor...the Little Seamstress of the title (who is, sadly, never named).Enter Four-Eyes, a friend of Luo and the narrator who hails from their own home village. Four-Eyes, whose mother is a poet, has naturally become an &quot;enemy&quot; of the people. But Four-Eyes is also the keeper of a veritable treasure house of secrets in the camp. He has, hidden away in a old, leather suitcase, copies of Western books, the very books that &quot;the people&quot; have been expressly forbidden to read. When Four-Eyes shows his friends a volume of Balzac, magic happens and the lives of the boys take a 180 degree turn for the better. (It is very interesting to note that most of the books Four-Eyes has secreted in his suitcase have been written by French authors.)Luo, who has become enamoured of the Little Seamstress, attempts to both impress and &quot;civilize&quot; her by reading her Balzac. Let's just say that both Luo and the Little Seamstress enjoy success beyond their wildest dreams. The Little Seamstress feels &quot;carried away in a dream,&quot; while Luo feels he is &quot;falling headlong into a story of awakening desire, passion...love...all the subjects that had...been hidden....&quot;While this book is quite lovely and definitely for adults (the subject matter is probably too sophisticated for most younger people), there is a very juvenile air to the story. The characters are, after all, juveniles themselves, mere adolescents.Sijie is primarily a filmmaker, so I suppose references to film are inevitable in the book, however, I found them tremendously off-putting, almost to the point of ruining the book's delicate and ephemeral qualities. Describing his characters, Sijie says one &quot;could have walked straight out of a bad comic film.&quot; Another has &quot;arms as thick as Sylvester Stallone's.&quot; Not what I expected in a book set in Mao's China.Luo's storytelling ability wins the boys the opportunity to visit the local movie theatre in a nearby town. After seeing the films, they stage &quot;oral cinema shows&quot; for the villagers. I would have liked the book far more had the references to cinema been left out. I felt they were unnecessary and definitely detracted from the book's charm. They are not badly written, though, and other readers may like them.This is a relatively short book and it is quite episodic rather than being a conventional novel. Its message (and it does seem to have a message) seems to be two-fold: literature is life-affirming and, be careful what you wish for, for you just might get it.While &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; wasn't one of my favorite books, it is entertaining and quite beautiful in spots. I think most people who read it will definitely enjoy it."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is an enchanting though serious-minded little book that actually has a lot in common with Ray Bradbury's classic \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", especially since both stories revolve around a totalitarian society that has sealed itself off from literature and how someone recognizes the oppression and dares to break free from it. This novella tells the story of two city teenage boys exiled to a remote mountain village for re-education during China's Cultural Revolution of the sixties. There the two friends meet the daughter of the local tailor and discover a hidden treasure trove of classic Western literature in Chinese translation. This proves fortuitous to them as they venture into worlds they never imagined.What I liked most about this book is how author Dai Sijie conveys the rapture of losing oneself in the words and stories found in these books while the characters lead desperate lives in a dreary setting. Under the author's light narrative touch (which was translated from French), the reader is left with the conviction that the mind and soul matter - that trying to control them by banning books and restricting education is wrong and intolerable. The book offers a good yet intimate picture of China during the Cultural Revolution -- the outrages, the petty humiliations, and the incredible poverty in the Chinese countryside. At the same time, the story moves too quickly given the scope of the theme. The net result is that Sijie does not dig deep enough into his main characters, thus making the lack of closure at the end less than satisfying though inevitable. Regardless of the shortfall in its pacing, this book is a fine little read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Once in a while, you will read a book that can truly relate to you. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is such a book for me, it relates to me directly, indirectly and from everywhere and in every level.Why I find this little novelette so enchanting? Because it tells a story so convincingly and I would not expect many of the readers especially for those who have not personally experienced the way of life in China during the time of the Culture revolution as I was could fully appreciate what was told in this story. As I read it in one sitting, all of those memories suddenly came alive as vivid as yesterday.In the Culture Revolution, people were being brain washed, and they would not understand what really went on outside of China. Books that even remotely resemble the western culture were being listed 'Yellow' (meaning reactionary or undesirable in its content) and banned. During which time, finding a book to read other than those preaching the communist doctrines was unthinkable, Balzac's books in translation had always been on my constant ALL TIME seeking list without ever being succeeded until I finally had a chance leaving China in the early eighties.This is a book tells a story encapsulating that period in China and more importantly it tells what really went on inside people's minds which could only be drawn from a true life experience as I believe Dai Sijie must have lived such a life himself. The story itself is fascinating even for those who have no such real life experience in China but undoubtedly for those who have, it guarantees to touch you emotionally as it have done to me.I have read the first two of The Rabbit books by John Updike, which I understand it conveyed true sentiments to many Americans who lived through the depression and Vietnam War, although I wouldn't say it related to me in the same sense, but nevertheless it commended nothing but the most rewarding reading pleasure. And in the same spirit, this book can be an excellent reading for any one who wishes to understand a bit more of the culture and its diversity in just one sitting.I wish not to leak and spoil the story of Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. Read it yourself, you will find it an emotional roller coaster that would not stop until you finished reading it. And even after that, the story will remain with you for a long, long time. For those who would not ride high with me due to lack of certain understanding as I explained having lived in China, then it is still a good story to read. You have absolute nothing to loss except a few hours of your reading time in exchange for an experience that you wouldn't want to personally live through it.Highly recommended, a 5-star at least."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"In &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,&quot; the narrator and Luo was sent to the mountain area to be re-educated under Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution in 1971. The young men were separated from their parents who were medical professionals and were considered by Mao as enemies. Life was difficult for the narrator and Luo as they were assigned works that were both physical and at times can be dangerous. Their lives took to a good turn when they met the &quot;Little Chinese Seamstress,&quot; the daughter of the village's popular tailor. Soon, they discovered that their friend from the city, Four-Eyes had been harboring translated Western literatures which were highly illegal. The young men craved for the literatures and when Four-Eyes offered a book by Balzac, their lives were transformed. Soon, they wanted to read all of Four-Eyes's books.I definitely highly recommend &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress.&quot; It is magical and the author is vivid in his description of the mountain area. In addition, I also enjoy the historical information that the author provided, giving insights into life during the Cultural Revolution. The book is beautifully written and his style of writing is very mesmerizing. At the end, he leaves you wanting for more. This is a simple story told in a simple way, and that is what makes the book wonderful."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"My sister, Rachel, gave me this book last week, saying that I would love it, and indeed I did! This is the story of two young boys, teenagers, who are sent to the country to be \\"re-educated.\\" Their crime is that they know how to read and that their parents were educated.This all takes place in China during Mao's \\"Cultural revolution,\\" where he attempted to dumb down the entire populace.I am a writer myself (Safe Sex in the Garden) and I love and appreciate terrific writing--and there is plenty of it here in this slim but strong novel. It is powerful to see how much these boys value the one book of Balzac that they steal--they're allowed no books at all. It is interesting to see too, how reading one book, one good book at any rate, how it can change one's life. The charming and beautiful Little Seamstress, and what happens to her, is an example of this power of a good book.This is also a very honest, funny, often sexy book. The crystal clear writing sparkles at every surprising turn. Do treat yourself to this little marvel if you love books."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Do yourself a favor and begin this book in the morning, for you won't be able to put it down. I loved it! The prose flowed (it's an amazing translation), the characters were beautiful, the setting was austere; I loved everything about this book. For those who don't like the ending: it's not an American novel. It's more French, so get over it. I had never read anything set during the Cultural Revolution, and I found it fascinating. I wonder if the author went to France because he read so many illicit French novels, or was it just coincidence? I teach World Literature, and I can't wait for my students to read it. They take their education for granted, and this novel will show them that there are places in the world where an unimpeded education is illegal. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The setting is China, under the rule of Chairman Mao, in the 70s during the Cultural Revolution. Two young boys are sent to a poor peasant village, Phoenix Mountain, where they are to be \\"re-educated\\". However, unexpectedly, here on this desolate mountain, enduring long laborious hours, the boys find the love of their life. Two loves actually, that intertwine and leave the boys changed forever.The two boys are given a task by the village headman to go into the neighboring village, watch a movie and then return to tell the story to the headman and the village people, \\"an oral cinema show\\". On their trek into the neighboring village, the boys meet the beautiful little seamstress. They also stop for a visit to their old friend, four-eyes, whom they have discovered has a suitcase of forbidden books. The two boys plot a way to obtain the books, and in succeeding, they free their mind and spirt from the harsh world of Phoenix Mountain and into the beautiful far-away world of authors like Balzac, Gaugin, and Dumas.The boys decide to bring the beauty and excitement of the books to the Little Seamstress. One of the boys, Luo, hopes to transform the Little Seamstress with the books from a simple peasant girl to an educated woman. Luo succeeds in this endeavor, however, not to his liking.Dai Sijie, a \\"re-educated\\" man himself, tells a wonderful story of survival, love and heartbreak all the while exposing an accurate picture of life during China's Cultural Revolution."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"An enchanting novelette with several themes - the Chinese cultural revolution, coming of age, first passion, and love of arts and literature. Perhaps the main theme is the indefatigability of human qualities such as imagination and quest for beauty in spite of oppression.The story begins with two young men from the city arriving on Phoenix Mountain, the place they have been sent to by the Chinese government for reeducation, both guilty of being the sons of doctors. Life among the peasants is bleak, the jobs assigned to them the most menial and dangerous and there is no intellectual stimulation. Over time though two important things happen - first they meet the \\"little seamstress\\" the most beautiful and intelligent girl on the mountain, daughter of the area's tailor - and later they come into possession of a secret cache of forbidden books, all translations of western novels. At this time period, all books were banned in China except for those written by Mao and his cronies and technical manuals, the boys have never seen foreign fiction before and now they have Balzac, Flaubert, Emily Bronte, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, Dickens, and many others, whole new worlds to explore.Quick to read with vivid descriptions, I will never forget the old man with the bed full of lice and jade dumplings with salty sauce. Also loved the ending, the little seamstress has absorbed all the education Luo has to give and keeps moving on the path of self discovery."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I was very interested in this book at first because it had caused a sensation in France and even my French teacher mentioned it in class. Also because the film version was supposedly very good.The image on the cover also made it very interesting. However, when I was reading it, i realized that it did not meet my expectations. This book is too unrealistic- it tries to hard to be sentimental, to be idyllic and sometimes to be funny. There is something about this book that isn't quite right. Both of my parents grew up during the Cultural Revolution and its true that books were hard to come by and that many people were sent to the countryside to be &quot;educated.&quot; But this book didn't feel that way. After the two boys went through their initial hardships and burden of work, it seemed like they were free to frolic with the little seamstress any time they wanted to. Also, when the seamstress consummated her relationship with Luo, it didn't seem quite right because in Chinese culture, it wasn't considered acceptable and girls are supposed to be more withdrawn. It lessens the impact of their relationship and makes it seem more like an episode of an American TV show than a chinese novella. This author doesn't give much description about the beautiful surroundings and the culture that the characters grew up with. It feels like a caucasion author, an outsider wrote this.But otherwise, I thought this novella had a very interesting story and prose though I regret paying $18 for the hardcover edition for such a short book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I bought this little volume in the airport of 9/11/2003 -- it seemed about the right size to read for my three hour flight. Discovering such a gem amidst the trash that is so prevalent these days was a joy. I felt like I had hit the jackpot.I can't wait to suggest it to my book club. I'm sure they will all enjoy talking about the boys and their devious ways of dealing with a miserable situation with humor.The ending was a shock. I had to re-read it to make sure I hadn't missed a page! I guess the joke is on Luo! He did too good a job educating the little seamstress!Ina Rilke did a marvelous job translating. I never felt I was reading a translation, not always the case.Am pleased to see so many others liked it also."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This charming book provides an interesting glimpse into China's cultural revolution, told from the perspective of a book-loving child of an intellectual who was shipped off to a remote farming community for &quot;reeducation.&quot; It is difficult to imagine a world in which books are contraband and deemed to be detrimental to one's education, but that was how Mao ran the country. This book is short, poignant, and leaves one with a lingering aftertaste."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I loved the idea of this book-- a parable set in communist China (modern yet feudal) about the wonder of literary characters and the magic of books... An intelligent, good old fashioned story with a hint of magic realism? Oooh, sign me up. I loved &quot;Waiting&quot; by Hai Jin, and was hoping for more in that vein. But this author's reach exceeded his grasp. It moved fast enough, and was an OK read, but the character development is a bit lacking... i really didnt care much about these guys, and the seamstress was barely sketched out at all. this book was a sensation in France, probably because the books that these guys gush over are Balzac and other French idols. There is also the token imagery/allusions/metaphors about communism; a buffalo is worked to death; they want to eat the buffalo but they cant by law kill one that is used for work; someone decides to push it down a ravine to kill it so they can say it was an accident; it doesnt die but lays there in pain and has to have its throat cut.... the subtext of which was rife for deconstruction in those lit classes.It could've been so much richer of a story; whoever wrote the summary on the book's jacket is the real genius. It played up everything I was hoping for in the book that actually never came through. On the plus side, I read it in about four hours... you might like it for a plane ride or something."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This clearly written novel is highly entertaining, enlightening, and instructive. Its story takes us to a remote area of China in the early 1970s during the time of the Cultural Revolution, where two \\"city\\" boys are cast away to be reeducated, Mao style, in a forlorn mountainous region by isolated villagers who know nothing of the modern world. The descriptions of this area are precise, as is the storytelling of the boys' plight. The narrative is simple and direct, echoing nineteenth-century Western literature. Both boys are enthralled with Western literature, much like kids today are taken with the latest video games, as the boys live out the nightmare of their capture as enemies of the revolution. Also woven into the book is their adolescent longing for love and sex and the joy of living, as they become friends with the beautiful daughter of the local hero, a tailor who travels like royalty from town to town, making clothes for the peasants.I could not put this book down as its story drove me on from the first page to the last. I strongly recommend it as a fast, well-written, entertaining work for any reader interested in good literature."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I loved this book. I'm so glad I bought it this year, when it is still available in hardcover, because it's a keeper. I give lots of books away, but not this one. Captivating, concise and sweet. At first I was not sure I liked the ending, but it grew on me. Also inspired me to put a few classics on my reading list. A jewel. I only wish I could have my book signed by the author. Signed an avid reader addicted to modern fiction."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"If this can be classified as a coming-of-age novel about teenage boys, it's like none you've ever read. First, it's set in China during the Cultural Revolution of Mao, second, the heroes suffer and enjoy totally unique experiences and third, it's sometimes hilarious.The narrator and his friend, Luo, both guilty of being sons of doctors, are sent to the boonies, Chinese style, for what appears to be a lifetime of \\"re-education\\", or slave labor. But they are resilient, and find solace in a secret stash of Western literature, story telling, and the beautiful daughter of a tailor.It's a miracle of talent that Sijie can portray these experiences in a novel that is often uplifting and itself a monument to beautifully written prose."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down! However, I wanted to give it only four stars because it didn't end the way I expected...at all! (That alone means it deserves five stars!) I was so disappointed, so angry at the ending. I wanted the book to continue for another 200 pages! Alas, that wasn't my decision to make so whether or not the review has four or five stars means nothing because it's still a lovely novel.Sijie's writing is beautifully-descriptive, and he is a wonderful storyteller. His words fill the reader with anticipation of what would become of his character's struggles during their \\"re-education\\" in China. All along I couldn't wait to find out what would happen to them. That's why I was so disappointed at the end. I couldn't possibly say what it is. Suffice it to say that it broke my heart.In terms of his style, his descriptions of the narrator's experience with the miller in the mountain (with the lice in particular) were so grotesque, it made me shiver. Again, his descriptions of their labor of carrying dung buckets up the mountain were so real and horrifying.There's a sudden change of narrative to three other characters halfway through the book, which was a nice change of pace. Those three chapters brought the reader directly into another time frame, another setting, as if the reader was in the same room, listening to these characters' stories.The story itself is captivating enough. I found myself dying to know what would happen to the narrator and Luo. Would they finally be able to finish their re-education and leave the fields? What would become of Luo's and the Seamstress' love? Would the Seamstress fall for the narrator? In what other ways would the discovery of Four Eyes' stack of Western classic literature change the course of Luo's and the narrator's lives? One can never guess how this story will end.I look forward to any future work by this author."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is quite a big book, packaged in a pocket-size version. There are so many themes : Love, friendship, betrayal, all tied together in Maon era of re-education.The thirst for knowledge, for reading, is not one that can be easily snuffed out.Human nature is one that will emerge, despite (and perhaps due to) the most excrutiating of circumstances.Perhaps not an ideal ending, but certainly a thought-provoking one.A quick read, but an everlasting one."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"all i can say is that i had to read it for a class, and it was very enjoyable. its a touching tale that really reminds you that no matter what happens, there is always hope."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Bought the book purely for asthetic reasons.

It tells their hardships but also contains a romantic story."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This was a relaxing read for me, though the underlying political movement (Mao Zedong's cultural revolution & re-education program) to which the story is set is quite the opposite. During this period literature other than Mao's was banned.In this story two boys, an unnamed violin-playing protagonist and his partner in crime Luo, are re-educated in a remote village away from their affluent lifestyles to haul poo. Thats right folks, they haul poo up and down the hills.Anyhow, the boys obtain some illegal European literature and introduce it to the peasant chinese seamstress, who they feel needs an opportunity to be educated. Luo begins to read her the works of Balzac to help her see the world outside her small village. This however, is not a fairytale and the ending is quite unexpected.Sijie creates warmth to the story by good imagery and adding a charming humor that works well even in translated english. My only complaint is that the story can be dry at times and took me longer to finish because it lacks an element of anticipation. However, if you are looking for a lazy evening read to go with tea, perhaps this will do just fine."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"The story and it's characters are a little under-developed but it provides a valuable glimpse into the \\"re-education\\" in China.

Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress provides an opportunity to see this revolution through the eyes of two young men. The humor in this books brings to mind the humor in Angela's Ashes. I found it empowering.I also seem to stick to reading bestsellers at the rate of maybe one book per month. As with Reading Lolita in Tehran, this book gives new ideas for some old classic books I should try to read.If you are looking for a book that is predictable and written with a formula, this isn't the book for you. But if you'd like to laugh a little, learn a little, and think a little(or maybe more), you should read this book.

They have to work in the rice and cornfields and in a small coal mine. Luo is found to be an extremely good narrator so the 2 of them are send to movies in a nearby &quot;city&quot;. Afterwards they can then narrate the story for the villagers.From another boy they get a book from Balzac, which opens their eyes for prose that is radically different from the revolutionary texts with which they were raised. When the boy goes back to his parents, they steal his suitcase full of Western books.In the meantime Luo has fallen in love with the daughter of the tailor, the Chinese seamstress. He sees it as his task to raise her cultural awareness by reading for her parts of the Western books. When Luo all of a sudden has return to his parents for 1 month, he asks his friend to look after the Chinese seamstress.The end of the story I cannot reveal, but I think it is quite unsatisfactory as is the whole book: the characters are paper-thin, the theme remains vague and there is not a lot of humor in the book, even though that is claimed.

Semi-autobiographical, the story is well told by one of these two boys, who crafted his storytelling art as a way of staying sane during less-than-sane times.

They must work hard and live roughly but everything changes when some forbidden books find their way into their hands. The boys escape into the novels, completely submersing themselves in distant worlds. They subsequently use the novels to create an oral theater in which the stories are retold to the villagers, earning the young boys time away from hauling pails up the mountain.When a traveling salesman/tailor asks them to come to his village and tell a story there, the boys seek permission from their village elder. Their adventures begin and lead them down unimagined paths, all for the love of literature.This is an intriguing story of life in China during the Cultural Revolution.

It's what frequently happens when you try something for the first time. You know, like Dr. Frankenstein's experiment with creating life. Christopher Columbus looking for a new route to India. Alexander Graham Bell calling for Watson. Banning Books. Thalidomide. Nuclear Power. Slavery. Smoking. Deforestation. The Automobile. Almost anything you can think of comes along with unintended consequences. Some good. Some not so good. Some, terrible.In this novel, the author demonstrates the law of unintended consequences by telling the story of two privileged young men in China during the Cultural Revolution. They are being \\"reeducated\\" in a poor village far from their homes. There, they meet a beautiful seamstress who has not been exposed to books, western music or the ways of the world. The boys set out to reeducate her, and, in so doing, woo her. One plays Mozart for her on his violin and skillfully acts out scenes from popular movies. The other reads to her from a forbidden cache of western books by Cervantes, Hugo, Tolstoy, Dumas, Flaubert, Bronte, Balzac and other luminaries.Because the story is related in simple language, often with slapstick humor, what should be an oppressive nightmare reads like a fairytale complete with a Cinderella, two Prince Charmings and more than one wicked villain. In the end, irony prevails over passion, demagoguery, and the best intentions of the various \\"reeducators\\"."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstrees was very well written and great for the kinds of people who just like to sit down and read a good book. This book is about the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's-1970's. It takes place during \\"Re-education\\". Chairman Mao Zedong required that chinese intellects be sent up high into the mountians to be re- educated in the uncivilized villages. The main characters include two boy's (one unamed and the other named Lou) and the Little Chinese Seamstress. Through some certain happenings the two boys obtain a suitcase full of forbidden books, one of which is written by Balzac. They read them and are fascinated by these works of art. They share these stories with others in the village and through this meet the little chinese seamstress. Lou falls in love with the young seamstress and wants to reform her from a peasant girl to an educated city girl. I will not give away the ending because it is quite suprising.

I found it poignant, well written and thought provoking. Unlike other reviewers on this site, I felt that the ending was the best part of this book. Great literature can trigger uncomfortable thoughts and actions. Without ruining too much, there was a book burning scene, which I found deeply unsettling as a lover of literature.However, I believe that the author could have developed his characters better. In addition, I wished he had delved deeper into the literary exchanges between the two main characters and the seamstress.If you are considering reading this book, I would say go ahead. It will not take you a lot of time. It will provoke some interesting thoughts. But it may not be the best or the greatest book you ever read in your lifetime-or even this year."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I read this little jewel in a day and a half. When two bourgeois city boys are sent to a remote mountain outpost to be re-educated during the reign of the Red Guard, they create havoc in the village. The novel is a paeon to absurdity amidst the misery of human experience, part Marx Brothers, part Solzhenitsyn's tales from the gulag.Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is poignant and terribly upsetting. But some of the anecdotes are so hilarious I laughed out loud. The boys play imposters, hoodwink the crafty-evil headman of the village, carry out an unforgettable caper and woo a pretty little seamstress.My paperback version noted that the book is being made into a movie. Not surprising: The whole volume reads like a screenplay. If faithful to the text, the opening scene could be a stunner. It sets the tragi-comic tone of the novel like none I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Work of simple art with a 'walk you through the story' line.

Enjoyed this noteworthy quick read."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Numerous accounts of abuse and degradation have been chronicled by those having lived through the Chinese Cultural Revolution. \\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" is unique in that the chronicling of the unnamed protagonist's tale takes place in a setting where the education wasn't conducted on a mass scale.The two young college students, clever and daring in ways true of younger people, are assigned to a remote mountain village. That is their punishment for being the offspring of China's professional class. And it is there that they are expected to perform drudgery that will expunge their elitist ways.From the local village chieftain the young men cleverly find methods to acquire bits of freedom. By becoming an entertaining and engrossing storyteller, the novel's protagonist is allowed to travel treacherous mountain passes to a nearby village where silent films are shown. Sometimes sitting behind the screen and viewing everything backwards, the viewer captures enough of the action and storyline to return and execute his assignment, that of relating the films' stories to the village to which he's confined.His homebase's dwellers, all illiterate, sit and listen with rapt attention as the silent film's content is related with great animation. Secondhand entertainment takes on a life of its own. So proficient is the storyteller that his freedoms expand, allowing him to visit \\"the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" with whom he's become enamored.The core theme of the story is the critical importance of personal, mental and intellectual freedoms. When the two young men discover a stash of forbidden books owned by one of their acquaintances who is also being re-educated, their goal becomes to surreptitiously read as many of them as possible without the owner's knowledge.Further the protagonist also feels it is his duty to educate the \\"Little Chinese Seamstress\\" about the emancipated thinking found in a volume of Balzac both young men so treasure. They succeed in a manner the reader wouldn't expect!"},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I really, really enjoyed Dai Sijie's novel. It was very French, which wasn't bad, but the ending is not what an American might expect. Still, it is a brilliant portrait of a reeducation camp during Mao's China, and has excellently developed characters. This book's plot revolves around a three boys exiled to a Chinese reeducation camp, for being 'intellectuals'. They have precious little to amuse them in the spare surroundings, and their days are filled with forced labor. When two of the boys, who are fast friends, find a stash of Western novels, their lives are changed. They read Balzac and other classic writers with zeal. Their perspecives widen, and they begin to clumsily find love. Balzac and the LCS transports the reader entirely to another world. It is a brilliant book."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Dai SijieLast year I read Dai Sijie's BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS, and I procrastinated on writing this review because I did not feel I could do the book justice. What fascinated me about the story was the idea of Mao's Cultural Revolution, which supposedly placed highly educated people in rural areas of China, so that they would be \\"re-educated\\". The plot of BALZAC centers on two young Chinese men, sons of highly educated parents (doctors and dentists), who are sent to the countryside to work among the peasants, and through living the hard life of laborers are to be taught a lesson.As the two worked the countryside and were put into situations where they were treated as low-educated laborers, they had to deny their educational heritage. Acknowledging the existence of classical music, for example, could mean punishment. No books were allowed by any means. They lived in constant fear, worried that the breath they took would be their last.Then, their life turns for the better. They discover someone who has a hidden stash of western books, translated into Chinese. They soon become obsessed with the books, and in particular one book written by Balzac. If they thought their \\"re-education\\" was a turning point, their discovery of these forbidden books is yet another turning point in their lives.The reason for the delay of this review is that although I enjoyed reading the book, I don't feel I truly understood what Dai Sijie was trying to convey to the reader. To reveal the ending will ruin the book for many, but it is the ending that I fail to understand the impact the author tried to make. Many readers have enjoyed this book that is destined to become a modern classic. But others like me fail to totally appreciate the meaning of the story of two men who tried to reclaim a life they had thought they truly lost. I am recommending this book only because I feel this is a modern classic and is probably going to become recommended reading in literature classes in the near future. I think reading this book should be required. Not only does the author have a gift of words, but also the content of this story is part of modern world history, and the knowledge of this should not be denied."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"My wife who is blind just finished this book in audio format from the Library for the Blind.She reports that it was very amusing and a good absorbing story.

The horrors that others must go through just to survive, no less to thrive! I just wish that more people could understand what a blessed existence we lead, and how so may others have to struggle to get even a smattering of what we take for granted."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"During the Cultural Revolution of China's Chairman Mao Zedong, hapenning in the 1970s, re-education of the intellectuals and professionals meant sending them off to remote villages to perform hard industrial and agricultural labor. At the same time, the communists had stripped the schools of many subjects already and many of the youth only had a rudimentary education. On top of it all, the Communists had also confiscated, burnt and banned many books that did not fall in line with Mao's Communism. In this setting, two young boys are relocated to a village for re-education. There, they become friends with another young man called 'Four-Eyes,' whom they suspect is hiding a case of banned books. One of them also courts 'the Little Seamstress,' the illiterate daughter of the tailor and eventually they become lovers. Although a fairly simple plot, it is like the Los Angeles Times Book Review says \\"an unexpected miracle - a delicate, and often hilarious, tale.\\"This book definitely took me by surprise. So well crafted. Immaculate language. Clean, crisp, and even entertaining. Besides the fantastic use of language and its somewhat serious tone, what makes this book especially pleasant is the small funny incidents and humor placed randomly and unexpectedly throughout the book. It's definitely a playful story amid China's history. One part of the book in particular was really cleverly funny. When Luo, the narrator's friend, has a fear of being taken in by the Red Guards on account of playing western music on a violin, he tells the Red Guards that they are playing 'Mozart is Thinking of Chairman Mao.\\" EVEN Mozart thinks of Mao.Lou is my ultimate favorite character in this book. He really drives the story the whole time. He's the one that suggests 'Four-Eyes' is hiding books in his case. He's sly, he's funny, and he's adventurous. Plus, he's the one that has a love affair with 'the Little Seamstress.' So much in the book surrounds around this character. Although, \\"the only thing Luo was really good at was telling stories. A pleasing talent to be sure, but a marginal one, with a little future in it. Modern man has moved beyond the age of the Thousand-and-One-Nights, and modern societies everywhere, whether socialist or capitalist, have done away with the old storytellers - more's the pity.\\" \\"How great Luo's talent was! He was able to electrify an audience by means of a perfectly timed voice-over, even when overcome by a violent bout of malaria.\\"I thought the pace and rhythm of the book really worked. It was steady and paced and there was never a dull moment. There is even a romantic element, one I didn't quite care for that much except for a scene or two in the book, nevertheless I think it adds depth to the book. If there is one favorite part abut 'the Little Seamstress' to mention it would be at the very end when she says that she had learned one thing from Blazac: \\"that a woman's beauty is a treasure beyond price.\\" I thought it was a bit hilarious. Lou spends and consumes so much of his time courting and pursuing her. He is hypnotized by her, and he uses Balzac's words to woo her. Then in the end Balzac actually hypnotizes 'the Little Seamstress' and steals her from him. A bit ironic, I feel.I definitely recommend this book to anyone with an interest in foreign literature, particularly Asian literature. It's an exceptional read, and if there was a read to start off with in reading Chinese Literature this would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is a fantastic novel in which the Chinese Cultural Revolution is the subject. This fictional tale of two boys discovering a suitcase filled with western novels in communist China explores how human nature leads us to crave what we cannot have. Ma and Lou both fall in love with a tailor's daughter who they refer to as the Little Seamstress. As they fall for the Little Seamstress, they also fall for the books found in the hidden suitcase; among their favorites is Balzac. Freedom is something that has always intrigued me and this book talks about the lack of freedom these teenagers have but still find a way to combat the government and enjoy Western ideologies in the form of books.I would recommend this book to students and anyone else interested in history or just looking for a good read. It was fast paced and unlike most historical books, was quite interesting and kept my attention through the entire book. It provides an accurate depiction of the time period and has historical value as well.

Any books, apart of Mao's Little Red Book and a handful of dry, production-oriented study books. And think, what would the biggest treasure in such a time be.Two teenagers stole a suitcase of forbidden books by Balzac and Zola, Duma and Romen Rollan, Tolstoy and Bronte from another boy, who was \\"re-educated\\" on the same Phoenix mountain. They already knew that after drinking in the melodious words and events, they will never be the same. They were destined to be transformed by the power of words which wake up the stirrings of the soul and heart; the very deep and soulful mission of books, the successful completion of which makes them survive through the centuries, being read by generation after generation.The books also transformed a young lover of one of the boys, the Little Seamstress... I will not tell you what happened to her, but in her life a book played a role of the \\"trouble-solver\\", a teacher, and an ambition-stirrer...For all the hardship mentioned in the book, it is a quick and witty read: I was laughing many times for it is impossible to NOT see the images in your mind when reading this book, the author managed to keep all of his humor despite the curves life sent him. The book leaves you breathing deeper with the happy realization of your freedom and the desire to take Balzac's work and drink it in slowly, sipping word by word through your heart, enjoying the flavor and the long-term effect it is destined to leave on the people who can switch the world off and disappear in the education of soul gifted to us by the grand master writers of the time long-gone.Victoria Evangelina Belyavskayaps It was joyful to learn that the author of the book managed to not only get educated in a University after the end of Mao's rule, but also became an author and a filmmaker in France, inspired, by no means, by the discovery of the World of Words, Feelings, Emotions and Events he found in the leather suitcase when he was a thoughtful teenager with a meek \\"three in a thousand\\" hope to ever see big city lights again."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is a very nicely written little book, with beautiful imagery, recalling a time in Chinese history that was full of fear and paranoia.

One a violinist, the other a story teller, the two find themselves in a mountain village, far from the city in which they grew up and where their parents ran afoul of the authorities. Their talents both hinder and help in their survival.The great joy in their lives is the little seamstress, daughter of a tailor living in a nearby village. Even unschooled as she is, they both fall in love with her, and spend as much time in her company as they can when not working in the rice paddies or the mine that supports the villagers. One day their lives are further enhanced when they discover another young man undergoing re-education who owns a suitcase filled with forbidden books. Then they not only love the little seamstress, they fall in love with Balzac, Dumas, and other authors whose stories transport them out of their difficult lives for hours or days at a time. Their taste for the wonders of beautiful words is nearly insatiable.This French translation is awkward in places and if not for the subject, it might have been written for young adults.

Still, it flows well and the total effect is at times magical, even to the production quality of the book itself."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I loved this book. Mr Sijie describes an important part of Chinese Revolution in such a simple, moving and deceptively unpolitical way that I was deeply moved. The story of the two teenagers in a remote village doing all kinds of work to be \\"re-educated\\" is reason enough but the story does not stop there. The power of reading books on these two young people who have been exposed to them in the past as well as one beautiful girl who has never seen any in her life is the most moving part of all.The ending of the story is very ironical and although it is disturbing (the part involving the two boys), it also feels realistic as one could expect such reactions from teenage boys who are in love.I found the translation somewhat weak at times and would have loved to be able to read the original writing."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"A fantastic semi-autobiographical fiction of two boys sent away to work in the countryside during the Cultural Revolution.

It is a fascinating period in China's history and an interesting setting for this novel.The only complaint I found with this novel is the chapters towards the end which are told from a different point of view than the rest of the story. It succeeds in changing the pace and narrative voice in the novel, however, I was confused and do not feel such a change of pace was needed.

Perhaps those more familiar with the Cultural Revolution and Mao's policies immediately saw the importance of this book. For me, I had to read \\"Wild Swans\\" to get a broader background.

This intriguing premise will reel in any dedicated lover of literature, forcing them to face the painful question: what if it was a crime to read your favorite books?

Luo takes advantage of that by changing the time now and then to gain an extra hour's sleep from a headmaster who depends upon the clock to tell him when to send him out to work. The work he does for the \\"good of the revolution\\" is grinding, filthy labor for which he's not paid. It's no wonder he tries to escape from it now and then.No one being re-educated is permitted to read anything except Mao's book of sayings, but Luo gets a hold of a book written by Balzac and the world of ideas opens. He wants other books. Then he meets the beautiful young seamstress and shares Balzac with her and now she too, wants books.Luo falls in love and wants to get them for her, not only to please her but also to raise her up from her lack of education to become something other than just a peasant girl. In his desire to \\"re-educate\\" the girl he loves, resides lies their ultimate future.This is a wonderful five star story that will take you to a place you've never been and will perhaps teach you a little about relationship and love.

Steinbeck once said of his character 'Curly's wife' from \\"Of Mice and Men\\" that he didn't give her a name like everyone else because she was just a literary mechanism...a means to an end. In the Chinese Seamstress, I think it's just the opposite, the character who gets the name is the mechanism through which the narrator, the seamstress and the reader explores the surroundings and events of rural China during this Cultural Revolution.In all, the book can be enjoyed on many different levels, if one bothers to dig deeply enough.

Only the playing of \\"Mozart is Thinking of Chairman Mao\\" saves the violin from the flames.The sheer ludicrousness of many of the situations in the book are laughable, but at the same time, have a ring of \\"crap like this REALLY HAPPENED\\" to make the reader stop in her laughter and just shake her head.There is also a love story, buried in here. It's not a happy ending, but the little seamstress does feature prominently as a star in a romance.Though I know this is a translation, it is an excellent one, and reads very smoothly.

Not only do you develop a deep sympathy for the two boys who are strapped to this remote village (surely a form of torture), but Dai's love of classical literature is infectious, and gives the reader a deep appreciation for the freedom to read.Dai moves his novel in an effortless manner, with almost no sign of the pretentious preaching one might expect from an Chinese ex-patriot.

That is their punishment for being the offspring of China's professional class. And it is there that they are expected to perform drudgery that will expunge their elitist ways.From the local village chieftain the young men cleverly find methods to acquire bits of freedom. By becoming an entertaining and engrossing storyteller, the novel's protagonist is allowed to travel treacherous mountain passes to a nearby village where silent films are shown. Sometimes sitting behind the screen and viewing everything backwards, the viewer captures enough of the action and storyline to return and execute his assignment, that of relating the films' stories to the village to which he's confined.His homebase's dwellers, all illiterate, sit and listen with rapt attention as the silent film's content is related with great animation. Secondhand entertainment takes on a life of its own. So proficient is the storyteller that his freedoms expand, allowing him to visit \\"the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" with whom he's become enamored.The core theme of the story is the critical importance of personal, mental and intellectual freedoms. When the two young men discover a stash of forbidden books owned by one of their acquaintances who is also being re-educated, their goal becomes to surreptitiously read as many of them as possible without the owner's knowledge.Further the protagonist also feels it is his duty to educate the \\"Little Chinese Seamstress\\" about the emancipated thinking found in a volume of Balzac both young men so treasure.

A funny, touching, and engaging story: two boys are among hundreds and thousands exiled to remote villages for re-education during the infamous Chinese Cultural Revolution under Mao Tze Tung. The narrator and his best friend, Luo, are accused of being sons of doctors. At the times of Cultural Revolution, doctors, engineers, and scholars are guilty of being corrupted by Western culture and ideas. Western arts and literature are subjects to governmental confiscation and burning. The narrator and Luo find themselves in the distant village on Phoenix Mountain carting buckets of excrement up and down precipitous hills and working in maize fields. They delight themselves in playing violin and spending time with the beautiful daughter of the local tailor. The boys' life at the re-education village takes a surprising turn as they discover a hidden suitcase of Western classics in Chinese translation owned by Four Eyes. For the first time in they lives the boys are exposed to the mystery of the outside world, especially the world of women, love, and sex as revealed to them by these Western writers day after day, page after page, book after book.The story is well written but somewhat short for development of the characters. Luo's passion to transform the seamstress into an urban girl by reading to her Western classics is understandable. The task however seems to be somewhat challenging. Dai has given us a fairy tale with political allegory. The ideas about how two boys exiled into some remote countryside for re-education ends up re-educating a mountain native the outside world simply seduces the reader and captures much attention. For those who experienced the infamous Cultural Revolution, the novel comes to dear to the heart.

Brief though it is, it is tightly written so that you get an engaging and informative story about a part of the world that is no doubt unfamiliar to most of us.The two protagonists are upper middle class young men who be sent from the city to the remote villages as part of Mao's Cultural Revolution. They quite literally get the \\"excrement detail\\" from the Village Elders. The Village Elder finds these two have a talent for storytelling (and dentistry as well) so they are sent from village to village, reciting movie plots to the rural populace. There is a subplot concerning collecting old Chinese folktales, nearly all of them amorous, from an older gentleman. And of course there is the love story and the critical Western connection in the form of discovered Western classics, read to the rural inhabitants at night, which gives the book its cross-cultural appeal. I would suggest watching the recent release of the film \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\", which novel receives quite a bit of attention, as educational material connected to this novel.

I like that they are willing to risk everything to read a book and experience the adventure."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"This is an entertaining and very brief novella, which nevertheless manages to be disappointing in its characterization and its cramped worldview.The unnamed narrator and his best friend, Luo, are Chinese city boys sent to a remote mountain for \\"re-education\\" in the early 1970s. While there, they pursue a local seamstress and a suitcase full of banned Western (mostly French) classics. The plot is mostly entertaining: what reader can resist a protagonist's quest to read books, complete with weird hijinks and adventures? I'm not into French literature, but this book did convince me to look into some of Balzac's work.However, the plot doesn't always come together or make much sense. We're to understand that the boys have been sent to this mountain to do manual labor, and at the beginning of the book their work dominates their lives, but it quickly falls by the wayside as the plot requires, and they're able to take off work all day every day to visit the \\"Little Seamstress\\" without anyone apparently noticing or caring. At one point the narrator tells us that he and Luo were \\"physically and especially mentally\\" marked for life by their short stint in the mines.... but doesn't say how, and never mentions it again. And the end suffers from bizarre, unmotivated point-of-view shifts.The characterization is a mixed bag, and perhaps suffers from the fact that the novel is semi-autobiographical. The narrator and Luo are decently well-drawn for such a short book. On the other hand, despite her prominence in the story, the nameless \\"Little Seamstress\\" never comes together as a real person, appearing only as an object of male desire. And everyone else who lives on the mountain--the \\"peasants\\"--are just peasants, whose role in the book is to be ignorant and primitive and awed by boys' storytelling abilities and by their \\"advanced technology,\\" like violins and clocks.Similarly, the historical aspect feels one-sided and simplified. From this book, you might think Mao's forcing a bunch of privileged city kids to go live in the country and do manual labor with ignorant peasants (horror of horrors!) was the worst atrocity in recent Chinese history. Sijie doesn't attempt to put either the protagonist's personal experience or re-education generally in any kind of context, and as far as I can tell the only thing he learned from his own experience is that he hates Communism. Not an unpopular position when writing for a Western audience, but I would've liked to see some greater understanding, some generosity of spirit, some nuance that just isn't here.On the positive side, the sense of place is very strong: I could just see this mountain, and if there's a movie version I'd watch it in a heartbeat; the visuals would be stunning. And the translation (from French) is seamless, such that I likely wouldn't have realized it was a translation had the cover not informed me.All-in-all, a bit annoying, but there's a decent enough story and it's a short, very fast read. Still, not something I'm likely to recommend to others."},{"Title":"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress","review":"I didn't think this was a story I would be interested in, but the literature was great, and the story itself, was surprisingly good.

You won't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"Unspoken Love (Arabesque)","review":"In \\"Unspoken Love\\", author Doreen Rainey crafts the tale of financial manager Natalie Donovan and Doctor Derrick Carrington. Having met during Derrick's quest to find help to save his parent's small business, these two quickly transitioned from a business relationship to a romantic involvement. As this novel begins, the story gets off to a quick start as Derrick tries to convince Natalie after a year of dating to accept his proposal of marriage.Natalie, however, refuses to move forward until Derrick's divorce from his first wife is final. Having being born to a mother who was having an affair with a married man, Natalie is not willing to move forward even though Derrick has had no contact with his ex-wife for more than a year and is simply being delayed from his freedom due to nasty negotiations with his ex. Derrick soon suspects, however, that Natalie's refusal to accept his proposal may mask a more general fear of commitment on her part. Derrick moves forward with a steely determination that Natalie is his life's mate and sets out to convince her of the same.Natalie and Derrick's story is peppered with interactions with characters from Doreen Rainey's previous novels. This infusion of characters from books in prior installments of Rainey's Love series (which include previous installments \\"Foundation for Love\\", \\"Can't Deny Love\\" and \\"Pursuit of Love\\") is nice as readers are treated to \\"updates\\" of some of their favorites including Natalie's half-sister Christine and her husband Damian.This is an intriguing tale that addresses the question of whether lovers will be driven by fears and demons of the past, or rather will let their hopes for a bright future become their guiding light."},{"Title":"Unspoken Love (Arabesque)","review":"Derrick Carrington was hopeless in love with Natalie Donovan. Derrick wanted nothing more than to marry her; but, until he was legally divorce from his first wife, whom he had been separated from for more than a year, Natalie refused to accept his marriage proposal. Or, so Derrick thought because once he finally became a free man, Natalie found yet another excuse not to say yes.All her life Natalie Donovan had been raised by her mother to believe that it wasn't safe to depend solely on a man because in the end he would always cause great heartache and pain. Natalie faithfully stuck to her mother's code of honor; that was until Dr. Derrick Carrington entered her life. Without Natalie realizing it, Derrick slowly broke through her defenses and charmed her into falling in love.But, all wasn't well for the happy couple because deep down inside Natalie was still afraid of total commitment and she truly believed that marriage meant giving up her independence. Will Derrick be able to convince Natalie to let go of the past and take a chance on building a united life together as man and wife?Unspoken Love by Doreen Rainey put a new twister on an old plot; total commitment. This storyline dealt with the heroine running away from commitment instead of the hero. Natalie's fears ran deep. She was hung up on commitment in general because of how her mother had raised her. Although, she showcased great affection towards Derrick; Natalie could never jump the marriage hurtle. Natalie was a very independent woman in every way except when it came to the matters of the heart. Derrick was a yummy man with alluring charm and refinement. I loved the way he approached making Natalie his own. He knew that he was dealing with a woman that shied away from commitment, so he took the road less traveled to earn her absolute devotion. The couple's love scenes were tenderly sweet and told in a vanilla fashion. Unspoken Love demonstrated that love can bloom in the scariest heart and that even with countless hindrances at play, love can conquer all.NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Being an admirer of C.S. Lewis, I have often wondered what it is about his writing that I find so appealing. Many times I have had the experience of reading an especially good passage from another author and thinking to myself \\"that sounds like something Lewis would have written.\\" Notice that I used the word \\"sound\\". Lewis doesn't simply convey information; he, like any good writer, writes with liquid words. And this book (\\"An Experiment in Criticism\\") is no different. The main point of the book, as many other reviewers have stated, is that readers should \\"receive\\" books instead of \\"using\\" them. In other words, don't fight the book you are reading, even if it is something that you disagree with. Lewis says that \\"we can find a book bad only by reading it as if it might, after all, be very good,\\" and that \\"...no work can succeed without a preliminary act of good will on the part of the reader.\\" Lewis defines a good book as one that \\"elicits good reading.\\" Now, to find out what he means by \\"good\\" reading you have to read the book. When it comes to criticism, Lewis says that \\"You cannot be armed to the teeth and surrendered at the same moment.\\" How many times have you read an Amazon review in which the reviewer clearly never put down his weapons? It's a wonder that they could even hold the book up to read with all the weaponry in their hands.In a chapter about realism, Lewis presents, very charmingly, a brilliant and simple argument for the adult reading of children's literature and fantasy. I myself like to read classic children's literature from time to time--admittedly wondering, all the while, if it is a fault to do so--and Lewis clearly shows how erroneous and silly that worry is. He is famous for his asides. The man truly possesses a philosophical mind. I imagine Lewis as a little boy trying to convince his dad that it would be okay if he stayed up late to read. \\"Dad, let me tell you why it wouldn't hurt anything; I have some pretty good reasons.\\" \\"Jack,\\" says Lewis's dad, \\"just go to bed; tomorrow is another day.\\" \\"Yeah but just listen.\\" \\"Fine, go ahead.\\" Lewis then proceeds to lay down such a tight logical argument that his dad can do nothing but turn and leave the room as little Jack runs to the bookshelf. Ha! Ha!There is a very interesting chapter on poetry. Lewis wonders if poetry will suffer the same fate as rhetoric: once being important and vital, but eventually being confined strictly to academia. Lewis wrote this in 1961, and my own opinion is that poetry is now there. For example, I took a literature class a few semesters ago that completely--and intentionally--ignored poetry. But Lewis has plenty more to say about poetry. I thought this was a great quote about modern poetry: \\"It is a pity if a glazed picture is so placed that you see in it only your own reflection; it is not a pity when a mirror is so placed.\\" In other words, in reading \\"old poetry,\\" one should be able to grasp the authors intention; but when reading modern poetry, it is sometimes only possible to ultimately see yourself. And \\"that's not a pity,\\" says Lewis. With that being said, I think Lewis prefers the old--as do I.Lewis is utterly fair in this book. There were a few times when I thought that he was going to slam a certain style or book or way of reading, but he never does. To put it simply, the man is very kind. He is also very interesting to read. If there is anyone with the credentials to discuss books and reading, it is C.S. Lewis. I have heard many a Lewis scholar talk of their amazement at the amount of books he read. Peter Kreeft once offhandedly commented that \\"it seems as if Lewis has read every book ever written.\\" But before we read as many books as Lewis, we have to read this book first. As Lewis says in another essay, \\"You can't get second things by putting them first; you can get second things only by putting first things first.\\" Read this book and gain the tools to tackle, and fully digest and receive, all other books. If you're a big time reader--or if you don't presently enjoy reading but want to acquire the taste--this is a book you need to read. I have found that I can go back to this book again and again, and I continue to find things that I never knew were there.(If your main interest is with non-fiction, I would suggest Mortimer Adler's classic book entitled \\"How to Read a Book.\\")"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Why read? C.S. Lewis says because it is a hedonistic pleasure and it is \\"good\\". Good for Lewis does not mean the subject matter is true or even logical but dependent on individual need.In the first chapter he compares buying a book to someone who buys a picture. The need can be very different from one person to the next. One might buy the picture to cover a bare spot on the wall and then after a week or two the pictures become mostly invisible to them. The good news is that the bare spot is now invisable too. Another person would buy a picture, live with it, and actually feed off of it, for years. This book helps to understand what it might mean to \\"feed off\\" what the book said showing that reading allows one to become what they had not been before. He likens this condition to a Greek poem saying, \\"I see with a myriad of eyes, but it is still I who see\\".The book has eleven chapters and an epilogue. Many of these chapters deal with the different choices and kinds of things people read. It concludes with a final chapter that draws conclusions about how literary tastes, reading choices and the process and approach to reading. The book concludes that the way we read is more important than what we read. Mastering the process suggested enables us to become, as he suggests, \\"a thousand men and yet remain myself\\".Rather than pushing a point of view, something it could be assumed and even expected that a Christian writer would do, this book pushes the idea of real agency of reading choice. He then shows how pleasurable the experience can be."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"What is most original about this work for the reader is that C. S. Lewis leaves the literary reader free to be open to new and old works of literature and non-fiction without suffering the false limitations of snobbery. He writes that he finds the standards of what constitutes great literature insupportable either by Logos or by science. His \\"experiment\\" in criticism in this work, largely but not exclusively, is to criticize the main false standards of literary taste and the critics who helped make them -- including Matthew Arnold, Aristotle, and I.A. Richards, for it is not they, the critics, who made great works like \\"Oedipus Rex\\" and \\"King Lear,\\" but it is these great works of literature that have made the critics worth reading.C.S. Lewis here advances a number of interesting insights about novels, some of which involve false and subtle notions of realism and what constitutes the realistic novel as well as what is the modus operandi of science fiction and how impossible it is to classify it even as a genre. His defense of the fairy tale to be read by adults, not children, is another bit of evidence that the discussions in this work, even about non-literary reading and literary reading, are not predictable, pre-cut, academic lectures but come out of his personal journey in reading and the intellectual introspection that accompanied it, all of which are provocative and refreshingly unusual.This book definitely rewards the reading time spent, and certainly as well it bears a rereading with justified expectations of newer delights. C. S. Lewis's style here is succinct but somewhat stodgy and formal, though not one word is wasted and the big picture eventually emerges with an amazing economy of language. In final, great literature takes the reader out of himself or herself and enlarges the reader expansively in a manner that no other mode of expression can, enhancing his or her familiarity and sensitivity to lives far beyond one's narrow, time-bound perceptions."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"This is the best book I've ever seen on reading books. Lewis does not judge books but readers here. He breaks us down into the literary and non literary. It's fun to see which category one fits in via his thoughts on the matter. If you bother to read this book at all then you surely fall into the former; the latter wouldn't bother with a work like this.Lewis teaches us the difference between \\"using\\" art and \\"receiving\\" it. He bids us to get lost in books and fully enter the world of the writer. And in the Epilogue he gives the best defense for reading fiction that I've ever seen (this goes for his thoughts on reading Myth as well).This is also a great book if you're trying to improve your writing and story-telling.I read this book twice, took lots of notes, and can honestly say it has not only made a difference, but will continue to do so."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"After purchasing, reading and being wowed by the author's A Preface to Paradise Lost, I opened this book with great anticipation. I was not disappointed.Even though Lewis separates readers into the unliterary and the literary, I don't think his main point is to condemn the reading habits of the masses. His main point is to clarify the nature of the literary experience. Lewis ends up criticizing the academic discipline of literary criticism rather sharply. In Lewis's view, these academic practices will harm the literary experience for the serious reader with their obsession over critical reading and the obligation to state a clever opinion.However, this point does not become obvious until the second half of the book. He gradually builds up to it through a series of clever but deceptively simple ideas. If you would like a quick summary of Lewis's position on the literary experience, it may be worthwhile to turn to \\"Survey\\" (Chapter 9) first. Of course, I wholeheartedly recommend starting from the first chapter again.Lewis performs a great service for those \\"who seek more in their reading\\" by clarifying the difference between the literary experience and the philosophical experience. One reads Dante not to derive a theology, but to experience what it feels like to be a theist. To me, this is the most valuable lesson of the book."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Reading this book I was reminded of the book on writing by Dorothy Sayers called \\"The Mind of the Maker\\". That was itself a wonderful book with the writer having a clear scheme of how she saw the role of the writer. What was most insightful was her perception of a Trinitarian structure to writing. Lewis' book is very different - its about the art of reading, namely what makes a good reader of a book. The question of what is or what is not a good book is not addressed head on. Instead we get reflecting on how and how not to read a book. The book does not have the organic unity of Sayers' book and I am not sure after a single reading whether I can encapsulate what Lewis is trying to say. Undoubtedly a key element for Lewis is that reading must not be utilitarian, the reader must surrender or rest in a work and given himself over to it like he would to play or to contemplation (\\"The first demand any work of art makes upon us is surrender\\") . He contrasts this with using art: \\"Using is inferior to reception because art, if used rather than received, merely facilitates, brightens, relieves and palliates our life, and does not add to it\\".So, for Lewis, there is a quasi spiritual aspect to reading. For Lewis, the person who is only interested in what happened is unlikely to be a good reader. The value of this book lies not therefore in the coherence of its message (its not entirely clear to me) but rather in a number of highly perceptive statements scattered throughout the work such as:\\"Those who read great works, on the other hand, will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of their life\\". This statement surprised me - yes I have read some books 2 or 3 times but this number?Lewis describes a first reading as \\"an experience so momentous that only experience of love, religion, or bereavement can furnish a standard of comparison.\\"Lewis emphasises the importance of reading contextually: \\"For he will read, in the same spirit that the author writ\\"Lewis sees no problem with the desire to escape: \\"Now, there is a clear sense in which all reading whatever is an escape. It involves a temporary transference of the mind from our actual surroundings to things merely imagined or conceived\\"Surprisingly he is prepared to praise works whose themes he despises: \\"A true lover of literature should in one way like an honest examiner, who is prepared to give the higher marks to the telling, felicitious and well documented exposition of views he dissents from or even abominates\\"And, in this statement Lewis reminds me of discussions on the Liturgy where one desires that the celebrant is almost invisible (at least that is my wish!): \\"The necessary condition of all good reading is \\"to get ourselves out of the way\\"It is in the final chapter of the book that we begin to mine pure gold and Lewis shows us why he is a great thinker where he discusses what we are trying to do when we read:\\"We seek an enlargement of our being. We want to be more than ourselves. Each of us by nature sees the whole world from one point of view with a perspective and a selectiveness peculiar to himself..We want to see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts, as well as with our own...to see what they see, to occupy, for while, their seat in the great theatre, to use their spectacles and to be made free of whatever insights, joys, terrors, wonders or merriment those spectacles reveal. Literature gives the entree to them all. Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom full realise the enormous extension of being which we owe to authors, We realise it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see that others have invented. Literary experience heals the wounds, without undermining the privilege, of individuality.Now we get to the final ecstatic moment:\\"But in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself, and am never more myself when I do\\".Does Lewis go too far in waxing so lyrically? I don't think so but as long as we realise that Lewis is reflecting on one aspects of man's being - his intellectual sphere (although it does include the heart). Man also enlarges his heart and transcends himself when he lives a life of virtue. So both the mind and the heart need, in so far as possible, be engaged to live the enlarged life!"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"I now have a great appreciation for book reviewers and pay much more attention to my own styles of writing and reading.There was an interview with JK Rowling in which the interviewer asked her when she found time to read, and she replied (to paraphrase), \\"When I'm standing at the stove, when I'm on the john, when I'm waiting for a bus, when I'm eating, when I'm about to fall asleep ... How could I ever be too busy to read?\\"And if I am not mistaken, this illustrates pretty well what CSL tries to say about readers - we fall into two groups: those who receive books and those who use them. We can learn from what we read, or we can use it and forget about it. JK, CSL, and myself (I'd like to think) fall into the former category.This is not all he has to say, so by all means read it (it goes quick) and revel in CSL's uncommon good sense."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Whether one otherwise adores or detests C. S. Lewis, this is a book every reader can love. Arguing that the focus in reading should not be on whether a book is a great work or not, he insists what is important is whether a book is susceptible to great reading. The result is that otherwise flawed and perhaps imperfect books (e.g., Toltoy's &quot;Master and Man,&quot; with the previously unhinted conversion of the master at the end) can be read well, while others cannot. Lewis was one of my earliest influences, and while I have over the years come to hold his religious works in lower and lower regard (I prefer Kierkegaard's passionate uncertainty to Lewis's smug confidence)I have come back to this one again and again for insight and stimulation. Along with STUDIES IN WORDS and the Narnia books, this book is Lewis's masterpiece."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"This book was a wonderful read and more than a read. While I read it, it was cutting the support from under my reading inhibitions and applying a solvent to the cement that held my reading in its grasp. In the end Lewis offered me to see the whole world and something more than the whole world in new light with new eyes. :)"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"How do you review a book about reviewing? Or more accurately, about how one should truly read? Worse yet, what if the author comes right out and says that, if one reads a book with the intent to review it, they can never get the real meaning of the book?With great miserableness, I must admit, I agree with Lewis on that point. As I've reviewed for Amazon these past eight years, I find that I often am reading a book while trying to determine the good and bad aspects of it. I am often thinking in the back of my mind what star rating it will receive, and what I will be writing. There are certainly some books that get past my defenses, and flood me into a new world, likeThe City of Dreaming Books- but not the majority. Perhaps I can console myself that I often review and read nonfiction. But the result is I am not fully engaging in literature as art. I am not fully allowing the author to wash over me, as Lewis suggests, and accepting the author's worldview, if only for a moment. When I review, or read with the intent to review, I use the art, rather than am immersed in it. And Lewis is right- all art, including literature, deserves to be accepted for what it is, and what it intends. It is not that the literature needs to be pedantic, but rather, if it is good, if it is well-written, then it will change us- if we allow it.So I resolve to remember this book, in my future reading, and my future reviewing. And I could say, of this particular book, that it is well-written. But I think that is said enough when I confess that it will change how I read all future books, and it will affect how I approach all future reviews."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Of all of C.S. Lewis' books, this is one of the few that I sincerely disagree with. Lewis here lays out a claim about the difference between two basic kinds of aesthetic appreciation - on the one hand are people who appreciate the form of art, and the other, people who inject their own private meaning into it, thus viewing art and aesthetic experience in primarily functional terms. This distinction seems to me to be fundamentally flawed, and although Lewis gives a periodic nod to the artificiality of the dichotomy he has here created, the language he uses only obscures the reality of his fundamental point.I respect C.S. Lewis a great deal, but I believe that this book is evidence of his insulation in academia (and this review is being written by an academic, no less). For someone like him, who has made careful thinking his life's business, the 'dark gods of the woods' that call so imploringly to the 'common man' appear quite vulgar and pagan (and he has said as much elsewhere). The participation that normal people have with art is, from the point of view of someone who has spent a lifetime isolating and clarifying this very experience, quite sloppy and low. In this book, he has let those intuitive reactions get mixed up with his philosophy, and it makes for a fairly sloppy book. This surprised me, because Lewis' work on medieval thought is excellent, perhaps the best there is. As Barfield points out, medieval aesthetics are highly participatory.For books on aesthetics and literature from a religious perspective, I would sooner recommend Owen Barfield (oddly enough, one of Lewis' closest friends). Barfield seems to me to be much more careful in his thinking on this particular topic."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"I can hear it now. The disparagement that Lewis is guilty of classism. That Lewis represents that awful \\"elite\\" attitude. He doesn't (really) but would be jusitified if he did considering his age, upbringing, cultural heritage, and education.However, what he actually does is carefully describe how NOT to do that where literature is concerned. He states, and I agree, that persons individually expect things from the books they choose to read. Because this is true, it is nonsensical to label a book as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" without considering the audience to which that book was intended to be played.Once, however, that distinction (in vulgar modern parlance), the intended demographic has been identified AND that demographic includes those \\"who read seriously\\" as Bauer defines it in her excellent The Well-Educated Mind then one can almost start talking about whether a work is good or bad. Almost.Lewis says, \\"Now the true reader reads every work seriously in the sense that he reads it whole-heartedly, makes himself as receptive as he can.\\" This is not the same thing as being \\"serious\\" or grave - it means paying attention! It means treating the act of reading itself as something worthy of time, effort, and value. There is a spectrum of \\"reading seriously\\" and I fall near the beginning of it. However, Mr. Lewis very clearly helped me realize \\"what\\" gives me the intense pleasure I experience when reading (although very catholic in selections.)I especially appreciated his opinion (near the end of the book) about the impact of those \\"evaluators\\" - the writers of literary criticism as opposed to the reviewers of individual works. He said, \\"...young people drenched,dizzied,and bedeviled by criticism to a point at which primary literary experience is no longer possible. This state of affairs seems to me a far great threat to our culture than any of those from which the Vigilants would protect us. Such a surfeit of criticism is so dangerous that it demand immediate treatment. Surfeit, we have been told, is the father of fast. I suggest a ten or twenty years' abstinence both from the reading and from the writing of evaluative criticism might do use all a great deal of good.\\"This, IMO, coincides perfectly with Lewis' discussion of Logos and Poiema - \\"means\\" and \\"is.\\" He says that it is unnecessary to require that literature \\"improve\\" the reader or alert him to faults in the world or himself. I will further construe and say that much of modern literary theory invests far too much emphasis on mining works for that feature. I have become increasingly impatient with the literary theorist who appears to build his self-esteem on the simultaneous \\"discovery\\" of world-shaking wisdom in a work and the boast that he, alone, has discovered it. But I digress ...Lewis helped me see my own reading experience as follows: \\"Here [ reading ], as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.\\"Simply an excellent book with, IMO, a very rational approach to literary criticism.

Lewis' \\"Experiment in Criticism\\" is one of those great books that gives one a new lens with which to view life. This book caused me to do a lot of self-examination and reflection on how I interact not just with literature, but also with culture as a whole.Lewis' point is that there is not a real \\"bad\\" or \\"good\\" literature. The value of what we read is in how we interact with it. Lewis defines how people interact with culture in terms of \\"The Few\\" and \\"The Many.\\"\\"The Few\\" are the literary (in other fields they would be musical, have a palette capable of enjoying the best food, or an eye for art). The literary count reading as valuable, read books more than once, are able to be changed by what they read, and remember and share works or pieces of works with others.\\"The Many\\" are the unliterary. Unliterary people generally don't accuse the literary of reading the wrong books-they wonder why literary people make such a big fuss about books at all. They never read a book twice. Their interaction with a work is not deeply felt. Though they may \\"read a lot\\" they don't \\"set much store by it.\\"Lewis draws some interesting comparisons with other forms of cultural involvement. He compares these two styles of reading with how some people interact with art and music. Just because one is in the literary \\"Few\\" does not mean that they are part of the \\"Few\\" in other venues.Chapter five, \\"On Myth,\\" is incredibly valuable in discussing myth as well as the value of modern genres such as Fantasy and Science Fiction. It is a wonderful area to start exploring what has come to be termed \\"Mythopoeic literature.\\"Another notable section is chapter seven which is a discussion of realism. Lewis' definition is broader than the usual. Personally, in changing my perception of what \\"realistic\\" fiction is, this chapter probably influenced me more than any other.This is a book capable of changing the reader's view of culture. It is therefore of great value. I give it my heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Typical of Lewis's deeper insight into things, his &quot;Experiment&quot; consists in a reversal of the usual method of literary judgement. Instead of classifying BOOKS, he classifies READERS and how they &quot;use&quot; or &quot;receive&quot; books. The true (unbiased) critic does not pontificate a judgement of 'good' or 'bad' upon a book without careful cosideration of the possible confusion between degrees of merit and differences of kind. &quot;I want to convince people,&quot; says Lewis, &quot;that adverse judgements are always the most hazardous... A negative proposition is harder to establish than a positive. One glance may enable us to say there is a spider in the room; we should need a spring-cleaning (at least) before we could say with certainty that there wasn't. When we pronounce a book good we have a positive experience of our own to go upon... In calling the book bad we are claiming not that it can elicit bad reading, but that it can't elicit good. This negative proposition can never be certain.&quot;Central to his argument is the fact that the same book may be read in different ways. It follows then that there is a certain speculative nature to evaluative criticism, and therefore no amount of reliance upon literary criticism can absolve one from the responsibility of becoming a GOOD READER. And what is a good reader? Well, that is the question isn't it? In my opinion (and it is just that... an opinion) I feel that reading Lewis's &quot;Experiment&quot; can answer that question more effectively than anything I've ever come across. Read it, and see where you fit into Lewis's categories of the &quot;literary&quot; and the &quot;unliterary&quot; person (too lengthy to enumerate here). If at any point, you feel offended and want to hurl the book across the room... you are of the latter category.Lewis deplored the technical dissection of what he loved so dearly... the simple act of reading. I loved his image in chapter 2 of the &quot;status seeker&quot; type of readers, gathered to discuss the finer (and, of course HIDDEN) points of &quot;approved literature&quot; while the only real literary experience in such a scenario &quot;may be occurring in a back bedroom where a small boy is reading Treasure Island under the bed-clothes by the light of an electric torch.&quot;Lewis sought in books (as he called it here) an &quot;enlargement of his being&quot;. He says on page 52, &quot;I am probably one of many who, on a wakeful night, entertain themselves with invented landscapes. I trace great rivers from where the gulls scream at the estuary, through the windings of ever narrower and more precipitous gorges, up to the barely audible tinkling of their source in a fold of the moors. But I am not there myself as explorer or even as tourist. I am looking at that world from outside.&quot; This is a terrific/significant book that will be read, re-read, and cherished by anyone who has ever had similar musings. Oh, and by the way... all GOOD readers have !"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"As a person whose life is dedicated to art in all its various incarnations, this has proved the single most enlightening work I have ever had the pleasure of reading. While it itself is literary criticism and in one sense not literature but a study thereof, it's the most radical, revolutionary book I have read regarding art. Before I can continue, one point needs to be cleared first.I'm a Christian, and I believe the single most important priority is to lead people to the knowledge and saving grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. You can do such through art. However, anything that Lewis wrote that lead someone to Jesus is, of course, more important than this book in that respect. Jesus comes first, art comes underneath that in priority, as do all things. That being said:AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM is the single most important work C. S. Lewis has produced when it comes to literature and the arts. THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, the SPACE TRILOGY, and TILL WE HAVE FACES are literature, but this overwhelms them all - not because of what it is (a universal principle that can be applied to art), but because of what it is not (a story or work of art that not everyone will have the same taste for). People may or may not like his fiction (although I find it rare to meet a person who doesn't like NARNIA) - but this book anyone can appreciate, especially those interested in literature in specific and art in general (for, although it concerns itself primarily with literature, this book also stands in defense of drama, music, painting, and the artistic endeavours of humankind in general). Because there are differing tastes in terms of fiction, people who will not read Lewis's own literature will (or should) read this. This element comes into play at the last chapter, where Lewis brings out how hard it is to take down a work with this apparatus, because, while you may not enjoy a work, others may. Literature is a very highly subjective experience.CRITICISM's central argument rests in the fact that books should not be judged by some arbitrary critical analyses, but by what response it elicits in the reader. This book contains one of Lewis's famous quotes, at the end of the Epilogue: \\"But in reading literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.\\" That is the central thesis of this work: not to approach a piece of literature, or movie, or painting, or drama, as something to experience and forget immediately afterward, but to enter into it, surrender to it, and approach it with an open mind. That is one thing that is so great about this book - even people who have prejudices against Lewis can read this work.It also points out the central flaw in evaluative criticism: it may dominate and wipe away the chance at a reader appreciated the work for what it really is, and to experience it in the reader's own way. Lewis does not argue that all evaluative criticism is bad - there's a very human need, he says, to \`compare notes', and that is normal, but to much has been given over to this \`note comparison' and not enough to the actual work of art. People, especially students (Lewis was, by profession, a medieval literature professor), had quite a broad range of knowledge concerning Chaucerian and Shakespearian criticism and hardly any of Chaucer or Shakespeare (he cited this example at the end of the last chapter). To much has been given over to criticism.Although I will continue to write reviews, this book has forever changed my approach. Lewis states that one can have an appreciation of a work without the critics, but one CANNOT have an appreciation of the critics without the author. Now I propose that all reviewers should read this book, and keep this in mind when writing. I certainly will. It is also my personal belief that anyone in universities who are studying literature should be required to read this book at the start of their very first semester, so they may examine their motives of precisely WHY they are in this study.Indeed, the biggest tragedy of this book is, I fear, it is not highly enough read. Regardless of your views on C. S. Lewis, this is one book everyone should read who professes a love for art, and ESPECIALLY by all who write literary criticism. And while that profession does have a place in our world (where would academia be without it? \`Publish or perish!'), it is superseded in importance by the art that it deals with, and we should first immerse ourselves in it, sometimes several times over, before we turn away and reach for that scholarly volume. And if it's a good work, it will only encourage you more to go to the work at hand and discover for yourself what the art can do for you. (Shippey's ROAD TO MIDDLE-EARTH is a good example of a well-written criticism). Lewis said one good element about criticism is, if the critics truly care for the art, the enthusiasm will be apparent, and it may cause you to read literature otherwise unknown to you. Also, a central element is the difficulty in producing condemnation to a work. It's a good case against censorship, because although a great work can be abused, it can also be used properly. One may classical images and use it as pornography - while one may look at it and fall in love with the Renaissance. Of course, PLAYBOY is mainly used for lust.A side note: Pay close attention to the chapter on MYTH, which is a central element in both Tolkien and Lewis. This alone should make it required reading for anyone who study the lives of these two great Christian writers. This work also shows you the depth of versatility of how well-read C. S. Lewis actually was, and shows his phenomenal memory of such things."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Contents:I The Few and the ManyII False CharacterisationsIII How the Few and the Many use Pictures and MusicIV The Reading of the UnliteraryV On MythVI The Meanings of FantasyVII On RealismsVIII On Misreading by the LiteraryIX SurveyX PoetryXI The ExperimentEpilogue, AppendixWhile this work is clearly a scholarly work, aimed at a scholarly audience, it is neither desirable that it be excluded from the modern scholar's library (because it is written by C.S.

He does not judge; he merely describes. However, he does draw some startling conclusions (especially to the modern literary mind) as a result of his analysis-conclusions that are in many respects more applicable today than when they were first composed.Regardless of the reader's agreement with Lewis' propositions, the mere journey through his critical process is an enrichment and a delight.

Instead, Lewis proposes an experiment: to judge literature by the way person read it. Thus, good literature is that which compels good reading.Lewis begins his discussion of good reading by an analysis of viewing pictures and listening to music - to the experience of art generally. Of the two ways to experience art, receiving and using, receiving art is best because it helps us transcend ourselves. When we receive art we allow our senses to follow the pattern defined by the artist. The art thus enriches our life, allowing us to see or experience something foreign and new. On the other hand, when we use art, we are merely using it to confirm or facilitate ideas, feelings, and beliefs that we already hold. We have not allowed art to enrich our life.Lewis mostly defines good reading by comparing it to bad reading. He, of course, describes in detail these habits. Ultimately, Lewis believes that we read literature to transcend ourselves, and yet paradoxically we are never more ourselves than when we do."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Well-worth your time! Yes, Lewis is elitist, and yes, he creates a binary of sorts between the many and the few.

Rather, the best readers are those who &quot;receive&quot; the text. In an era where ideology threatens literature and authors, Lewis offers a more noble route.This book changed the way I read. And its not too long. =)"},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Like famed Canadian novelist Robertson Davies, C.S. Lewis believed that a great reader is someone who enters fully into the experience of the writer, who gives his whole attention to what he is reading, and who brings to a book a curiosity and a sympathy to surrender to the work on which the author is engaged. In this way, great reading is similar to love, moral action, and intellectual achievement. Even those who with whom we disagree can teach us to see the world through their eyes. As Lewis says, &quot;in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.&quot; In this way, literature can enlarge ourselves and our view of the world. Lewis argues it is less important to decide between reading what is considered &quot;high brow&quot; versus &quot;low brow&quot; than it is to learn to read greatly. AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM was a delightful book to read, chock full of illustrations to demonstrate the points being made. Avid readers will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"Despite the dry title, this book is a must-read for anyone whose life has been shaped by books. In AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM, Lewis explores the experience of reading. He suggests that the majority of people &quot;use&quot; reading, for information, or entertainment, or distraction. Others use reading as a subject to be studied and become experts at technical criticism. But for some few people reading is a much more significant activity. Such people don't use the books they read; they receive them. They return over and over to the same books which provide &quot;a sort of iconography by which they interpret or sum up their own experience.&quot; For such readers, reading changes the consciousness, and the experience of reading a particular book may be as significant as experiences of romance, or travel, or spiritual insight for other people. Lewis doesn't suggest that the few readers who have this experience of reading are more intelligent than the many who do not. Other people may create the iconography of their lives based on music, or visual art, or personal relationships. But for those few who read in the way Lewis describes here, reading is central to life. If reading is central to your life, you must experience this book."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"\\"You can't get a book long enough or a cup of tea big enough to suit me,\\" C.S. Lewis once said. Well of course-- an Oxford and Cambridge prof. I'm the opposite: I should like a small cup and a brief book, preferably one with short chapters I can read at a sitting. This brief book doesn't fulfill Lewis' criteria, but it does mine. I also like to read slowly, with a book mark under the line, savoring every word. This book reads delightfully slow and is, oddly enough, a book about reading.Given the fact that Lewis seems to be replying to some thesis or idea of which I am unaware, which is far more the case in The Abolition of Man, which many people nevertheless read with profit, and that one might question the very idea of a book about reading (who needs that?) this remains one of my favorite Lewis books and has done its work so well that I nearly cannot say why. What I do know is that it's entirely changed the way I read (and view reading), and made it a pleasure above TV and video games. I still don't desire to delve into thick tomes or to quaff large steaming cups of of Earl Grey, but this Oxford don has given my small small draughts and slim pages a deeper enjoyment."},{"Title":"AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM","review":"C.S. Lewis is the very embodiment of the open-minded Christian, of which \\"An Experiment in Criticism\\" is perhaps the best example.Many Christians today have what C.S. Lewis calls a \\"problem of belief.\\" If they read books like \\"Harry Potter\\" at all (which they usually do not), they quickly voice their disagreement with certain ethical implications or their concern that the books incite dangerous magical practices (they also frequently voice their disagreement even when they have not read the books). Or they point out that God is totally left out of the picture.Aside from the question whether such qualms are justified, C.S. Lewis would reply that in good reading there ought to be no \\"problem of belief.\\" \\"A true lover of literature should be in one way like an honest examiner, who is prepared to give the highest marks to the telling, felicitous and well-documented exposition of views he dissents from or even abominates,\\" says Lewis in \\"An Experiment in Criticism.\\" \\"I read Lucretius and Dante at a time when (by and large) I agreed with Lucretius. I have read them since I came (by and large) to agree with Dante. I cannot find that this has much altered my experience, or at all altered my evaluation, of either.\\"In the book, C.S. Lewis maintains that one of the prime achievements in every good fiction \\"has nothing to do with truth or philosophy or a Weltanschauung\\" (worldview) at all. This is especially true of Lewis's favorite kind of fiction: fantasy. The primary value he saw in reading fantasy was not that he could learn truths about life but that through it he could be more than himself. He wanted to \\"see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts,\\" as well as with his own. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, was not enough. He wanted to see what others had invented.He would therefore (I think) have delighted to enter into the beliefs of J.K. Rowling or Philip Pullman, even though, as a Christian, he would have thought certain aspects of them untrue. His defense for doing this, \\"for occupying his heart with stories of what never happened and entering vicariously into feelings\\" which he tried to avoid having in his own person, was that in reading them he became \\"a thousand men and yet remained\\" himself. He saw \\"with a myriad eyes,\\" but it was still he who saw. \\"Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing,\\" he transcended himself; and was never more himself than when he did. \\"The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison,\\" he wrote.It is needless to say that in this way C.S. Lewis learned much more from his reading than a person who looks in every book for truths about life, only to find on every page his own face staring at him. Such a person, says Lewis, \\"attributes to his chosen author what he believes to be wisdom; and the sort of thing that seems wise to him will obviously be determined by his own caliber. If he is a fool he will find and admire foolishness; if he is a mediocrity, platitude, in all his favourties. At best he is a profound thinker himself, and what he acclaims as his author's philosophy might in itself be good, but in reality be merely his own.\\"C.S. Lewis was not like that. He honestly tried to put himself into the shoes of the authors he was reading.Whether or not you agree with C.S. Lewis's approach to reading, if you want to get to know Lewis the READER and not just the writer, \\"An Experiment in Criticism\\" is your prime source.An admirable and provocative little book.- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C.

All true, and these points are well argued and well presented.However, there is one glaring fact that is not addressed: that all of these wonderful things built and brought to Africa and Asia (at European expense) were created FOR the Europeans, and were designed with the intent of suiting the needs and wants of the European powers - roads, canals and ports, for example, were built exclusively for the extraction of raw materials in the quickest and most expedient manner possible - without thought or concern for the indigenous people. The same is true with the hospitals, schools and universities, civil service, and other social and political institutions.While admitedly this book is an &quot;apology&quot; for European imperialism, it is nonetheless a marvelous read, its point of view well argued.

Hamlet, Act iii, scene 2.The ultimate problem in Karel Capek's extraordinary play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) is that the robots created by humanity's journeymen imitated humanity so abominably well.Written in 1920 and first produced in 1921 RUR opened to critical worldwide acclaim. Although RUR is best remembered for introducing the word robot into the lexicon (the word was coined by Karel's brother and some time collaborator Josef Capek) it is more a somber reflection on humanity than on the emergence of robots.The play opens on an unnamed island at some point in time after 1920 where lifelike robots are being produced by Rossum's Universal Robots. The officers of the corporation meet a young lady, Helena, who has come to the island on behalf of the League of Humanity, determined to help liberate these robots from the inhumane working conditions that confront them. The executives fill Helena in on the history of the company, particularly the father-son team of Rossums that developed the first robots. Capek makes it a point to describe the difference between the father and the son. The father was a \\"scientific materialist\\" whose desire to create an imitation of man grew out of his wish to prove that God was unnecessary. The son thought this was both silly and inefficient and sought nothing more than to produce robots capable of working non-stop.Each of the following scenes takes place at some unspecified point in the future. The millions of robots produced take on all the industrial and agricultural work performed formerly by men and women. This leads to unintended consequences. First, the lack of necessity (the need to work) in everyday life leads to a few worker revolts. This causes various governments to arm the robots to quell the resulting riots. Further, these governments decide that all future wars will be fought by robots. As one might imagine, a well-trained robot-militia is not conducive to the future health and welfare of the human race. Second, the lack of work and the general lack of purposefulness of life render humans incapable of reproducing.As the play nears its end, the robots have united and have set out to destroy the human race. Clearly, the robots have learned to think for themselves and as such they have taken on (or evolved into) something that more closely resembles the human race. The fact that the robots behave so abominably does not belie this similarity to their human creators. The problem the robots face is that they do not have the inherent capacity to reproduce (they have a shelf-life a bit shorter than is average for humans) and they have inadvertently destroyed those humans that know how to create more robots. They are faced with extinction just as surely as the humans they have destroyed.As the play concludes the sole remaining human, Alquist, spots two robots whose clear affection for each other indicates that the robots are about find a means to reproduce without the assistance of the humans who gave them life. This pleases Alquist no end and as the play ends, he \`anoints' the robots with his blessing. It is a poignant, jumbled mixture of the creation story (and on the sixth day) and the Song of Simeon (Let us now thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.) The rich irony in this biblical blessing of the new, robotic Adam and Eve brings us to a place dramatically different from the elder Rossum's stated desire to create robots to disprove the existence of God. Alquist's benediction shows man at the height of his humanity and speaks directly to Alduous Huxley's dictum that \\"the humanity of men and women is inversely proportional to their numbers.\\"R.U.R. was written at a time when the world was still reeling from the horrors of the First World War, which horrors were magnified by technological advancements that made the killing industry far more efficient than it ever had been in the past. Capek's pessimism must be viewed through that prism. However, it must be noted that &Egrave;apek's pessimism was not directed at technology itself. I think his concern was with the unchanging human nature of those who think they control the technology and who direct, for good or ill, its use. In some respects this harkens to the political slogan that \\"guns don't kill people, people kills people\\". In this instance and in view of the horrors Capek witnessed first hand, it does not seem inappropriate.It should be noted that R.U.R. was written 85 years ago and the words Capek wrote were meant to be heard by an audience and not read.. As such, some of the dialogue will sound a bit stilted or dated to the reader. However this bit of apparent aging should not diminish the enjoyment to be derived from reading R.U.R. R.U.R. and Capek' other great dystopian work, War With the Newts are a must read for those interested in some of the early 20th century's most compelling fictional looks into the heart of darkness that is mankind. The introduction by Ivan Klima, a biographer of Capek is noteworthy and adds a great deal of illumination for the reader."},{"Title":"R. U.

Any serious student of science fiction should read this play. A factory on an island produces robots (actually, in today's terminology, the products being made by this factory are androids, not robots) to do man's labor and to grow his food. But, as the years go by, governments misuse the robots, having them replace soldiers. Robots begin to be used in wars everywhere. They rebel and man is exterminated. However, the robots don't know how to build new robots and discover that they are doomed to extinction as well. But, the sole two robots of a later model discover beauty, compassion, and love. They become a new Adam and Eve. Interestingly, one of the characters in the play builds robots so that man won't have to work.

R.","review":"Most 20th century plays are focused on the exploration of characters, not ideas. Karel Capek's R.U.R. (short for Rossum's Universal Robots) explores instead ideas, leaving character to one side. The character in this play are somewhat beside the point, irrelevant. The ideas about human beings, about the centrality of labor to give their lives meaning, of the pressures of modern capital to strip workers of their essentially human characteristics are what the play is all about. The robots are emblematic of what, Capek believes, modern capital want to do to workers, taken to their logical extreme.The play is, therefore, a profoundly political play. Capek's own politics do not fit comfortably on the current political grid. He could properly be called conservative, if one could recover an older conservative tradition that was not linked so powerfully to business and corporate interests. Historically this was not always so. John Adams, for instance, the second American president, wrote passionately about the need for the executive branch of government to stand between the greed of the economic elite and both ordinary Americans and the republic. This tradition in American politics was transformed earlier just after the half century mark in the 20th century, much to the chagrin of traditional conservatives like Russell Kirk. Capek shares much in common with this earlier tradition, seeing the greed of corporate interests, which would reduce workers to mere machines if they could. But Capek also shares with this older conservative tradition a fear of technological development. He does not believe that much genuine good will arise out of increasing technological development.The play is perhaps most significant for having popularized the use of the word \\"robot,\\" a word coined by Karel's brother Josef. The robots of Capek's play have far more in common with what we would today call cyborgs or androids, being apparently human creatures made by humans. I find it fascinating that this, the first truly important SF play, focuses on robots. The novel that is usually considered the first SF novel, FRANKENSTEIN by Mary Shelley, also is about an artificially constructed human being. The first SF feature length film, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, also had a robot as one of its major characters. Capek's particular version of the robot has many connections with subsequent depictions of constructed people. To take merely one instance, there are many parallels between Capek's robots and the Cylons in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new version, not the 1978 one). In both versions the robots were created to undertake work for humans to make their lives easier. In both versions the robots or Cylons turned against their creators. In both versions the robots or Cylons are obsessed with replicating themselves, though in BSG the Cylons are capable of laboratory reduplication, but aspire to procreation sexually. Clearly Capek anticipated many ongoing questions in SF.This remains one of the important works of SF of the 20th century as well as one of the most crucial works in the history of imaginative explorations of what it means to be human through the creation of artificial people."},{"Title":"R.

The poems of Robert Burns, the best loved of Scotland's poets, are written in the Scots dialect, which differs significantly from Standard English. My friend's grandmother once made the observation that many of the words unique to the Scots dialect strongly resembled their German counterparts. At the time I doubted her analysis, imagining that the different Scots vocabulary was due to the influence of Scottish Gaelic. After having studied a number of ancient Germanic languages many years later, however, I came to realize that my friend's grandmother was essentially correct. A study of the Scots dialect reveals more words from Old English and Old Norse (both ancient Germanic languages) than found in Standard American or British English, while the contribution of Gaelic is insignificant. Indeed in the Scots expression \\"it gar me greet\\" (it makes me cry) both \\"gar\\" and \\"greet\\" are of Old Norse origin. The Norse word \\"gera\\" corresponds to \\"make\\" and \\"grata\\" to \\"cry or weep\\" as can be confirmed by reference to the glossary of the Old Norse textbookAn Introduction to Old Norse, the modern Icelandic dictionaryEnsk- Islenzk Ordabok/English-Icelandic Dictionary, or equivalent online dictionaries. Nevertheless, the Lowland Scots dialect is not so different from American English as to present a challenge to the literate reader. The version of this book that I own (of the same exact title as this edition) is complete with a glossary to define dialect words unfamiliar to the general reader. I hope that this edition also has this useful glossary.Many poems familiar to the reader can be found in the volume. \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and \\"Comin' Thro' The Rye\\" are among the best known. Of particular note are the poems \\"The Cotter's Saturday Night,\\" a celebration of the common Scottish people and \\"Tam O'Shanter,\\" a story of a man who happens upon cavorting witches, one of whom is appealingly clad in a \\"Cutty Sark\\" (short shirt or chemise like undergarment, or nightgown).One of the accomplishments of Burns was to compose words for traditional songs or \\"Airs\\" that prevented these melodies from being completely forgotten. Burns is also known to have composed a number of songs too bawdy to be widely circulated. My friend's family had apparently known of handwritten copies of such poems that had been hidden away in desk drawers back in Scotland. It was also recalled that decent women got off the street when Burns was in town! Such poems are not included in this volume, at least not in their entirety. To find such poems the interested reader need only consult the web. Joe Covenant's very accessible website includes a few of these poems complete with a glossary. I was particularly amused by the poem entitled \\"Wa'd Ye Dae That?\\" (Would You Do That?)."},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"and you can easily use search to find the items you want, be them beasties, haggis, or other."},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"This edition is more convenient by far than \\"The Complete Works of Robert Burns.\\" It's easier to find things. A scholar might also want the latter, though. But my high rating is because of the contents. Robert Burns might be the most virile poet in the language. His only rival would be Chaucer. There's none of the bragging about his exploits that we see in Byron, and there's none of that adolescent eviler-than-thou feeling. Burns lives a full life and sympathizes with everyone -- with the exception of Calvinist types who don't believe in leaving people alone. And this inspires his satire. There's no better or more effective religious satire in English than \\"Holly Willie's Prayer.\\" At least in America, where religious hypocrisy is alive and menacing, the poem is timely, but it would still be priceless as personal satire if it weren't. As for the Scottish dialect, it takes a little practice and patience at first, but it's well worth the trouble, and it adds that assured masculine tone that reminds us of no one since Chaucer. Burns had a perfect ear and radiates a sense of oneness with all things great and small. It's a tragedy for literature that he died so young."},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"The simple reverence for all life is herein displayed for your study and enjoyment.

Of immense value are the photographs and tips on reading water, as well as the detailed anatomy of the various fish and tips on hitting the river at the right time when fish are biting.While specific in certain areas, it is also very general in others which is inconsistent with the thesis of the book, i.e. Kushrets does not speak in depth about any particular region although he makes it clear he is from the Northwest U.S. One thing that may turn off the novice angler is for most of the book he speaks to the reader in a very authoritative \\"this is how you fish\\" style, more like a college professor than an enthusiastic weekend warrior. Explaining things in a simple, straight forward and friendly way is not Kushrets' writing style.I would not go so far as to say that this is 'the definitive steelhead resource' it could have definitely contained more information; you can read it in an evening.

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of all is that this is his first book and frankly I can't wait to see what he's going to give us next.

It was not hard to catch salmon/steelhead. This guy must be writing his own reviews....because this is the worst salmon/steelhead fishing book i have ever read. (its not mine, i bought it in a rush last christmas as a gift for my brother inlaw) First off, the tittle is missleading....salmon is in the tittle yet NO WHERE does he talk about driftfishing for salmon. He must just assume that since he has caught a few dark salmon while driftfishing for steelhead that they are one in the same....theyre not! Also, he starts the book buy bashing one of his friends, telling a story where the first time he went \\"driftfishing\\" with him that he was \\"sure\\" his friend was snagging.....he even explains his friends setup, witch is clearly a plunking setup. He was just jealous. He said that durring this trip, while his friend was \\"snagging\\", he had caught and realeased 7 salmon. But in the next few paragraphs he said he was going to do some \\"research\\" to help him on how to figure out \\"drift fishing\\".....uhhhh, you just said you caught and released 7 salmon???? And you dont have it figured out???There is also lots of pictures of him with dark/spawned out fish. He also admits that alot of the pictures are of people he ran into on the bank. One picture on page 76 is just rediculous. A guy holding up about a 50lb dead dark chinook. I hope it spawned out before he caught it. Pathetic. I cannot believe that AMATO Publications put this one out. There are alot better books on Amato publications....read bill herzogs or Scott haugens books. Leave this one on the rack.

One book I tossed out..to general...another has very nice color photographs and some good basics, but, Tims book has the details that I appreciated reading and highlighting for future quick referral. It is true, the beginning was somewhat disjointed, but, when you want to know the rigging, he puts it all together in an easy to follow read with good photo's and very good tips and pointers. Again, the detail is what I appreciated even though I plan to apply Tim's pointers to Fly fishing equipment. The book is spin fishing based, but can easily be crossed referenced to fly fishing.

In a scant 100 pages the material covers more insights than all other drift fishing books I've read. I had no idea how complicated reading water could be and how simple it is to understand before reading this book. The color photographs, with illustrations, makes deciphering water something comprehensible that any angler can appreciate. The value of reading water is something I can take anywhere Salmon, Steelhead, and Trout are found...it's wonderful! And it works on any type of water I've fished be it stained or crystal clear. The detailed information of fishing techniques is concise yet informative enough that I can now fish multiple techniques on the same fishing trip, though of course not at the same time. The essential gear chapter is outlined in a chronological order, I surmise, in the way of importance; of immeasurable value is how to purchase them cheaply and then how to apply them all. I love the stories at the front of the book and how Mr. Kusherets came to embrace this particular fishing discipline.He also covers how to detect those elusive strikes, which I've never seen in another book: mainline, leaders, and weights all marry together for strikes you can actually see while on the water. Who knew?His insights were gathered from going out and experimenting, which is something that had never occurred to me prior to this book. The Glossary of Terms and Definitions at the back of the book finally gives me the vernacular that seems to be closely guarded by other authors and expert anglers. I love this book and look forward to reading more; though my copy is dog-eared it is a treasure."},{"Title":"Steelhead & Salmon Drift-Fishing Secrets","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about drift fishing in general and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and amount of information contained in the book. This book is one of the best angling books I've ever read and not only does it cover drift fishing rigs and techniques in detail, but covers other valuable information as well.Whether or not you want to learn how to drift fish, this book deserves a a place in every angler's library.While other books do cover trout anatomy, none do it in such detail. This book goes over every aspect of trout anatomy so that you even learn how to tell the difference between male and female trout - and important skill for anglers wanting to help ensure they release female trout to help preserve the fishery.This book is also one of the best I've seen with information on reading rivers (another important skill for all river and stream anglers). While other books do teach this, this book is unique in the quality of photos that accompany the information. In fact, this book is filled with high quality photos throughout all it's pages (a real advantage for those who may not have seen or used some of the equipment discussed before).Other information contained in the book include tips for drift fishing tackle, rigging options, different drift fishing techniques, tips for recognizing subtle strikes and setting the hook, and even detailed info and pictures for filleting your catch!It's obvious from page one that the author knows what he's talking about and has information to share for beginners as well the advanced angler.I'd highly recommend this book to any and all trout anglers (beginners and advanced alike)!"},{"Title":"Steelhead & Salmon Drift-Fishing Secrets","review":"I bought this book to learn the basics of west coast steelhead drift fishing. While it started out OK, and the author seems to have a lot of knowledge, the book was a disappointment. It is so poorly edited it looks like several articles, pieces of articles, and even sentence fragments were swept off of someone's desk and into a book jacket, given a cursory spell check, and published. There are misspelled words, sentences that appear to mean one thing and say the opposite, and some phrases are repeated 3-4 times verbatim in different parts of the book. The photos do not have reference numbers (e.g. figure 1, 2, etc.) which would really help to be sure which one the author is talking about. And the author seems to assume that the reader already knows what a 'drift rig' is. It's a shame that between the author and Amato publishing that the editorial process got such short shrift. I would not recommend this book.. there must be better ones on this topic."},{"Title":"Casa De LA Laguna/House on the Lagoon (Spanish Edition)","review":"Ferre's novel documents the life of a prominent family in Puerto Rico shortly after the end of the Spanish-American War, and although she tries to write in a style similar to that of the great Isabel Allende, she doesn't even come close to it. There are many reasons this book never did well among the eyes of critics and readers. They include(1) The book was written in English. Upon its' release, the book stirred controversy in Puerto Rico, due to that nation's use and respect for Spanish. Ms. Ferre's political connections (her father, Luis, was a former governor of the island who favored statehood) probably had a lot to do with this, and one thing writers know is not to mix a book's imminent success with cultural nationalism.(2) The book's references to Spanish colonialism seems very negative and critical. Again, Ms. Ferre's leaning towards everything Pro-American can't undo the 400 years of colonialism Spain has left on the island, especially when it comes to its' language. As a Puerto Rican of Spanish descent, I found it both insulting and disturbing that although the Spanish were not perfect, Ms. Ferre decided to put down the country that gave Puerto Ricans many things that we can't erase or deny. Surnames, religion, place names, history, and culture are contributions that can't be undone.(3) Ms. Ferre's characters seem to be out-of-touch with the common Puerto Rican. Although there are social elites who wield money (statehooders) and the ideologically elite who possess great knowledge and love for their nation (independence seekers), she really has never written about the &quot;jibaro&quot; and other traditional rural characters that gave Puerto Rico her identity. Truly this is her greatest mistake.Ms. Ferre is no Julia de Burgos, nor she will never be. She is no Esmeralda Santiago who has written novels that are relevant to the Puerto Rican experience. She is no Julia Alvarez, the Dominican writer who is possibly the greatest Latina writer to come out of the Caribbean in recent years. Ferre is unique, and in my opinion is that unless she gives un-biased, apolitical accounts of Puerto Rican life in her future novels, she might as well pack up her typewriter and put it in the closet. Overall, a disappointing novel."},{"Title":"Casa De LA Laguna/House on the Lagoon (Spanish Edition)","review":"Este libro es excepcional.

It's literary style is deliciously complex &quot;a la Garcia Marquez&quot;, using the majic realism technique captured by Mr. Marquez's movement, with a &quot;feminine touch&quot;. She renews the magic realisms essence by borrowing elements from other genres and movements. A little romanticism, history, impressionism and vanguard, Ms. Ferre has quite successfully mastered the art of playing with narrative voice, manipulating narrative consciousness and point of view to the advantage of the main character - or is there a &quot;main character&quot;...? The author toys with the reader as historical anecdotes are devilishly played with. By exploiting this narrative style her point is subtle yet powerful - truth is in the eye of the beholder... It entices the reader to go beyond the voice of characters and delve into reviewing the history of Puerto Rico. From this perspective alone, the story encourages the reader to further seek knowledge on the history of the island - the lines between fiction and reality are that thin! It is also a great way to break generational barriers, as it encourages discussions between generations on the Puerto Rico that once &quot;was&quot;, the Puerto Rico Ms. Ferre describes and the Puerto Rico that &quot;is&quot;. The novel explores many issues ranging from politics, values, gender roles, the multi-ethnicity of the puertorrican culture, sexuality and others. A refreshing way to digest current hot topics of interest, such as the political status of the Commonwealth of Puert Rico. From a literary analysis perspective, the reading offers a banquet of options for study. It may, however, given its regionally defined environment, appeal mostly to a &quot;hispanic&quot; audience, predominantly Puerto Rican. If you are serious about literature and its genders/styles I would encourage you to review other publications pertaining to Puerto Rico affairs as well as other Latin American literatu! re, countries history, culture and politics.

If you are a disciplinarian who has mentally decided that you are gong to be the pack leader in the house and are going to be responsible for training your pup, then this book will help you greatly. BUT you need to be prepared to use some strict-er techniques laid out in this book that involve elements such as using choke collars or sometimes picking the pup up from the scruff of his neck and shaking him vigorously to discipline him. Only reason I highlight this is because I myself struggle with even THINKING of being too aggressive with my pup. So in such cases the techniques mentioned in this book might not be for everyone. Definitely not for someone like me. But hey if you are someone who is training for shows and conformation and field competition then I see this book helping you greatly. Just not for me.All in all, this is still a very good book filled with some really good advice on how to train your lab for basic commands such as sit, heel, etc to much more complex things involving soft mouthing, blind retreats etc. I wouldn't say you should pass on the book because of the strong training techniques, I just wanted to review with a few words of caution.Oh and one last thing, I love this guy's dry sense of humor/ strangely stern tone of writing. This book cracked me up at more than a few occasions. An example of the same is \\"You need to discipline the Pup on his play biting. This will help save your furniture and your marriage\\". And then the author goes about talking about some techniques in a dry matter-of-fact tone."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be similar to all the others. It definitely has a different approach. This book uses many of the tactics used by Richard Wolters in \\"Game Dog.\\" I read the book entirely three times and believe this to be an excellent training system. I don't have my pup yet, but he will learn through this method and some portions taken from \\"Game Dog.\\" I also purchased \\"The Windrose Way Retriever Training DVD\\" which after watching one time appears to be an excellent training video with many of the same principles from the above books. You won't be sorry reading this book."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"Thank heavens for this book. I did not like the other so-called training books. This is a great book! I am new to training a dog. I needed THIS book! Even if you are not planning on training a dog, this is a book for any dog lover on your holiday or birthday lists. It is simple and clear and fun to read. If you are interested in a calm, gentle dog who listens to you, then study this book. This is the book for you and for your best furry friend. My dog is doing great! This was so easy for me to read AND use. This is a book to be dog-eared and dog-drooled, and that is ok. Put this book next to your favorite dog stories, or better yet put this book in your totebag,for those long and peaceful afternoons with your dog member of your family."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"I recently started training a puppy, my first in a dozen years, and, first thing, I went back and re-read all the books that had proved helpful the last time around--Wolters, Tarrant, and Roebuck. Then I bought and read three new ones: Charles Jurney's Finished Dog, Mike Gould's The Labrador Shooting Dog, and, last, Robert Milner's Retriever Training, A Back-to-Basics Approach. I've already reviewed Jurney and Gould. I panned Jurney because of his emphasis on field trials and I praised Gould because I'd successfully used some of his methods, gleaned from Bill Tarrant's books, on my last dog. Also, Gould emphasizes upland hunting (as do I) and lives in the West (as do I)and dogs trained by his methods suit our terrain and our birds. Now I turn to Milner's book which, on balance, might be the best of the three.Why?First, his section on obedience training is the best not only of the three aforementioned books but of any dog training book I've ever read. This is important. Time afield, though probably the reason you have a dog, is small, a tiny fraction of the time you'll spend with your dog. A dog that's a joy to be around is preferrable to one that hunts like a house afire but drives you out of your mind at home or in the car. Milner understands this and his methods are the best I've ever seen for making a quiet, dependable companion animal. I'd recommend this book to non-hunters too, for that reason; anybody who needs to get a handle on his dog can profit from this.Second, Milner's emphasis is on waterfowling and while that's not my main thing, it probably is the main thing for most retriever owners. So this book may be helpful to more people than Gould's. Also, contrary to what some people, including most pointing dog owners, will tell you, it's really nice to have an obedient, well-mannered dog in the uplands, too. There is no downside to steadiness and control, old wives' tales notwithstanding.Third, I admire Milner's economical writing. He covers a deceptively large area of subject matter and does so in a book that feels even shorter than it is. If you skip the sections on e-collars and force-fetching, (two things which, as Milner will tell you, you probably don't need), it's an even shorter, simpler read. Everything you need to know is in this book and you can read it in a sitting or two. The program, once you get on it, feels simple and is simple. And it works.Buy this book."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"I think Tom Davis of Sporting Classics magazine put it best, \\"If I were training a retriever puppy now, and had no interest in competing in field trials or hunt tests, this is the program I'd embrace.\\" This book is easy to understand and is easily instituted by the average hunter with a retriever like myself. I also think it's worth mentioning that author Robert Milner's training program can be accomplished without an electric collar which too many hunters think is a cure all for what ails them. Be sure to go on line and preview bits and pieces of the book to get a feel for it before making your purchase.

We neither hunt nor compete in field trials ...However, we do own a 5 month old Labrador whom we have been training for the last 3 months ...Although much of the book focuses on training a Lab to retrieve game in the field, we decided to buy this book because it teaches owners how to train a Lab for good off-leash behaviour (something many training books/manuals do not do) ... and also because it's specifically tailored for the Labrador ...Mr. Milner's training style comprises of both traditional &amp; more modern methods of training ... for instance, although Mr. Milner advocates the use of slip &amp; pinch chains, he discourages use of physical punishment ... and utilises plenty of positive reinforcement ...The book is well organised and structured ... making it easy for the reader to progress gradually and successfully from stage to stage in the training of the dog ... from basic sit, stay &amp; heel ... to the more complex lesson of teaching a dog to obey hand signals at a distance ...What we found particularly useful is Mr. Milner's insistence that the Lab should maintain an air of calmness and steadiness at all times ...The Lab is a happy, easy outgoing going breed that loves people, is easy to train but sensitive ... Mr. Milner obviously understands the breed very well ...His thoughts on how the breed is progressing today, his opinion on field trail competition in the States ... also make interesting reading ...All in all ... a good book for hunting and non-hunting Lab owners alike ..."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"Excellent! If you want to use your brain more and the whip less when training your dog, this book is for you. Robert Milner's new book shares the experience and insight of a lifetime of dog training and learning. It's not just a bunch of tips and trick, but rather an improved understanding of the relationship of human and dog. It is always refreshing to read an author's new book and find that they have been learning, not just getting older. I read Milner's first book, \\"Retriever Training for the Duck Hunter\\", fifteen years ago. It is a good book still worth reading. This new book has the same practical approach, but utilizes canine understanding and dog psychology more and rigid routines less. I don't think the author intentionally became \\"kinder and gentler\\", it's just that more knowledge and better understanding have brought about a more effective training method that requires less harsh punishment. I have been lucky enough to know several dog trainers over the years. I have invariably thought, at first, that they had a heavier hand than I was willing to use but I was aware that I was interested because they trained dogs better than I did and I could learn from them. Without exception, as time passed, they became better trainers and used the whip less and less. A perfect example is Robert G. Wehle in his first book, \\"Wing and Shot\\" and his latest book \\"Snakefoot\\". Read both of Milner's books and see what I am talking about. \\"Retriever Training\\" has excellent information about dog training, no matter what breed you have. Read this book! Your dog will appreciate your improved understanding."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"I bought this book soon after bringing home my lab six months ago. I don't hunt. But I figure that if hunting is what this dog was bred to do, I would spend some time giving him something of the experience. We do walk the forest preserves and farmer's fields frequently.The methods are based on understanding trainer and pup's behaviors, simple obedience commands, creating a steady dog, and training in habits that you want your dog to have. The lessons are set out as self-paced exercises. They are described concisely and clearly. I have found them to be easy and fun. My pup seems to like them, too.This book is very enjoyable to read. I have read the chapters over and over again, getting some new insight nearly every time. We still have a ways to go before we have mastered all of the skills, but we have the confidence to keep trying because Milner's book has produced successes along the way we've passed."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am presently training my first labrador retriever to be a hunting dog and this book gave me a different approach than many of the regular authors waterfowl hunters read in order to train their own dogs: Richard Wolters, Bill Tarant, etc. I found this book to be well written and full of examples that really hit home after I had a chance to take a step back and access my own weaknesses as an amateur trainer, as well as, the weaknesses of my retriever. It offered a means to improve not only my abilities but also a positive manner in which my dog responded well to what I was asking her to do. I felt the book was well organized and the time the author takes to hammer home the importance of training a steady dog is well worth the read.After reading several books on the subject, I feel that the more knowledge you can arm yourself with, the better results you will achieve in your training efforts. I don't believe there is one book that is the end all be all of dog training. That said, I would recommend this book to any amateur trainer that is more concerned with producing a confident and capable dog for the hunting field than with winning ribbons at a hunt test."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"This is simply the best retriever training book I've ever read, and I've read quite a few over the years. Move over Dick Wolters and Bill Tarrant. There's a new master at teaching us how to train our own hunting retrievers, and his name is Robert Milner.Rather than simply recycling old methods, Milner brings something totally new and refreshing to retriever training. This is a kinder, gentler training method based on the latest research in understanding how dog's have evolved and how they learn, as well as on the author's many years of training experience. Best of all, it teaches us how to use our own intuition and common sense in the training process."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"It is very difficult for some to &quot;think outside the box&quot; with regards to training their dogs. Sometimes one needs to explore the results of the most popular training methods and realize the room for significant improvement. We trained our first dog using these familiar methods. She would retreive anything, anytime, anywhere. She would bring anything she could find to anyone who would throw it to her. She was as far from a &quot;steady&quot; dog as you could find.Now, using Mr. Milners techniques (which are very different than the &quot;popluar techniques&quot;) we have an incredibly obedient and steady young lab. The difference is amazing. Both dogs came from similar lines (field trial)and they couldn't be more different. It works, and works well. Very easy to read and implement. You must buy this book!

The knowledge you receive makes pups a pleasure instead of a pain(cleanups, chewing, and wandering off on a destruction spree). This book starts with the basics and continues on to very advanced training. All of which, in an EASY to follow and understand way, relies on a building block method.

It is sponsored by Ducks Unlimited so you know that it is focused on hunting but a good portion of the book is on basic retriever obedience. The author follows a low pressure, high praise approach that does not rely on electronic collars but rather on handler-dog relationship and the dogs basic willingness to please.If you are looking to train your dog for hunting this would be a decent reference, though having an experienced hand to help is more important in my opinion. What this book offers is a good reference and framework for getting started for the novice and experienced owner alike.I find this useful for any owner, if they want their retriever to be a pet or a working dog, you could do worse then spending a few hours reading through this book."},{"Title":"Retriever Training: A Back to Basics Approach","review":"Last year I lost my outstanding female Lab after eight wonderful years.

In this last respect, it is also a continuation of \\"Tango Awareness\\" -- but it steers clear of the some of the pretentious and silly grand declarations that bogged down Tango Awareness, and sticks with the author's wonderful little \\"thought experiment\\" explorations of tango philosophy. (The back cover of SotDv2 is pretty darned pretentious, but the book is not, thankfully.)If you have not read SotDv1, but are an experienced tango dancer, you may be able to jump straight into this one -- if, and *only* if, you understand why, for example, a front cross against an open step in parallel system moves in contrary directions.

Lewis' 1938 science fiction novel \\"Out of the Silent Planet.\\" He is mentioned there as a twelfth-century Platonist who, in addition to writing difficult Latin, used the Malacandrian (Martian) word \\"Oyarsa\\" for a class of superior spirits. At the time (the middle 1960s), if I paid any attention at all, I probably assumed that \\"Bernard of the Forest\\" was Lewis's version of Lovecraft's Abdul Alhazred, celebrated author of the \\"Necronomicon\\" -- an impressive-sounding but non-existent reference. (L. Sprague de Camp's \\"Science Fiction Handbook,\\" which had sent me to Lewis's books, referred vaguely, but on the whole correctly, to Lewis' use of Neo-Platonic and Gnostic ideas, which would not have clued me in.)If I thought so, I was corrected by the discussion of Bernardus (in English, often simply Bernard) and the \\"School of Chartres\\" (a disputed concept, although now apparently back in favor) when I went on to read Lewis' \\"Allegory of Love\\" (1936), a study of medieval literature. Bernardus' \\"De Mundi Universitate,\\" also known as the \\"Cosmographia,\\" described with proper bibliographic information, there comes in for some attention as a Latin precursor to later allegorical works in vernacular languages. Bernardus appeared in my reading again, providing examples of medieval concepts and terms, in Lewis' late work, \\"The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature\\" (1964).Still later, as an undergraduate at UCLA, my curiosity aroused by Lewis' quotations, but with no translation in existence, I tried the available Latin text; and I was hardly the only academically-inclined Lewis fan with access to a copy to make the attempt. I soon discovered that (a) Lewis was right about the difficult Latin (and what was difficult for a character in his novel was pretty much impossible for me!), and that (b) the existing edition (Barach and Wrobel, 1876) didn't seem to be very well-edited, which could hardly help matters.Both feelings about the Latin text were confirmed when, not so very long after that sobering experience, Winthrop Wetherbee's translation appeared in 1973, as \\"The *Cosmographia* of Bernardus Silvestris.\\" The slender volume included a useful introduction, with textual notes explaining departures from the printed text, and a separate set of explanatory notes following the translation.The latter were definitely necessary. Reading the book, even in English, proved to be a difficult experience. It did have rewards, beyond finding out what Lewis had been talking about. It offered a look at the unexpected intellectual equipment of a medieval Christian philosopher *before* the Aristotelian revolution, and a Platonism unconnected to the Italian Renaissance, and any Greek texts. (I specify because of the intermittent controversy over a \\"Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,\\" in which Bernardus and his possible associates can serve as an exhibit.)It was also, in places, quite charming. Lewis was right about that (although some of his preferred readings of the Latin, and his graceful translations, have had to be dropped in favor of other manuscript evidence.)I eventually acquired a copy of my own (used; the price asked for the hardcover in the 1970s then seemed extortionate), and have re-read it several times. Still not easy, but always interesting. Eventually, while a graduate student in English literature, I began to feel that I sort of understood it.The \\"Cosmographia\\" is a description of the creation and form of the Universe, using ideas from the rather obscure writer Chalcidius (or, as now preferred, Calcidius), whose Latin commentary on a portion of Plato's dialogue \\"Timaeus\\" included the only genuine Platonic text available in Latin Christendom for centuries. \\"Cosmographia\\" itself was a sort of dialogue, but in a mixture of verse and prose, as used in the \\"Consolation of Philosophy\\" of Boethius (one of the key works of the Middle Ages). Wetherbee identifies allusions to the Pseudo-Dionysius, to Macrobius, and to the Latin translation of the Hermetic *Asclepius* attributed to Apuleius, among others. At times it seems to be expressing Christian ideas in pagan terms, at others dressing up pagan philosophy for Christian readers. It bears little resemblance to Scholastic texts, although Lewis was certainly correct to compare it, in terms of genre if not traceable connections, to the \\"Romance of the Rose.\\"I'm going to say STOP RIGHT HERE. If these names and terms mean absolutely NOTHING to you, you will be wasting your time trying to read Bernardus, in any language. If they are a little familiar to you, you will probably need to read a lot more about the literature of medieval Europe before trying it. Better still, add to your readings translations of at least some of the works I have mentioned (Plato instead of Calcidius, although he is, slowly, appearing in English), and some accounts of a number of others I haven't included (Alanus Insulis, for example). If you haven't read Lewis' \\"The Discarded Image,\\" it would probably be a good place to start.This may sound like snobbery, but Bernardus was esoteric in his own time, and I am not going to advise anyone to read it without some proper preparation. As I said, it would be a waste of time -- think of running a Marathon without training. I have given it five stars because Wetherbee did a difficult job remarkably well, not because I expect a lot of people to like it.Of course, if you are motivated enough, you can always try it.Personally, I had already done of lot of this reading at my first attempt at Wetherbee's volume, and eventually got around to filling in some of the rest. But I also took advantage of a shortcut. Brian Stock's \\"Myth and Science in the Twelfth Century: A Study of Bernard Silvester\\" (Princeton University Press) had appeared the previous year, and I raced through a library copy before it could be recalled.Although not in total agreement with Wetherbee about Bernardus by any means, Stock proved an invaluable guide to the material, and the existing secondary literature. He also provided useful suggestions on how to read such a text, which doesn't quite correspond to anything in modern literature. I still needed to do a lot of catching up, but this was a real boost.Unfortunately, Stock's book is out of print (and perhaps somewhat more out of date than the translation, due in part to the author's own later work). The current asking price for used copies of it seems to me unreasonably steep, except as a tribute to the book's intellectual value. If you are interested, by all means try a library! If you are the sort of person to really want to understand this branch of medieval literature, you will find yourself using his bibliography as a reading guide.Wetherbee's translation, on the other hand, has achieved a trade paperback incarnation (1990), and in this form, as university press books with a limited market go, is not too expensive. (The hardcover -- apparently reprinted at the same time, with a much more attractive cover than my old copy -- is still high-priced, and probably aimed at libraries with a generous budget.) I find it easier to imagine it as a text in a graduate seminar than in any but the most rarefied undergraduate course, but I hope that it will continue to find readers, and continue to open eyes to a neglected corner of European thought.Note: The truly dedicated may want to look into another work by (or \\"Commonly Attributed to\\") Bernardus: the \\"Commentary on the First Six Books of Virgil's Aeneid,\\" translated with introduction and notes by Earl G. Schreiber and Thomas E. Maresca (1977). There was also a text edition the same year, edited by J.W. Jones and E.F. Jones (from which I take the \\"commonly attributed\\" description). [I have been prompted to add mention of Peter Dronke's 1978 edition of the Latin text of the \\"Cosmographia,\\" published by Brill, a great improvement on Barach and Wrobel. It is sometimes available through Amazon, where it is currently listed as \\"Cosmographia (Textus minores ; v. 53)\\" by Bernard Silvestris.]The secondary literature continues to grow, although mainly in journals, and unpublished papers presented at conferences; an on-line search shows that there have been some interesting-looking contributions in the last decade, several, including one specifically on Lewis and Bernardus, by Robert M. Ziomkowski.[Addenda, August 2012: Studies of Bernardus and his writings continue, some appear on-line. Angus J Braid's \\"The Amalrician Heresy and Illuminist Mysticism in the Central Middle Ages\\" website, which includes fascinating material, has a section on \\"Bernardus Silvestris' Bold Synthesis\\" among other \\"Possible Sources,\\" and good bibliographies. An expanded version has appeared in print (2011; 442 pages!) as \\"Mysticism and Heresy: Studies in Radical Religion in the Central Middle Ages (c.850-1210),\\" available through Amazon. The modern text edition of \\"Cosmographia (Textus minores ; v. 53)\\" is available used through Amazon, although at a very high price. However, Barach and Wrobel's edition, although antiquated, is available as a free download (pdf) from the Library of Congress' archive.org (select the category \\"Texts,\\" and enter as search terms \\"Bernardus Silvestris\\" or \\"De Mundi Universitate\\"). Despite its defects, it can be compared to Wetherbee's variant readings as well as to his translation. I no longer have my hardcover copy, alas, but since I wrote this,\\" Cosmographia\\" has also been issued in a Kindle edition, at a reasonable price. I have been working my way through it, It seems to be a good, clean transfer (but the end notes are not hyperlinked to the text).]"},{"Title":"Before I Kill More ... : The William Heirens Story, An Account and a Quest","review":"ALL COPIES OF THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED.

Without being simplistic, it introduced me to so many interesting things I could use to my benefit. Being intellectually smart is surely a strong advantage in our society, but it doesn't say nearly as much as your control and awareness over your own emotions.

As you go up the corporate ladder, it is critical to know how to manage emotions so that you can relate better with others.This is not just an academic book but also one that looks at the whole aspect of emotional intelligence to see how it \\"fits in\\" with all aspects of life. The book examines all the relevant issues and provides sound, sensible advice succinctly.The book will change the way you look at life and relate with people. This is particularly the case with people with professional backgrounds that tend to emphasise logic and rationality such as engineers, doctors, mathematicians and the like.

Since much of your success work and play relates to how well you handle emotionally difficult situations, it's a very important to understanding your total intelligence. Your total intelligence is measured by taking your IQ and your EQ and also your personality.I personally have scored high on IQ and personality throughout my life yet have had issues on the EI side of the equation (I blame it on a stubborn Irish gene). This book and others on the subject will teach how messages enter through the spinal cord then enter limbic system (feeling center) and may never make it to the frontal lobe where your rational thought center sits. There are good methods in the book to force an emotional thought to the frontal lobe to trigger a more controlled response.Of the 10 or so books I have read on the subject this book is about the middle of the road. Their (The Authors) book EI 2.0 is probably a better value.I find the fact that I was 35 before I had ever heard of the subject is a sad statement about society.

First, there is clear manipulation of the y-axis. The authors zoom in on the 68-80% range on a scale that is 0 to 100 to inflate an effect/pattern. Looking past this trap, the average performance of this group is only 2-3 percentage points below the mean, with Directors falling on or about the mean!

According to authors Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves, you'd miss the mark if you based your choice on educational achievement, intelligence or experience.

When you're emotionally intelligent, your emotions work for - not against - you, and you are respectful and mindful of other peoples' feelings.

This may have been my own, never-fully-developed stab at the construct of \\"emotional intelligence.\\" At least my attempts at developing a theory may explain the success of this \\"quick\\" book. This is a short, useful treatment of an important construct, hampered primarily if not only by the difficulty in locating the password under the dust cover to allow the reader to go on line and assess his own emotional intelligence. I did not have the IQ to pull off that task but I guess I had the EI to not let it cause me to lose my temper.The basic two x two delineation of the personal (self-awareness and self-management) and social (read the book to learn these two) elements of EI are clearly drawn and easy to understand.

The categorization has as four parts: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. This is the biggest takeaway of the book. The rest of it is clarification or examples of what each category includes and how its important in personal situations.I have benefited from seeing people's behaviors through the lens of EQ. It helps explain not only my emotional strengths/weaknesses but also where other people have developed their emotional skills and where they are lacking.I only give it 3 stars because as useful as the categorization of emotional intelligence is (emotional intelligence really a misnomer, should be called emotional skill), there is no practical method for improving one's EQ provided by the book. The book itself is a quick read and doesn't go into much depth. Take the online assessment -- the questions themselves are useful in understanding what is considered high emotional intelligence. By the end, you'll know what EQ is, you'll know how to identify it, but in terms of improving your own EQ, this book leaves you to your own devices. Then again, knowing is half the battle.

This book positions itself as an educational book but is merely a tool to promote the authors' website and side business. For example, they encourage you to go to their website and take their quiz which they insist is not a \\"cosmo quiz\\". Before you take their quiz, be sure to find and write down the code in the jacket of the book. Great gimmicks. I did not feel that their goal was to teach their readers about emotional intelligence but more likely to get us to look into their business.The simplistic diagrams of the brain in the book attempt to get readers to think that this is a scientific book with ample research behind it. The authors state that \\"emotional intelligence\\" is searched more on the web than \\"John Travolta\\". Who cares?

Harlem is the backdrop for this gritty story, with its vibrant colloquial style, but at its core is a theme of family love and loyalty.The centerpiece of this provocative work of fiction is glamour girl extraordinaire Tiara Bynum. Tiara is a college student whose vain preoccupation with her physical appearance is only matched by her determination to find a wealthy man. Tiara and her tomboyish younger sister JoJo's only parental role models are their father Reggie, an ex-gambler/ex-prize fighter turned sanitation worker, and their whiskey imbibing Aunt Charlie, whose once beautiful face was disfigured in an auto accident. Reggie is fiercely devoted to his daughters and is indulgent with them to a fault. He has, however, instilled less than stellar values in Tiara regarding the importance of finding a man who can spoil and provide for her materially.When Tiara meets Lionel with his sleek Porche and designer clothes, she is immediately mesmerized by his flashy lifestyle and sees him as her dream man. Matters become complicated when she finds herself attracted to Rashad, a down to earth, community oriented cab driver whose seeming indifference to her good looks only serves to peak Tiara's interest in him. Soon Tiara has to make a choice which will change her life forever.In USING WHAT YOU GOT Karen creates characters that are at once endearing and exasperating. At the end of the story the reader is left with the impression that Tiara has somehow been reformed by her experiences, which makes the story a bit incredible. Overall this book is a very thought-provoking read.Reviewed by Autumnof the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"I really enjoyed this book by Karen Miller.

I'm more than halfway through the book and feel like I WANT A REFUND! I am so ashamed to have bought this book! I don't even let my friends see it and when people catch me reading it I admit it sucks and am just reading so at least I could say I read it. (Especially since I can't get my money back.)

He only lives in the projects so he can save for a brownstone and provide a better life and living enviorment for his girls.The weekends for Tiara and her friends are all about having fun. One Saturday night she and her friends get into a cab driven by Rashad. And while Tiara feels an instant connection to Rashad, she doesn't think he is giving her the attention she deserves, so she sets her sights on someone else. Tiara meets Lionel; a flashy, rich, fine and attentive man, who showers her with gifts. She feels that he is the man of her dreams. Will her dreams become nightmares?Karen E. Quinones Miller has written a fast paced novel that will keep readers turning the pages.

Her father is the one who implanted in her the idea that a rich man is the only thing she needed. So he too was blinded by all the glitter when Lionel showed up. His insecurity about his wife leaving him made him really spoil his daughters and put them in a mind to be &quot;Gold diggers&quot; as was Tiara.The only people that had enough sense in this book were Aunt Charlie and Rashad. Aunt Charlie had pinpointed Lionel from the begining. Rashad could see people for who they really were on the inside. The glitter and glamour didn't please him.The title to this book did not fit the storyline at all. Tiara didn't know how to use what she had. She had brain power and looks. Even the end she was still in that golddigger frame of mind but refrained when she realized how it would hurt her father and the man she loved. I believe if her father would have accepted that proposal that was offered in the end Tiara would have also went along with it. But that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"Very good read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"I actually borrowed this book from my teenage daughter who bought it from the writer (and it's signed!) last week.Celia and i both thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"that Ms. Miller's on to her third novel and it's just as stuffed with bad (sometimes REALLY bad) writing, ludicrous situations and unrealistic dialogue as the first two, as well as a main character that could really benefit from a well-placed boot. The only reason it holds your interest is because you want to see just what the hell the author is gonna come up with next. Whatever happened to well-written, believeable novels? As I said before, if you're gonna write fantasy, use dragons and wizards, not supposedly \\"real\\" people. But obviously I'm clearly in the monority, because everyone else raves about this tripe.... Am I being elitist? Not intentionally. It's just that when people buy and love junk like this, it doesn't say much about the quality of our current fiction, or level of literacy. This book is at best written at a high-school level, and again, badly at that. That's just sad. Karen: If you really care about your readers and not just the money you make from your books, and want to encourage authors of color, LEARN TO FREAKIN' WRITE! You don't have to try to be a Langston ar Zora; pick up any Val Wesley or Nina Whetstone; they write popular fiction but know how to use the English language properly!"},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"Reggie Bynum has a long and hard road to toll; he is a single father raising two teenage daughters in Harlem. On top of this, his sister Charlene (Charlie) visits often to cook and offer her own brand of discipline and advice. The novel is prefaced with a brief story of Reggie and Charlie as teenagers and the responsibilities put upon them. We get a glimpse of Reggie and his interactions with women, which sets the stage for his adulthood relationships. Reggie promises himself that he will never leave his family, like his father did, and will always provide what he can for them. Because of this affirmation, Reggie, a former professional gambler, takes a job as a garbage collector; it is honest and steady work. Reggie's wife Sharon and the girls' mother, abandons the family because of this decision.Nineteen-year-old Tiara Bynum is a beautiful and smart college student and she knows it. She uses her looks to get what she wants; it is all about Tiara and she damns anyone who gets in her way. Sister Josephine (Jo-Jo) is a basketball phenomenon suffering through the growing pains of adolescence. She is typically Tiara's punching bag. Tiara is caught in a dangerous game because she has her eyes set on two young men; one who is interested in her and one who could not care less. Rashad presents a challenge to Tiara because no man has ever resisted her charm. Rashad is a cab driver and film school student. Lionel presents a different challenge to Tiara; he is rich and able to provide her with any tangible item her little heart desires. Lionel has a dark side and the entire family is caught up in his web of deceit.Using What You Got offers some life lessons that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults. Miller has offered a very realistic and engaging look into the trials and tribulations that many families can go through based on poor decision making; the meaning of family first and forgiveness.Reviewed by Dawn R. ReevesAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"I have to start this by saying that book definitely wasn't all that. It was very, very shallow or maybe I am getting it mixed up with her main character Tiara Bynum, who is definitely shallow. One thing I can say is that Karen E. Quinones Miller made Tiara so real that I couldn't stand her through out the whole book.I think Karen E. Quinones Miller is colorstruck to some degree. She stresses the people that are light skin curly hair and light eyes. I'm sorry that doesn't make a person at all. She also makes is seem that since Tiara had hazel eyes made her the bomb diggity, which to me she was not; I felt she was a conceited witch. Ms. Miller mentioned in the book that Tiara wore a weave, well, that's telling me right there that she wasn't all that. When every situation went her way, she would say &quot;cause I got it like that&quot;. She was very rude and nasty to mostly everyone around her except her father and that was only because he bought her nice things and gave her money when she wanted it.I didn't like how Ms. Miller had so much physical fighting surrounding her story,it seemed that every situation, someone had to fight their way out of it, even her father a grown man and her aunt a grown woman was in the book fighting people. What type of example are they setting for Tiara and her little sister Jo-Jo.In the book's acknowledgements, Ms. Miller thanked her daughter Camille and her daughter's friends for helping her right the story and keep her on point. Pleeeeeeeeeeze...its seemed like a bunch of immature girls wrote that story instead of a grown woman protraying a story of a young girl. I am just saying that it was a poor style of writing for her third book.I don't mind when author's have similar story lines but the difference is how they tell their story, but Ms. Miller did a poor job at this one. Her first two books I love, but this one left a lot to be desired. I think she may have lost a fan."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"This book was a total waste of time, all that went on in the book was Tiara and her friends arguing and talking to each other like dogs. She was also a spoiled brat that whined so much, I could've slapped her myself. I don't know what's going on with the author, but her books haven't been worth anything since Satin Doll."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"Using What You Got by Miller PLEASANTLY surprised me. (I don't usually read this type of genre ... it's my LEAST favorite as a matter of fact.) I was doing a little &quot;required&quot; reading. This book stirs up quite a few emotions. Reggie is the doting father of Tiara and JoJo. He as done his best to give his girls all they ever wanted in this world and as you read you will understand why he try to give them so much. Aunt Charlene is Reggie's sister and is quite a character. JoJo is Tiara's younger but much taller sister, with some issues of her own. The story essentially revolves around Tiara. Tiara thinks,&quot;she's got it like that&quot; (basically she's conceited), but unfortunately she soon gets more than she bargained for. In the end, however, BOTH Reggie and Tiara will learn a valuable lesson.Using What You Got was a quick and easy read, it made me angry, it made me laugh and it made me cry. How much I enjoyed this book, tears and all, pleasantly surprised me. I would definitely recommend Using What You Got by Karen E.
