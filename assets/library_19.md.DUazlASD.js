Period.This book is horrific in its imagery, but the language and descriptions are gorgeous beyond belief. Anyone who loves the English language (and has a strong consitution) should read this novel and savor the terrible power of McCarthy's writing.I can honestly say that this is one of the few written works that has really left a unique and indelible mark on my spirit."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Know this: Those who find in this book too much darkness and too much blood should realize that this is only because there is too much of the evil and too much wickedness that lives and breathes in our histories and our hearts.

The guy is a genius w/ imagery. The blood is on tap. The male unconscious is laid naked and proven to be beautifully hideous. An epic."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"There is no bleaker or more bitter book. There is no better or more beautiful one, either. This novel, Cormac McCarthy's finest, depicts violence so depraved as to be almost unbearable, and doesn't ameliorate its impact by confining the evil within one or two sociopathic characters. His violence is institutionalized and endemic. His vision indicts the entire project of Western expansionism, and goes farther to become a threnody for the debased human condition.The writing in this book, though, is so careful and pure that the act of reading it is itself redemptive. As the story grows ever more horrific and threatens to engulf the reader in despair, the cumulative power of detail and diction elevates the spirit and mind. More than almost any other book, &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; shows art's ability to ennoble us while it illustrates our worst aspects.The experience is exhilarating."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a novel that, after reading the first time, you can never forget. The Judge towers over the book, your imagination, and most every other character in the literary canon. Cormac McCarthy writes a beautiful and horrific novel that is best the book written in the last half of this century and among the best ever written. With touches of magic realism, McCarthy can show Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Salman Rushdie a few things. This is the only book that I've read which has actually caused the hair on the back of my neck to stand on end. You will never forget this book, you will never forget the Judge--&quot;He says he will never die.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"It's always hard for me to explain just why this book is so wonderful. Sentences range from &quot;and he spat&quot; to endless prose poems describing Texas and Mexican landscapes that are full characters in the book.The story involves a young, quiet man who travels with a band of mercenaries who are paid by the Mexican government for Indian scalps. It is extremely violent, but more in the manner of the Iliad than, say, American Psycho.Philosophical insights, historical speculation, 2-dictionary words. . . . You will never regret reading the book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy is the kind of writer that would have been born out of a union between Faulkner and Peckinpah, excessively violent and excessively and intentionally obtuse. I can see why so many people loved this book, the writing is original and the characters initially interesting, but after a hundred or so pages of beautifully written senseless gore I transitioned from horror to boredom and had a hard time maintaining my interest. If you like challenging writing and don't mind a blown off head or two, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a tale of savage violence, murder and mayhem on the lawless frontier of the Southwest during the 1850's. Don't read it for plot (it's pretty much one damn thing after another) or character development (all the characters are vile). Read it for the gorgeous, sumptuous language. The writing is utterly unique and unforgettable. And there is a mystery to be solved: Who is the Judge, anyway?"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I'm not sure how I never heard of Cormac McCarthy until about three months ago, but anyone with even a passing interest in unforgiving, challenging literature should know this guy's name. While I've just started getting into his catalogue, I've read in several corners that Blood Meridian is among his defining works, and it's easy to see why. A revisionist Western in the Unforgiven/The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly mold (but a lot more graphic), this is a guy novel to end all guy novels, with absolutely no attention whatsoever to emotions or sensitivity and plenty of space devoted to graphic depictions of killings, debauchery, and general atavism. Needless to say, I loved it.The book starts out following The Kid, a directionless teen runaway living a life devoid of civilizing influences, a prime candidate for the bloodbath to come. The Kid eventually falls in with a group of mercenaries contracted to kill Indians and collect their scalps, and crosses the border with them into harsh terrain of Mexico. The company initally has at least a semblance of a clear purpose, but their mission quickly devolves into a harrowing, Heart of Darkness-style journey into the darkest recesses of human nature. As they travel through the desolate recesses of Mexico, the company descends to a level of savagery that matches that of their targets, leaving a trail of drunkenness, murder, and general atavism at every stop. At the lead are Glanton, a vicious former Army captain, and Holden (aka The Judge), a mysterious superman seemingly transplanted on Earth from another planet. The Judge is both literally and figuratively a towering (and for some reason hairless) figure, a freakishly gifted philospher-king type whose goal is nothing less than to make the whole natural world submit to his will. The Kid, for his part, basically just goes along, submitting to the senseless violence of his surroundings because he can't really think of anything else to do. The book is also littered with memorable secondary characters, including a mentally retarded guy (or \\"Idiot,\\" in the book's politically incorrect terminology) whom the Judge picks up in his travels and basically adopts for no apparent reason.Much like McCarthy's recent The Road, Blood Meridian is heavily concerned with exploring the effects of a completely amoral and uncivilized environment on human behavior, but Blood Meridian goes much deeper than that, incorporating ample doses of heavy philosophy and replacing the mythology of the Western genre with its own, much darker and more compelling worldview. The book's violence, whether committed by the company or by the Indians, is frequently gruesome and unsparing, with more descriptions of scalping and castration than many will want to read, but it's all memorably rendered in McCarthy's sweeping, biblical prose. More important, though, is McCarthy's pitch-perfect evocation of the scarred landscape his characters travel across, a dystopia where any checks on man's baser instincts have vanished in favor of a primitive, survival-of-the-fittest mentality. Institutions are nonexistent, causing its characters to basically make up their own morality, and the results are about what you'd expect when men are allowed to create the rules as they go along.While Blood Meridian may be anything but pretty, and the incredible density and obscurity of McCarthy's prose (lot of unfamiliar words there) make for some difficult reading, I found my eyes glued to the page most of the time I was reading this. There's a certain purity to McCarthy's storytelling here, as his focus is pared down to an examination of man's predisposition to violence and drive to impose himself on his surroundings, with few extraneous considerations or digressions. Sure, in the end there may not be a great deal of redeeming societal value in this book, but as long you're not looking for any you'll probably be as riveted as I was. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is a dramatic story, drawn from the uncomfortable relationship humans have with the dark side, and mixed with the bloodline that links mankind to the savage beast. Unlike the beast, man has the higher brain function to control this instinct, which is what makes portraits of bloodthirsty murder even more chilling. Like many novels before it, Blood Meridian probes the violent side of man, but resisting the failures of almost all novels before it, remains in the story to the end. There is no happy ending, no redemption, and no recovery. Someone once told me that drama exists to evoke emotion. McCarthy's novel induces plenty, each emotion shrouded with some level of fear.The first thing you'll notice is McCarthy's unique style. It sticks out like a white belt on pink polyester. He tells you the story, whether you like it or not. Whoever said that voice over is the death of any story, clearly has never read this book. After adjusting to the style and the words (he uses words and language you don't know) you lose your skepticism in the Morse code rhythm of the story. There is an amazing story in here and if you just listen long enough you'll have to know the end.The second thing you'll notice is the unforgiving images of death. I'm reminded of how I was initially blinded by the violence in Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction and missed the cool story and dialogue. If you're prepared for it, the images of dead scalped babies hanging from trees, or the endless descriptions of human torture won't draw the curtains over this western tale. In fact McCarthy has exposed the not-for-Hollywood elements of the early West; murderous Apaches, barbarous bounty hunters, glorified gauchos and filth that great Western movies like Unforgiven are not capable of telling. For any fan of the Western genre, this book is a must read.Finally, you'll recoil at the characters in the book for their dirty, heartless life. Each one out-repulsing the other as they make their \\"way\\" to nowhere in particular. Maybe you get the idea that when you begin your day focused on survival that sensitivity and morals tend to flitter out the window. Instinct overtakes conscious, and the beast reincarnates in the man.This feels like an important book. Like some of those you read a long time ago in an American Literature class. It feels like Moby Dick but looks like something much different. I can't judge where the book fits amongst the classics but I can be sure that it belongs on the shelf that defines the Western genre."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book is poetry for people who can't stand poetry. It's western history for those not interested in religious movements or family life on the plains. It's a gorgeous read, filled with glowing descriptions of the natural West, and choked with the violence of the early westward expansion. People die on every page, the main characters are horrible people, and to sympathize with them, the book requires you to read it with the darkest parts of your soul.This book is haunted by death and cruelty; this book is black and dark, as black and as dark and as beautiful as the night itself.Read it. Buy it. Cormac MCarthy KNOWS how to write about the West. He knows to write, period."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The &quot;I&quot; in paragraph 2 of chapter one is the kid's father, drunk and reminiscing, speaking directly to the kid. McCarthy's eschewal of quotation marks does make this a little ambiguous, but not hopelessly so. The Leonids meteor shower of 1833 was one of the most spectacular in recorded history -- possibly 150,000 meteors per hour -- and it occurred on the night of November 12/13, pinpointing the kid's birthday. Notice also that at the end of the novel, when the now middle-aged kid walks out to the jakes in Fort Griffin to meet his grisly fate at the hands of the Judge, there is another spectacular meteor storm occurring -- possibly the Leonids again, which would mean the kid dies on his birthday."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Some excellent reviews have already been written here on Amazon, so I will make mine brief. \\"Blood Meridian\\" is not an easy read in any sense: scenes of shocking brutality are interspersed with weighty philosophical ponderings and unbeatable scenery-setting. McCarthy is, for my money, one of the very best American writers ever and there is no better showcase than \\"Blood Meridian.\\" How an author can maintain such unblemished perfection for over three-hundred pages is a mystery. The problem, however, is that three-hundred pages is a little too much of a good thing--the plot (what little there is) is simply too thin to sustain even such exceptional writing. Massacre after massacre, drunken binge after drunken binge -- at times, everything seems to blend together. Violence is violence is violence and while some scenes are more horrific than others, McCarthy's commentary regarding the heinous acts men are capable of committing is made early on. Still, the unforgettable, tightly-written ending is ample payoff. Whatever else may be said for the novel, it will certainly make one look at the world in a different light."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Does a novel whose action fits the genre description \\"Western,\\" at whose heart lies convicting moral ambiguity and historical \\"fact,\\" and that reads as densely as poetry sound like a page turner? What if I said that the first 80 pages are like learning a new language? What if, as well, I said that it would be a good idea to read up on what was going on \\"politically\\" in North America between the years 1833 and 1878? It is true of Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian that readers looking for a mental rest need not apply, but this novel is worth the time it takes to read, even to read the number of times it takes before it can be fully grasped. (I suggest not expecting to make this a single-read novel.)Nothing in McCarthy's novel can be taken only at face value, not even the \\"Wild West\\" convention itself. This is not a novel in which black or white hats distinguish the bad guys from the good guys. This is a novel sunk deeply in history that will make readers question if there are such a things as \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys.\\" Readers will likely find themselves, as I did, excusing or ignoring the actions of certain characters just to have someone with whom to side. Ultimately, McCarthy will not allow this, leaving his audience in a stormy sea of characters and actions too horrifying not to be true.Set in the era of Manifest Destiny, Blood Meridian, on a surface level, seems like a story of the slaughter of innocents. Getting below that surface, even innocence becomes questionable. Is it humanity's capability for evil that stratifies us? Or is evil a concept entirely invented by the person writing history? If it is true what has been said, that history is written by the winners, then it seems that evil is an invention of the winners, and something else divides all life into categories. McCarthy's novel gets at what it truly is that divides us, the abstractions of our minds. While the reader's eyes are riveted to the windows of his bloody world, McCarthy is telling us things about ourselves that we do not want to know, and yet we cannot deny.The story begins with the lengthy personal history of one of two key players whom the reader mostly know as \\"the kid.\\" From the details of the kid's history, it is hard to imagine that we would ever end up rooting for him. Between flashbacks and through sometimes cryptic seeming prose we follow the kid to the true beginning of this saga, where we realize that we have met the other key player, the Judge, many pages before, and likely without realizing it. The reader is well-rewarded not to let McCarthy's thick prose throw him for a loop. This author will slip things by you. That is why I suggest a repeat reading. Blood Meridian requires that the reader be aware of what is not being said as well as what is. Before too long, the reader will find himself a witness to atrocities that implicate him by virtue of his desire to ignore one man's actions while recognizing another's, if only to get some bearings in the tumultuous world of this novel. It is all too easy to forget that everyone is in on the conspiracy in this novel, even the reader. Don't worry, though. McCarthy's meaning totally inaccessible. As the kid and the Judge come closer and closer to their inevitable clash of characters, McCarthy gives the reader a clue from the lips of the kid. \\"What's he a judge of?\\" When you know that (and remember that nothing in this novel is only what it seems on the surface), you're truly in McCarthy's world.Give this novel a chance (or several chances) to show you the true darkness of humankind's history. If it seem like it is too frightening, remember that some things are too horrific not to be true. And if you have some extra time check out the historical autobiography section of the nearest major library."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"&quot;BLOOD MERIDIAN&quot; is a novel of awe-inspiring ferocity, a mythological Western illuminating the choices men make and the consequences of their action and inaction.The stark and monumental beauty of the landscape is in fact the most noticeable aspect of this work ( I found that having some familiarity with the desert and mountains of New Mexico and Arizona helped me in following McCarthy's brilliant descriptive prose ). Somehow, through a tightly controlled yet rhapsodic style, McCarthy conveys the beauty of the natural surroundings in an objective manner, neither from the perspective of Glanton's nihilistic band of scalphunters ( a poisonous human &quot;organism&quot; taking on the characteristics of the amoral and equally deadly environment they rove through ) nor from apparently any human perspective at all ( I confess I was not aware of the presence of a narrator ). The paradox is that these passages ARE filtered through the lenses of McCarthy's perceptive and, one senses, humane sensibilities.To me, one of the primary themes the book conveys is what happens with man's divorce from any vestige of citizenship, a separation most definitely not resulting in the wistful Romantic era notion of a &quot;return to nature&quot;. The overriding power of the Ancient Greek &quot;tragic vision&quot; of life has been re-born again in &quot;BLOOD MERIDIAN&quot; ( the myth of Pandora's Box comes to mind; also the symbolism of the snake devouring itself ).The novel's most fascinating and mysterious character is &quot;Judge&quot; Holden, a physical oddity ( 7 foot tall, albino, completely hairless ) and a figure of immense intelligence, creativity and rhetorical eloquence. His persuasive brilliance is &quot;balanced&quot; with proportional reserves of evil ( he is the archetypal destroyer; a child-murderer and perverter of dreams and aspirations ). The judges' kindness is cruelty, his honesty is deception- he is the very emblem of arrogance and resentment. The &quot;Judge&quot; is a character worthy of comparison with the great villians in literature ( Milton's Satan; Dostoevsky's &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot; ).Previous thoughts notwithstanding, I don't wish to convey the notion that this is a simplistic morality play; McCarthy's ideas are not easily defined and categorized. As with all great works of art, this book contains much more than one can elucidate. Riches of insight abound. &quot;BLOOD MERIDIAN&quot; is a novel to come back to every few years; there is that much substance in it. An excerpt from the writings of the German mystic Jacob Boehme cited at the very beginning of the novel sets the tone perfectly:&quot;It is not to be thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing. There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of the darkness.&quot;I urge others to journey through the bleak beauty of &quot;BLOOD MERIDIAN&quot;. It is harrowing but you will be the richer for it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy knows now to take the edges of society and reduce them to mere animals. This book is brutal. The main character lurches along from one debasement to the next, and some scenes are so difficult to read, I felt a tiny bit nauseous. Yet, it's McCarthy. What else do you expect? And in the end, this book is beautiful in a sort of wildlife safari way. Yes, there's death and blood and heartlessness. But that is how the characters see themselves and the world around them. Like it or not, it has a way of drawing you in."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Literally the best book i have ever read. I am obsessed. I will not go into details since everyone else has."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Absolutely amazing book - Bone-chilling, violent, breath-taking, lyrical... As a horror aficionado, I went into this book thinking it would be a quieter story, more of a western and written in the vein of \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" Nothing could be further from what this book is - The storyline is shocking and filled with terrifying scenes. I am continuously amazed at the author's clear prose and descriptive prowess - McCarthy is truly a master author."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Absolutely phenomenal book. I can see why this book is re-read so many times. McCarthy does magic with words and there are parts of this story, mainly almost everything said by the judge, that are so profound that you'd think they were the subject of a philosophy course. The imagery of the West is beautifully described, and it's brutality is not sugar coated in the slightest to portray heroic cowboys or solemn native americans. Blood Meridian is a brutal tale bordering on a level of despair and depravity that only the American West could provide setting for.Going on my favorites shelf."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This was a difficult book to read - not only because of subject matter but also because of writing style. This is the second book by McCarthy I have read, the first beingThe Road, and I don't remember \\"The Road\\" being written in the same literary style. It took quite a while to get into the rhythm of the story because of lack of punctuation and an abundance of author created compound words.That written, this was a compelling journey through the dark side, almost having the feel of an epic poem about it (think the Iliad and the Odyssey) although without the requisite hero.I was glad I was reading this on my Kindle for a few reasons - built-in dictionary, highlighting and note taking capabilities. The prose was true to the time period (1800's) with many unfamiliar terms.Brutal mind pictures, lyrical landscape descriptions of wasteland after wasteland, the inhumanity of man. Word after tortured word rolling out of this author and imprinting themselves on my brain and psyche.This definitely was not an easy read or a fun read but if you have a love of masterfully written prose (and do not have a weak stomach), \\"Blood Meridian\\" is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Finally finished this book just this past week. I'm not ashamed to say that it was my second attempt to get through it, either.It's very difficult to describe this work, even in a simple manner. At a little over three hundred pages, it is not a simple, quick read and its one that outright demands that you don't speed read it but absorb every facet of McCarthy's writing. The man is a living legend and proves it with this chilling tale. He has managed to create (or recreate) a world that is so detailed in his writing that for those of us who have never braved the badlands of the West (like myself), you will literally be able to taste the air of this world and you will feel like you are walking along with the characters as they make their way through this nightmarish journey. The violence in this book is indeed sickening, just like you may have heard. In fact, I'll go on record as saying that this is the most beautifully written description of slaughter and debauchery I have ever read.The characters are handled in an interesting way in that you really don't get to learn much about them, being that the story really reads like just a dictation of events. The one character that most likely will stay with you is that of Judge Holden, a character that nearly defies description, at least as far as his motivations go. It is a book of horrors from a very real past and a reminder of the darkness that lurks within all of us. I'm still trying to grasp what I've read and I can only help but feel like I'm trying to tame a wild mustang. I sincerely believe I'm going to have to read this book again and do some further research on it because I can't shake the imagery out of my head or the idea that I've read something that is just too grand for me to have understood in one go through.I would recommend this without skipping a beat but like I said before, its not an easy book to get through due to the heavy language usage. It is a book that needs to be read with respect, for it waits for no one as it blazes forward at both a slow burn and a devil's run.On a side note, I really don't see how this could be made into a film but if it were and it were done right, it would be an instant cult classic.And on a more important note, if this book includes the intro by Harold Bloom, read it only after you've finished the book as there are serious spoilers in it. You'd think the man would've had the sense to have this be included as an afterword or not be so assuming and think that we were all familiar with the book before handing out important plot details without so much as a heads up. Its a very well written piece but better left until after you're done."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"After reading \\"No Country For Old Men\\" and \\"The Road\\" (my favorite of his books) I decided to give Blood Meridian a try. Just an amazing book. The way McCarthy writes dialogue, the imagery he communicates, the ferocity of the violence...it's all very special and shows just what an amazing talent he is. By taking some true stores from the Glanton Gang (Judge Holden may be a real person) and combining them with his abilities, McCarthy made me think he was eyewitness to these accounts.There is active work being done for a movie version which should be released in 2011, though this might be one of the most difficult films to cast I've ever seen. The other part the film makers will have a tough time with is the violence. While it fits well within the story, it still would be too gory for a movie and it will be interesting to see what path they take.All in all, while \\"The Road\\" is my favorite of his works, I'm more likely to re-read \\"Blood Meridian\\" every few years, it strikes me as the kind of book that you will find different nuances with every reading."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy tells an essentially true story, reminiscent of Lord of the Flies but concerning adult males with fully matured savagery.

But, it's the I-cant-take-my-eyes-off-the-page train wreck syndrome. He has a way of reminding us that we are animals, after all, and will do what it takes to survive, when backed in a corner. He also reminds us of how our ancestors granted the Native American a favor by giving him all that desert.

The story meanders from one situation to the next while Cormac narrates from the clouds. You will not find yourself daydreaming about the Kid and the various people in this book.The 4 stars comes from Cormac's ability to create such vivid imagery with words beyond most vocabularies. I was engaged throughout the book by the images flowing through my head. He alternates between simple sentences and long elaborate passages that sound like poetry.Here is an example: \\"The sand lay blue in the moonlight and the iron tires of the wagons rolled among the shapes of the riders in gleaming hoops that veered and wheeled woundedly and vaguely navigational like slender astrolobes and the polished shoes of the horses kept hasping up like a myriad of eyes winking across the desert floor.\\""},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is an American classic.

The first fifty pages or so were a bit of a struggle. The more I read, however, the more I came to accept (or even look forward to) Mccarthy's monolithic sentences and paragraph style. While the cold violence is quite intense, I would bet that it was probably fairly accurate for the novel's times and places. History has a tendency to get more glossy and sterile as time moves on. Mccarthy describes an era that most people would have little or no concept of. That is what truly makes this a classic. I hope Ridley Scott doesn't allow the violence to overshadow the real, bleak ideas when the movie comes out in 2009. One thing is certain....it may be the most graphic western ever filmed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Mccarthy has been described as \\"our greatest living writer.\\" He lives up to that title in what is in my opinion probably his best novel. Any fan of Mccarthy or someone just looking for a good read should definitely consider this book.The story is similar to that of many of this other books, containing the recurring themes of Gnosticism, nihilism and violence. It tells the tale of someone known as nothing more than the Kid. The story follows the Kid's adventures with a group of scalp hunters in the American southwest. Amongst the scalp hunters is a certain character, the Judge, a massive monument to the evil in this world.It's not so much the story that makes the book though. Don't get me wrong, the story is both engaging and interesting, as is the writing style, but what really defines this book are the unique ideals of good and evil, light and darkness. As the reader is lead along the Kid's turbulent path, drug behind in the wake of the Judge, the reader is forced to look at what appears to pure evil straight in the face. It is no short look either, it lasts most of the book. This view of the world is both stark and harsh but it rings true somehow. It is this ring of truth from within the darkness that makes the book what is is: great."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"...and who would have guessed it? But that is the 'subject' of this incredible book: the eternal battle between Good and Evil fought across a no-man's land of bleached desert sparsely alleviated by barricaded towns of terrified civilians forever threatened with instant annihilation.Across this deathscape of fortune-seekers, looters, gunslingers, Indians, con-men, prostitutes, and soldiers, an enigmatic bald man called 'The Judge' dispenses a brand of 'justice' the likes of which will chill you to the bone.\\"Tour de force\\" is a phrase that is all-too-cheaply thrown at books nowadays, but if ever a book deserved that appellation, its *Blood Meridian.* The language alone carries you away--muscular, musical, and monstrous--describing unimaginable horrors with such visceral beauty youre left in awe at what youve seen and where McCarthy has taken you. To Hell, really, is where youve gone, and back again, if you ever really left Hell in the first place.Among recent 'apocalyptic literature,' I can only recall one other novel that affected me as deeply in its uncompromising tone, subject-matter, & style as *Blood Meridian,* and that is a novel called *Afterhuman.*I am looking forward to reading McCarthy's *No Country for Old Men* next, and then, perhaps, his latest, *The Road.* But I cant imagine anything that can follow up on a novel like *Blood Meridian.* I think that every author probably has one comprehensive \\"testament\\" in him, one true revelation, and I'd have to think for Cormac McCarthy everything after *Blood Meridian* is mere commentary on the vision he's delivered here.Read this book. I wont say that you wont regret it...but you'll surely never forget it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is certainly a special book. It is the first Mccarthy book I have read, and it certainly made my eyes open wide. His style is very deliberate, slow storytelling - perfectly matched to the scenery and pace of the protagonists. The lack of first names, deliberate obfuscation of most character's origins and motives make this a very strange book. A saga and an epic, in a slim volume. If I use \\"deliberate\\" a lot in this review it is because the book is clearly crafted by a master. One who understands what he wants to say, and has the talent and mastery of the language - words, rhythms, cadence, and punctuation - to bring it alive.That said, this is not an easy read - at least it was not for me. Sometimes I have felt like I was traveling through a similar landscape to that of SouthWest - hard journey with dazzling views along the way."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy is clearly a highly intelligent and incredibly well read writer. There's more philosophical, historical, literary and anthropological erudition packed into these pages than in probably any novel I've ever read (and no doubt there's even more than I realize that simply went over my head). He also has some serious writing chops - there were multiple passages that I marveled over, reading several times before moving on not because I needed clarifying, but just for the sheer pleasure of reading them. But neither of these things are enough to make a great novel, and in the end, I felt like this one was more satisfying to think about afterward, mulling over specific bits, than it was to actually read.Partly it was the structure of the book that irked me. Long stretches meander on like a shaggy dog story and a lot of the scenes seemed to repeat themselves without much thematic elaboration over the course of the book (and now there's another apocalyptic hellscape; and now there's another brutally violent Indian attack and/or brutally violent attack on Indians; and now the Judge is talking philosophy and doing some pseudo-mystical stuff again; and now there's yet another apocalyptic hellscape; et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum). That McCarthy gives us basically no access whatsoever to the thoughts of his characters, makes his protagonist (\\"the Kid\\") largely an inactive observer within an ensemble cast too large to keep track of (the lack of quotation marks and dialogue tags doesn't help here), and writes in an uneven style which lingers on certain minute details while condensing major events into a sentence or two, all serve to compound this problem and keep the reader at a distance. Most of the book reads more like a lengthy description of a Hieronymus Bosch painting in narrative form than like a novel in any conventional sense. This combination of detachment and gravitas may also be part of the reason why the violence in this novel didn't effect me in the way I was expecting it to, or the way I expect McCarthy intended it to. Reading drole descriptions of mutilation and torture in American Psycho made me physically ill. Reading McCarthy go on about skinned babies hanging from trees in solemn, biblical verbiage just seemed kind of silly.But I probably could have put aside my quibbles with the structure if it weren't for the writing style. As I said, there are some incredible passages here. But they are the exception, and not the rule. For the most part, the style is overbearingly pretentious. Though I hate to use that overused and frequently abused word, it really is the most accurate. McCarthy's writing can be impressive in its own right, but only occasionally does the style of the book's prose (some amalgam of Melville, Milton and the Book of Revelation with a country twang) align with its thematic and narrative aims. More often, it just gets in the way. B.R. Meyers says it better than I could (see his \\"Reader's Manifesto\\" in The Atlantic, the section on \\"Muscular Prose\\"): \\"[N]ovels tolerate epic language only in moderation. To record with the same somber majesty every aspect of a cowboy's life, from a knife fight to his lunchtime burrito, is to create what can only be described as kitsch.\\"I should add as an addendum to all this that I read most of this book standing on a crowded subway during my commute. Maybe I'll try it again sometime sitting in a nice comfy chair and come away amazed. But I kind of doubt it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book was recommended to me by Mr. Greg Proops. He said that this was a must-read, and it turns out that he was right. You'll be walking in the Kid's shoes through a story full of blood, gore, and everything American."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have never written a review in my life but I have to say this is, without a doubt, the greatest book I have ever read. That's it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCormack's unique style of writing once again captivates in Blood Meridian, with sculpted landscapes, mesmerising dialogues, and portrayals of violence that are disturbingly perceptive. Spinning a web between two disparate characters, the youthful Kid and the diabolical Judge, one is swept away on a most disturbing journey of the deepest senses. As several of his books, the mythology of the wild west is given a twist, unravelling the spin that has formed our perception of this part of American history, exposing it as it really was. The savage events that dominated the growth of the new nation are bared in chilling detail, uncomfortably lyrical in a language as of song. But it strikes an even deeper core, timeless beyond the historical time frame of the western expansion in America, equally relevant today as in any other time, relevant far beyond the geography of America's west. The elements of human nature are exposed as the quest for power and its abomination into brutality culminates in the peaks of violence - the meridians of blood. McCormack's writing, singular and unique as no other, as full of emotion as it is sparse in punctuation, stimulating and illuminating in clarity of thought, effortlessly breaking the mould of conventional form and grammar, and ultimately striking a chord deep within, that normally is touched only through poetry. And what most would not dare admit, a chord as relevant today as it was in the days of the wild west. My admiration for McCormack's writing, driven both by emotion and intellect, is complete - the man is a true master, this book a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"At times, one questions the narrowness of McCarthy's vision, but his writing is beautiful, his sense of humanity brutal and realistic. I wanted to hate this book after page 1, but it has haunted me for years."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"evidence of constant suffering and pain.Here's the thing. BLOOD MERIDIAN is one of those polarizing books. Some consider it the greatest thing since the paperclip, others think its a load of hooey. I find it falls, to this humble reader, somewhere in the middle. No doubt it is a monumentous achievemnt. But I have to wonder if it is one of linguistic daring-do or one of pompous, \\"lookee what I can get away with\\" rasberry to the literary world. McCarthy does not care one lick for rules of grammar and style that do not fit in with his plan (quotation marks, apostrophes, commas, and semi colons be damned!!!).The language is most definately something from a different plane of existence, and while that is a nod to the balls and smarts of McCarthey, it makes the novel a slog-fest. I mean, come on, I am all for poetic prose, but damn, the thickness of the diction, the layering of simile upon simile and the shear volume of obscure wordings is tough to deal with. On a positive note, the book is a case study in the filthy and visceral: you can almost smell, taste, feel, the rank nastiness of the existence the novel presents.\\"Death seemed the most prevalent feature of the landscape.\\" This is no joke. The landscape is continuously dotted with the evidence of murder, disease and pain and then is strewn with the bones of actual men and beasts or those of the passing of human activity in the world. Nihilism in the desert.The first 4/5ths of the book are punctuated by some of the best lines I have ever read surrounded by a whole lotta blah, blah, blah, blah... the diction and vocabulary are almost overwhelming and the scenes of travelling (and boy are there a lot of them) are slow, ponderous and surreal to the extreme.That being said, the final three chapters of the book are some of my favorite reading ever. The whole of the tale is really found there in the last 50 pages or so. The first 260 are simply the prelude, the ultra violent, trudging, filthy prologue. The scene with the bear in the tavern will haunt me for the rest of my life. And, while some people balk at Judge Holden being considered one of the greatest characters in literature, I whole heartedly agree. The Judge is a god from a High Place come down upon the creation to weave his own way in the world. He is charming, disgusting, terrifying and wholly fascinating.Ultimately, the book will not be for everyone. Heck, it will not be for most, but if you can slog through the horror to get to the end, it is well worth the read and will put your brain to the test. Cormac will make ya think, that's for sure. But for me, the book could have been half as long, the language less cryptic and the similes toned down just a bit and it would have been far more approachable. Not that it is for me to be so bold, but this is, after all, my review. To the uneducated rube that I am, it seems that McCarthy often sets out to write literary fiction, and he goes about it as if he stands above the rest of the literary world as a Judge Holden of writing. It often comes across as self-serving and vain. Regardless, the end of BLOOD MERIDIAN makes up for all of it and wraps it up nicely, albeit vaguely.Spoiler-ish warning!!!To those who have read it, in the end, whatever happens to the kid is irrelevant. For me, it is enough that he goes willingly."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Perhaps it was the relentless violence. Could have been the alienating vocabulary that poked out of the pages used to describe the terrain and other simple items. Perhaps its because I never saw into the character of \\"The Kid\\" who I guess was the hero. All that being said there was some staggering writing that I marveled at and the overall sweep of the story was impressive.From a masterwork I would have liked to have seen a little more depth of character shown. I'm sure that was not McCarthy's point of interest here, but a little more balance between it and the scenes of brutality would have made this a more rewarding read for me."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"For the McCarthy uninitiated, it takes time to adjust to his writing style, particularly Blood Meridian. I made the mistake of taking this book to the beach the first time I tried to read it. Blood Meridian requires careful attention and the duly attentive reader will be rewarded by this wonderful book.I must admit that I put the book down for a couple months in part from disgust as it often reads like a horror novel and in part because law school rarely accommodates pleasure reading. When I returned to finish it, I started over, read it without interruption and actually disliked it very much when I first put it down. However, upon reflection and reading a few other novels in between, I find myself thinking about Blood Meridian often (much like another reviewer). Blood Meridian is hard to read but I highly recommend it now.The poetic descriptions of violence are shocking in their regularity but most shocking because they rarely advance the plot in any meaningful way. McCarthy, whose other books seem to deal with the inescapable presence of evil, ends up eliciting the same indifference to violence in the reader as that demonstrated by the characters in the book. It is a wonderful literary technique that few writers are even capable of achieving. Perhaps the cleverest part of the book is the fact that one of the most important scenes of violence receives hardly any description at all. It makes the book challenging and thought-provoking.Blood Meridian is not a page turner because you want to find out what happens next, rather McCarthy's prose will invite you into the book's scenery and immerse you in its sentiment. This book will appeal to readers who believe, like McCarthy, that evil, danger, and violence will always be a part of the human condition. In spite of that, I also found some truly beautiful moments when the characters, after suffering staggering calamities, continued on without delving into the existential angst we see all the time now.Blood Meridian is excellent. The characters are truly unique and the prose is simply stunning."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Well, here we go again: Another group of 1-star, pseudo-intellectual reviewers complaining about the themes of evil and brutality, the lack of a happy ending, and a general lack of sunshine and flowers. Clearly, McCarthy is not bothered about the perceived covenants of what does or doesn't make a novel worth reading. Buy the book (or borrow it from your library or a friend), read it, and come to your own conclusions. 1-star reviewers: Back to mass market trash, pop-up books and Disney movie tie-ins is your best option."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy has risen to stardom in the past few years through the esteem of several major critics, and through the very fine adaptation of No Country for Old Men. Blood Meridian is widely regarded as his finest work, and I don't disagree. It is an extremely dark and well crafted vision of the barbarism of the West, with particular emphasis on the brutality of the U.S. in its conquest of Mexico. We are given unfathomable acts violence and hatred amidst the landscape of godless oblivion. However, I'm increasingly inclined to feel that McCarthy is a one-note writer; his persistent need to repel is strange and often uninteresting. Although he is truly capable of telling a good tale, his characters are often flat caricatures. Although very good, to call Blood Meridian another 'Iliad' or 'Moby Dick' is simply hyperbole."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I am not a professional literary critic; I acknowledge McCarthy is a talented writer, maybe even great writer. But the unrelenting amount of violence and cruelty in Blood Meridian strikes me as having crossed the line to pornography. Are we supposed to enjoy it? Are we supposed to be horrified, enlightened? To what purpose? Other than perhaps to recognize that CM can turn a phrase, I do not see any purpose or value. Do any of the characters presented have a discernible personality or motivation for their actions? This book to me is the literary equivalent of a snuff film, which I have not the perversity to see as other than pornography."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book felt too much like required reading in high school - so boring in fact I couldn't even finish it.

If not, read Lonesome Dove instead, it's a hundred times better."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have enjoyed other books by this author, but I felt abused by Blood Meridian. It consists of a series of almost unconnected scenes of unspeakable violence. There, now you know the book. There is very little story. It reminds me of an awful book by Clancy, I don't recall the name if it, but he based it on some submarine video game he had played with a friend one night. He then just wrote it up and sold it to me as a book. \\"Open the outer doors.\\" \\"Outer doors open, sir.\\" On and on. Submarine battle after battle. The complete opposite of his great Hunt for Red October. In that same way, I thought this book the inverse of All The Pretty Horses, which I found to be a wonderful book. There was extreme violence in that book too, but there was much more to the story than violence. In Blood Meridian, you are forced to travel with a continually shrinking band of men who ride and walk from violent scene to scene...and that's it. After a while you see that the only energy the author has put into the book is trying to come up with ever more imaginative ways for his characters to mutilate human beings. The author covers up the lack of a real story with flowery language that reminds me of Bob Dylan's 120 decibel backup musicians on his current tour, trying to drown out the sad fact that Bob plainly can't sing anymore. I'm sorry, but everyone saying how this is a great book is just the Emperor' Clothes.

It has great insights into how men can survive on next to nothing, while at the same time being ever vigilant. Yet the story is so overwhelmingly grim as to be a genuine burden to slog through. The main character, the Kid, is unbelievable. He's apparently very self sufficient right up until the end when he's killed by the child molesting chronic killer and all around sociopath, Holden. Holden is the sort of overt child defiling character who in real life wouldn't last a month in a state penitentiary, because someone would rightly dispatch him as soon as possible. Somehow his wordy, over the top speechy dialogue causes the other sociopath killers in his group to be taken in by his talk, and not blow his brains out, even though they would kill anything else hat moves. Some want to hold this story up as a model of a well written, meaningful novel with deep insights, and references to ancient beliefs. It's pure bunk. Holden wouldn't have lasted two weeks. There are dark sides and there are there are those dark sided characters who don't tolerate child molesters. Glorify this character and this story and you glorify child molestation.

The beginning of the novel drew me in and I was eager to read on. It has a fantastic set-up. The execution of the rest of it is what I didn't like.For the most part the novel details the travels of the Glanton Gang, and this is where it falls flat for me. The novel skips from one scene to the next to the next within a very short space of time, which didn't allow me to indulge in anything of potential interest, unlike previous McCarthy novels such as \\"Outer Dark\\" or \\"Child of God\\" where there are long scenes which allow tension to build and the reader to be drawn into the world of the novel.As I said before, the novel mostly just explains what the Gang does on a day to day basis, and I found this boring. I don't mind the \\"montage\\" style in a novel if it's used where appropriate, but when the majority of it is written in this style, I lose interest fast. Not only is this all that happens, but it goes on and on and on, and I don't understand why people enjoy it so much. I appreciate the fact that this is a classic, and that it reveals the truth of American history, but that doesn't mean much to me when I'm not enjoying it in the slightest.This novel was nothing but a struggle for me. However, I'm not going to claim that you should drop it from your reading list, if you are intending to read it, I'd say give it a blast.

His endless descriptions of the landscape where great in the beginning, but got very tedious and consumed large portions of the book. The main reason I stopped was his use of metaphors. In a single paragraph describing the desert there might be 4 to 7 analogies. Once I realized this I couldn't not see them and really started to annoy me. At some points he actually had analogies describing other analogies.He appears to have cut back on the analogies in his later books.

The crude comic-book violence is relieved only by the pseudo-intellectual philosophical maunderings of the bad guy, who says, basically, that war and violence are the only real things in life and that everything else is just window dressing. Tell it to your mama, Cormac.I bought this gobbler after reading Harold Bloom's giddy review, which, as it turns out, is far better written than the book itself, if equally misguided.

What I got was page after page of boredom. At first, Cormac hits you with a few small shocks, like some guy having his eye ball pulled out, or, an Indian raping a dead body. After that, it becomes boring. Every second page has someone writhing around in intestines, or, an infant having its brains explode across a rock. It's too much. Not only does it get boring quickly as the value of such events has been over-used, but, you start to wonder if Cormac is sick in the mind, well, I can answer that; Yes, yes he is. After reading this book, I would dare anybody to answer 'yes' to this question; Would you let Cormac McCarthy look after your child for the night?He is obsessed with death, intestines, brains across the ground, disease, ****ing dead people and child killing. If I was 17, I would absolutely love this book.Apart from the various and wonderful ways people and children die in this book, it's boring for another reason, and the reason is this; It's boring.

If you think No Country for Old Men was violent, notch it up about 1000%, and you'll have Blood Meridian. It's as if the author was trying to outdo himself with each successive chapter. I'm not sure why this book has received so many accolades, because I certainly did not enjoy or admire it. It has some elements of Heart of Darkness, and it's the Wild West at it worst--savage, gruesome, and just plain evil. It's based on truth and conveys very emphatically how addictive violence can be. The writing is Faulkneresque in its loftiness, which contrasts sharply with the baseness of the subject matter. However, form does match content in that it's difficult to ascertain who's doing what in the midst of all the bloodshed and mayhem. The two main characters are the kid and the judge, who are studies in contrast, both part of an army of men who have been offered a reward for Apache scalps. Need I say more. They far exceed their charter, however, so that they become more despicable than their victims. The kid certainly loses his innocence but doesn't seem to be particularly appalled by the slaughter, while the judge is one scary character, justifying it all as part of the ultimate game of war. Each chapter is headed by a bulleted list of events, which was helpful. I bookmarked the beginning of the chapter so that I could go back to it at the end and reread the recap."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I really enjoyed the second in the Border Trilogy.

McCarthy is a born storyteller, and his narrator in this novel is perhaps its greatest aesthetic achievement. I believe this work has been greatly overshadowed by McCarthy's more recent publications \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and \\"The Road\\". However, I urge you to read this book before the two aforementioned ones. There are certain passages, sentences, and phrases in \\"Blood Meridian\\" that make you want to call Cormac McCarthy the greatest American writer of the 20th century. Indeed, I'm sure he will easily claim that title for the 21th century. But I digress. If you want to be exposed to pure literary genius, pick up \\"Blood Meridian\\"."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I'm a fan of Cormac McCarthy having read The Road, No Country, The Border Trilogy, etc. I think this novel proves his raw talent as a writer but also that his books became better as he went on.Anything with \\"Blood\\" in the title, well, you can bet it's going to be pretty violent. This is probably the most violent book I have ever read, but it loses its shock value quickly because it's all at the same level, and it just goes on and on. A friend of mine stopped reading the book halfway through because he just couldn't see what the theme or point of the book was.You can't really choose sides between the main characters in the book, and those they murder along the way. They're all bad actors. Yet it's so well written that you want to keep reading. It does get monotonous at times though and the characters aren't really developed further as you keep reading."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I had been recommended this book by some friends and had previously read The Road.

McCarthy's style takes some getting use to, but it's worth the effort. Set in the 1800's, the story follows The Kid as he travels through the American southwest. A drifter, he hooks up with a group of mercenaries out for Indian scalps. The scenes McCarthy depicts are horrorific and you realize there was no law or mercy on either side and no lasting allegiances. The person you need to keep your eye on is the Judge, he reminds me of the character Marlon Brando played in Apocalypse Now."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This was a typical Cormac McCarthy doomsday in the west book. I couldnt finish it as it was repetitous,depressing and not very interesting."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A warning to readers: this is a violent book! I felt like the violence was always in my face but my brother claims he felt like the violence snuck up on him in places - one minute he was reading about scenery and the next he was reading about raids. Regardless, just know that there is a lot of killing and violence, though I wouldn't call it gratuitous, McCarthy does use it as part of his story.The story itself follows \\"The Kid\\" (we never get a real name) as he leaves home and ultimately joins a group of bounty hunters hired to rid the area of Indians. Eventually their thirst for violence takes over and they become out of control. It's as if a monster is created. This book is the story of that monster.I enjoy McCarthy's prose and I don't feel my time was wasted reading this book but I definitely enjoyed some other of his books better. I feel that either Blood Meridian was overrated or my standards were too high after other McCarthy books. However I did enjoy the epilogue."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Anyone who gave this less than four stars is either just a total \\"weiner\\" or stupid.

It's also exhausting reading, with minimal return on the investment. McCarthy's got a breathtaking vocabulary, and he surely knows his terrain. But that's no substitute for his failure to develop meaningfully a single character in the novel. You don't care about anyone, not a wit. The psychopathic violence in the book tires fast, well before the book's end. While there are scenes of some suspense, there is no organically building suspense (or, for that matter, plot). The judge, in the end, is a cipher of a character--less a character than a symbol, a vehicle through whom McCarthy can flaunt his pretentiously philosophical chops. The Kid, whom one expects to be the centerpiece of the narrative, shortly becomes as ancillary and sketchily developed as (and indistinguishable from) everyone else. I slogged through this novel for the challenge of it, but it was ultimately unsatisfying and immediately forgettable. On finishing it, I felt as if released. I may return to McCarthy someday, but I'll need a good long rest to regroup."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The most grotesque novel ever written in modern literature, Cormac McCarthy should have earned the Pulitzer Prize for a novel so splashed with blood and massacre, it outranks all the horrific books published by Stephen King or Jews who have written about their concentration camp experiences during World War II. To read this book is like memorizing detailed instructions on how to butcher a cow in a meat plant. The novel could easily take the place of Salinger's Catcher in the Rye as the number one book the FBI would find in a serial killer's home. The story is not about murder, although one see's it in each gripping chapter of Indian massacres, merciless bar fights, child killings, and simple I don't like seeing your face, so I'm going to chop your head off scenarios. Instead, the story gives us an understanding that world peace can never be obtained in a society ruled by competition and war-making genes flourishing in all of us. The novel is brilliantly executed and keeps the reader \\"with a strong stomach\\" reading until the climatic end. Cormac writes with a poetic style, distorting descriptions with brilliant metaphors, so one receives an exciting view of the landscape like only Melville and Faulkner can do. The highlight of the book is its haunting albino character, Judge Holden, a Moby Dick or Satan in human form who exploits the shortfalls of humanity. One could imagine Marlon Brando of Apocalypse Now in the character Judge Holden, but with white skin and a vocabulary as prolific as a Harvard graduate. The Judge kills with relish and gives creditable excuses for all his murders. If you have read Stephen King's The Stand, you will find many similarities between Holden and Randall Flagg, they are the same demonic entity, but the Judge is more brilliantly done up. In the end, the Judge is neither evil nor sympathetic to the human cause, but is a reminder to our mortality and how useless self-gain, entertainment, and love means in the end when all that invites us is death."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I've never written a review here but I feel it's my civic duty to warn people off this book.I picked this book up because I liked the movie \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and it was recommended for people who, as I do, like the game \\"Red Dead Redemption\\". But I feel cheated out of hours of my life after having slogged through this purple prose.Perhaps some would be turned off by the graphic description of violence and gore, or the lack of a hero in the story. Quite the opposite for me, I was looking forward to that. What I wasn't expecting was the horrible diction. It seems like the author wrote this with a thesaurus in one hand. And for all the description of the bleaching bones and scenery it would have been nice to have a little character development, other than, \\"He looked like a giant baby.\\" Michael Crichton does better character development.And it's interesting how I think he used every adjective and noun for things gory, fecal and putrid, and went into elaborate detail, yet when it came to any sort of violence against women it was mentioned as an aside. Probably more a commentary on taboos in our society and what we will tolerate in our books.The weird outlook of one of the characters is interesting, but the interesting bits in this could be distilled into a pamphlet. Half the novel is beating the reader to death with the red blood/sunset analogy - alright, we get it!And it's a pain to read as the author has something against quotation marks so you are nauseated trying to figure out who said what. Maybe we are meant to be nauseated to add to the effect. ee cummings can play fast and loose with the punctuation, but this guy is no ee cummings.It's a great idea for a movie, someone should take it and put in some character development and make a decent screenplay.I can't believe this passes for good writing, and unless he grew up in the same zip code as Faulkner there's no comparison. This is why bookstores are going out of business. If you want something with no heroes, read some Vonnegut. If you want western, read L'amour, Hondo is great, or the Virginian. Watch \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\". If you want Faulkner read \\"A Rose for Emily\\". If you want to know how many adjectives there are to describe blood, filth, rot and western North American scenery, this is the book for you.I would like to find more desolate-flavored westerns, but this is not one of them. Wait for the movie! At the end all I could think of, besides finding something good to read to make up for this, or if I should stop reading entirely, is a few lines from a Housman poem:The cow, the old cow, she is dead;It sleeps well, the horned head:We poor lads, 'tis our turn nowTo hear such tales as killed the cow.OK, so I changed it a bit.

I was very let down. The violence does not stop at all and halfway through you become immune to it. The rest of the bloodshed is rendered moot by the repetition. The characters that are supposed to be followed either in fascination or dread are barely sketched in at all. You can easily forget that \\"the kid\\" is even in the tale at all. The Judge and Glanton would make interesting studies but no third dimension ever emerges. The scenes are set with elegant words but the dialogue and action fail to live up to that gold standard."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"... but I couldn't.As a lover of literature, I consider myself a pretty patient -- even stubborn -- reader. I don't give up easily on books, even when I have decided it's not the book I thought it was, or even if I've determined the writing isn't very good or the plot uninteresting. I've slogged through 700- and 900-page novels before out of sheer determination, even if halfway through I knew it probably wouldn't be worth it, and never once skipped to the end to get the \\"payoff\\". I have a great deal of respect for the journey the author wants us to take, and choose to trust the author for the one or two or even twelve hours I am spending with their creation.I say all that to say that Blood Meridian, not even 400 pages, beat me. There's a lot that's good about it: McCarthy has a unique and very compelling style (something that's all too rare in today's literature) and his imagery is stark and memorable: I still remember the incredibly written scene where the Indian tribe roars into view, shouting terrible war cries and decorated with war paint and bones and in all other ways appearing so ferocious they strike fear into the heart of their supposed conquerors.And yet after about 20 or 30 pages in, it became a chore to get through each page. I had to make myself read a few pages at a time and then let myself have a break. Finally, I gave up at about the 100-page mark, trying several times to make myself pick it back up, and failing.I don't know if it was the run-on style of writing that forced me to pay close attention to every word: it meant that I could never catch the novel's rhythm and escape into the world the author had created. (Imagine trying to enjoy a song that stops and starts every 10 seconds, and you'll get some of what I mean.)It might have been the relentless violence: I'm not squeamish, but there was no relief, no redemption, barely a pause. If the characters went to a town, I knew better than to hope there'd be a moment of peace or even a moment of reflection -- on their part on on the part of the reader -- but more likely they'd start a fight and slaughter the townspeople instead. I began to dread each page.It might have been the fact that there was not one character to root for in the novel. I'm not saying novels have to contain at least one \\"positive\\" or \\"good\\" character -- it's one of the skills of a great writer to make a character sympathetic even if the reader neither likes nor agrees with that character. But I couldn't feel any of that for a single character -- all I felt was revulsion.But I think it was actually the combination of all of those things that finally beat me -- I realized that, if I kept reading, I was in for more than 250 pages more of relentless violence and horror; I realized there'd be no character who changed or transformed, and that nobody I could identify with was going to come onto the scene. So I began to ask myself what was the tradeoff for suffering through so much more of it.From what I could glean of the book's message, it was this: the border at that time was a dehumanizing, monstrous place that produced soulless, amoral humans capable of unthinkable destruction. And I could see that McCarthy was portraying all \\"sides\\" -- the Indians, the Mexicans, and the Americans-- as equally guilty. For the first part of the message, I don't know why it would be necessary to take hundreds of pages to simply repeat, over and over and over, the events and horror that McCarthy wants to use to make such a point. A well-written 40-page short story would have done just fine. And as for the second part -- that all the parties were the same -- I just can't agree. Were the Apaches, who were resisting the theft of their land by both the U.S. (and before that, by Mexico), on an equal par with those stealing their land? All sides committed bloody, vicious acts, but to portray things as if they were all equally wrong is to be untruthful. And I don't remember who I'm quoting with this, but: \\"Fiction tells lies to tell the truth.\\" Everyone knows that fiction is not \\"true\\" in one sense: they know the characters and events didn't actually exist, they know there's no Captain Ahab or Iago or Kid in real life. But fiction is, ultimately, saying something about the world, through all the elements of its story, and I feel that nobody should use the power of their pen to tell what in actuality amounts to lies -- not the \\"lies\\" of the fiction they create, but an actual lie that comes through in what they are ultimately saying about their subject or the world at large. Would anyone want to read, for example, a novel that argued that the horrific rubber trade in the Congo (where the colonists chopped off the hands of those that didn't bring in enough rubber) was good for the native peoples? Or a novel that ultimately argued that there is no global warming, no environmental problem, and that actually the earth is doing just fine and dandy?I admire the author's style, and even further admire his setting out to depict the border and the wars of conquest in a way that does not romanticize or even identify with the conquerors, as so much fiction set at that time and place do. And furthermore, I can appreciate that so much of what made the book hard to read -- the run-on style, the spare brutality of its prose, the amoral and vicious characters, the endless violence and sense of dirt and filth that the reader can almost taste -- are part of the world the author is depicting. But I just couldn't see putting myself through so many more pages of one of the more horrifying books I'd ever read, for a message I had already grasped 30 pages into it. Maybe there was more I would have gotten out of it if I'd stuck with it -- and maybe one of these days I'll make myself try again.Hopefully my own story will help you decide for yourself if this book is worth it -- but know what you're getting into."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I want to soften the blow for the Cormac fans by saying McCarthy has penned some sequences in this book that are some of the most vivid imagery I've read but the images are few and far between but when they come they are like painting pictures with words. (There I even used a grammatical structure they would appreciate).Certainly the imagery is there, and that is what earns the second star for me. But the rest of the book is just bogged down in long-winded grammar and strained similes. I chose a page at random to give you an idea. Here is the first sentence on page 251:\\"On the day following they crossed the malpais afoot, leading the horses upon a lakebed of lava all cracked and reddish black like a pan of dried blood, threading those badlands of dark amber glass like the remnants of some dim legion scrabbling up out of a land accursed, shouldering the little cart over the rifts and ledges, the idiot clinging to the bars and calling hoarsely after the sun like some queer unruly god abducted from a race of degenerates.\\"You still with me?Alone, you could almost argue this sentence conveyes a lot of meaning... but try meandering through 335 pages of it!

Out comes the red pen with the words \\"RUN ON\\" and big exclamation marks all underlined. But because it's... *Cormac*... it's okay."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy is not for everyone. The violence of Blood Meridien is graphic and pervasive, but is also cold and emotionless, and it dehumanizes many of the characters. I found no dark humor here, only darkness, but not evil. Of course there are evil acts perpetrated by nearly everyone McCarthy chose to include as a character and those who don't are either killed before they have a chance, or shown as fools to juxtapose the reality of western expansion of the United States. So the question that arises is \\"why?\\"McCarthy based this book on real events, the participation of the eradication of the indigenous population of North America by scalp hunters paid by the Mexican government to track down and kill Indians, the scalps serving as receipts to prove that Indians had been killed. When caught by Indians, the scalphunters suffered the same fate and worse at the hands of their intended prey, which left a river of blood in the wake of these marauding bands. McCarthy's point here is to destroy the romanticism of how the West was won that has supplanted the reality of genocide and ruthless destruction. The West was won by an almost unimaginable amount of killing, Indian and buffalo alike, by our ancestors, and McCarthy wanted to write a book about how and why people ended up doing this, and wipe out the hideous mythology of sentimental and delusional western hacks like Louis L'Amour. At this he succeeds brilliantly. No one who reads this book should ever think of the American West of the 19th Century in the same way again.Part of what drives the book and its characters is the love of war by some, and the acceptance of war by others. The relevance to our current foreign policy situation is even more startling than when McCarthy wrote the book in the 80s.McCarthy's wordcraft is everything it's hyped to be. There aren't many writers working today who can craft descriptions of the landscape with as much compelling wonder and detail. One section early in the book, a long, unpunctuated description of a band of men attacked by Commanches, stands as far as I'm concerned with some of the greatest literary achievements in history, Hamlet's soliloquy, the last few pages of One Hundred Years of Solitude, the opening scenes of The Sound and the Fury, the death of Joe Christmas in Light in August, chapter 4 of V, Joyce's The Dead, just to name a few off the top of my head.Yet there was something missing from this book that weakened it for me. It is a great book, but not a perfect book, and that is because McCarthy has no use for women. Even in scenes with women, they are tossed aside as unimportant. This is a book about men, he leaves no doubt, but he never even for a moment speaks of sensuality, need, and desire, and despite his wilingness to describe violence in lurid detail, his view of the human experince remains myopic. He barely mentions sex, and refuses to detail it despite his chances to. Graphic violence is everywhere, these are men passionate about their killing, yet their sex lives are so glossed over or ignored they stop seeming like men. One could imagine a band of robots sitting in for the men in this book because it is bereft of the most human of desires. This huge absence left me sad because I wanted to really love this book, and love this writer, but he is so ensconced in masculinity and unable to even approach the female side of his male characters, let alone the females characters, and the mens' needs for them, that ultimately I was put off. Blood Meridien could have stood as an example of the great American novel, but instead it stands as a brilliant near-miss, a great book that missed its chance to be the greatest, letting itself be defined by this failure. As an example of being able to encompass violence and sensuality, I feel I know what I'm talking about, thusly:Mad God"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"_Blood Meridian_ concerns a bunch of drifters who contract with the government to kill and then scalp Indians for a profit.

A great deal of the book presents scene after scene of senseless massacring of innocent men, women and children who have the misfortune to be Apache Indians. Mexicans who get in the way are not exempt from these murdering marrauders.We are introduced to the book's two major characters: a teenage boy, referred to throughout the book as \\"the kid\\" and \\"the judge,\\" neither of whom has a name. The kid runs away from home at the age of fourteen and eventually joins up with this miserable gang. \\"He can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless violence.\\" The judge is described as a large, totally hairless man, who despite his intelligence and a tendency to philosophize, is a completely violent and evil man, totally without conscience. He takes joy in gratuitously killing a child and defenseless animals. The book is filled with such endless scenes of carnage and destruction. Carcasses and bones of men and animals are shown strewn throughout the landscape as if the old west were one huge graveyard.Years later the kid and the judge (accidentally?) meet up with one another in a bar. What ensues is a veritable \\"dance with the Devil\\" with a fiddler providing accompaniment.

The words on the page completely and accurately painted an image of the old west. How accurate can be debated, but i would assume that this novel is closer than Gunsmoke or Bonanza. It is the content of the novel that caused the low rating. Before reading this i would have considered myself a \\"fan of violence\\". Well, this book was the cure for that. The prose was so vividly, sickeningly accurate and lifelike that i felt i was there, watching the most brutal, senseless atrocities imaginable.Imagine if Michelangelo had used his immense skills of creation to make a very vivid, accurate, precise painting of a rape scene. That is what this novel is. If you can get past the hideous violence, this is a good book, however that was something I was not able to do.*I wrote this review a while ago, after just having finished the novel, with time it has grown on me, it was fantastically written, just too violent. But I can see what others see in it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In this novel, Cormac McCarthy takes a definite stand on some pretty abstract thinking. McCarthy chose to set Blood Meridian at the time of the Mexican-American war. It's not a time that the vast majority of Americans are taught about, so the plot line is at least interesting to history buffs. While I appreciate not being spoon-fed the actual events in history (thus negating a possible bias of the author against any group of people), my lack of knowledge of that particular time period made following the trail of Glanton's gang back and forth very difficult. McCarthy makes other choices in his presentation of dialogue that made me lose some of the grasp of the work as a whole. For example, he throws in some Spanish here and there, some French, and a little German. Again, I appreciate how much closer to reality those bits of other languages bring Blood Meridian, but it was frustrating on the very basic level of simply not knowing those languages. In a nutshell, this book can be frustrating and hard to get through for readers who don't have as wide a knowledge base as McCarthy evidently had when he was writing it.McCarthy does a good job with making sure the reader stays focused on the thematic elements. The main character is never given a name, and there are a number of levels to each thematic element. It is very clear that McCarthy had a vision for this book - every detail is included for a reason. I don't think there is a portion of the book that doesn't hold up to that under intense scrutinization. However, it is incredibly easy to get caught up in the lyrical prose of the narration and stare at the same page for the next ten minutes. Not that that's a bad thing. Unfortunately for those weak of stomach, a lot of this same lyrical prose is written about slaughtering and scalping, generally lots of blood (go figure). Such beautiful language amidst such tragic acts can be more than a little unnerving at times. That works for rather than against the reality Blood Meridian is presenting, which is very harsh and unkind.I have heard a lot of people getting anxious over the kinds of moral judgments - or rather, the lack of them - they perceived McCarthy placing on his characters. I prefer this kind of story, though: the author is well enough aware of the kind of world he is placing his characters in, and he is letting them act out what happened. He doesn't judge his characters, and he doesn't give them any easy ways out. If you're looking for Good versus Evil, you'll find it here (well, at least the evil). But there are so many more shades of gray that are present, it just makes the characters that much more realistic.If what you're looking for is food for thought, this is one of the best contemporary American novels to give it to you. It might take a while to get used to the lack of quotation marks, but don't let it stop you. Blood Meridian is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"It's dark, it's ugly, it's incredibly violent and it's the best book I've ever read.

However, after about twenty pages or so of 'Blood Meridian', you will realize you've wandered into something special. The entire novel is an incredibly violent, bleak, fevered dream, featuring the most memorable character I've ever come across--the terrifying Judge Holden. McCarthy's language and descriptions are brilliant, and unlike anything I've ever read. Just a simple description of a hog rising out of mud in a pre-dawn gloom is mesmerizing, and I ended up reading some paragraphs three or four times out of sheer wonder for McCarthy's skill.

Until you've read Blood Meridian. You'll see things through Cormac McCarthy's prose that will change your view of the universe forever. The word-rendered sights that will limitlessly alter your view of seemingly mundane circumstances are relentlessly horrific.Imagine men bound and strung upside down, their heads jerking above blazing campfires, screaming for death that can't come too soon. Imagine infants hanging from tree limbs by cords that have been wrapped around their necks, with one end forced (who knows how?) through the roofs of their mouths and out their still-open fontanelles. Imagine frenetically fierce aboriginal warriors attacking, defeating, and systematically raping those hired to exterminate them, screaming when they climax. Imagine a dull and disfigured dwarf sitting idly in a circus cage, indifferently munching his feces.Imagine a large, oddly youthful and pudgy man who has taken the title \\"the judge.\\" With bald head and baby face, he is indestructible, master of whatever he chooses, with an insatiably amoral interest in the world about him. One who visits death on others, but remains unscathed, unruffled, undisturbed, and preternaturally whole. Now imagine that the judge sets the limits of our experience, boundless at bottom, locating unknown depths of horror and pain. Our experience will take historically specific forms, but unimagined cruelty, cosmic indifference, immanent fear. and intolerable banality will prevail as ever-present possibilities. McCarthy makes clear that we cannot anticipate how bad things can get.If I have a problem with Cormac McCarthy, it's that he's too good. We've all seen vague and fleeting intimations of the amoral madness of the eternity he reveals, but he makes them concrete and certain, and he forces us to become fully conscious of unknown extremes of horror and suffering. McCarthy shows us that human experience can be more brutally painful than we suspected, and persuades us that the only thing that stands between the worst and you and me is randomness.Blood Meridian is a brilliant book.

So reader beware: scalps are cut off, charred dead babies are strung up in trees, puppies are tossed into rivers and shot, people are burnt, skinned alive, and decapitated. This isn't a romanticised view of the old west. This is the old west soaked in blood.Blood Meridian is also difficult to read because of McCarthy's prose. The scarcity of punctuation will put some people off, but more than that, the \`scripture' style of writing McCarthy employs here (quite deliberately) can be challenging. Like scripture, much of Blood Meridian is made up of lengthy convoluted sentences that are extended by numerous \`ands'. We're accustomed to reading sentences that are short, making them more manageable to read, so these long sentences can be challenging.And finally, it's a difficult book to read because of the absence of a redeeming character. Our protagonist (a character some people regard as a flawed hero - although I respectfully disagree) is referred to simply as \`the kid'. McCarthy doesn't get inside the heads of his characters very often so we never get much insight into what the kid is thinking or feeling. To make this situation even more challenging, the kid is present, but rarely mentioned, for the middle third of the novel. This leaves a strange void, where there is no apparent protagonist. There is a method to McCarthy's madness here; however, it does make for a more difficult read. In Blood Meridian, McCarthy doesn't take us inside the head of the kid, allows him to fade into the background for a significant portion of the novel, and even when he is present, he's not a very compelling character anyway.If it sounds like I didn't like this novel, you would be mistaken, although I have to admit that I struggled through the middle section, primarily because of the protagonist issue I noted above.This isn't escapist fiction. What I want from an ambitious literary novel like this is for it to get under my skin, to get into my head. Eloquent prose is nice but the best literary work doesn't just sound great, it makes you obsess on it, to ponder its meaning, to contemplate what the author is trying to say about the characters and about human nature. It took a while, but Blood Meridian got inside my head and it's still there.As much as I am tempted to offer my interpretation of this novel, this is not a venue for book reports. I started my review by listing three reasons why this novel (some might say) is an intentionally difficult book to read. These points are valid, but there is a counter argument to each.Yes, the novel is violent but, by all accounts, it's an accurate reflection of the time and of humanities long history of brutal violence. Yes, McCarthy's prose is challenging, but it's also hypnotic and at times powerfully affecting. The dialogue, particularly when the Judge shares his philosophies on issues like war and violence, is extraordinary. Yes, the kid is a flat character that most people won't be able to empathise with, but McCarthy has also given us Judge Holden, who may be one of the greatest literary characters ever created; an eloquent, charismatic, mesmerizing sociopath who will haunt your dreams.This admittedly is not a novel for everyone but for those willing to gaze without flinching upon the ugly and violent nature of man, this is a powerful novel; disturbing, enigmatic, and at times hauntingly beautiful. This is, quite simply, one of the best novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Like many classics this book starts with an introduction by some literary critic that is overly scholarly and pompous. If you are going to read it wait till the end of the book because it spoils major plot details as soon as 2 pages in.The book itself is great."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"It seems that most of the negative reviews this book receives are holding it to the standards of commercial fiction. This is not commercial fiction, it is not supposed to be a Clint Eastwood western, and it certainly isn't meant for those who ignore the beauty of McCarthy's writing because they think this simile is too vague or that word too archaic.This is a difficult book - it is difficult to read, to digest, to fathom, and even to stomach at parts. It is literature. You aren't always supposed to be able to \\"connect\\" with or relate to characters. A book doesn't always need a fast-moving plot. This book, rather, is a collage of scenes which, in relation to each other, form a cohesive whole.Except for \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" McCarthy's books are more character- and concept-driven than plot-driven.McCarthy is an absolute master storyteller, narrator, and stylist. It's understandable that some like his more sparse work of recent years. His literary genius is evident in these works as well. But it is incorrect to mistake his more \\"baroque\\" works (like this and \\"Suttree,\\" which I have been slowly ingesting over the past few months) as him trying to find his style. And long, obscure vocabulary doesn't automatically mean that the writer is pretensious. If you don't like the style, that's your business, but just because you don't like it doesn't make it inferior.\\"Blood Meridian\\" is certainly not for everyone. It is horrifying at times. My first time reading through it, I stopped 100 pages into it because of the violence. It took me a month to give it another try. I wouldn't recommend it to many people I know personally. But as a work of art it is brilliant. The prose is poetic, the themes are timeless, the characters (particularly the Judge) are immortal. It isn't my favorite McCarthy book but it's more amazing as a book than his other novels."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the third Cormac McCarthy book I have read, and my awe for him as a poet is as strong as ever. My awe for him as an anti-sentimentalist is also stronger than ever. Blood Meridian is not an exhilarating book based on it's contents. Quite the opposite; It is a haunting and sobering account of a group of despicable men in the West, and all that they partake of. However the style of McCarthy's prose, and his economic use of striking vocabulary are a beauty to behold. Consider it a painting, masterfully composed, but inducing an awful awe and depression on those who behold it.Blood Meridian is, at its most obvious, an anti-western. It is about all the things that Heroic stories of the settling of the west, and all those outlaws that are idolized, are not talked about. It is about brutality, inhuman (or, how you look at it, all too human) behavior and all the rest of the things that legends are NOT made of. And yet you can feel it is honest. However beneath the Western Motif, it is not just for the West, but for all mythologized things, that the book is making a statement. There have been comparisons of this book to the classical works such as THE ODYSSEY, and I feel that it is well earned. THE ODYSSEY is about a journey, but even when reading that classical work, there are hints of barbarism that the story doesn't stay long on to contemplate. There are acts of killing and slavery in THE ODYSSEY, however that would taint all that we love about the Heroic journey, and so it is not emphasized.Blood Meridian is, you could argue, the side of the heroic tale that is not celebrated, and yet lurks under it if you are looking for it. With Blood Meridian it is all there, stripped of it's glory. Once you read this book, you will wonder, \`was this what it was like? Was Davy Crockett such a brute? Only elevated for what he did for his own people, glossing over what he wrought to everyone else?' I'm not saying that Crockett was a bad man, only that this book serves to illustrate how, perhaps the figures in history who have songs and tales commemorating them, might have only one aspect of their lives committed to history. I believe part of the purpose of this book is to see the Judge as a champion of European values, and triumphing over the Indians and Mexicans. This is not, understand, the part YOU will read in Blood Meridian, I merely point out that the romanticized version of the west, of cowboys and Indians, of the Alamo, are mere interpretations. The grim reality of how those \`obstacles' to America's \`taming' of the west are perhaps too brutal and horrific to remember. I will personally be haunted by several sequences in this book, and I think that is the point. America was an inherited land, and it took a lot of bloodshed and villainy to make it the place that is celebrated today. Would the Judge, had he been a real man, been sung about in America as a conqueror of wild regions that were a threat to homesteaders? And more to the point, is this idea of Indians attacking settlers not one that goes 2 ways? Who was the first to draw first blood in the West? Should we be glorifying what was a massacre of a less developed culture? It is not something you have to contemplate the way McCarthy does, but if you read this book you will look at the Romantic Western Outlaws in a different light.There is a passage in this book. It is in response to a man who does not want to be sketched, documented if you will, into the Judge's sketchbook/journal. The Judge's response is, smiling, \\"Whether in my book or not, every man is tabernacled in every other and he in exchange and so on in an endless complexity of being and witness to the uttermost edge of the world.\\" I am citing this as one of many statements to the reader in this book. You will not like what you read, but you are asked to bear WITNESS to it. I can think of no other explanation to this book. It is one of a kind, and it will not be abook that you put down and forget. Like me, you will be imprinted with it's imagery for many days after. That is what makes this a great book; it is not necessarily enjoyed, but it is deeply philosophical on the heart of man, and how we as a culture like to abbreviate what barbarity has made our place in the world. Again, this is only my interpretation of one aspect of the book. There is much more to it, and several theses could be written."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"OK, this is the third Cormac McCarthy book I've read in a row, following 'The Road' and 'No Country for Old Men'. Each is alike in some ways yet different in many. All are written, quite obviously, by the same author. I say obviously for the two reasons of his name is on each and his stamp, his method of writing is in each. To talk about McCarthy's books is to talk about his style along with the content.This book is chock-full in each sentence. It's not empty writing, ever. There's a ton of words you won't be familiar with, yet you'll get the gist of each. There's words he's most certainly cobbled together from others, but again, you'll see why and understand how each fits. He doesn't use much punctuation and produces paragraph long run-on sentences. He doesn't translate the Spanish into English for you, no matter how long the conversation. And yet, it all still works. In fact, it works because of what he does, not in spite of it.Before 'The Road' and 'No Country...', I wouldn't have continued much past the opening paragraphs of this book, such is the writing. With those two as my experience, I knew it was worth having to pay attention to read this book - and I was not disappointed. My god, the imagery, the things he can bring to life. Or death. Of course, the Judge and Granton and the expriest are all larger than life characters, even the ones based on real folk. Of course, the descriptions are more graphic than need be. It's all part of the journey. If you take it, you won't regret it.If you like simple prose for a before-sleep read, something to let you down easy - this ain't it. If you're looking for happy-go-lucky, everybody ends up better for the experience stories - look elsewhere. If you're looking for a book that will have you reading and re-reading the words, seeing visions so clear and characters and stories so intense you'll find yourself looking at the clock saying 'dang! it's that late!', then this is your book.Be forewarned, if you like this one, you're gonna want to read more McCarthy. 'The Road' is totally accessible to anyone. 'No Country' needs no introduction. Next on my list is 'Child of God'. Also, be prepared to be disappointed, because at some point, the book will be over and you'll have to look for something to read to replace it. That won't be easy."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I've read several McCarthy books and Blood Meridian is now at the top of my list. It is a relatively simple story about \\"The Kid,\\" a young man from Tennessee who joins up with a ragtag group of mercinaries who hope to make their fortune killing Indians in Mexico and the Southwest and then selling the scalps to towns who had been pillaged by Indian raids. The group was very adept at killing people, even though they often targeted peaceful people just hoping to find as many scalps as possible, and quickly they became more dangerous and a bigger burden than anyone the cities employed them to hunt. Eventually most of the characters get their due, but this book describes a very violent, ugly world inhabited by dark humans.I am not very familiar with the Wild West, but I imagine this book paints a fairly accurate portrait of what it was, unlike the sanitized version most Western movies or novels present. This is possibly the most brutal, violent story I've ever read, but it is written so well and with such force that I couldn't look away. It is an absolutely wonderful novel and I would highly recommend it to McCarthy fans, Western fans or people who just might enjoy a very horrific but fantastic book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book feels like Federico Fellini (or maybe Wes Craven) directing a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western - enigmatic figures wandering a strange, brutal landscape and spilling blood with impunity. Given this reference point, let me frame my thoughts as follows:The Good - McCarthy writes as though he rode with these marauders for years. His attention to detail (e.g., obscure names of saddle parts, the chinking sounds of horses on the trail, the misery of desert thirst) makes for a vivid reading experience. Combined with the biblical tone of the text, you feel like you are part of an ancient, epic tale produced by an eyewitness.The Bad - McCarthy is almost too damn good at describing landscapes, using obscure terminology that frustrates more than it enlightens: \\"They rode through regions of particolored stone upthrust in jagged kerfs and shelves of traprock reared in faults and anticlines curved back upon themselves and broken off likes stumps of great stone treeboles...\\" What the heck? If you want me to visualize the landscape, I'm going to need a few familiar terms. It took a dictionary, geology text, and Google to get me through many passages in this book. Still, you have to marvel at McCarthy's command of the language.The Ugly - The Judge is a genuinely disturbing villain; the character made me think of Brando in Apocalypse Now (or Kurtz in Heart of Darkness) - big, weird, violent and chillingly unpredictable. However, the feller just talks too dang much! The second half of the book has far too many rambling soliloquies in which the Judge expounds on his Nietzschian world view. I have already watched him smash babies' heads on rocks; speechifying on the beauty of violence and subjugation is hardly necessary. The speeches just detract from the creepy intrigue of the character.So ultimately I'm ambivalent about this book. It is more like a long, unsettling poem than a novel. If you want a difficult but linguistically dazzling description of the wild west, you'll love it. If you want a cowboy story, keep your distance. Cue the Enrico Morricone."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"... that I'd managed to live to be almost 40 before I read this novel. Now I have to spend the next 40 years telling others to read it.I've avoided Westerns the way I've avoided Harlequin Romances, Andy Garcia Films, and the Ice-Capades. However, calling this book a Western is kind of like calling Moby Dick a boating guide.True, all the stock and traditional of the typical Western are here (The silent loner, the gunfighter, the Indians), but they've been de-romanticized - forced to be viewed under the microscope of reality. The protagonist speaks very little throughout the book. Not because he's the strong silent type, but because he has nothing to say. The other characters (The Judge, Toadvine, Tobin, etc.) are a fascinating mixture of cruelty and humanity. McCarthy even manages to avoid the PC temptation to depict the Indians as noble savages.The real power of this book lays it its sense of realism. McCarthy can describe a cantina down to the tiniest speck of dust, a mountain down to a single rock, and a gunshot wound down to the smallest drop of blood. Also, there are lines of dialog that you just can't shake:The Judge: The freedom of birds is offensive to me. If I had my way, I'd see them all in a zoo.Toadvine: That would be one Hell of a zoo.Toadvine on the cruel Mexican guard: My biggest fear is that some evil might befall him. I pray to God, daily, to watch over him.There's no way that I'm going to do justice to this wonderful / disturbing / thought-provoking / nightmarish work in a short review. Just buy it. Hurry!Now, if only someone would write a dark and disturbing Harlequin Romance."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Those with weak stomachs need not open the pages of this book. From beginning to end, this is one long travail of unadulterated gore and brutality. It's major mythic character, the Judge, states that war is divine, that nothing on the earth is beyond his notice or does not require his permission to die. And brutal, violent death occurs with great regularity within this book, every couple of pages or so.The setting is the West and Mexico around the period of 1847, and the license to kill without discrimination is enabled by the Judge's charter of killing and scalping renegade Indians for bounty. If that was all that this group did, perhaps the reader could make some allowance for the portrayed actions, but it quickly becomes apparent that anyone is a target, regardless of guilt, innocence, age, occupation, race, gender, or prior actions. The book becomes a dark celebration of violence for violence's sake.The Kid, fourteen years old at the start of this book, is the nominal protagonist, drawn into the Judge's group mainly because he had nothing better to do, without other skills or any ambitions. And he is practically the only ray of light within this whole concoction, as he (once or twice) actually shows a little feeling for persons besides himself.The Judge is an enigmatic super-something, ageless, multilingual, educated, interested in ecology, and much larger than life. Who (or what) the Judge is is clearly central to this book's theme, but he certainly can stand as an avatar of an element of human nature that most people would rather not think about.McCarthy's prose is very distinct, with odd syntax, unquoted dialogue, and considerable use of some rather rare words. His descriptions of the country are, in some places, nearly prose poems. But this style also leads to what I think is the major flaw with this book, as he never gets inside the heads of any of his characters, remains distant, such that none of his people ever came \`alive' to me. Some descriptions of the privations the group experiences while crossing a desert, while quite accurate, remained something happening to a group of stick figures, rather than recognizable humans. Perhaps this is exactly what he wanted, written more as an allegory or parable than any conventional type of story. Certainly there isn't any real plot, as the story careens from one brutal incident to the next.Perhaps this book can best be described as an archetypal anti-Western, the antithesis of the standard Western, which, amid all the violence, has its focus on heroes. There are no heroes here.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"My book jacket says BLOOD MERIDIAN \\"...chronicles the extraordinary violence of the Glanton Gang, a murderous cadre on an official mission to scalp Indians.\\" Wikipedia adds that John Glanton \\"led a gang of scalp hunters. Nominally a mercenary operation hired by Mexican authorities to track down and kill dangerous bands of Apaches, the gang began murdering and scalping non-Apaches and massacring citizens...\\" and were eventually \\"declared outlaws.\\"McCarthy's entry to the Glanton gang comes through two characters. The first is the Kid, who joins up in his mid-teens and participates in its gruesome crimes. The second is Judge Holden, who dominates the gang and has a philosophical view of its random violence.In McCarthy's hands, the story of the Glanton gang is like a psychopathic road novel, which is held together with genius-quality poetic writing. Read BM and be captured by McCarthy's immense talent as the gang traverses the Southwest and northern Mexico. I open BM at random (the start of Chapter 14) and find:\\"All to the north the rain had dragged black tendrils down from the thunderclouds like tracings of lampblack fallen in a beaker and in the night they could hear the drum of rain miles away on the prairie. They ascended through a rocky pass and lightning shaped out the distant shivering mountains and lightning rang the stones about and tufts of blue fire clung to the horses like incandescent elementals that would not be driven off. Soft smelterlights advanced upon the metal of the harness, lights ran blue and liquid on the barrels of the guns. Mad jackhares started and checked in the blue glare and high among those clanging crags jokin roehawks crouched in their feathers or cracked a yellow eye at the thunder underfoot.\\"The writing is truly amazing.At the same time, McCarthy uses the Judge to move his narrative beyond gruesome and episodic adventure. Here, the Judge seems to create and sustain a mission of violence for the gang. And when a character temporarily operates outside the gang and the Judge's influence? Then society quickly challenges and usually contains him. (In fact, only the kid is able to avoid self-destruction outside the gang, which provokes a final act of viciousness by the judge.)Anyway, BM makes terrible (not just aesthetic) sense after the Judge emerges as a force that makes greater violence possible. And in the final chapter, McCarthy's treatment of the slaughter of the American buffalo reminds us that the violence of the Glanton gang and its willingness to massacre lurks in the nature of many men, simply awaiting sanction and leadership.Two quick final points:First, I encourage readers who enjoyed BM to try Pynchon'sAgainst the Day. This shares a character (Sloat) and also has traverse motion in the Southwest and Mexico, albeit in family form. But in AtD, the violence is personal and capitalistic, not epic, while the narrative, in its Western thread, is sweet and magical parody.Second: Have your dictionary ready. McCarthy is the master of the short and obscure word.

None of us alive today remember the 1840s and 1850s, nor are there any journals extant that can give us day to day details of life in the American West during that era. McCarthy manages to put us there in this astonishing book. Although I am well aware that this book was first published in 1985, I felt during the course of reading this book that I was reading the firsthand account of someone who was there. The dialogue, the descriptions, the accounts of the action, all read like a recently discovered journal of a reporter who was there. Then I step back and remind myself that this is work of fiction, the creation of a contemporary American novelist.It is possibly the most brutally violent novel I have ever read. In a lifetime of reading, I can't recall ever experiencing any literary work in which the brutality is so relentless. It is every bit as violent, and as stark, as King Lear. This book demythologizes the American West. It is the antidote to Zane Grey and Louis Lamour. It has several antecedents; two that come to mind right away are Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;--a much darker book than often recognized--and John Ford's film &quot;The Searchers.&quot; Others often mentioned are the &quot;Southern&quot; writers, especially Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, and Tennessee Williams. None of that does this book justice, however, for, despite his influences, McCarthy is an original.This is a terrifying book that scared the hell out of me. There are no likeable characters--none. The &quot;kid&quot;--that is all he is ever called, until the very end, when he is called &quot;the man&quot;--can elicit some sympathy because of his history of abandonment and abuse, but at the core he is a mean little bastard. I would not want to run into any of these characters under any circumstances. But the most terrifying character, and McCarthy's most memorable and astonishing literary creation, is Judge Holden.Judge Holden deserves special mention. I don't believe that such a character ever existed, or ever could exist. He is an archetype, the archetype of pure evil. In less skilled hands he could be dismissed as an incarnation of the devil, or of an evil god, like Moloch. Here he appears as a preternaturally gifted archetype of evil. Yet, like all genuine archetypes, he has that &quot;ring of truth.&quot;I am not crazy about McCarthy's literary style, which at times approaches pretentiousness, but at others, and especially near the end, has a power rarely matched except by the greatest novelists. The book's ending must rank as one of the most shattering in American literature.This book is transformative. If you read it, it won't leave you. It will haunt you. You will never look at American history, or the west, or at certain aspects of life, the same way again."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I picked up a copy of Blood Meridian on a whim and sat down in the bookstore to read a few pages. From the first appearance of Judge Holden I was hooked. There are images in this book that will stay with you for the rest of your life. McCarthy has used the American West as a launching pad into the mythopoetic, archetypal realm. While based loosely on real events, the book takes place in that dream space that is always present between history and the present; a space of which the exploration goes back at least to the epic of Gilgamesh. Out of this realm, emerges Judge Holden, the living, breathing embodiment of our Nietzschean/Darwinian naturalism. This book is a must read if you are interested in Western literature at all."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":". . . which is how you might feel after reading this masterwork. One of the greatest novels of the 20th century, *Blood Meridian* is, on the one hand, about the, ahem, delightful mixing of cultures which occurred on the newly-formed Texas-Mexico border in the 1850's. On the other hand, the book is a gory fugue on the nature of Evil. . . . We follow the depraved &quot;adventures&quot; of the Kid, who is McCarthy's ironic homage to Huckleberry Finn . . . Huckleberry Finn in hell, that is. The Kid was almost born corrupted; before we ever meet the Judge, the Kid is fighting and killing his way across the dusty plains of Texas. McCarthy is careful not to let us build up sentimental attachments to his rather cipher-like character: whenever he does speak, it's usually muttered monotonously in words of one syllable. Only with greater exposure to Judge Holden does the Kid start gaining in moral authority.As for the Judge! -- one of the most memorable creations of American literature, he's a gargantuan conflation of several mythic literary figures: Iago, Milton's Satan, Ahab. He's seven feet tall and completely hairless. His pronouncements are masterpieces of the hollow philosophy of moral abnegation. He's like the most terrifying beast you could possibly dream up, smarter than you and infinitely skilled, tramping across the bloody, empty Southwest like some golem, seeking brains to savor. We read with grim fascination as he leads a savage band of bounty hunters into a vortex of moral nullity. This is frightening stuff.McCarthy writes in a fiery, sweeping style. Captivating. Brilliant. Not a single phrase, word, is wasted -- you sense the magnificent struggle it took to shape each of these paragraphs into a small work of art. A command of syntax and vocabulary that is matchless in today's dying literature. The tone is one of howling outrage: first, at how this country was &quot;founded&quot; (and, by extension, at the sickening pieties and hypocrisy with which we view our history), and finally, at the basic nature of man: bloodthirsty beasts whose supposed &quot;morals&quot; and &quot;values&quot; can be, given the right circumstances, burned away from us as easily as a thin puddle on a hot rock in Yuma. This is essentially a pessimistic novel -- no phony uplift here. *Blood Meridian* will not find its way to Oprah's Book Club, in other words. But perhaps consolation can be found in the unflinching art used to describe this world (which is our world). If you love great literature, you need to own this book. Its aesthetic rewards, believe me, more than compensate for the hell it describes."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"\\"Blood Meridian\\" is one of the most graphically violent and one of the best novels I have read. It is a Western in the sense of where and when it takes place, but what it portrays is nothing less than a vision of a nightmare world, the ultimate confirmation of man's sadistic potential for evil.The novel takes place in the American Southwest and northern Mexico in the middle of the nineteenth century. Local governments are paying gangs of mercenaries to hunt down and scalp Indians, mostly Apaches, who are considered a dangerous menace to the settlers. The \\"hero\\" of the story is a scruffy, pugnacious, Tennessee-born teenager known only as the kid, who, after proving his skull-smashing mettle, is recruited into a renegade military regiment on Indian-scalping missions. After an ill-fated encounter with some Comanches, the kid joins another gang headed by a man named Glanton, a merciless brute who performs his job with such insane bloodlust and inspires such rowdiness in his gang that the residents of Chihuahua wonder if maybe the Indians aren't better after all.The most physically striking and imaginatively fascinating member of Glanton's gang is a hairless giant named Judge Holden. When we first meet him in the novel, he gives the impression of a charming trickster when he debunks a phony preacher he's never even seen before. However, as the novel proceeds, we learn that he is something of a Renaissance man -- scholar, artist, philosopher, natural scientist -- even while he is every bit as coldhearted a killer as Glanton himself. By the end of the novel, we realize that he may be something more than just human, a living manifestation of the endless cycle of war and death.McCarthy's writing style, with its masterful descriptions of scenery, strong narrative dynamics, and Faulkneresque flair for dramatic scene building, elevates \\"Blood Meridian\\" to the highest plane of literary art. Two scenes in particular stand out to me as masterpieces of storytelling: The first is the appearance of the Comanches in Chapter IV; McCarthy's description of the attackers is genuinely frightening, a nightmarish depiction of a diabolical masquerade of costumed demons. The second scene, in Chapter XIX, is (Glanton gang member) David Brown's visit to a blacksmith in San Diego with a request to saw off the barrels of a shotgun; the dialogue and the unexpected but realistic outcome of this scene is, again, very reminiscent of Faulkner.Excessive violence in a novel (or a movie, for that matter) can become cartoonish just from sheer overkill, but McCarthy writes so well that every gunshot, arrow wound, knife stab, and axe cleave seems not gratuitous but necessitated by the requirements of realism and historical accuracy. In fact, the violence is so rampant and relentless that the cold hard fact of its eternal ubiquity seems to be the novel's main thematic element, relegating to the background any hackneyed statement that might be made about the horrors of man's inhumanity to man."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I never review things that have more than 10 reviews posted already. Afterall, who is going to read the umpteenth review of a book or cd? For Blood Meridian I have made an exception. This allegorical, revisionist western novel is surely Cormac McCarthy's magnum opus. I have read it twice, and both times I could not get the stark images the book gave me out of my head. I will read it more times undoubtedly. Never have I read a work that is so violent yet so beautifully written. McCarthy writes of brutally savage acts of violence, but in a prose that is just gorgeous to read. One could apply a term used to describe the films of the late Sam Peckinpah: \\"Beautiful Bloodletting\\", to Blood Meridian, for it is a most apt description. Additionally, his descriptions of the natural world are awe-inspiring. I have never read anything else like it, and it is a sure bet that you have not either. I suspect that most one-starred reviews are due to the extreme violence in this brilliant work, for I cannot see any other logic behind those reviews. No less than Yale literature professor Harold Bloom has proclaimed Blood Meridian one of the finest examples of American literature to appear in the last 30 years or so. But one must be warned, there are no sympathetic characters in this novel. The character of \\"the kid\\" is somewhat of an anti-hero, he appears to have a conscience, while the character of \\"Judge Holden\\" is the epitome of evil, the Devil incarnate. He is clearly not human and is a metaphor for the evil men do. The other characters occupy a scale of badness between these two characters. This is not a romantic vision of the west that one pines for, on the contrary, as you read this masterpiece you're just glad you were not there to see it. Also, this work is a far more literary work than his later works...The Border Trilogy, No Country for Old Men, and The Road. Those works are less challenging reads, and are just generally more accesible. Although, if you are ready for a challenging read, that is beautifully written, yet savagely violent, but will leave you in awe, and will indelibly singe itself onto the convolutions of your brain, please, please read this masterpiece!!!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The other reviews do a great job of all the detail. Basically, if you like reading about men committing horrific acts of violence on most every breed of man and animal, AND you especially like reading about it in dense, apocalyptic language written by someone with the vocabulary to describe the same bleak landscape 230 times without repeating an adjective or a noun, then by god, this is your book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Never one to look at the world through rose-colored glasses, McCarthy really outdoes himself here. Written in his usual quirky syntax, McCarthy will show you a side of the wild West to which you might have preferred to remain oblivious. He will also encourage you to consider the men, great and evil, who built this country and made it what it is today. Finally, for me at least, it set off a new evaluation of the quality and value of life."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Absolutely ghastly, and yet one of the most beautiful things I've ever read.

But this gap serves as the very setting of this novel of Blakean intensity. McCarthy reveals the true proportions of this ostensibly minute gap-- the proportions of epic.Roaming this infinite (and thereby surreal) terrain, is one of the most memorable characters in the history of literature -- the Judge.

The dying man sang with great clarity and intention and the riders setting forth upcountry may have ridden more slowly the longer to hear him for they were of just these qualities themselves.&quot;Blood Meridian is a copious work of art to be explored for its profundity of treasures. Not for the faint of heart nor for those looking for light poolside reading. A relatively naive reader such as myself would no doubt benefit from some help with the myriad themes and imagery hidden in the folds of McCarthy's prose. Has anyone read &quot;Notes on Blood Meridian&quot;, by John Sepich?"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Here it is: a monolith of modern literature, the continuation of Melville and Faulkner, a solemn pitch-black morality tale seething with guts and grandeur. Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" is as audacious as it is grim. Since its publication in 1985, this book has flooded academic conferences and literary circles with questions and philosophical debates. Is it a Gnostic tragedy, an allegory for Vietnam, a rendition of Nietzschean power struggle, a narrative of nihilism, or a complex epic about moral alternatives in the vein of \\"Moby Dick\\"? Unquestionable, though, is the novel's brute strength and poetic prowess as it takes the reader through countless journeys, over phantasmagoric landscapes, and into the deep wild of the human heart.The kid, nameless Everyman, strikes out for the West to forge a way and a will in the world. There he discovers the brutal energies of the wilderness and the savage nature of primal man. His first foray into the desert with a throng of legionnaires meets a swift, unforgettable end; McCarthy's description of the Comanche attack is some of his finest writing and characteristic of his talent for detailing the bloodiest of moments with the cool hand of a historian. Yet, our protagonist survives, now a lone orphan, in search for a new purpose and direction. His path leads him to Glanton's gang: a cross section of societal decay replete with mongrel profiteers, war-wearied infantrymen, and one Judge Holden.Holden has become a major point of interest for scholars and critics analyzing \\"Blood Meridian,\\" and for good reason. He invokes the linguistic dexterity and glittering morbidity of Milton's Satan while preaching a godless doctrine of nihilism and triumphal will. This is McCarthy's white whale, the sun-bleached trumpeter for War, whose presence dims the prose and overshadows the proceedings. It is he that the kid must resist, and the final third of the novel revolves around their unspoken bartering for the kid's soul. Pay attention to their meeting at the well in Alamo Mucho--watch the kid's feet at the rim--listen to the exchange between Holden and Tobin, the ex-priest; McCarthy has written a morality play without equal in American letters.The novel is dense, the journey arduous, and the destination enriching. To read \\"Blood Meridian\\" is to read one of the best novels of the past century. It's not for the faint of heart, but neither then is the descent into the darkness within us all."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is an American classic.

My first encounter with Cormac McCarthy was watching the film No Country for Old Men, a film based on his novel of the same name. I then read the novel, which was excellent. I went on to read The Road, another excellent novel. Finally I decided to read one more of his books. I decided on Blood Meridian, hearing nothing but outstanding praise. Blood Meridian completely lives up to the hype.It is a classic novel, in the same way that 1984 or Lord of the Flies is a classic. It will leave an impression on you. It will stay with you for days after you finish. I tried reading another novel afterwards but I couldn't. I simply couldn't stop thinking about Blood Meridian. It is deep, complex, brutal, and wonderfully written, exploring the deep philosophical issues of human morality. One word of warning, it is exceedingly violent, if that is a turn off, perhaps look elsewhere. If not, read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book arrived on time and in excellent condition.

McCarthy is a poet - his language is superb. One line from this book I'll never forget, describing the Commanches: '......a legion of horribles'. I've read every book this man has written and I have only one complaint - he hasn't published anything in a long time."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A friend recommended this book to me because I had recently taken a trip to Texas's Big Bend National Park. After I had described my experience and what little history I had picked up in four days, she pointed me toward Cormac McCarthy. This was a wonderful coincidence because being out there had left me with a sense of wonder and many questions about the people and history of the area.For much of the 19th century, West Texas was disputed territory. Though remote and barren, this Native American land was alternately claimed by Mexico, Spain, The United States, and of course Texas. This book is full of bloody battles, with the constant feeling of some great Darwinian process at work. Most novels have fewer characters than this one manages to kill off in the first half.Granted, a novel may not be the best way to learn history, but I get the impression that no one really knows what day-to-day life was like out there. If it was anything like McCarthy's description, it was a brutal, amoral time. I'll warn you: this book has a lot of violence and gore. And there are no good guys, just survivors and corpses."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy's yarn will not make you yawn!A revolving cluster of archaic verbs and arcane nouns blast the reader like bullets from a Gatling gun. Much of his language trundles the reader across the dead and blood-soaked terrain of the American Southwest, during the time when a benighted intolerance of people black and red went unchallenged.The Kid, who begins the tale, winds his way through one grotesque scene after another. Almost the entire story is shown through his eyes. Rarely does the narrative &quot;tell&quot; you what's transpiring before the protagonist, rather each sentence &quot;shows&quot; you the carnage in all its meticulous detail. The reader, who winces from the onslaught of grotesqueries, struggles for some form of judgment, mostly condemnatory, to right his/her own understanding of the horror. McCarthy holds no judgments.In many respects, Blood Meridian, albeit a well-crafted simulation of a 19th-century novel vis-&agrave;-vis Moby-Dick, stands as a totemic testament of the inhumanity the 20th century harvested."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is increasingly seen as one of the great American novels (thanks, in no small part, to Harold Bloom's impassioned advocacy) and it remains a remarkable achievement.To begin with, McCarthy is just a brilliant prose stylist. Even at its most affected and portentous, the book contains breathtakingly poetical passages and imagery. And McCarthy is also a terrific storyteller. The characters are vivid, and the action is often thrillingly intense.Beyond that, however, I have some reservations. McCarthy is an inspired genre writer (and as a thriller, western, and road book, Blood Meridian is first-class), but there's always a sense of overreach in his books and I'm not particularly moved by the heavy-handed quasi-biblical language and symbolism or the rather tired platitudes on the nature of violence and man and war that litter this book. As many have noted, the violence in this book is graphic and legitimately shocking at times. Yet by the end of the book, the violence has grown tedious and even kitsch-y from McCarthy's constant efforts to top himself.I don't want to deny McCarthy's exceptional gifts and Blood Meridian is, in many respects, a tremendous book, but I do feel it ultimately stumbles under its own weight."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a tale of a kid from Tennessee who journeys to a cesspool of post-Polk terror and carnage where the fallen joints of cholla are encrusted with the dried blood of insignificant \`natives' but their scalps are subject to auction and then there is the savagery of the filth that accompanied the kid and a judge who has the genes of a pig and who believes with gusto of the ontology and necessity of war and who adores the monotone hues of blood and then there are the \`niggers' who are only a slight totem pole height above the \`natives' and who, along with women, whiskey, and money are \\"unique in their ability to destroy the earth\\" and who are also immersed in the baptism of blood and then there is the war against Mexico that had not really ended and where Mexican land is open for plunder and the Mexicans are also barbarians who do not understand republican government and cannot govern themselves and so must be governed by others and where God is absent and there is the land with no music but only the syncopated rhythms of war cries and which is trodden by war parties where bushes are decorated by dead babies and where vampires drink blood for survival rather than pure unadulterated pleasure and where Apache bones litter the landscape with their white color a reminder of the brutalities of whites whose bellies are yellow."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Being the author of a Western myself (&quot;Bounties&quot;), I picked this book up not sure of what to expect. I'd heard great things about &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; but had no idea that McCarthy had taken the Western novel and re-shaped it into an art form unrecognizable from anything previously written. Whereas in my books I try to rely on humor to get characters through the hardships of the Early American West, McCarthy allows the grit, sand, heat, and violence to define the lives the character's lead. As a writer, and not just a writer of Westerns, I feel obligated to thank the author for giving us a new view of what American literature, as well as literature about the West, can achieve. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get a clear, untouched picture of what the American West really was like."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"One of the strengths of this novel is its depiction of genocide. Bring the characters into the present, ditch their horses, and arm them with automatic weapons and this novel could be describing any number of mass murders that have occurred across the globe in the past decade. The fact that it's describing America 150 years ago makes it that more relevant. It peels away all the Old West myths and reveals the ugliness behind. There are no heroes to root for; there are no gunfights between the good guys and bad guys at the OK Corral. Often, the people being killed are women and children. From fistfigts in mud to horses swelling from snake bites to The Kid(the central character, if there really is one) carrying a festering arrow stub in his leg to the countless sculpings of Native Amercians, this is far more than a &quot;western&quot;. It's an epic novel that just happens to be set in the West. McCarthy's writing is a feast, filled with long sentences, tight dialogue, and an endless supply of details. The only flaw I can think of is that it climaxes too soon, with a four page tour-de-force of energized prose, as McCarthy describes in numbing, vivid, almost hyperreal detail, a Comanche attack. This centerpiece reminded me of only one other moment in modern literature, Julio Cortazar's rumination on jazz in Hopscotch. I have read both scenes by themselves just for their accomplishments in language, for the fact that they show writers playing with all their skills in an effort to elevate their craft. With Blood Meridian, it doesn't appear that McCarthy has elevated just his own craft but that of all American writing."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The prose is vivid, the characters chillingly alive, the themes provocative. The extreme violence has a purpose: McCarthy wants to show that bloodthirst is a part of being human, that violence speaks to our innermost hearts.

A gorgeous and wonderful book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I disliked, borderline hated this novel. In fact, I repeatedly had to force myself to finish it because I thought maybe there would be some epic ending since so many people have said how superb a novel it is. The language was just strange. I would read an entire chapter and didn't really understand what happened. McCarthy is just often too wordy for me as well. I think he just tries too hard. The story had potential but the way he told it, well, nothing happened. Graphic violence and lot of people killed - that about sums it up. The antagonist and protagonist were hard to identify with. I really wish I would have stuck with my gut and just put this one down. Not my cup of tea. I won't be reading anymore McCarthy. 3.5/10"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"\\"Blood Meridian\\" is a challenge. I do not recommend delving into this book as a solo endeavor, grab a friend, grab a class, grab a book club, but don't start this one on your own! I'm not intending to dissuade you from reading this book, Cormac McCarthy has a lot of offer a reader, but \\"Blood Meridian\\" is without a doubt the single most challenging book I have ever read. I like to believe that I would have been up to the challenge had I been reading this on my own; I know, however, that I would have failed miserably at understanding this novel if I was not offered guidance, encouragement, and support from other readers.McCarthy throws the reader into a situation that few readers are familiar with, in fact, few authors are even willing to try what McCarthy attempted. \\"Blood Meridian\\" is a complex story that centers around the kid (not Billy the Kid or any other kind of capitalized \\"kid,\\" just 'the kid,' mind you) and the judge. The cast of characters extends from there to a group of diverse nomadic soldiers that includes an expriest, an earless convict, several Delaware Indians, and other rough types. None of these characters is likeable in the least way. All of the characters thrive on war, murdering women, children, old men, and other warriors, and sell Indian scalps for gold. Therefore the reader is surrounded by what appears on first glance to be an utterly immoral book.Morality is a major tenet of \\"Blood Meridian.\\" McCarthy's characters do not appear to have a moral fiber in their bodies, and this makes the book difficult to read, especially if you are the type of reader who absolutely needs to identify with a character in order to 'get into' a book. You will not (I certainly hope) identify with any of these characters. That does not, however, mean that there is nothing to glean from this gruesome novel of murder, mayhem, and immorality.In life there are often no clear cut sides, no black and white answers, and in this book, at moments, the reader is forced to root for a character not because he is good, but because he is less evil (at that particular moment). The judge is a giant, totally bald man, with a grasp of several languages, who has a vast repertoire of knowledge, and is utterly capable of surviving the direst circumstances (in one scene he makes gun powder in the middle of the desert). It is difficult not to be drawn to the judge, this powerful man who records cave drawings in his journals, sketches, writes, and outwits anyone who speaks to him. And just when the reader is embracing the judge, he does something that reminds the reader that every character in this novel is the worst kind of scoundrel... Yet the Judge is not the incarnation of the devil, McCarthy does not make things that simple for us. Just as the kid is not a David type figure (David and Goliath), the judge is something very evil, but he is not evilness itself.The kid is the character the reader wants to like, but it is hard to root for anyone associated with the judge and this band of soldiers. Therefore McCarthy has created a world where the reader does not particularly care for any of the characters and yet, and this is the brilliance of it, the reader is still invested in the book. I kept turning the pages even though I thought the world would be a better place if all of the characters were locked safely away in padded cells.If you are looking for a challenge, a book that you won't be able to understand without deep thought and concentration, a world where evil is plentiful and goes unpunished, but where there is some morality nonetheless (or so I suspect), then this is the right book for you. If, however, you are looking for some light summer reading, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The one good thing I can say about this book is that the author makes great use of vivid (if often disgusting) similes and metaphors. Despite the truly excellent use of descriptive language, I hated this book (and I know that puts me in a minority).The storyline follows the wanderings of \\"the kid\\" and a shifting group of brutal killers who rape, slaughter, and burn their way through the death-filled lands along the Texas-Mexico border while collecting Apache scalps for bounty. While I do not mind a nice dark \\"what evil lurks in the heart of man\\" book (e.g. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"), this one was nothing but a long parade of (brilliantly described) unimaginative brutality. No clever plot, just unending bloodthirstiness and death that just kind of peters out at the ambiguous end of the book.I know this is supposed to be some sort of literary masterpiece, and I felt like the author was trying to be deep and edgy (war as the reason for man's existence, the only half-explained action, scorning the use of quotation marks or hyphens, etc.), but to me it just came off like tawdry \\"violence porn\\".

Well, maybe it was - but that doesn't mean you have to write about it. And so opaquely!

He is exposed to all sort of violence and depravity, as he wanders first thru old Texas (just after the Mexican-American War), then joins up with a crazy American Captain who organizes a company of men to somehow \\"help take Sonora\\" from Mexico... they pretty much all end up getting killed, and the boy ends up joining a band of mercenary Apache hunting scalpers (they trade the scalps for bounty in the Mexican State capital cities of Chihuahua and Sonora)... this band of marauders eventually wear out their welcome in Mexico, then Tucson, and eventually head for California, but not until they first set up shop in Yuma, running a ferry across the Colorado River (but which is really just a way for them to rob the people of everything they have)... some of the marauders eventually make it to San Diego, and a couple of them make it to Northern California Goldrush country... even back to 1870's North Texas at the end of the book, where the Buffalo has all been but wiped out, and many folks make a living transporting the bones of all the dead buffalo carcasses.LOTS of violence and depravity... it makes my semi-hedonistic life look tame in comparison.Much of the story involves tales of survival of these rough and hardy people, and those they encounter... but there are also MANY tales of death, dying, and murder (the fact is, most everyone described gets killed off sooner or later - mostly sooner).The author has an almost childish writing style, which sometimes makes it hard to follow what is being told, but otherwise is not a hindrance to the story."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"No one really knows what the west was like...but this really looks like the best description of those rugged times: the prose is great, too."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"After finishing this novel, I have a lot of mixed emotions. To begin with, I feel intellectually inadequate because I found this book to be very difficult to read without a dictionary by my side. For me, significant passages were nearly unintelligible and had to be re-read to gain even a modicum of understanding of the prose. The inclusion of Spanish lines without translation was especially annoying.After years of reading literature, it is obvious that the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;, must of necessity, contain detailed descriptions down to the last rock, rose petal, or sweat bead. It must also contain language that no &quot;normal&quot; individual would employ in general communication. In this book, McCarthy maintained this tradition by describing every minute detail from the weather to precisely how the &quot;Judge&quot; or Glanton brutally murdered an Indian. Moreover, he used words that were archaic, &quot;made-up&quot; or just plain unknown to me (i.e. why I needed my Dictionary). While great writers all tend to use these techniques, McCarthy does so in a way that I found arrogant and mocking. In fact, the main character, the Judge, was a man of great learning and intelligence leading a band of ignorant thugs in the butchery of Indians. The Judge frequently held &quot;campfire sessions&quot; where he poured forth his great wisdom in a mentally intimidating way that was far beyond the intellectual capacity of his minions. To that extent, I find the Judge's personality embodied in McCarthy's writing style.Overall, this book was extremely challenging, very horrific, often boring and clearly unentertaining. I've given it 3 stars because it must be a good book because nearly every review says it is.

Often I felt my eyes skimming over the endless journey of these highly unlikeable and disgusting, unredeemable characters...sorry I didn't \\"get it\\" nor did I find exalted purpose in it like so many other reviewers seem to have found.

The \\"great american novel\\" should probably today be caleld \\"the quintessential american novel,\\" because the word great, in this context, refers to the novel that will encompass what we have been, why, how we got there, and where we were going. And because of the story, by definition, it cannot be \\"great.\\" The story of America will be unremittingly (and unapologetically) brutal and bloody; it will lack all traces of logic and civilization on a grand scale (though, certainly, there will be logical or civilized characters); and throughout there will remain the slightest glimmer of hope, although depending on the viewpoint of the author, that hope may be snuffed out at the end of the novel or kept alive.I have read the great american novel, and it is Cormac McCarthy's stunning Blood Meridian.Blood Meridian centers on a character known only as The Kid, who leaves home at fourteen to make his fortune during the expansion of the American West (the book begins ten years or so before the outbreak of the Civil War). (and comparisons with the hallmark of that genre, Robert Deveraux's brilliant Deadweight, are inevitable, and correct). McCarthy never shies away from the actions of his characters, never allows the reader any leeway, but the prose in which McCarthy describes the atrocities Glanton's band commits is so starkly beautiful the reader cannot help but be capitvated by the carnage. And during the lulls in the action, when members of the band philosophize, the philosophy is not so overbearing as it is instructive for those who may not be able to understand the mechanisms that work in the collective mind of Glanton's troops:* * *The good book says that he that lives by the sword shall perish by the sword, said the black.The judge smiled, his face shining with grease. What right man would have it any other way? he said.The good book does indeed count war an evil, said Irving. Yet there's many a bloody tale of war inside it.It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way.He turned to Brown, from whom he'd heard some whispered slur or demurrer. Ah, Davy, he said. It's your own trade we honor here. Why not rather take a small bow. Let each acknowledge each.My trade?Certainly.What is my trade?War. War is your trade. Is it not?And it ain't yours?Mine too. Very much so.What about all them notebooks and bones and stuff?All other trades are contained in that of war.Is that why war endures?No. It endures because young men love it and old men love it in them. Those that fought, those that did not.That's your notion.The judge smiled. Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselevs sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that man's hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a man's worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at least a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.Brown studied the judge. You're crazy Holden. Crazy at last.* * *Like James Jones' masterpiece The Thin Red Line, McCarthy gives us men at war, though McCarthy's troops answer to no one but themselves, and act as such, and he does it in such a way that we cannot help but understand what it is about violence and bloodshed that makes it so attractive to some. By far the best book I have come across this year. If all of McCarthy's novels are this good, then truly, he is one of America's most neglected authors, as The Atlantic monthly would have us believe. ****** * *(It's worth noting, by the way, that while I've handed out a number of four-and-a-halfs this year, Blood Meridian is the first book in the year 2000 to receive a five star rating.)"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the first McCarthy novel I read, and, on completion, I found myself both impressed and disgusted. As a crafter of English prose, McCarthy is stunning; the imagery, the dialogue and the symbolism are dazzlingly effective. I was irresistably reminded of Melville at his best...and yet.. There is a moral vacuum at the heart of this novel, which excludes it from greatness. We know that man can be vile, but vileness isn't everything. The characters commit acts of unspeakable cruelty without the least sense of conscience or remorse: none of them care about the murdered children, which makes it impossible to care about any of them. If it is a study of how human beings become less than human, we need to see the original humanity. The judge may keep us awake at night, but ultimately, he is a cartoon figure, a Freddie Krueger for post-grads (and heavily &quot;influenced&quot; by Jodorovsky). He's certainly no Ahab. McCarthy is a powerful, talented and disturbing writer but if you want a mythic western, with moral and symbolic depth I suggest you look to John Ford."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have read four of McCarthy's books, the latest being &quot;Blood Meridian.&quot; This author tells a good story, and his prose is among some of the best of our modern writers. Unfortunately his rambling, cracked philosophical gibberish often detracts the reader from what otherwise would have been an excellent novel. This is an author who is in love with his command of baroque and arcane words, and far too often allows himself (at the expense of the reader) greatluxuries in convoluted, confusing passages more akin to riddles than novels.McCarthy is a precise historian and a good story teller, but too self-absorbed for his own good. &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is a good novel; it could have been a great one."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This novel, 337 pages of it, busies itself with two overarching themes--the timelessness and universality of war and violence, and the utter inability of mankind to control any part of his destiny, nor much else with which he is faced. These themes are played out against a sere and hellish landscape. Indeed the land consumes the novel and the characters are merely beings and non beings thrown, in no coherent order, against the canvas of the earth, something like a Jackson Pollack painting. The book has been selected by the New York Times as one of the very best written over the past 25 years, as well as by Harold Bloom, the pre-imminent literary scholar and critic.McCarthy has filled his work with every obscure word, image and analogy that he can conjure. It is a very difficult read and somewhere along the way one begins to read only a chapter or so at a time, hoping that, after some reflection, one can understand what this man is driving at before moving on to the next chapter. Somewhere also one begins to understand that The Judge, one of the three main characters of the book, is a symbol for all war; the Kid is a symbol for those young who stumble, intentionally or not, into war; and Glanton--the supposed leader of this bloodthirsty and merciless gang--is merely the unknowing instrument that the Judge uses for his purposes.McCarthy tries! How he does try. But these themes have been recounted time and again in all literature and history. And in far fewer words and far more adept renderings. It is almost as if McCarthy wishes to be a poet, so image evoking his scenes and his language, but he does not quite have the skills or the patience to pull it off.He cannot do in 337 pages what Matthew Arnold has done in 37 short, beautiful and terrible lines in \\"Dover Beach\\". It does seem as if McCarthy, having read this poem, is now trying in some desperate way to match the short commentary on war and hopelessness which this poem so wonderfully encapsulates, but it will not do. Arnold, 120 years before McCarthy, has beat him to the punch."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"It's hard to describe Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy because it is not so much a story as an experience. It is one of the most violent books I have ever read, but it isn't the comic book violence of most novels or movies; instead it is a brutal, realistic violence that is not for the squeamish.The nominal protagonist in this novel is The Kid, a teenager who runs away from his Tennessee home and after some brief adventures, winds up with a militia group in the 1850s South. Not satisfied with the settlement after the Mexican War, they intend on seizing more land and killing more Mexicans. This effort doesn't go well, but The Kid survives and joins a different group which he will remain with for most of the book.This second group, led by a man named Glanton, is charged by the Mexican government to kill Indians and bring back their scalps. Glanton's crew is a motley team of unpleasant sorts but few are more vicious than Glanton himself or the judge, whose intelligence is only matched by his cruelty. This team will kill many Indians (and others) and in turn suffer death and injury themselves.Essentially, Blood Meridian is a journey through Hell in the guise of the antebellum Southwest. It is a land of perpetual war. Neither side has much in the way of redeeming values (not even The Kid). Even the animals (perhaps, especially the animals) suffer in this world, and like the damned, no one truly escapes.McCarthy is a good writer, though not necessarily as good as his reputation often makes him out to be. He is not an easy read, however, due to frequent use of untranslated Spanish (if you don't know the language, you can't always pick up the meaning by context), which is, admittedly not as prevalent as in his Border Trilogy; also, McCarthy is a bit of a minimalist when it comes to punctuation: dialogue is shown without quotation marks and contractions only sporadically have apostrophes. This is a good book but it requires patience and is definitely not for everyone."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Based loosely on actual historic events, McCarthy-alongside of James Salter, probably the best living American author--explores bloodlust and the desire to know and in knowing possess and in possessing destroy that seems central to American expansion. He glorifies nobody, not the Indian hunters nor the Indians; they are all of clay and at each heart burns a darkness, save maybe that of the main character, who himself cannot stand up against the darkness, but will be sucked down into it, destroyed like everything else in a world that has no respect for innocence and no real belief in the sacredness of anything."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a marvelous book, brutal and cold, with a bitter wind of universal loathing. Here we have a story of an almost unspeakable evil and the coarse, boorish thugs involved with carrying a reign of terror to the end. Like many of McCarthy's other novels (especially Child of God and Suttree), it is gloriously composed, featuring a writhing prose style, rousing and rhythmic and directly to the point. There is a wonderful, matter-of-factly written dialogue of two of the scalp hunters realizing they are eating tacos made out of cat meat. They can only shrug their shoulders and chow down, starving and with nothing else around for miles.Of all McCarthy's works, this is my favorite, but be forewarned (if, for some reason, things like this bug you): Here is truly one of the most violent novels ever written. Of course, sheer, murderous depravity has never been recorded with such precision and style, the same energy given to McCarthy's celebrated scenic descriptions in The Border Trilogy, repeated for atomizations of an agonizing death and the wounded maraduers creating some sort of apocylpse."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What an amazing work by an equally amazing writer. No one whom I've read captures the land and the people who live and travel it like McCarthy. If you liked any of his trilogy for the romance, this book is not for you. If, however, his descriptions of sheer humanity, his absolute gift with words, and his incomparable ability to paint a verbal landscape in any way appeal to you, then this is the book to read. With characters just unusual enough to be both repulsive and fascinating, McCarthy brings to life a West that has never made it to film, but ought to. My hope is that one day a director with the guts to put this tale to film will find the actors and resources to do so. Until then reader, find this book and enjoy some of the best contemporary fiction to be had."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian will lead you to all the other Cormac McCarthy books, for that same clear power and beauty; but you will not find it.It is here only that McCarthy has taken the language and forged a novel of such individual intensity that it will strike you like the single clear tone from one huge bell. It is an exploration of an archaic vocabulary and a lost culture using a storytellers skill that was last used by Homer. The story and plot are irrelevant other than McCarthy has fashioned a group of crudely chiseled characters on a wide wide horizon of fine resolution; and he moves the characters across a blasted panorama in a pounding and relentless drama. There are portions of the prose that are so perfect in assembly and content that, like the Bible and just a half dozen other documents in English, they should be read aloud.In the thousands of books that I will read in the second half of my life I hope to find one more to equal this Blood Meridian.Put this book up on a shelf next to Homer, Cervantes, Melville, and Joyce."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The story of a movable abattoir, a desert flower in fullest bloom wrought in bold, panoramic arcs of blood and dust. It is as though Huck Finn staggered southward without aim to coat himself in filth and toil at the grinding work of murder for pay, never blinking once to the possibility of a hell or burning in that sulphur through eternity.McCarthy's novel is an epic driven by minute, horrifying description. Though most of the characters are drawn in variant shades of sociopathic indifference, each depiction is crafted in expertly effected understatement (the exception is 'The Judge' who looms as large and strangely sympathetic as any Kurtz or Ahab). Still, one cannot help being fully taken under by McCarthy's portrayal of humanity. That this is so is testimony to the author's seemingly effortless command of razor-blade prose which cuts clean to an undeniable truth born of the animal within us all. To have that truth branded on one's heart is to feel the painful exhileration of evolution by way of thoughtless deceits and homicide. Seldom if ever again will the reader pass through a story wherein the savagery is so beautifully and unerringly sustained. Finally, once the tale has closed, despite the intricate detail of harrowing,feral ignorance and lusty violence, the end is sad only because there is no more. Such is life and the high-bore power of this novel."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I read this book ten years after its publication and without doubt, it is one of the most powerful and vivid novels I have ever read. What a stupendous writer! The critics said, \\"McCarthy employs a neo-Biblical rhetoric, a soaring, pulsing...always stirring diction without parallel in American writing today.\\" \\"An extraordinary, breathtaking achievement.\\" What a book!Also great is McCarthy's \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" (1992), about two boys who cross the Texas-Mexico boarder on horseback in 1949.In the following passage from Blood Meridian, here come the Indians, driving cattle before them as they charge into battle against the American adventurers in northern Mexico in the late 1840's.There is nothing to distract your eye's mesmerizing march across the page. Powerful and relentless, run-on sentences. McCarthy's intention is to conjure up a vision by putting the reader into a trance.\\"The first of the herd began to swing past them in a pall of yellow dust, rangy slatribbed cattle with horns that grew agoggle and no two alike and small thin mules coalblack that shouldered one another and reared their malletshaped heads above the backs of the others and then more cattle and finally the first of the herders riding up the outer side and keeping the stock between themselves and the mounted company (of Americans). Behind them came a herd of several hundred ponies. The sergeant looked for Candelario. He kept backing along the ranks but he could not find him. He nudged his horse through the column and moved up the far side. The lattermost of the drovers were now coming through the dust and the captain was gesturing and shouting. The ponies had begun to veer off from the hear and the drovers were beating their way toward this armed company met with one the plain. Already you could see through the dust on the ponies' hides the painted chevrons and the hands and rising suns and birds and fish of every device like the shade of old work through sizing on a canvas and now too you could hear above the pounding of the unshod hooves the piping of the quena, flutes made from human bone, and some among the company had begun to saw back on their mounts and some to mill in confusion when up from the offside of those ponies there rose a fabled horde of mounted lancers and archers bearing shields bedight with bits of broken mirrorglass that cast a thousand unpieced suns against the eyes of their enemies. A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood of the prior owners, coasts of slain dragoons, frogged and braided cavalry jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in whited stockings and a bloodstained weddingveil and some in headgear of cranefeathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo....And on and on until the reader is drained.I am very much reminded of Joseph Conrad here. Its takes a mature reader to fully appreciate the power of Cormac McCarthy's writing. It is clearly adult fiction.Here is another great paragraph from \\"Blood Meridian\\" (page 47) that could have come straight from Joseph Conrad's pen:\\"That night they rode through a region electric and wild where strange shapes of soft blue fire ran over the metal of the hoses' trappings and the wagonwheels rolled in hoops of fire and little shapes of pale blue light came to perch in the ears of the horses and in the beards of the men. All night sheetlightning quaked and sourceless to the west beyond the midnight thunderheads, making a bluish day of the distant desert, the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and lived like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear. The thunder moved up from the southwest and lightning lit the desert all about them, blue and barren, great clanging reaches ordered out of the absolute night like some demon kingdom summoned up or changeling land that come the day would leave them neither trace nor smoke nor ruin more than any troubling dream.\\"Compare above lines to similar lines in \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad:\\"We could have fancied oursleves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, , of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who could tell\\" we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.

With all the novelists writing today, it's hard to find one worth reading, let alone one worth studying. However, in Cormac McCarthy, we have such a writer.\\"Blood Meridian\\" is a deep and dark novel about horrific depravity and absolute cruelty. The novel is ostensibly about the Kid, but it doesn't take long for the book to shift it's focus to the strong characters in the book, Glanton and the terrifying Judge Holden.The violence of the book is not, in this reviewer's opinion, over-done. The scenes of violence are close together in the first hundred pages or so, then they level out. The scenes of violence and terrorism never lose their poignancy, even though there is a good deal of violence in this book.Judge Holden is, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying fictional characters produced in a long time. We are not sure if he is a man at all, for \\"ever a man in this company swears to have seen him before they got here.\\" Like a twisted theophany, the judge is never entirely absent. His philosophical ruminations are chilling in their matter-of-fact tone, especially when he talks about \\"the sanctity of blood.\\"Holden may very well be the only permanent literary figure of the last twenty-five years. He is in the line of Melville's Ahab, Faulkner's Sutpen, and to a lesser extent, Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor. He towers above this novel and his words still echo in my mind.As to McCarthy's writing itself: He is a master. Only Thomas Pynchon can come close to the technical virtuosity of the prose. His long and oblique sentences are sometimes difficult, but if you think about them they are always beautiful, but always with a funereal beauty. The influence of Faulkner is clear, but make no mistake about it: McCarthy is a strong writer and has forged a voice entirely his own. A metaphysical atmosphere is maintained throughout the entire book. One always feels as if one is reading the lost text of a Western religion now extinct. McCarthy's \\"neo-Biblical\\" rhetoric is pitch perfect in this novel. Flawlessly describing various landscapes, he never recycles metaphors. He seems to forge images fresh and anew on almost every page. His diction is high and word choice incredibly meticulous. His resourcefulness with language is simply astonishing.McCarthy is simply brilliant, to put it mildly. In the first chapter, he out-writes King, Roberts, Steele, and virtually any other writer at work today. He is the real deal.For those who want to a terrifying, gripping, and ultimately rewarding read, pick this up. You won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I will say straight up that there is simply no point in anyone attempting to write yet another of the many reviews seen here and elsewhere that attempt to emulate (some well, some not) the hyper-articulated style of the author himself. Suffice to say that this is a brilliant work and makes me think of those times that I was doubtful of those who described any given book as something that simply must be experienced. I have joined such people at least as far as Blood Meridian is concerned. I am surprised at those who find the character of the Judge as some kind of literary or metaphorical \\"overkill\\" however. He is in my estimation, simply the book's \\"war is god\\" principle incarnate. Perhaps I have missed something over the years, but I have always perceived him as an immortal presence who at one time perhaps subsumed the life of a young man in events years prior to those of the novel, that other young man now somehow being the character of the presumably middle-aged Glanton of the story. I do not presume to understand in any way what literally seems to occur at \\"the jakes\\" except to say that there is perhaps something there about the way in which the Judge perpetuates himself over time? Anyway. Not to trivialize everything here, but what of a movie? Is it beyond everyone's ability? I must add here that works such as this nearly always invite a knee-jerk backlash from the \\"emperor has no clothes\\" crowd, those that assume it hip to go against the grain and who generally seek to smash potential icons. Rest assured, those folks here (the frustrated perfectionist, I believe?) have it dead wrong. This work is simply brilliant by any measure."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I was really awed by McCarthy's descriptive style when I read Blood Meridian. But I remained unconvinced of the claims to greatness I had heard from so many others. Too often, I thought, these characters are just trudging across the Southwestern desert; no matter how beautifully one describes that desert, it starts to get old.But a week after reading this book, I still found myself thinking about the judge. The judge is one of those characters and/or ideas that you come across in a book that you just can't stop thinking about. His thoughts on the truth, and the savagery that those thoughts engender, are unforgettable now; they're burned into my thoughts.I'm not willing to go out on a limb, as Harold Bloom does in the Introducation, and put Blood Meridian up there with the very best of Faulkner and Melville, but it is certainly well worth reading two or three times."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The friend who recommended this book prefaced his offer by warning me that McCarthy essentially had to reinvent the English language to tell this story - much the way that biblical translations often take great liberty with typical structural and grammatical conventions. He then effectively tripled my apprehension by promising more than a few uncomfortably graphic scenes, then hinting that the story's resolution was bound to infinitely deepen my disgust with the World of Man's inherent immorality and injustice.I read the story anyway (with a degree of caution I typically reserve for late-night downtown strolls), and found myself ecstatic that all of his warnings came true. Not only does McCarthy's prose speak of an unparalleled timeworn Western gothic, but it rates easily as the most poetic and intense narrative I've yet read. Indeed, the gore occasionally reached epic proportions, serving as a visceral reminder that the story's lofty, deeply interwoven themes do actually have basis in physical reality. And, truest of all, Blood Meridian left me hopelessly stranded in the midst of a dark, brooding, inhumane surreality that for months afterward stifled any hope I had regarding the future of humankind. That said, it merits mentioning that I've not come across a more enthralling, powerful story before or since.It also should be obvious that unadventurous readers need not consider even approaching this book. While it might be possible to read the dramatic narrative superficially as some divine archetype of the picaresque cowboy-and-Indian adventure novel, to do so would be tantamount to original sin. McCarthy uses the backdrop of the newly annexed southwestern U.S. to explore a myriad of historically developed cultural mores and philosophies that have laid the groundwork for Western civilization's arrogant, self-righteous obliteration of all things - cultures, credos, environments, et c. - that represent potential deviations from its singleminded vision of The Way Things Ought To Be. (These underlying themes are far too extensive to detail here, and I doubt that my singular reading of the book was enough to notice even a fraction of them; you'll have to investigate for yourself.)The setting and characters McCarthy employs in this extended parable are not only engaging and broadly representative of their cultural and historical contexts, but also are of particular import in accessing the complex metaphysical nature of his thematic exposition. By the story's end, your unlikely attachment to the kid, Judge Holden, Toadvine, Glanton, the expriest Tobin, Davey Brown, Jackson, the Vandiemanlander, the Delawares, and the rest of their leather-souled scalp-hunting posse - in spite of their multifarious personal shortcomings and acts of nearly unspeakable atrocity - will have engraved a twisted black scar onto your humanity's virgin flesh, compelling you to pick Blood Meridian right back up and begin anew, searching feverishly for a fleck of hope that the world really isn't such a bad place after all."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"In a nutshell, I am in awe of Cormac McCarthy's &quot;Blood Meridian.&quot; His tale of the Kid, who is severely wounded early on in the tale and spends the rest of the novel in the hell of McCarthy's Southwest, is chilling and beautiful at the same time. McCarthy's writing is challenging, as he uses highly unusual words and phrases. And yet his voice is always appropriate and his descriptions are captivating. The key is to let yourself float along with the rhythm of the writing. You don't have to understand every word to get the gist of what he is saying, and the rhythm conveys sensations greater than the mere words could ever achieve. (In this limited sense, reading McCarthy is like reading Shakespeare.)McCarthy has created one of the most horrifying characters to roam the Old West in the Judge. An otherworldly monster, I believe the Judge is Satan walking the earth, leading a band of killers deeper and deeper into evil. The Judge isn't officially in charge of the Glanton Gang, but like Satan he keeps egging them on to greater depths of depravity. The Gang ranges from one bloodbath to another, enduring the miserable parched heat of Mexico, and yet the Judge never tires, never falters, and never gets so much as a scratch. Maybe he's a twisted version of Virgil from Dante's trilogy, guiding his charges into self-destruction rather than into Paradise. In any event, he's so evil it's haunting.Our witness to McCarthy's saga is the Kid, a character of limited vocabulary and blunt commentary. We ride with the Kid, endure his hardships, and agree with his refrain, &quot;You're crazy,&quot; that he uses so often in his conversations with the Judge. The Kid is no hero, however, and by siding with the Kid we are made accomplices in his various crimes, as well. The conclusion of the novel is about as scary as it comes. &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is a true delight, and I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"'Blood Meridian' is the most riveting book I've read in years. It treads the ground that other novels fear; a Faustian epic all the more chilling for its veracity. I can't recommend this novel enough - for some to read and for others to avoid.The tale traces the events of 1849-1850, when a band of mercenary marauders led by Capt. John Glanton ravaged the Texas-Mexican border, fulfilling their contract to bring Apache scalps to the governor of Chihuahua by indiscriminately killing whoever got in their way and passing off the evidence of their kills as Indian. Glanton's devilish second-in-command, 'the judge', is a seven foot tall hairless murderer who seems to have a mystical tie to an outer plane of existence, and who appeared to the band one day in the middle of the desert, sitting on a rock as if he'd been waiting for them. 'The kid', a 16-year-old boy (and the novel's protagonist), rescued from a Mexican prison, is also accepted into the group, and rides with them on their trek westward up until the gang's eventual destruction.Mr. McCarthy has been notoriously silent on the ideas and themes behind his novel, and there seems to be no end of theories about what the book represents. The vast territory of the mind that this book encompasses allows that freedom of opinion though - and the stonehearted brutality of McCarthy's biblical prose may guide readers into their own consciousness to withdraw whatever lies within and project it across the novel's hellish landscapes. Regardless, this is no territory for the squeamish - no stone of human barbarity is left unturned (and described) by McCarthy as the marauder's hack and stab their way across Mexico and into California. Even though the judge remarks near the novel's end that the kid alone had reserved in his soul \\"some corner of clemency\\" for the gang's victims, there are no contrived redeeming characters at all - the kid (maybe) the closest of any to retaining his humanity.The characters of 'Blood Meridian' may be archetypal surrogates, but they are unlike any I've come across before. It's as if Mr. McCarthy has tapped into a primal essence long shunned or forgotten, and if 'Blood Meridian' is any sort of allegory of the battle for men's souls, it's not a Christian battle alone but an ancient mixture of forces where there is little or no hope for succor or salvation. In this sense, the judge stands above them all - a gleeful, dancing stand-in for Ares, who studiously makes notations in his notebook of everything the gang encounters, from flora and fauna to ancient hieroglyphs carved on rock walls, in order to gain ascendancy over it all. The ex-priest Tobin, who whispers guidance into the kid's ear during their travels, is diametrically opposed to the judge, but unable to offer any counterweight to his vast strength. Between them is the kid, a savage middle ground, who eventually loses track of one and is captured by the other.Mr. McCarthy's challenging style of writing will antagonize many readers, though I found it easier than his 'Western Trilogy'. That and the brutal violence that erupts throughout the book. Both points are valid, and as I said, I would as strongly protect some against this book as I would urge it on others. Humanity hasn't changed since the time McCarthy writes about in 'Blood Meridian', but some are insulated from its brutality, and are not forced to confront it in any meaningful way. That doesn't mean it isn't still there, festering, waiting, but it would seem almost cruel to force a book like this on them, unprepared.Lastly, on the edition I read, there is a cover blurb that states, \\"A classic American novel of regeneration through violence\\", which makes little sense to me. \\"A classic American novel of...\\" implies that 'Blood Meridian is the best of many such novels, and as far as I'm concerned, it is one of a kind. And the idea of \\"regeneration through violence\\" is simply ridiculous. There is violence, then violence again, then death. Nothing is 'regenerated' by it, through it, or because of it. From what I took away in 'Blood Meridian', the notion of violence as a cleansing agent to prepare for the growth to come is a myth. Instead, it is humanity's birthright, and it does not concede the idea of any other constant."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This novel is an experience. I am not sure where to begin. It is not bound by proper character development or narrative trajectory. The most important event of the novel is never revealed--the reader is left to imagine that event, or at least sit uncomfortably with the implication of that event. And I suppose that is the most remarkable thing about the novel, the way the reader is implicated. But there is also the language, the imagery, the iconoclasm.McCormac drives the narrative forward in unconventional ways. There is the sheer spectacle of violence and all the qualities of great writing. There are the questions raised in the reader's mind: How far will these men go? What events will force them to greater extremes? What kind of ugliness resides in the landscape ahead?There is little question as to brutality of these men. I was never waiting for any sort of redemption or failure or revelation. There is no evidence in the text that such things are available in the world of this novel.It is a novel of hyper-reality, of haunting images, of brilliant monologues. It is the sort of novel that makes me want to stop writing.There are similarities between \\"Blood Meridian\\" and \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" The protagonists of both novels are 14-16 year old males. There are similar themes: an inability to deal justly with the world at hand, a longing for a world that is gone, transformative power of violence, loyalty, landscape, animals.And not that this should be any measure, but I also noticed that \\"Blood Meridian\\" was not a best seller like the border trilogy. And that perhaps highlights one of the defining features of this book, it demands a lot of the reader."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book is the ultimate litmus test for the avid reader of fiction. An arguable triumph of prose, style, form and content it has no equal I could think of to compare it to. I haven't read an exceptional amount of Westerns but then I'm not sure that this is the best category to place this book. It is epic in story conception and completely without the romantic elements that are so prevalent in such novels. Its theme of depraved brutality is unlikely to appeal to a mass audience despite the magnificent poetic style and form McCarthy utilizes here. Even though I was repelled by the violence of the story and found it quite difficult to read I still felt driven to finish it because of the author's excellence in creating a powerful visual picture inside the mind's eye. An example of the prose found within the pages of McCarthy's book: \\"There is hardly in the world a waste so barren but some creature will not cry out at night, yet here one was and they listened to their breathing in the dark and the cold and they listened to the systole of the rubymeated hearts that hung within them.\\"McCarthy has turned the normal pageantry of the Western tale inside on itself in an effort to help us discover the part of the western advancement of our nation that seeks to remain hidden and often at our own insistence. Our desire to remain happily ignorant of this dark region of history comes naturally to everyone - it isn't pleasant to hear (or read) about. And confronting that evil (and being confronted by that evil) even at this now great distance of time is unsettling for most of us. It won't be an easy read for anyone, will get under your skin and stay there for the duration of your reading and may even leave you feeling uneasy after you've finished.\\"Blood Meridian\\" recounts the odyssey of a Tennessean, 'The Kid', a fourteen year old runaway who eventually falls in with a band of men that have only the barest threads of humanity which they loose quickly. It isn't long before the kid learns to survive by learning their ways, willingly assisting in the terror they spread as they journey westward beginning at the Texas - Mexico border and spanning a few years between the 1840's & the 1850's. The rest of the supporting characters in the story are vividly fleshed out with the judge, an educated and shrewd man among near-savages, being the most unforgettable. The kid outlasts all of his counterparts with his wanderings taking him to the coast of California and almost back to the same spot where his travels began, meeting up with the judge one final time.Understandably \\"Blood Meridian\\" will not fascinate each reader in the way it did me. Read as many of the reviews here as you can; you'll see that there is a huge debate over the merits of the book. There is plenty of criticism and equal (or more) amounts of praise for this controversial but bravura work by McCarthy. If you're a reader of fiction who is looking for a real challenge then I suggest the book to you; and be certain to venture as far into the book as you can. Getting accustomed to the style and rhythm of the storytelling takes a while, and steeling yourself against the often numbing theme of violence will also be difficult at the beginning. But I found the rewards were worth it and I can't recall such a senses-stunning, more memorable ending to a book ever."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" is a cheerless and troubling narration of a blood soaked odyssey through the recently liberated land along the Texas-Mexico border in the late 1840's. This trek is experienced through the eyes of a 14 year old Tennesseean known as \\"the kid\\". Leaving his hopeless existence at his homestead, he joins up with a cutthroat band of mercenaries who have been given a mandate. The governors of the various states of Mexico have put a bounty on the heads of the rampaging Apache indians and other tribes in the area. They had been slaughtering homesteaders and pioneers ambling into these areas under the policy of eminent domain. Each bloody Apache scalp, including women and children, procured by the marauders was worth a price in gold.\\"The kid\\" connects with a blood thirsty group of vagabonds from varied walks of life. They are led by two men, a depraved sadist named Blanton and a hairless and surprisingly erudite gargantua of a man known as \\"the judge\\". Neither had high regard for any living creature. These men lead the raucous group on a killing spree that includes not only the bountied native Americans, but pillaging, raping, murdering and scalping of the innocent villagers they were supposed to protect. Evidently those paying for the scalps weren't too particular as to their origins.\\"The kid\\" grows up under the guidance and direction of these horrible men and we follow his fight for survival in the dangerous existence he pursues.McCarthy paints an unfortunate picture of westward expansion. The collision of different cultures leads to the inevitable death match that occurs when territorial boundaries are broached. This is not a feel good book of hope but one where the darkest corners of man's psyche are revealed."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Lushly descriptive and morally shocking, Blood Meridian is a triumph of post-modern American fiction. Cormac Mccarthy has constructed a novel almost Faulknerian in its descriptive beauty, yet filled with enough action and gore to satisfy the most avid horror or thriller reader. His multifaceted characters are replete with higher meaning, from the disturbingly Satanic Judge to the orphaned, hardened &quot;kid&quot;. The novel's only real shortcoming is that it floats between two audiences - the Faulkner camp who would be impressed with the imagery but turned off by the anti-moralistic plot, and the horror reader who would love the elements of blood and evil but would tire of wading through the thick description to get to those elements. Nevertheless, Blood Meridian is a refreshing break from the Western traditions. It is not the campy, good-cowboy tale of the 50's, nor is it the Dances With Wolves-esque, noble-Indian epic of recent years. It simply exposes the American West for what it was - a maelstrom of conflict, atrocity, and bloodshed perpetrated by all sides. A landmark piece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Apparently like a lot of other people, it took me several tries over the years to actually finish \\"Blood Meridian\\". The overwhelming violence and deliberately archaic language and diction were obstacles for me, I admit. The kick in the butt that finally got me reading again was the great recent Coen brothers adaptation ofNo Country for Old Men. Something that struck me was the similarity between the monstrous hit man Anton Chigurh and the demoniac Judge Holden. They both talk in terrifyingly murderous, deterministic terms. Both are unstoppable to the point where you wonder if they have supernatural powers. Both seem to symbolize the eternal, predatory evil of the world. There's not a physical description of Chigurh given in the novelNo Country for Old Men (Vintage International), but I wouldn't be surprised to find out he is a seven-foot-tall bald albino. Maybe he is like Stephen King's character Randall Flagg, an infernal figure who takes various guises over the years all over the world. It's a thought that gives me chills.\\"Blood Meridian\\" seems at once modern and ancient. The hallucinatory violence and existential urgency and fear remind me very much of movies likeApocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition): and yet the language of the novel is, as I've said, deliberately old-fashioned. The characters, particularly Judge Holden, speak in convincingly 19th century diction. Even the introductory titles before each chapter are like those found in old novels likeMoby-Dick or, The Whale (Penguin Classics), an obvious influence on McCarthy. The story that Judge Holden tells in chapter XI is in intentionally scriptural language (\\"One day a certain man...\\") and is almost an inversion of a New Testament parable. Holden's parable is an explanation for how evil is created in men, and appears almost a justification for it. (But the ex-priest Tobin warns The Kid more than once that Holden is a liar.) It's as if McCarthy is a bard, and \\"Blood Meridian is a horrifying, beautiful epic poem like \\"The Odyssey\\" or even the Old Testament. Only here God only shows himself fleetingly; in McCarthy's Old West the devil is in command. The sliver of hope that is found in the novel is cast in sharp contrast to the fiendish workings of \\"Manifest Destiny\\" as McCarthy's historical novel unfolds.The Modern Library edition includes critic Harold Bloom's excellent essay on the novel as an introduction. It clears up a lot of things. Something else that helped me finally get through \\"Blood Meridian\\" is the recently released unabridged Recorded Books audio edition, memorably performed by actor Richard Poe. Hearing aloud McCarthy's rhapsodic, harrowing prose helped tremendously with my understanding of the text. The audiobook can be found at many local libraries, or can be legally downloaded at several libraries on the internet. It's well worth seeking out in addition to the actual printed book. I'm glad I finally completed \\"Blood Meridian\\". It's a scarifying, weirdly beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" has won the Pulitzer prize -- deservedly so; it's a great novel. But \\"Blood Meridian\\" is better. It is one of the most harrowing reads I have come across. Based loosely on a real gang in northern Mexico and the southwestern US (to be, since they weren't yet states), \\"Blood Meridian\\" revolves about two characters -- \\"the kid\\" and \\"the Judge\\" -- much as \\"The Road\\" revolves about the boy and his father (\\"the kid\\" and \\"the guardian\\"?)The West portrayed by McCarthy has not one hint of the romance or glamor or guts of any John Ford or Zane Grey western. It is brutal. It is not a post-apocalyptic world. We the readers are not insulated by imaginary time. It is not at all difficult to believe that something like the events described did occur.McCarthy's writing is extraordinary, capturing moments of sublime beauty and awful depravity (like the films of Terrence Mallick or David Lynch).This edition is also very nice with a very interesting introduction by Harold Bloom. Whatever your take his general thinking, his essay is good.My one gripe about the Modern Library editions in general is that the trim size is small and the paper is of too light a stock. All-in-all the books could have a greater heft. I have the impression that the publishers, though using archival papers, are largely stuck in a book design of decades past."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Much is made about the violence of this book, and with good reason. McCarthy draws an allegory to the birth of modern America (and, by extension, the modern world). And births are violent business. The grotesque savagery of this book is often too much to bear, but it is rarely sensational or unnecessary.McCarthy's writing is the real star, though. He uses a neo-biblical style that never descends into pretention or foolishness. It captures the apocalyptic happenings perfectly.And then there is the Judge. A cinematic Ahab, he is the black heart of the Enlightenment unleashed. He is unforgettable. Overall, a great achievement and a great book, for the right person."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Although this is a very graphic novel.

The prose soars even as the story descends into madness. This is possibly the darkest of all McCarthy&#8217;s novels. Based on a true event, it tells of the tale of a troop of soldiers of fortune in 1840 Mexico brought together to slaughter every Apache they can find. They are like Joshua at Jericho. they slaughter everyone and everything.The leader of these mercenaries is &#8220;the judge&#8221; a satanic incarnation. The narrator is a 14 year boy who is enlisted for the cause.I include one quote &#8220;It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be.

Every sentence, all the diction, the pacing, the themes, all balanced themselves into a perfect narrative of despairing Western lore and humanity's archaic purposes. The images McCarthy creates are so vivid and heart searing that after having read the books several years ago, the scenes linger in my imagination and I find myself thinking about them occasionally out of the blue. I wonder about the judge and the little boy he takes in for a day - and what that boy must have thought the next morning when the judge placed his hands over the boy's ears, I think of the desert landscapes and how the light might have cursed it and the darkness damned it.

He ends up joining a group of roughnecks who are paid for every Apache scalp they collect. The men roam the desolate West on horseback, killing not only Apaches but also entire villages full of peaceful people and anyone else they happen to meet in their travels. The men witness horror and brutality, cause their fair share of it, and are alternately treated as heroes and villains. The figure looming large in their group is a man known as the Judge, a large and hairless man, often naked, who seems to have the mind of a genius. He is brilliant in everything he does, and he explains that life is all about war. This dangerous man seems to have a connection with the kid, who can't get away from him for long.The landscapes in this book were beautifully written and realistic. I could imagine the distance, the space between water sources, and the loneliness of life so far away from society.For a book with such an interesting storyline, though, I found this book tedious. The brutality, instead of being shocking, became so normal and all-encompassing that it grew dull and meaningless. The characters traveled from place to place without changing, without growing. I couldn't care about them enough to become immersed in their story."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I am puzzled by the posters who have had a hard time reading Blood Meridian - the prose is flawless and without peer, among living writers anyway. Save for the violence, which is remorseless (and necessary as well as key to the theme) I'd handily recommend this book to readers 12 and above.I also find accusations of pretentiousness difficult to understand, though it's worth noting that some of the reviewers who accuse McCarthy of pretention also claim that Faulkner and Melville are over-rated. Um...kinda makes you wonder if these folks should be reviewing books, doesn't it?Anyway, all that is by the by. Read Blood Meridian if you haven't. Read it for the iconic characters. Read it for the stunning and gorgeous prose and yes, those tricky polysyllabic words. See the underpinnings of our world's current situation summed up in the final paragraph of the last chapter.Oh, and All the Pretty Horses ain't too shabby either."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I read Blood Meridian after having finished the Border Trilogy, which was probably a mistake. In the Border Trilogy, McCarthy is all about nuanced characters. All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain are modern cowboy stories: raw, vivid, visceral, without gratuitous bloodletting.Blood Meridian, while a fascinating book, betrays the true quality of McCarthy's inspired prose. He pours so much blood on his characters, while smashing their heads in and killing babies and drowning puppies etc., that we are quickly desensitized and expect any of the characters to die soon enough, or be maimed, or slaughter a family of pilgrims, and are almost happy when they do so. The world that McCarthy describes is horrid, awful, a place no one would ever want to go. The chances of survival slim.But still, there's something appealing about the Kid, the teenage Tennessean who roams the west, often with the Judge, in my eyes a nod to Conrad's madman in Heart of Darkness, or Apocalypse Now for the modern generation. The Kid comes from a bad family, not Jerry Springer bad, but better-get-out-before-you're-killed bad. He rides through the west with the Judge, a sinister character, the devil on earth. The Judge's army needs him to survive, but why they want to live in that existence is anyone's guess.The ending of Blood Meridian is as fine and as frightening as you'll find in literature. Stephen King, not even close. A truly chilling book."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I was enticed to read McCarthy's &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; after listening to Professor Harold Bloom expound on the merits of the book on a recent edition of C-Span's &quot;Booknotes&quot;. Bloom's praise of McCarthy and the novel were both effusive and well deserved. After finishing the tale,it seemed to me that the author's work should be viewed on two separate levels.First,the grotesque violence and the ceaseless,utter depravity will likely forever change your outlook of that time and place in history and perhaps of human nature as well. But on a larger scale,there is a deeper message.We see in Judge Holden,a creature of pure malevolence,the embodiment of evil incarnate.But,particularly in the final chapter, McCarthy opens our eyes to the fact that this evil,metaphorically expressed in the character of the Judge,vanquishes everything in its path and is in the end,all powerful,omnipotent,and eternal."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy, through a grotesque and often brutal narrative, presents the reader with a view of history that many Americans would like to forget: i.e.the systematic slaughter of Native Americans and the destruction of their culture. Based on historic evidence and newspaper reports of the time the novel follows the life of a nameless frontiersman as he travels West in search of the American dream.What he finds, however, is a dream soaked in blood senseless violence. Over the course of the novel the nameless traveler embarks on a filibustering expedition into Mexico, encounters and joins a ruthless band of bounty hunters, and struggles for survival against the forces of man and nature alike. Wandering the great expanses of the southwest, through the eyes of this child of god, McCarthy draws an indelible portrait of human degeneracy and the exercise of regenerative violence.The terrifying vision of the past invoked in this novel requires the reader to reassess their understanding of America, and the way in which it came into being. Although this book contains many violent scenes of the most grotesque and graphic nature, through his amazing use of language and imagery McCarthy uses them as a means of exploring the ways in which historical texts are constructed. This work is a monumental achievement that through the melding of fact and fiction allow us access to a truth that somehow transcends history and takes us to a place where word, image, memory and flesh are pushed to the limits in a way that no reader will ever be able to forget."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCormack's unique style of writing once again captivates in Blood Meridian, with sculpted landscapes, mesmerising dialogues, and portrayals of violence that are disturbingly perceptive. Spinning a web between two disparate characters, the youthful Kid and the diabolical Judge, one is swept away on a most disturbing journey of the deepest senses. As several of his books, the mythology of the wild west is given a twist, unravelling the spin that has formed our perception of this part of American history, exposing it as it really was. The savage events that dominated the growth of the new nation are bared in chilling detail, uncomfortably lyrical in a language as of song. But it strikes an even deeper core, timeless beyond the historical time frame of the western expansion in America, equally relevant today as in any other time, relevant far beyond the geography of America's west. The elements of human nature are exposed as the quest for power and its abomination into brutality culminates in the peaks of violence - the meridians of blood. McCormack's writing, singular and unique as no other, as full of emotion as it is sparse in punctuation, stimulating and illuminating in clarity of thought, effortlessly breaking the mould of conventional form and grammar, and ultimately striking a chord deep within, that normally is touched only through poetry. And what most would not dare admit, a chord as relevant today as it was in the days of the wild west. My admiration for McCormack's writing, driven both by emotion and intellect, is complete - the man is a true master, this book a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Reading Blood Meridian, I felt like I was rediscovering what it must have been like to read Homer for the Greeks. The prose is so spare and raw -- and unwieldy (that is not a complaint, though some have complained about it in other reviews; if you want pretty prose don't read McCarthy) -- and has precisely what appeals in Homer: the feel that these men, almost gods in their inexplicable resoluteness combined with an uncanny ability to survive the harshest conditions, are nevertheless all too human. It is significant that this novel was written after WWII, after the Korean war, after the Holocaust. This is what sets it apart from the classical Western film -- even the disillusioned Western as represented in revisionist films like the Unforgiven (which hasn't really absorbed the global lessons of these events). We can no longer believe, if we ever could, that we are on an inexorable path towards greater civilization, greater freedom, greater justice. We can't really say that as a world we are beyond the age of Homer. Especially when the dominant powers are held in check by roving bands of terrorists, and when the dominant powers find themselves forced or enabled to operate in the same mode as terrorists -- and to collaborate with the meanest sort of folk, not so different from the mercenary gang led by Glanton and the Judge in this novel.The difference between ours and the Homeric age is that for the Greeks war was glory and we like to pretend it is merely an inescapable evil. But that is really what the novel is about: our modern ambivalence regarding the thesis that war and violence are part and parcel of the human condition. The kid represents that ambivalence: yes, he is violent, but what is at stake in the novel is whether he can be violent without accepting the thesis that man is essentially violent and that there is no justice apart from what is established by the sword.This is, of course, the issue of our age: can we claim that what we are really about (I speak as a United States citizen) is freedom and justice and human rights, when we go to war on false pretenses, when we torture our enemies in the name of justice and then cover up the truth? Can we stand by and watch -- even with a little pride that we are on the winning side at least? Blood Meridian, for asking us to face such questions, is as timely now as it ever was. Beyond that, it was for me a revelation, that got me started reading contemporary American fiction again after I'd largely given it up for philosophy and the classics (and film)."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I had heard of neither Cormac McCarthy nor Blood Meridian before a few weeks ago, when I suddenly read about it everywhere I turned. After seeing the novel mentioned probably a half-dozen different places in about two days, I decided I should investigate.The novel ostensibly deals with \\"the kid,\\" a teenaged boy from Tennessee who runs away to Texas and becomes entangled with a group of ruthless scalp hunters. I say \\"ostensibly,\\" because the greater part of the novel uses the kid as a point of view to observe two other major characters, Glanton and the Judge. These two--as well as several others, including an earless hooligan and a former priest--are fascinating characters, well worth the time to investigate.Readers with weak stomachs should beware. This book, while not exceptionally graphic (at least not to me), deals with extreme violence in a very matter-of-fact manner. My toned-down explanations of what the novel was about set my relatives' stomachs turning. There are also exceptionally dark overtones to everything that happens in the story which may disturb some readers.For those strong enough to handle the gore, Blood Meridian can be a rewarding read if you stick with it. At times I wondered what the point of the whole thing was, and considered dropping it to read something else. But I finished it, and in the last third or fourth of the book a very strong plot develops from the seeming mess that goes before, and some sense of purpose is found in the closing chapters.Blood Meridian reminded me of a Sergio Leone film, with perhaps a mild pinch of Stephen King thrown in--a bleak, hopeless landscape peopled with unlikable people and dotted with violent outbursts. The writing is bold and vivid, every sentence strongly constructed and hard-edged.Now for the negatives: Blood Meridian shows a good writer at work, no doubt. But the style he affects to tell his story damages the readability and, I think the overall effectiveness of the story. Stylistically, it reminded me of Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain, but with Frazier's precision and clarity smudged. I found it difficult to tell some characters apart--I didn't know the Glanton and the Judge were different people until about fifty pages in--and the scalp-hunting party is never detailed, so new characters appear from seemingly nowhere (usually to die a grisly death soon afterward, like the Red Shirts in cowboy boots).McCarthy also shows a typically modern disdain for writing conventions--punctuation is irregular and quotation marks and, often, dialogue tags are nonexistent. The result lets the reader know immediately that he is reading [drumroll] LITERATURE, but comes across as pretentious. This is not exclusive to McCarthy by any means (the aforementioned Frazier drops quotation marks in Cold Mountain), but is an annoyingly conventional defiance of convention that adds nothing to the quality of the novel. The lack of quotation marks and dialogue tags, while not a major issue, made dialogue among multiple characters unnecessarily confusing at times.I've dwelt on a lot of negatives for the last few paragraphs, but overall I liked and enjoyed the book. It can be difficult reading at times, even for an experienced bibliophile like myself, but offers a fascinating look at some really strange, disturbing characters.Recommended."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This year I read Cormac McCarthy for the first time -- Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men.

Certainly, McCarthy has tremendous gifts as a writer.But the relentlessness of the violence does not make it more powerful -- it makes it monotonous. It's like listening to a Eddie Van Halen guitar solo for 7 hours. At times, McCarthy just seems to be trying to outdo whatever grotesque murder / dismemberment scene he came up with 10 pages before. I respect the technical virtuosity, but the book is inherently tedious.Clearly, this book has many passionate adherents. You may become one of them. For everyone else, this book is totally skippable."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I have read McCarthy's Pretty Horses trilogy, as well as \\"The Road,\\" so I am aware of the author's dark and brooding imagery, but this book was just too much. Not only did I dislike all of the characters, but McCarthy seems bent on one-upping himself with the gore on almost every page. It got to the point where I just couldn't wait for the book to be over anymore, I didn't want to read about more brains flying everywhere and people's heads being crushed open. At the end, I couldn't tell what McCarthy wanted to say with this book, other than that evil exists and that he successfully managed to gross me out on the way.I'm not sure if this is an earlier work of his, but the prose is different from the other books I've read. Much more descriptive and filled with symbolism, it has a kind of sermon-ish doom-and-gloom style to it.If you're a die-hard fan or a careful, intellectual reader who likes to go in-depth and look at the hidden meaning of all the imagery and words, then you will get something out of this book.

I am remiss for not reading many American writers since Faulkner, Hemingway and O'Neill.I also learned that a little McCarthy goes a long way. I spent a sleepless weekend reading \\"Blood Meridian,\\" and felt like I had a hangover afterward. (Not that that's unusual) . I understand why Harold Bloom writes in his introduction to the Modern Library Edition that he had several false starts with this difficult, challenging, mind-bending book.Others have done excellent plot summaries and reviews...so I'll stick with impressions. The first is visual; I'm reminded of Fellini, Sam Peckinpah, and Hieronymus Bosch. You could add Rainer Fassbinder for the sexual overtones and S&M.; His images are haunted and haunting: blood-smeared Indians rolling in gore after a massacre; a tree festooned with dead babies; the decapitated head of the Captain of the mercenaries displayed at a village fair. After a few hundred deaths and dismemberments, the shock effect becomes numbing, and we become inured to the violence - which may be the whole point.Character development, assuming the characters live long enough to develop, is limited, largely because the dialogue is so sparse. Like \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" which was successfully adapted to film, most of the characters speak in monosyllables. \\"The Kid\\", the anti-hero/protagonist, is amoral, illiterate, and inarticulate.The Judge... an obese, albino egoist, the likes of whom we have seldom encountered before (except, maybe, for Falstaff) is an enigma. Maybe he is the Ultimate Judge.I greatly admire Mr McCarthy's gift for language. I have less praise for his ability as a novelist. This would have made a great short story or movie screenplay.

Also, a caveat: keep a dictionary nearby.Wonderful, a must read!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Just finished this a few minutes ago and want to commit my thoughts to a public forum. For people who have finished the book only.The judge, while smart and slick, makes some specious arguments. For instance, there cannot be life on other planets because the universe is not constrained to repeat itself, or so the judge argues. But in fact the universe does repeat itself over and over again. Take homology, which is the similarity of structures in animals of shared ancestry. We can see in a horse a leg structured like our own. And the same elements that constitute life on earth constitute the structure of all the universe. In addition, the judge seems to believe in phrenology, widely discredited.All of which points to the judge being less a force of nature or the personification of war and more a man defined by his era. And yet the judge doesn't seem to age and says he can't be killed and can heft a cannon like a gun and even a sloppy reader could see the character drips with symbolism.To me, this is why this is a novel. That ambiguity between moral arguments and story is something you could not do in other mediums. The judge is both a fictional character and a device to make arguments about our inimical nature. But what are those arguments?It seems to be that the natural state of men is to be at war. War is inherent in our nature. Our academic pursuits are just our desire to conquer and control each other in other guises. It's an interesting idea McCarthy advances with a seemingly endless parade of horribles, like Apaches raping dying westerners or Delaware indians slamming babies against rocks. Our essential drive is to subjugate other men. I liked the moment at the end when the expriest and the kids are rescued by Indians. It was McCarthy acknowledging compassion as a counterweight.The book isn't only about our violent nature or need to dominate. It's also an evocative and unromantic description of life on the prairie. At times I felt his language was overly florid and mix his metaphors, like when he talks about the cotton eye of the moon squating in the throat of a mountain. And for all his rep as a minimalist he has a tendency to overuse modifiers like \\"mad\\" and \\"terrible\\". For the most part, though, his style is impressive; his skill with language makes you feel like you're reading a real living master. It's one thing to come up with a clever metaphor, but it's another to consistently use language that serves the spare affect of your book the same way a cinematographer serves a movie with a tailored visual style.Reading this book was an experience, like reading Grave's Claudius books or Updike's Rabbit books. I haven't decided if I will go on to Bolano's 2666 or the second book in Samuel Delany's Neveryona series. The world is a rich place."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Incredible craft and how the author managed to sustain the blood and violence and yet move the story toward a conclusion was amazing. However, there is talk Fields is going to attempt a film version and I doubt he will be able to stay close to the plot since there is so much going on. It would take a ten hour film to complete the novel's film version. Read for the craft and language. The plot is the craft."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"How is it possible that this, one of the greatest American novels of the last few decades, is not available for the Kindle?Can someone please remedy this? Of McCarthy's novels, only \\"The Road\\" and \\"No Country for Old Men\\" are in Kindle format. Very odd. I know, those two had movies made recently. Still, this is a surprising gap in the Kindle offerings."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Having watched a few interviews with Cormac Mccarthy, I am convinced that this guy believes in the propaganda about himself. He throws metaphors on top of his similes on top of his zig zagging, broken paragraphs. All that aside, this book really grabs you. The picture it paints may be brutal, but the colors are so beautiful you may not care. The vanity in Blood Meridian seems largely missing from his later work."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"There's not much to say here that hasn't been said. This book is extremely violent. The vocabulary is at times obscure. The characters don't live happily ever after.With that being said, this book is phenomenal.The writing is brilliant. The story is brilliant. My one piece of advice would be to not pick this book up unless you are willing to invest your time and energy into it. I would also recommend reading it more than once. After my 4th reading, I'm still learning to appreciate and piece together all of the themes that are woven throughout this book. I've read that McCarthy read hundreds of books in preparation for writing Blood Meridian, and in reading it, you can tell."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"There is no doubt that McCarthy can write in a truly exceptional manner; it's no wonder \\"The Road\\" won the Pulitzer Prize. Both these books shine with McCarthy's beautiful manner of putting words together; I would often re-read paragraphs just to soak in how expertly McCarthy created a one-of-a-kind description of an event or a nature scene.That said, I also find him very hard to read, and BM is no exception. McCarthy's trademark is his lack of punctuation and run-on sentences. Sometimes it took me a few heartbeats to figure out who was talking to whom; there is also his annoying habit of making an entire paragraph consist of one sentence, plagued with numerous \\"ands.\\" Any English comp teacher would have a fit!Mostly, it becomes the question of \\"you either get it, or you don't.\\" In the case of this book, I don't. I enjoyed reading it, but I find it interesting and humorous that at least two books have been published on how to read this book! I'm a professional non-fiction writer and when I read for fun, I don't want to work at it too hard! The ending made me mad, for it explained nothing. Who was the Judge, anyway? Why did he seem to run around naked a lot? What was his interest in the Kid? And what the heck happened between the two of them at the end?I like a fiction book that makes me think, but doesn't make me struggle to get the point, if there is one. I'll read more McCarthy, even though he STILL doesn't use punctuation!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I really didn't want to read this book. I knew that I would be subjected to gruesome senseless violence on at least every other page, whether it advanced the plot or not. BUT my students insisted, AND I respect my students, so I persevered. I am glad I did. While the violence, gore, and sadism is much as I expected, what I did NOT expect was the author's amazing ability to capture the landscape of the desert in such spare beauty. Over and over I found myself marvelling at scenes that I knew I would treasure for years to come. After a while even the violence began to make a degrfee of \\"sense\\" in relation to the flow of the book, and I began to see the multiple layers that McCarthy is reaching for in an understanding of the human psyche. While the ending is deliberately ambiguous, my students and I did not in any way feel cheated, and all of us agreed that this was \\"time well spent\\""},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Wow what a story at times this was really hard for me to read as some of the language is tricky, but man is it a great story.

Now, after reading this and the road im totally a fan."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"What can one say? The best American novel of the1980s. Violent, epic and hilariously funny McCarthy subverts and scares like no other writer in the country. One page of Blood Meridian is worth a whole forest of Stephen King."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Unbelievable in all respects. This book offers a Greek tragedy rendering of the usually jingoistic and romantically blinkered historical telling of the American West. The punishing precision of the writing is worthy of marvel and the story line resonates with the perpetual folly of man's vanity in the face of Earth's bounty. Nothing less than a complete and profound annihilation of Manifest Destiny and the primal, violent stupidities it engrained into American life. Should be required reading for all grade school students. Too bad Ronald Reagan was too busy reading Louis L'Amour"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Reading through reviews of Blood Meridian, it seems apparent that McCarthy is one of those novelists that elicits strong opinions. Those that love McCarthy compare this work to the best of Melville and Faulkner, which is excessive, while those that revile him label him a hack who masks his lack of talent with violence and machismo, which is excessive as well. Prior to reading Blood Meridian, I would have fallen into the latter group, but the book has changed my mind on McCarthy, at least in part. I first picked up McCarthy in 1992, when someone gave me All the Pretty Horses, a book that I consider highly undeserving of the National Book Award. Thinking that perhaps I simply missed something, I read The Crossing, which reaffirmed my dislike for McCarthy. I then read an article by the critic Harold Bloom, which called Blood Meridian the greatest American novel by an author still living, and I decided to give McCarthy one last chance. Suffice it to say that I finally understand the hype surrounding McCarthy. Blood Meridian is not an easy read, owing to its language, but once the reader gets past that, it develops a good rhythm. The characters of The Kid and the Judge are almost mythical, and have to be experienced, and the violent setting of the novel is outstandingly presented. While the novel is not without its flaws, (a few events are repetitive and McCarthy supplies some unintentionally laughable moments when, unable to control himself, he becomes overly poetic) Blood Meridian is an epic, ambitious work that hits more than it misses. There are few good westerns being written today, and even fewer with literary merit, but Blood Meridian is exceptional. It is an outstanding novel that can be enjoyed even by those of us who have few kind words for McCarthy's body of work."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"One of my favorite books, having read this over 12 years ago, I still reflect on parts of it. One of the few books I consider X-rated, and graffic. Be warned, reading this book is like pealing over your skin and peering at the gobbelty-gook inside. Horrific."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy has written one of the most compelling fictional tale with \\"Blood Meridian\\", which left me as a reader like I had been torn apart, much like what happens to some people in the novel. The prose and structure are a cut above anything else I have ever read regarding the subject matter or fiction in general. Perhaps it is the rather dismal, doomsday style approach that makes you realize this macabre Western Frontier as McCarthy views it.The novel follows the journey of several people, but the main one is a teenager who is traveling west. The country is literally smoking from Civil War, and the landscape is full of outlaws, lawmen who might as well be outlaws, scoundrels, bandits, Indians and rogue soldiers. The description of the boy and his journey is a sickening one, filled with a realism of sorts that a reader could perhaps identify.This WAS the old \\"Wild West\\" in many ways, and McCarthy gathers up every terrible thing he can think of and plops it all into this novel. Scenes of Fire, stampedes and gunfights abound, but are told in a somber and matter of fact way that for some reason makes them all the more realistic. McCarthy is able to bring out a strong visual while heavily using the plot as a vehicle for the evils of mankind in a yet untamed land. Characters like \\"The Judge\\" as well as the \\"kid\\" are but a couple of an entire handful of interesting people that make this ghastly story one to remember."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Read this book for the prose alone. Yes, it is violent, Sure, it is saying something about the birthing of America (although too much is made of that on book jackets and reviews). Ultimately, Mccarthy writes in as precise a prose as I have read."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This western is just different from any other, because it is so apocolyptic for lack of a better word. These characters are riding to the seemy ends of the earth where only savages and the macabre can exist, and to the people that were there, that must be what it felt like. The beauty of it is that the author never once imposes his character's feelings on you, just the sheer weight of his descriptiveness puts you there.The most amazing thing about this book, as that while the details are fictionalized, the amount of violence that these men wrought is probably not exaggerated, and only an almost surreal approach to the violence like this could do it justice. But the book isn't like other westerns where the violence is made to be cool or stylish. Somehow the author mananaged to drench almost every page in blood, guts, and grime, without becoming gratuitous... and its sad, its just a very sad book about a forgotten, dark corner of history. I don't think I've ever felt so empty after reading any other book. It'll shake your faith in humanity, if you had any to begin with."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This work is absolutely astounding. From the gritty, raw-boned characters to the wasteland vistas, the book pulls the reader in and keeps you there. Outstanding historical depiction of the Texas/Mexico setting in the 1850's."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Read this book only if you are willing to spend the time with it that it deserves. The story itself isn't complicated, there aren't many characters to memorize, and yet it took me a very long time to read. There were times that I literally re-read pages or paragraphs half a dozen times before continuing, it's just that beautifully written. Brief, simple, intriguing dialogue mixed with sometimes long flowing environmental descriptions, but you never have the feeling that any of it is overdone or over-dramatized. There is almost a biblical or mythological feel to his style that is very engaging. The story is rather dark, and has a few disturbing things to say about evolution and human nature - reading it is sort of like watching a nuclear explosion - fascinating and beautiful in it's own terrible way. This book is a classic."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Feeling like a challenging and mind boggling novel - or an Odyssey is more like it? Try Cormac McCarthy's BLOOD MERIDIAN -- Or the Evening Redness in the West. Finished it yesterday a in shutter. Nothing like it. Deliberately archaic language, among other conceits. Gigantic myths come to life. One protagonist, perhaps the God of War, certainly a \\"warlord,\\" named Judge Holden, seems singular in American literature - our Iago, and kin to Milton's Satan: you cannot resist him. He is immortal.Harold Bloom says this book is the heir (and fulfills the promise to American Literature) of Melville and Faulkner and Lowry. It is also feels like King Lear and Dante and many other unforgettable works.It seems to me, moreover, especially IMPORTANT now (written in 1985) because the setting is a parched desert and mountain land of chaos, starvation, ignorance, anarchy, tribal and racial hatred, and literally unspeakable and unholy violence - exactly like Afghanistan today, but this is America on the Texas-Mexico border in 1850, and based on facts and real characters: a gang run amuck. But this ain't no \\"western,\\" pardner! Finally, as a \\"visual performance\\" the book's imagery is among the most vivid I can recall, and certainly the most economical: as in the sharpest poetry. Not a cliche anywhere. A book so terrific, and so apocalyptic, it may make much other fiction one reads seem like pulp junk for some time to come. The risk of exposure to the best!"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This book proved to me once and for all that reincarnation does exist. Herman Melville is alive and still writing as Cormac McCarthy. I don't know where to begin, except to say; I started over again at chapter one last night. McCarthy is able to weave a tapestry of unforgettable characters who move dream like through a surreal world of violence and horror which left me disturbed and wantng more at the same time. The people in this book are so real, their images were painted in my imagination by the words they speak and the all too brief sketching of their physical attributes put forth by McCarthy. I kept putting this book down, but had to pick it right back up to be sure I'd just read what I'd read. I don't want to give any of the story away, but the adventures of the main character brought tears to my eyes mixed with a sense of revulsion and envy. If you're a Melville fan and are unaware of Cormac McCarthy; you must read this book. Even if you're not, read it. You won'! ! t soon forget it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"At first glance, the average reader would not be interested in picking up this novel. It contains little of the dramatic conventions common to books of our era. The main characters do not have names, the motivations are often unclear and complicated, and the judge has a stronger grasp of rhetoric than even the reader. Its pages, seemingly laced with blood and pointless racist slaughter, bring about the timeless struggle of every serious reader: to read critically and thoroughly. At the end, to truly read this novel one must be able to think like Stephen Hawking while fighting like John Wayne.The major obstacle of this novel is the ability to think in abstract terms. It is almost a new language for those readers, including myself, unused to reading beyond a dramatic level. We are challenged in this book to examine the dramatic conventions and decisions as part of and taking the back seat to the thematic concerns of Cormac McCarthy. Each decision made in this book is not just a way to get to Mexico; it is one of the intricate puzzle pieces of McCarthy's world. The discussion of the nature of man on page 19 makes no sense until the last page (and even then it is still worrisome) and the constant religious references plague any reader that is conscientious enough to catch them. They will only fit into an abstract reading. But this abstraction is quite difficult to arrive at without an English professor or the knowledge of historical events and philosophies such as Manifest Destiny, none of which McCarthy gives us.These difficult abstractions are, however, couched in some of the most poetic and lyrical language written in recent years. The lines read as though taken from \\"Thanatopsis\\" or \\"The Tell-Tale Heart.\\" The pure, flowing prose contains a beauty that the brutal subject matter lacks and is one of the best features of this novel. Even if the subject matter had been baked beans, McCarthy's prose would have been, as always, brilliant and reason enough to read at least a little of the passage.McCarthy, a critical favorite for his Border trilogy and winner of the National Book Award for All the Pretty Horses, received much condemnation for his use of violence, death, and brutality, including a \\"baby tree,\\" ... of young children, and the flaying of Indian tribes. Within the first few chapters, it is obvious that McCarthy is a rated \\"R\\" author. The amount and vivid description of violent acts was one of the things that turned me away from this book initially and a part that I skimmed rather than read. The violence is a necessary part of the historical accuracy and themes of the novel, but is hard to endure dramatically.However, even without the possibility of compassion, the story still rings true. Hope for the future certainly is not present in Glanton or the judge or any member of the gang. This seeming utter lack of hope in the story will keep Blood Meridian from being an ... Book of the Month or from gracing the top of the \\"New York Times\\" best-seller list, but anything else would be untrue to the author's view of the world. McCarthy refuses to tell the reader what they want to hear because the world, his world, is just not that simple. The world that McCarthy wants to present is harsh, one that can hardly be seen as a good place. Yet, the novel must have some sort of redemption from the wasteland of pessimism. This redemption is the very fact that the story is being told. These deaths and activities are not buried in the ignorance of future generations. McCarthy, despite the fact that there was little hope in world of which he writes, at least memorializes its tragedies. The true lie would be to erase the sufferings in a rewritten, happily-ever-after, Disney ending. Though the feeling and conclusions follow a clearly marked path and seem quite true according to the author's perception of the world, the overall tone and conclusion of the piece was, in my opinion, a bit too dark and too brutal in its assessment of the human condition. While I think a happy story would be inaccurate, I think that McCarthy is wrong in his creation of a harsh, almost totally unfeeling world.Though I am certainly no Stephen Hawking and would never want to be John Wayne, I have had my own valiant struggles to understand Cormac McCarthy's vision of the world and the choices he made in shaping it. With its abstractions, heavy subject matter and frequent use of violence, this is not an airport-read or a book for a Saturday afternoon, but if the reader is willing to work as hard as McCarthy has in writing Blood Meridian, the reward will be a dark and lyrical voyage into the truth of the Old West legend and the rawness of humanity."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"And certainly in the running for THE greatest of recent history.How does one describe this book? Is it Shakesperian tragedy as directed by Sergio Leone? Is it Dante's Inferno located in the desolate west? Is it Melville in the boarderlands of 1840?It seems impossible to describe without reference to these other masters. Howard Bloom describes Judge Holden as perhaps the greatest villain in american literature and as sharing much with Shakespeare's Iago. I'm inclined to agree, though Holden seems to transcend the idea of a \\"villain.\\" Even in his utter cruelty, the reader roots for him... or perhaps less roots FOR him as observes him in awe like some unfathomable God whose every action confuses.The prose is, as many have said, Biblical in its tone and feeling (and also, as again many have said, Melvillian, Faulknerian and Shakesperian). Observe:\\"A man's at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it. You believe that?I dont know.Believe that.\\"A brillant book that demands to be read. A central part of the American canon. Believe that."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"At the beginning of BLOOD MERIDIAN a fourteen-year-old boy runs away from his home in Tennessee, circa 1840s after the Mexican-American War. \\"The Kid,\\" as McCarthy calls him, wanders south to Texas where he meets a man known as \\"The Judge\\" at a tent meeting. The Judge is a peculiar looking man, over seven feet tall without a stitch of hair on his body. The Judge proceeds to slander the Reverend preaching at the revival. The Reverend tries to fight back, calling The Judge the devil. Later, after general pandemonium, The Judge admits he's never met the Reverend before in his life.After a fracas in a bar the kid joins an army led by a man named Captain White, whose goal is to subjugate Mexico. On their way into Mexico, White's army is attacked by Indians. The Indian attack is a horrific tour de force of description. White's army is wiped out, The Kid being one of the few survivors.Eventually, after numerous adventures, The Kid joins a group of scalphunters led by a homicidal killer named Glanton. His right hand man just happens to be, you guessed it, The Judge. They go on to scalp whole tribes of Indians and Mexicans. One note of irony is when the scalps are hung on the facade of a Catholic church.The Judge is a fascinating character. He carries a little notebook in which he sketches pictographs they find in the desert. He has a seemingly insatiable desire for knowledge. After an attack on an Indian village, he rescues a little child whom he seems to want as a pet. The rest of the men play with the child and make it laugh; these men seem to have a smidgeon of humanity after all. But then The Judge scalps the little boy. Later, the Apaches corner the scalphunters who are almost out of ammunition. Using bat guano and other accessible materials The Judge makes ammunition for their rifles and the scalphunters are able to ward off the Apaches. Is this man really the devil or some sort of warped God?BLOOD MERIDIAN has its tedious moments. At one point McCarthy completely disdains The Kid's viewpoint, resorting to omniscient description. According to one of the blurbs, McCarthy is trying to imitate Biblical prose. He certainly has the vocabulary for it; some of it is downright Shakespearean. But the almost continual slaughter and brutality begin to wear on the reader.In the end you will wonder whether The Kid is meant to be some kind of Everyman, and if the Judge really is a judge or Death come to mine The Kid's soul."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"\\"The thunder moved up from the southwest and lightning lit the desert all about them, blue and barren, great clanging reaches ordered out of the absolute night like some demon kingdom summoned up, the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and livid, like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear.\\"Based on historical sources, written in an Old Testament style all its own, laced with gallows humor, synchronized with stellar and cosmological references, aglow with bright literary references to Melville's MOBY DICK and Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS.

His first major encounter is in the town of Nacogdoches, where the Reverend Green 'has been playing to a full house daily as long as the rain had been falling and the rain had been falling for two weeks.' The kid watches the Reverend preach when 'An enormous man dressed in an oilcloth slicker' enters the tent. The man accuses the Reverend Green of pedophilia and bestiality. The Reverend Green denies the accusations, but the crowd, formerly enjoying his sermon, become hostile. The Reverend Green is killed, as well as many others. The kid escapes to a nearby bar and there, already seated, is the man who made the accusations. The judge. Thus we meet him.McCarthy describes the judge: 'He was bald as a stone and he had no trace of beard and he had no brows to his eyes nor lashes to them. He was close on to seven feet in height and he stood smoking a cigar even in this nomadic house of God...'. Throughout the novel, he is constantly described as hairless, as immensely tall, as huge. In figure and in character, the judge is enigmatic, larger than life, menacing.Later, the kid joins Captain White on a filibustering campaign to hunt Indians. This ill-conceived expedition ends in a massacre, with the kid one of only two survivors. The first of many baptisms of blood in a thoroughly blood-soaked novel. Still later, the kid joins John Joel Glanton's gang of scalp hunters as they scour the fringes of the United States of America and Mexico's joined boundary. Here, he is reunited with the judge.With the primary thrust of the novel in place, Blood Meridian becomes just that - the greatest peak of blood and violence possible. Over and over, violence is thrust upon the reader with no warning, little premeditation on the parts of the characters, and less remorse. As we travel with the kid in Glanton's gang, we become as accustomed and desensitised to violence as any in the group of murderers, rapists and thieves.The violence escalates slowly. Glanton's gang was initially a scalp hunting troupe, under the sanction of the American government in their hunting. But the influence of constant violence - the influence of the judge - shifts the character of these men until any positive qualities are scoured away, and all that remains is violence, blood and war. They become outlaws, men of great violence and little mercy, raping and pillaging their way around Colorado and Mexico. Villages where once they were welcomed with open arms, now barricade themselves in a useless attempt to avoid death.The kid remains that and nothing more. He is not a character, so much as a placeholder for our attention. Because we have been with him since he ran away from home, since the massacre, since the Reverend Green's murder, there is an emotional connection. But what do we know of him? Little. He is comfortable with the line of demarcation that marks life and death - comfortable with shattering it for others. He rides with Glanton, he murders as much as the next man. Perhaps it is his friendship with Toadvine that allows us a hope to his humanity.But the kid is hardly the focus. McCarthy is very shrewd in keeping the judge back until at least two thirds through the novel. Before that, he is a curiosity, an enigma, a shroud accompanying the darkness that is Galton's gang. We hear how every member of the gang has run into the judge before meeting Glanton. We learn that the judge has never changed, and that no man remembers him as any younger, or older, or thinner, or fatter. The judge is seemingly eternal, a constant in the lives of these men of violence.Tobin the ex priest has this to say of the judge: 'That great hairless thing. You wouldn't think to look at him that he could outdance the devil himself now would ye? God the man is a dancer, you'll not take that away from him. And fiddle. He's the greatest fiddler I ever heard and that's an end on it. The greatest. He can cut a trail, shoot a rifle, ride a horse, track a deer. He's been all over the world. Him and the governor they sat up till breakfast and it was Paris this and London that in five languages, you'd have give something to of heard them. The governor's a learned man himself he is, but the judge...' We are presented with another mystery. The judge is something more than a murderer, perhaps something greater?At times throughout the novel, the gang will come across a doctor, or a learned man, or someone with an interesting tale or knowledge. Always, the judge is able to converse with them as though he were an expert on the subject. On any subject. As we read, the question grows within our minds - who is the judge? But then, as the novel continues, the question changes. It becomes - what is the judge?The violence continues. Because we are so 'used' to murder and rape, the stakes are increased. Massacres are committed. The gory details are explicitly described. The judge, during the killing, is known to walk about naked, dancing. The size of the gang dwindles, though the horror increases.McCarthy writes with an archaic hand. Commas are placed sparsely. Dialogue is not marked. Paragraphs and pages are exercises in literary deciphering. We are required to work at this novel. It is not an exaggeration to say that this novel will be too difficult for most people, both due to the extreme violence and the relentless density of the text itself. But the rewards are great. Biblical, historical and mythical references are woven through the text, while at the same time, it seems as though McCarthy is creating a new myth, that of the judge.There is no secret where the focus of the novel lies. The judge is arguably one of the more compelling characters in contemporary literature. It is to McCarthy's credit that he does not seek to describe the judge completely. To do so would be to cheapen his power. The judge is beyond definition, he thrives in the shadows of our almost-understanding. Is the judge violence incarnate? Is he Satan? Is he something greater, or less? We don't know, but nor do we need to. Blood Meridian is a rare novel in that it is relentless and unsparing in its commitment to the message it is delivering. McCarthy never compromises his novel for the sake of the weaker readers, or for an easy way out. He is as hard and unyielding as Glanton and his gang. His vision is that of starkness striped bare, it is darkness. It is that of the decider of man, of men, of violence and of warfare and of our intense search for immortality through the death of others. It is as a judge. The judge."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Bruised, burned and scarred I flipped the final pages of McCarthy's bloody nightmare. Eyes still open because of blood-lust, the text held thick between my ears, opening a passage into imagination I'd never travelled before. Scenes based in a historical land and time that is rarely recorded or taught or imagined in such a vivid, coagulated tale. It is hard to believe that this story was written at all, as it drips through your mind with fantastic prose so acute, you will feel dehydrated and anxious, immersed in what seems a bad dream. McCarthy is a madman loosed amongst unsuspecting readers, twisting their preconceptions, severing their ties to conventional scripture and scalping the western genre of its grayed headtop."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy has been a personal favorite of mine for the past few years. His work in The Road is absolutely breathtaking. I have never been so thrilled to open up a book in my whole life! After reading a few reviews about Blood Meridian I decided to give it a go. I went into the book expecting a great book, and ended it with my eyes wide open and my jaw to the floor. You will not be disappointed. Reading it was something that I looked forward to every day and even something I would dream about. McCarthy has a very unique gift, even among authors. He forces you to give your full attention to the book, he will make you forget time and other daily worries. McCarthy is an exceptional writer and this book underlines that fact even moreso than his other works. Read it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I've just started the process of reading through McCarthy's collection, and it has been a wonderful journey so far. Started with The Road, went on to No Country For Old Men, and then to Blood Meridian. It is a totally different experience, in a good way. It was much less concise, more literary/poetic. It was also VERY violent. To the point where I almost had to put the book aside a couple of times, just because it was overwhelming.McCarthy's descriptive capacity is something to behold. His grasp of the flora and fauna in the Southern US and Mexico almost makes this book encyclopedic. He does truly rival the greats like Faulkner.Reading All the Pretty Horses now, and will review that after."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"To really enjoy Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West, one has to appreciate Cormac McCarthy's rich, detailed prose and unparalleled gift for storytelling. Manifestly brilliant in his ability to paint images that leave the reader alternately shaking his head in awe and cringing in disgust, McCarthy relates a story of unspeakable violence based on Samuel Chamberlain's memoir, My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue, about his experiences riding with a gang of mercenaries under contract to the Mexican government to defeat marauding Apache Indians during the years 1849 to 1850.Included by TIME magazine in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005, Blood Meridian causes even the most hardened readers among us to blanch. Initially detailing the adventures of 'the kid', a wayward runaway from Tennessee already predisposed to violence, through the United States-Mexico borderlands, much of the story centers on the exploits of the Glanton gang, a merciless, scalp-hunting posse of reprobates utterly bereft of morality who eventually trade scalp-hunting for armed robbery, rape and other assorted crimes.In an attempt at portraying cowboys and Indians as they really were, McCarthy depicts his characters as thoroughly testing the limits of depravity.More than merely dispelling any notion that the rough men who traversed an unforgiving Southwestern frontier in the mid-19th century were a virtuous lot, McCarthy treats us to the Glanton boys' steady descent into hell, ably guided by the very embodiment of evil, Judge Holden. A complex, intelligent, Virgil-like character ushering Glanton and his men through their own fiery 'Inferno', Holden is given as much to glib philosophizing while mentoring his young charges as he is to deviance. The Judge finds fertile ground for his evil in John Joel Glanton, and the plot devolves into the gang committing one atrocity after the other. The outcome, though deliberately ambiguous and subject to the reader's interpretation, is the kid growing into a man, apparently still wayward, and finally succumbing to the judge's patient seduction.This novel is not for the faint of heart. Massacres are the order of day as this band of predators, quite skillfully and thoroughly developed as characters through McCarthy's florid imagination, journeys west. We are treated to scenes of abject poverty and despair interspersed with descriptions of the bizarre and the macabre. Indians of every stripe are brutally murdered or left in desperate circumstances, mortally wounded and remaining as carrion to be picked over by vultures in a vast moonscape of desolation. And the Indians, particularly the Apaches, in their vicious raids on frontier settlements, at times leave their victims hanging in trees and eviscerated.In McCarthy's world, violence and conflict are omnipresent, man is inherently evil, and war is inevitable.For all the story's butchery, chaos, and suffering, however, there is no denying the power in McCarthy's writing. Reading any McCarthy novel is an experience, but reading Blood Meridian strains the imagination. One is almost dared to participate in a further assault on his senses and finds many of the sadistic actions of the characters stimulating a visceral response. Ultimately, though, it is the enigmatic ending, Faulknerian prose and the author's uncanny ability to spin a fantastic, yet believable, story of a gang of remorseless sociopaths roaming the plains while leaving a trail of carnage in their wake that are at the core of this writer's genius. And it is the evocative imagery that distinguishes his extraordinary talent.Finally, it is McCarthy's ability to get readers to think on a deeper level, for instance, about the inevitability of war:It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way.Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West is inarguably Cormac McCarthy's defining work.Simply a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Really enjoyed this one, though I have to feel a little guilty for saying so. The scenery itself is like another of the characters, and all characters are harsh, brutal, and real.The pace of the narration does not drag, and though you try not to flinch at the descriptions of horror and blood, flinch you do, and then you can't resist turning the page to see what happens next.Well done."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Be warned that Blood Meridian is a relentlessly blood thirsty and violent work that at times is not so much read as endured.This is not a criticism just an indication of the world that is being painted in blood and pain through various encounters between a group of mercenarys and anyone or anything that they happen to come across. Apparently based on real people and events that occured in the 1850s on the border between The United States and Mexico, the story follows a boy leaving home and becoming a member of this group who earn their keep by killing and scalping indians,not necessarily in that order,as well as anyone else who will pass for an indian.This is no sanitised view of the wild west and reveals man at his most primal and animalistic.Whilst the events are gruesome and detailed they are written with an almost detached and matter of fact style that lends itself to you believing they could actually have happened.Even some of the more surreal moments that I would normaly have thought ridiculous somehow have a feeling of authenticity about them. At times the book seems to descend into a kind of insanity in its convoluted descriptions of places and ideas which is in stark contrast with the simplicy it uses to decribe most of the characters who utter very little dialogue and almost no indication of what is going on inside their head.If you are looking to glimpse the monster that possibly resides in us all then this stark and haunting work stands out as a compelling and brutal journey that will leave its mark on the reader."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Cormac McCarthy has been labeled many things... genius, great American novelist, best living English-language writer, the heir to Faulkner & Hemingway, etc. Likewise, Blood Meridian has been called not only McCarthy's best book, but the best novel of the past 25 years. The best book since 1984! There have been a LOT of great books written since 1984.I won't get into McCarthy's reputation here... this is a book review. Enough people have waxed on the author here as it is. To stay simple:Is Blood Meridian a good book? Absolutely yes.Is it a great book? Yes again.Is it McCarthy's best? Not in my opinion, no.Is it the best novel written since the mid 1980s? Not nearly.Do I recommend it? Yes.This is a historical novel, written about the Glanton Gang of the US-Mexico border in the mid 1800s. McCarthy reportedly learned Spanish in order to read records about the infamous marauders. This is not a surprising claim given the profundity exhibited in the book by McCarthy - Spanish is spoken as often as English in the dialogue, & every element of the landscape is described in technical, sometimes scientific detail. It describes a time & place in America that most of us know nothing about. For that reason alone, I think McCarthy has done a service to us by writing this book & making a piece of our history more accessible.I enjoyed it immensely. McCarthy is one of my favorite writers... the imagery he creates in my mind is unlike what any other novelist can do for me. Why not five stars? Because the subject matter was interesting, but it wasn't compelling for all 300+ pages. The prose itself never falters, no no of course that wouldn't happen with McCarthy. But the 200 middle pages of fighting & going thirsty & finding a town & repeating it all, it just didn't hold me the same way the longer it went. I took a break every chapter to avoid the boredom by the mid 100s. I did NOT feel this way when reading his other books (in my case The Road, No Country, Suttree). I enjoyed everything about the ending a great deal, but I thought, why take so long to get here? What did the length of the journey add to the experience?Many quibbles that people bring up about BM / McCarthy - sparse punctuation, long meandering sentences, the excruciating violence prevalent throughout - are minor in my own evaluation. I do not think that McCarthy writes as \\"someone who considers himself a great writer\\" - I only think that he writes in his own voice. The tone is epic, researched, & objective. Bodies hang from a tree, burned to blackened shells. There is no sorrow, no delight, no philosophical whimsy expressed in the narrative... just an illustration for its own sake. McCarthy will never be accused of being maudlin.Give Blood Meridian a go, it's quite good. If anything it makes a lot of the popular Westerns seem silly by comparison. There's nothing romantic about the bloodthirsty desert of 19th century America."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"McCarthy takes you on trip into the past when human life was easily discarded or snuffed out. It's almost as if he lived during this time of history, his accounts and special added information of this period is amazing.If you are looking for a warm and fuzzy book that puts a smile on your face this is not your book. If you want a shocker that makes you turn page after page with some gore and \\"oh my God!\\" then without hesistation buy this book you won't be disappointed. I read \\"The Road\\" and loved it, this book has the same kinds of strange happenings, that leaves you with a dark feeling. A good example is holding a baby by the ankle and swinging it to smash it's head against a rock. Dark and evil you bet!... but a great read, one that I looked forward to reading each night, then thinking about it the following day until I got time to read more."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I listened to this book on my MMP3 player. It was really well performed, and I loved the book within the first few minutes. That said, I kept wishing that I had the page in front of me. McCarthy's prose is so rich, his neologisms clawed back in my consciousness while the player had moved to the next sentence. I'm listening to it again, and will read on paper in a few months.This is a disturbing, allegorical tale that is not, as one person pointed out, a cowboy tale. The best feature is the prose, the second the imagery, the third, the historical placement. I am trying not to say \\"the plot\\" because the plot is almost irrelevant, and if I liked the plot does that make me an accomplice to the pervasive evil? The allegory is dense and abundant, but not so transparent as to annoy. The kid is the pilgrim, the idiot is.... and the judge... my oh my.Truly one of the best novels of the decade, by an author I am becoming convinced has earned \\"greatest living writer\\".BTW, of McCarthy's other work, This bests \\"Pretty Horses\\" and \\"No Country for Old Men\\". \\"The Road\\", which gets a lot of play these days, is a different and inferior idiom, IMO."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I believe McCarthy to be our greatest American novelist. His lyrical prose is so amazingly descriptive. You can't skip a sentence, & like his other novels, deserves to be read & re-read. Worth reading out loud for the full impact.Based on the true story of the Glanton gang's scalp hunting expedition in Mexico circa 1849-50. Feel free to Google Glanton for more info."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is a book that you have to have a strong stomach to appreciate. It takes some historical facts (William Walker and the Filibusters) and creates a vivid and cruel world. The writing and the plotting are spectacular. If you are uncomfortable without punctuation you may want to give this a pass, though. As with most McCarthy books he plays fast and loose with the language."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I asked for this book, based on the reviews on Amazon.com. I love Western movies, but have never read a Western novel. Was I in for a shock. The plot has been reviewed many times here, but the real basic outline is a fourteen year old boy becomes involved in a ruthless gang of scalphunters, and their ensuing adventures in the American Southwest. As this was my first Cormac McCarthy novel, I was definitely unprepared for his writing style. At first, I found it very difficult to follow, with who was saying what, and from what point of view. However, the more I read,the more I appreciated his style, and the ways events would just \\"sneak\\" up on me. The way the gang would converse, and then all of a sudden babies are hanging from trees, or spiked through the jaws. Western movies have portrayed the Old West as a rough era, but I was amazed that this group of scalphunters actually existed back in the 1850's. Instead of Indians running into settlements and scalping the \\"white man\\", here you have a cross cultural group of Americans who are scalping Indians for profit and sheer terror and delight.The characters in the book were fantastic, and had me fascinated in one moment, and then disgusted in the next sentence. Especially with the character of the Judge, Captain Glanton's second in command. I would have liked to see Glanton last a bit longer in the novel, but his demise was as quick and sudden, as the many deaths that he dished out.I would like to read \\" A Reader's Guide...\\", in a few years, as I know I definitely missed some references by Cormac in the novel. I also have \\"The Road\\" and \\"No Country for Old Men\\" by Cormac also, and look forwards to reading them."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I read this in 2001, at the suggestion of a good friend, and completely enjoyed the book. It's pretty dark, but is a compelling tale of a man's journey in the old west. I especially enjoyed the sinister character that keeps re-appearing and could be more than just a man.. seems like the same character turns up in lots of Cormac McCarthy's books. Overall, I would recommend this book"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This is the third Cormac McCarthy book I've read. I read \\"The Road\\" first, then \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and now this book. It's not an easy read, it does require concentration and there was quite a bit of vocabulary in the book that was new to me as its set in the mid 1800s...but I have to say I loved it. It's of course very violent and a \\"dark\\" story, but I've never read anyone who writes like Cormac McCarthy. You find yourself re-reading passages he's written just because they are so beautifully and poetically crafted. I think he is officially my favorite writer. Definately a good read, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"This was the first Cormac book I have read, I'll be honest I bought it because it was called Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West. At first your reading it and your kind of lost and confused about what exactly is going on, then you realize it is meant to be that way. It's greatness shows with each passing page once you figure out how to decypher Cormac's cryptic writing. It's like reading a puzzle and having all the pieces but only you can place them where they go. You understand the beauty of the novel after you have read a short way in. This novel is not for everyone, you must be ready to travel with these characters as low as they can go and be ready for the worst. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I hope you get to also."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Widely considered to be McCarthy's masterpiece, Blood Meridian explores the same themes which reached a wide audience in his more recent worksThe RoadandNo Country for Old Men (Vintage International), both adapted for the screen in recent years. McCarthy presents a world of chaos, violence, and inhumanity, a bleak landscape peopled by mercenaries, malice, and violence. But just as his desolate vision and descriptions of the horrific violence which characterized the much mythicized \\"Old West\\" are interspersed with expertly rich and poetic language, what at first appears to be a cynical and wholly amoral worldview holds something deeper nestled within.The book follows the fictionalized exploits of the historical Glanton gang, a group of mercenaries hired to kill Apache Indians in Mexico after the Mexican-American wa. Throughout the book stands the enigmatic and frightening character of Judge Holden, who many reviewers see as the personification of evil and perhaps the Devil himself. While the Biblical tone of the book definitely suggests this interpretation, McCarthy is as always saying something about the very real manifestations of evil in a world often viewed through rose-colored glasses. Holden is in fact a typical, if exceptional, psychopath. He is ruthless, remorseless, intelligent and malicious. He is larger than life and embodies the psychopathic worldview. (SeeWithout Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among UsandPolitical Ponerologyfor more on the worldview of the psychopath.)Interestingly, McCarthy associates Holden with science and law. In Holden's hands both become tools of self-glorification bereft of any human feeling, the law simply a means to win, and science a means to conquer nature. But within the Holden-dominated landscape of the West, is the kid. Born under the Leonids, he is the only character with the seeds of a conscience, and even these are hidden and unexpressed in the majority of the book. And as the events build up to the famous ferry massacre, we learn that these very qualities are those which Holden seeks to destroy.Just as in The Road and No Country, McCarthy shows us, in his own inimitable style, the realities of life in this world. The dance of war is recurring, and now, just as then, the philosophy of psychopathy is the dominant ideology. And yet within this reality, conscience still lives. It is fragile, yet it persists. It is often destroyed and defeated, but it is what keeps us together and makes us human in an inhuman world. It is the fire that we hold inside, sheltered against the cold dark of \\"the world inside the devil.\\""},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The amazing thing about Blood Meridian is that seemingly every little question is answered and many of the big ones are not, and I think that's the point. Through all the blood, all the amazing prose, and all the attention to minute details the answers to the bigger questions are notably unstated. If you're looking for a perfectly executed tale wrapped up in a neat little package try another book, but if you want to think and question your ideas about American destiny and the true nature of good and evil look no further. The beautiful imagery and intricate detail of long vanished border villages, their inhabitants, and the battle for survival in a majestically harsh time and place paints a perfect picture to get lost in and try to decide what you're proud of or ashamed of.I disagree with the assertion that you either \\"get it\\" or you don't. We all read books differently and open up a book with different expectations; there's no wrong or right way. However, that also inherently means that we all \\"get\\" different books and authors. Those that read books to be told a story with little to no interpretation probably won't \\"get it\\", those who read to create a somewhat personal vision of the characters and story will be infinitely pleased. You'll find yourself trying to answer questions about yourself and your views of the American West that you've never been asked."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The best anything I have experienced courtesy of a living person. The material is so rich you may find yourself focusing on brief passages for an hour. Bleak, desolate, haunting, visceral, phenomenal."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A true classic of American literature. Cormac McCarthy's writing ability is nothing less than genius. While not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, failure to add this novel to your collection is the equivalent of literary heresy."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"Blood Meridian is a masterpiece, which like Moby Dick and Ulysses requires considerable effort from the reader. On the other hand, McCarthy is an easier read than Melville or Joyce, and his book is more accessible emotionally. The elaborate symbolism and language of the book is a PhD's wet dream, but for the more casual reader the important thing is whether after all the effort that goes into slogging through a book like this, the author can connect on a gut emotional level. McCarthy succeeds in this most important respect.\\"Blood Meridian\\" refers to the red, north-south meridian defined by the Western sunset, as McCarthy's rather obvious subtitle reveals. But in a larger sense it refers to the geographic and temporal frontier of the old West. One crosses the north/south meridian that runs through Texas of 1848 and in the process crosses into the bloody frontier of our historical memory -- including, as McCarthy's epigraph reveals, a history of indiscriminate bloodshed and scalping that defined human civilization for the past 300,000 years. For McCarthy, the recent \\"civilization\\" brought to the frontier over the past 150 years is a paper-thin moment in time. We are not really far removed from the blood meridian, and much of our seeming civilization is sheer hypocrisy and self-deception.As the body count piles up in chapter after vivid chapter, the reader strips away the veneer of civilization and overcomes the cultural taboos that prevent us from seeing humans as road kill. Our skull and brains really are only marginally less fragile than a watermelon, and human civilization and action hangs on the ridiculously thin threads that run down the central nervous system. The ethical codes against killing and violence are also paper thin, and in the frontier, the killing is as indiscriminate as the practices of army ants and wolf packs. The species kills and is killed, and is distinguished only by the imaginativeness of the act.The most striking character of the book is not the nominal protagonist, the \\"Kid\\" who helps to pile up the body count, but the figure of the \\"Judge\\" who is second in command of the paramilitary band of scalpers the Kid joins. The Judge says he is the legal representative of Glanton, the band's leader. But his procilivity for blowing brains out, molesting children, and his ridiculous denials of Glanton's atrocities combine to make him a distinctly different kind of jurist. But then, the Judge can deliver speeches and cite precedents in a mesmerizing way. For me, the Judge captures all the hypocrisies and self-deceptions of our current civilization.It is not at all clear whether McCarthy sees some redemption for the species. Is there some redemption at the end of all this violence? The Kid stops killing. The maniacal fear-flight defense and blood lust that motivate the violence is put on hold when the Kid declines to kill the Judge or the Judge's \\"Fool\\" companion. The Kid comes in from the frontier, and for the next 20 years obeys the rules of civilization, with the exception of one justified act of self defense. But the ambiguous end of the novel seems to indicate that the Judge has killed or perhaps even raped the Kid -- and he ends by dancing and exclaiming \\"I can never die.\\"I find the ending of the book to be one of its important flaws. It is simply not clear what the Judge does at the end, nor is it clear just what McCarthy is trying to convey. Nor is the one-page epilogue helpful. Perhaps he has not worked out for himself the fundamental question of whether there is any hope of redemption for the species. I'm of a more optimistic bent, and find some promise in how the Kid seems to come to terms with himself after returning from the Blood Meridian.This is one of a handful of truly great American novels."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"A friend of mine who was getting his degree in literature a few years back kept rcommending this book that he had read in class, but I repeatedly disregarded his recommendation because of my aversion to stories about the \\"Wild West\\". Finally, he brought the book over, and when I saw that it wasn't a spaghetti western, I reconsidered, and was forever changed. I must say that I have never encountered a story that has impacted me (both good and bad) in such a profound way. Some of the scenes and events painted with such color and imagery are way off the scale, and will shock even the most seasoned horror fiction fans - the scariest thing of all is it is based on a real events. Extremely dark. Cormack McCarthy's writing style (in this book only) is a little hard to get use to (very little punctuation, for example) but the descriptions paint vivid, brutal, powerful images that might haunt you for a lifetime. The characters, the lonely, desolate scenery, the amazingly chaotic adventures, the hideous cruelty, murder, and destruction left me very disturbed, yet I never wanted the book to end! After I finished, I read all of his other books and loved them all (especially \\"Outer Dark\\", \\"Child of God\\", and \\"The Orchard Keeper\\", all of which are wonderful, if not demented, stories that capture the the darker side of the imagination and leave you stranded in desolate, yet strangely beautiful corners of the mind.

But echos of truth permeate the bloody landscape.

A pessimistic view of human nature, or the \\"human condition\\", but not necessarily an inaccurate one. Who knows what dwells in the soul of man? The first sentence, \\"See the child.\\" should rank with the first in Moby Dick as one of the best remembered in literature. Is what we see in the child in the pages that follow a valid reflection of human nature? Could a band of such revolting criminals have ever roamed the face of the earth? Is violence/evil within us, part of our nature?

Beyond staggeringly vivid depection of the totality of social relations in a pure culture of death and killing, the violent yoking of discourses produces a kind of language virus which infects the reader. Blood Meridian offers a powerful and quite frightening example of the linguistic constructedness of the subject, or how the speaker is spoken by the language of another. Just try not talking or writing like McCarthy after Blood Meridian. McCarthy's Elizabethan/Tex-Mex/Nietzschean prose perfectly exemplifies the heteroglossia which, accoring to Russian critic Bakhtin, is the very essence of the novel. Picture Ahab and the Great White Whale conjoined and set loose in Death Valley, as purveyor of the new religion, War. McCarthy presents an America of infinite, &quot;borderless&quot; landscapes that will not be possessed and monstrously chimeric figures which resist all synthesis and defy any readerly fealty to the principles of psychological depth, unity and humanity."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"With all books, there is a difference between author and narrator. Sometimes the difference is slight, sometimes great. Omniscient narrators tend to reflect the author's stance about the story more than, say, first-person narrators, which often strike poses very unlike the authors', excepting the case of confessional \\"fiction\\" (which is not actually fictional). At first I thought Blood Meridian's narrator spoke without irony, without distance being injected between his voice and the author's feelings about the story. As I read on, I felt more and more an ironic distance between McCarthy and the narrator. I felt as if McCarthy were telling me to resist this narrative for its excesses, its hyperbole and its superstition and fatalism.Omniscient narrators are not usually unreliable. This one certainly speaks with an authority we are invited initially to believe. The narrator knows the landscape and how it regards the people trudging through it, like pawns in a game ruled by its unalterable ends. We can say that the landscape is the most revealed character in the novel, as Harold Bloom has noted. The narrator seems to speak with unquestioned insight about the world, which he animates. We glimpse the landscape's recalcitrant and indifferent interiority in the poses it strikes, that is, in its eerie lightening, meteor showers, ominous clouds, threatening mountains, and its hellish surfaces that stretch for miles. It is god-like and uncaring, harsh and without mercy.But the Judge also speaks with authority, and we do not believe him: his actions are clearly manipulative, and so must be his words. The judge shares the narrator's King-James-inspired dialect, though the judge uses that rhetoric to a much greater extent, consciously, with the intent to manipulate and gain authority.Whenever a dialect is assumed in a narrative this automatically distinguishes the personalities of author and narrator. Once I had this present in my mind, when I was about three quarters of the way into the book, I began to look for signs of slight parody, by which I mean, not humor, but notable and critical repetition. I found them immediately, everywhere. I began to note some formulas being used in the narration. An object or person in the landscape is frequently described as \\"like some\\" fearful object, monster or god from ancient times, mythology or religion. Things are often described as \\"like some\\" ominous or meaningful thing. Sometimes there are as many as four of these formulaic constructions per page. On page 251 of the Modern Library edition, for instance, the lakebed of lava is \\"like a pan of dried blood, threading those badland of dark amber glass like the remnants of some dim legion scrabbling up out of a land accursed...\\" while the character called \\"the idiot\\" is \\"clinging to the bars and calling hoarsely after the sun like some queer unruly god abducted from a race of degenerates...\\" and there lay a ridge \\"sand or gypsum, like the back of some pale seabest surface among the dark archipelagos.\\" On 282, judge and idiot are \\"Like things whose very portent renders them ambiguous. Like things so charged with meaning that their forms are dimmed. ....\\" and the judge pale pink is \\"like something newly born, lurching ... across the pan at the very extremes of exile like some scurrilous king stripped of his vestiture...\\" and who \\"was bedraped with meat like some medieval penitent.\\" There is at least one \\"like some\\" construction every few pages in the last quarter of the book where I started counting. Another common formula, which also appears in the quote above, is \\"the very\\" whatever of such and such. Formulaic writing is bad writing in the hands of an amateur and good parody in the hands of a master. I think McCarthy is a master, therefore I think it's an indication that we should understand it as having a critical distance.\\"Seems\\" may be an operative word thorough the book. The foreboding landscape that says over and over again, You are doomed to your fate, only seems to say so. Things are like this and that; and things behave as if they were this or that. Simile is almost always used over metaphor. While metaphor actually changes one thing into another, and speaks with more objectivity, simile makes fragile comparisons that are always subjective.I met McCarthy in 2001 or so. We both had offices at the Santa Fe Institute, a center for complexity science (I doing research, he writing fiction). We had a few conversations, mostly about postmodernism, for which he expressed great disdain, disdain for the view of science as \\"just another narrative.\\" As far as I know he still writes at SFI. I presume that he continues to enjoy the intellectual atmosphere of that place. The prevailing philosophy there typically involves the belief that nature, as complex, is inherently unpredictable. Without being critical of science an enterprise that seeks to know and therefore to posses the world -as does the judge, who is the evil scientist character, clearly--complexity workers tend to be aware of the limits of human control. At the same time, however, the inherent complexity of the world offers new possibilities for imagining a new kind of human agency and creative freedom. Agency, free will, destiny, fate, one could say, is the theme of Blood Meridian. War, gore and brutality are also themes, but war is justified or not depending on whether or not its inevitable or due to fate (or so the judge argues) and whether or not we can make choices in our lives.My analysis of fate would be deeper in a longer writing. Suffice it here to say that the notion of fate espoused by the (unreliable?) narrator feels very ancient to me and akin to that of epic narrative. Blood Meridian, many have noted, is an epic. It shares many characteristic of that genre, including the absence (relative to modern literature beginning, say, with Hamlet) of individual interiority. We do not know what members of the Galton gang think. Modern literature conventionally shows thought in asides, soliloquies, in stream of consciousness, internal monologues, none of which we have in Blood Meridian. Whereas in modern literature a man is often shown to be in a constant state of becoming, in epic, a man is equal to his actions and his fate is inextricably linked to his innate character. Does Blood Meridian uphold this epic view of character and fate or does its over-the-top narration belie it?I think ultimately McCarthy invites us to resist a narrative that describes, in too much gory detail, two columns of blood gushing out of a decapitated trunk of a man, whose head was struck off, unbelievably, in one stroke with a knife.Blood Meridian is a pre-modern narrative of fate, strangely devoid of notions of honor that justified the gore in the Iliad and that goaded poor Hamlet on in a time when such notions were fading. I believe that probably there still exist Galtons in this time and age. But they are otherworldly. They don't belong in our psyche. They belong to a rhetoric we cannot help but doubt."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"I ran into a friend reading this book at a coffee shop. I opened it to a random page and started reading the following:\\"They rode through regions of particolored stone upthrusts in ragged kerfs and shelves and traprock reared in faults and anti-clines curved back upon themselves and broken off like stumps of great stone treeboles and stones the lightning had clove open, seeps exploding in steam in some old storm. They rode past trapdykes of brown rock running down the narrow chines of the ridges and onto the plains like the ruins of old walls, such auguries everywhere of the hand of man before man was or any living thing.\\"This is, in a word, awful. I read several other portions before putting the book down in disgust. The standards for writing have clearly fallen far if all the praise heaped upon this inchoate, pompous mess of a novel is to be taken seriously. Mr. McCarthy is incredibly adept at styling sentences that appear to have depth and substance when they are at best meaningless and at worst completely contradictory.Don't waste your money or time on this nonsense."},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"The Undisputed King of Literary Mule Carnage.&quot; - Harper"},{"Title":"Blood meridian, or, The evening redness in the west (Picador)","review":"One star for style; one for content....Here I was all set to do my own screenplay: the definitive Western remake of Igmar Bergman's Fifties' existential angstfest: &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;.

I sent the screenplay to my beloved cousin: night editor for a great midwestern newspaper and reader voracious. He says, &quot;Read 'Blood Meridian'&quot;.

This book was written long before McCarthy had mastered the style that has brought him so much fame and credit. In this book, one sees him trying hard to hone his now-extraordinary powers of observation and description, and failing badly. That the publisher decided to release this book again long after it had been retired from view is a violation of public trust.

Along the way he meets a man called the Judge who is supposedely really the DEVIL, and whenever the plot begins to get boring the Judge pops up, becoming the DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE ENTIRE STORY. How's that supposed to be something in common with the BIBLE??? Its just weak plot device if you ask me.

Once an \\"authority\\" makes an analysis, everyone who wishes to confirm their self-perception of themselves as intelligent gets on the band wagon. Selective perception affirms the observations of those with whom they would like to be identified.Literati seem to thrive on the obtuse and esoteric. I loved \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" This book is something different altogether. How pretentious can you get? Obscure wording and arcane imagery are substituted for subtle discriminations and richness. The juxtaposition of novel phrases and incongruent words does not constitute genius in a writer.Literary criticism is replete with the antiquated artifacts of Freudian symbolism. A character represents some psychological attribute of the author or some universal archetype which we can all apprehend through the representative language of the writer.The less we understand it, the more \\"depth\\" it must have; the more meaning. Horsey Poop. Meridian has biblical allusions. Does this teach us anything about right or wrong? Have we had an emotional learning experience that we take away; an increase of knowledge or wisdom?Do we need anyone to tell us how violent our species is and how capable we are of atrocities against our own kind? The violence in Meridian becomes gratuitous and predictable. It serves no purpose.The worst part of this book is the patronizing morality lessons presented through the character of the judge.

It is only the second book I have read by this author, the first being THE ROAD. That one was simpler and more intriguing, but still not the best thing I have read. I can understand why the academic elites celebrate this author; he writes with that \\"I am a great writer\\" self consciousness that those people love. I find it boring and condescending.

There's no doubt that Cormac is a genius. His prose, while stilted and even pretentious, seems to cast a spell over the reader and you enter a new land. That land is often dark and I'm okay with that. I read five of his previous books including the unrelentingly grim THE ROAD. But in BLOOD MERIDIAN I finally reached my limit. I was appalled by the early and aggressive passages of violence and brutality. Then came the attack by the Comaches which left me reeling. And then, finally, came a short scene where one character beheads another with a Bowie knife. McCarthy doesn't just say that he was beheaded but he goes into detail about what it looked like, what the head looked like and how the body remain sitting with a cigarette in its hand -- all vivid and freakish details, but not in any way adding to the plot, story or character development.

BLOOD MERIDIAN is a meditation on violence by a writer with no apparent first-hand knowledge of the subject. I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. McCarthy has never even been on the back of a horse. By the way, there is a scene in the book that is stolen straight out of an old Star Trek episode (both \\"the Judge\\" and Capt. Kirk know how to make gunpowder out of elements found in the landscape). For an authentic tale of violence in the West, consider I'VE KILLED MEN by Jack Ganzhorn.

Alright, I'm going to dissent with most opinions on this book. Is it good? Yes, in a way, it's good. Is it great? No. Frankly, this was a tiresome book for me. Ninty percent of the book deals with ever increasingly clever descriptions of things ... the desert, the sky, the mountains, men. It just goes on and on. There is precious little dialogue and none of it particularly clever. The men spit more than they speak. If you compare Blood Meridian with most of the trash at your local bookstore than yes, it's a good book; its author writes well. If, however, you compare it to great classics that we don't have time to read anyway ... it's probably not worth the effort unless you're a real Western fan. If you're looking for great literature, buckle down with Shakespeare, Chaucer, Dante and Cervantes. Once you're done with the classics you can come back to Blood Meridian if you really want to.

The only thing I could even begin to care about was the animals. There wasn't a character that I was even remotely interested in, I certainly wasn't even the least bit curious as to what happened to them, let alone care about even enough to wish their demise. The evil, amorality of the characters hold no interest, no fascination and is very soon boring instead of evocative of anything. There is nothing inventive, interesting or otherwise at all compelling. You don't care about the Kid or the characters that surround him, you don't care about the people they kill, you don't care that the killings are brutal, and often indiscriminate. You don't care if they kill 10, 100 or 1000 Indians, Mexicans, by-standers or who or whatever ever. The violence is not fascinating, not shocking, not even numbing.

Ryan struggles with his hidden love for Megan, a childhood friend of his own children, while trying to keep her out of danger.This series has it all, mystery, budding romance, quotes from old mysteries (in this book, from old mystery films), and great characterizations.

As such, Dr. Megan Elizabeth Clark resides in her mother's home to keep expenses down. To supplement her income, Megan works at local library. She loves mystery novels and belongs to a reading group, Murder by the Yard, who meet at the Time and Again bookstore. The group currently celebrates its six-month anniversary with Megan creating a tour of famous murder sites in which the group reenacts the homicides of famous murders.Millionaire and patriarch of a local dysfunctional family, Bruce Gorman joins one of the tours. Twenty years ago, the wife of Bruce's grandson was found murdered in a gazebo with her husband covered in her blood holding the murder weapon. Not too long afterward, he committed suicide, closing the nasty chapter for everyone but Bruce. He has doubts and hires Megan and her cohorts to investigate the homicide even knowing that another family member might be the killer.MURDER PAST DUE is a delightful installment in a well-written, sweet amateur sleuth series. The book appeals to Christie fans and anyone who prefers a non-violent novel. Megan remains an appealing lead character, who belongs in the world yet still seems to rise above it. D.R. Meredith's five Clark books are all quite good, but leave too much of a gap between their releases to satiate us fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder Past Due","review":"Megan, Ryan and their mystery reading group are back in another great adventure.

Each morning and each evening I was transported to the old, decrepit Bellevue wards with Danielle Ofri and her patients. Ofri's openness, particularly in the field of healthcare which is so closeted, about how doctors feel and cope, her sensitivity to and empathy for her patients - in the country's oldest and largest public hospital that I have often walked past and shuddered at its sinister faade - her humility of being a newly minted medical student running in place to learn, while not encouraged to ask questions or kill anyone - transported me to a hidden and fascinating world. That world of our most intimate human relationships where we are vulnerable - both doctor and patient - and somehow forbidden from revealing too much of ourselves. I highly recommend this book to both health care providers in their quest to be more human and humane, and understand the patient experience as Ofri peers into it, and to patients to better understand what goes on for most practitioners. I can only hope as an advocate in diabetes myself for both patients and practitioners, that through Ofri's eyes and work, readers will be inspired to take one step closer to their partner in this complex dance we do."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"After continually telling myself, \\"just one more chapter,\\" I finished Singular Intimacies in the wee hours of the morning.

Each chapter was touching in its own way, and I felt as if I could see the patients in front of my eyes. As a medical student, this was a heartening way to wind down in the evenings. It is so easy to get caught up in the mountains of lecture notes that it can be hard to remember, as she puts it, the person behind the patient. Thank you, Dr. Ofri, for your continued reminder of that, as well as showing the reasons behing the heart and soul of medicine.

It's also a hands-on, first person account of what it's like to work in one of the biggest and busiest hospitals in the country. Her essay, &quot;Merced,&quot; on a patient who continuted to suffer from a mysterious and unknowable ailment, is a wrenching tale of a doctor who can't help her patient, despite incredible efforts and every modern mechanism.

This is a book about real people, with real problems. This is a book written by a doctor who takes nothing about what she does lightly.Dr. Ofri takes the sacred--a person and his/her life--and offers us a glimpse into the patient's world and the doctor's world in a poetic, gorgeous book that offers us both rare insight about ourselves and insight about human beings in general.Each essay describes a moment in time, a look at Dr. Ofri's residency at Bellevue Hospital, a glimpse of one or more of her patients, and a glance toward the human condition and how it can be both transformational and devasting.Dr. Ofri takes the mundane--an alcoholic arriving in the ER from too much imbibing--and transforms the story into one that will stay with you for the rest of your life.I am not a doctor, I am not a scientist. I am an ordinary person who will never again look ordinarily at any person whether I see them in a hospital bed or posted as a missing person on a flyer.Perhaps what sets Dr. Ofri apart is that she is a doctor, a wife, a mother. But I hope not. I hope that every doctor could aspire to having access to both sides of his/her brain, to show emotion and to offer solace in a way that Dr. Ofri has.This is a must read for anyone in the medical field and a must read for anyone who aspires to have a deeper connection in any relationship with any person."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I am currently an intern in my first year of training at Bellevue. This book was given to me as a present upon my recent graduation from medical school. Although internship does not provide much time for pleasure reading, I am very glad I stayed up at night to read this book. Dr. Ofri is wise and caring. Her willingness to share her insecurities and imperfections is rare in the world of medicine where admissions of weakness are rare. Unlike a number of other senior and jaded doctors I have met, Dr. Ofri has not lost the caring and excitement for medicine everyone has when they begin medical school. Anyone involved in the medical profession will immediately relate to these aspects of the book.For readers not involved in medicine, the book will still be wonderful to read. It is beautifully written, and all readers will be able to relate to the human drama Dr. Ofri presents. Although I have yet to meet Dr. Ofri in person, I hope that when I am done with my training at Bellevue, I will have a fraction of her passion and compassion."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Singular IntimaciesIf you have ever wondered what medical training is like, if you have ever fantasized about becoming a doctor, or if you just love strong writing and great stories, this is a book for you.Singular Intimacies takes us inside the emotional and intellectual heart of a doctor as she makes her journey from medical student to resident physician during her training at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. As a physician and poet who learned to practice medicine at similar inner-city hospitals, I can assure any reader that Dr. Ofri's descriptions of the clinical situations she encounters (including the array of patients, diagnostic dilemmas, clinical conversations, and moments of genuine love and exhilaration), all ring true for me: patients recover unexpectedly from what seem to be fatal illnesses; they die without warning and without having an accurate diagnosis; and they laugh, bleed, masturbate, cooperate, and act up in every imaginable (and unimaginable) way. Through all these experiences, Dr. Ofri shares her own personal responses which vary from her sense of pride when she begins to experience a sense of mastery, to moments of intense anxiety and despair. I found myself re-experiencing my own excitement, fear, and sleep-deprivation, only this time with a compassionate guide, one who is strong enough to let herself laugh at gallows humor, and also be vulnerable enough to cry in the arms of a priest as the patient's family watches. And I celebrated when Dr. Ofri finally finished her training , bruised and calloused, but with the compassionate heart and voice of a healer."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Singular Intimacies is a must read for any physician or non-physician with an interest in the human spirit. Danielle Ofri focuses on the physical and emotional connections she made with other interns, residents, and attendings, as well as her patients while learning how to become a doctor at the legendary Bellevue Hospital.She describes each level of training she went through, and what lessons she learned in caring for the ill at that particular point in her training. We encounter a diverse group of patients who all have something unique to bring to Ofri's learning experience.The diversity of New York City is also a point of interest. Regardless of race, sex, or class, Ofri shows we are all emotionally vulnerable. She shows it doesn't matter what side of the medical community a person is on. We are all affected by an individual's illness in some way or another. The descriptions Ofri provides of the hospital, and the surrounding neighborhoods really makes the book intriguing.Ofri's interactions with the patients shows the pride she has in being a physician, and the book shows the pride she has in being a writer."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"The beauty and clarity of Danielle Ofri's writing convey the immediacy of her experiences during her clinical training in medicine at Bellevue Hospital in NYC. In the complex, somewhat chaotic environment of a large city teaching hospital not necessarily conducive to reflective compassionate care, she values the innate resilient sensitivity and compassion within herself that complement the technical proficiencies she is developing. Her responsiveness to the interpersonal side of medicine enriches for her her professional role, and the patients under her care are beneficiaries. A rich perspective and wit enhance this wondrous rendering of the interpersonal nature of doctor-patient relationships."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Singular Intimacies, Danielle Ofri's first non-technical book, is a brilliant addition to the memoirs of physicians and other health care workers. In it, Ofri chronicles her transition from medical student to internist at New York City's Bellevue Hospital. She is humble, funny, smart, sophisticated, vulnerable, and blessed with rare insight. In addition, she has the gift for lucid, direct prose. This book will appeal to physicians, other health care workers, the general public; and especially to those young persons considering a career in medicine. For this latter group and for medical students it is a \\"must read.\\"Occasionally, when reading a book I feel like Keats did when he first opened Chapman's \\"Homer.\\" \\"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken.\\" Singular Intimacies imparted this welcome and always surprising feeling to me. It should enjoy a great success and help to inspire and humanize many future (and some practicing) physicians."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"This is an interesting book and it certainly held my attention. But it was not especially enjoyable to read; at the time it came into my hands, a friend who was seriously ill was being treated at a teaching hospital. Those who prefer not to know too much about the white coats and their training (which is certainly being conducted on patients at teaching hospitals) may want to avoid this book.That said, some of the stories about patients are pretty eye opening, as well. The human personality is remarkably fixed; a dirty old man who has probably made women miserable all his life will persist, even at death's portal. Some of these stories demonstrate the sad human drama caused by bone-deep denial; others show the amazing aspect of the creative, healing interaction between patient and physician."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"As a physician in a New York inner city hospital this book held a particular interest for me. Each scenario was described in such beautiful, literary prose that I felt like I was on the wards once again experiencing the same joy and sorrow. This book is a triumph for the medical profession who trains its doctors to follow directions rather than think creatively. Dr. Ofri's book is the first step towards humanizing the medical profession. I would reccommend this book for all human beings!!"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Danielle Ofri's peek into the making of a physician at Bellevue is clear and compelling. We are caught up in the quivering overwhelm of a novice thrown into the arena of life and death, expected to assess, make decisions, and live with them. Progressing from medical student to intern to resident, we are privy to Ofri's learning by the seat of her pants, to how she absorbs the hard lesson of how to treat with compassion even those patients who are difficult to like, to her sense of wonder as she realizes she is gaining expertise and confidence. In this era of physicians bent on appearing as if they are always in control and on top of things, Ofri bravely exposes her passion, her caring, and her vulnerability as she finds her way through the sometimes dark tunnels of medical academia. As a struggling neophyte, she seems to silently bear her trials without comment. It is gratifying to see that the more confident graduating resident finds her voice, standing up to those who make the system difficult. \\"Singular Intimacies\\" can help budding and practicing physicians to be better doctors. And from learning that doctors are people, too, patients can learn to be better patients."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Danielle Ofri's work tours us through the Jekyll and Hyde world of modern medicine while wearing the author's heart very firmly on its sleeve. In Ofri's version of Bellevue Hospital, the goal is always noble: to treat and help every sick person, to the best of the staff's ability. The methods, however, are often Draconian, so if your goal in reading about medicine is to condemn the looming medical industry, you'll find plenty of tinder here. On the other hand, if what you're looking for is searing treatment of the case-by-case emotional trauma of administering medicine to the very sick, this is pitch-perfect. It's well written, certainly, and any individual essay can stand alone, but of greater merit is the aesthetic Ofri brings to her observations. She desperately wants to find the poetry lurking behind each \\"code,\\" I.V. and intern. More often than not, she finds it. The chapter \\"Intensive Care\\" is especially effective, at once a stunning character study and an alarming look behind the veil of medical training. Put it this way: if Dr. Ofri lived anywhere near me, I'd want her to be my doctor."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Singular Intimacies is a book of great power and grace, a book written from the heart. Danielle Ofri takes readers inside the world of Bellevue Hospital, but, more important, she invites us into her mind and soul. Written with great compassion, wit, warmth, and grit, this book presents us with the humanity at the center of medicine. Thank heavens for doctors and writers like Danielle Ofri. I can't begin to tell you how deeply this book moved me. I can only invite you to experience it for yourself."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"This book could be subtitled &quot;No day is normal at Bellevue.&quot; The enthusiastic young doctor keeps trying to find meaning, do the right thing, be the best doctor, and smell the roses in a chaotic, surreal world, where everything is fast-paced and unexpected and where it would be easy to become tired and cynical. It reads very fast."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Danielle Ofri expressed clarity and beauty in her writing while conveying experiences from her clinical training. The book, Singular Intimacies, takes us into the emotional and intellectual training of a physician during her transition from medical student, to intern, to resident at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.Ofri describes some of the hard lessons she was faced with while transitioning one year to the next, including how to treat all her patients with compassion, even those who are difficult or are hard to get along with. I particularly enjoyed the sense of wonder she details while gaining clinical confidence and expertise.Ofri portrays great insight into medical training which could be useful for those interested in entering a medical profession. Currently in medical school, I felt that this book would appeal to health care workers, students, physicians, and the general public."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Danielle Ofri is a gifted writer who offers a rare look at the relationships between doctors and patients. This completely absorbing book could not fail to touth the humanity of everyone who reads it. It soars!"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I can't stop thinking about the patients that Danielle Ofri so exquisitely portrays in Singular Intimacies ... even the grumpy or chronically misbehaving ones! What that tells me is that these are portraits of people who were truly cared for by their doctor. How utterly refreshing to get this perspective, given the prevalence of cynicism about the quality of care and consideration provided by most doctors. As Dr. Ofri's patient, you're a person, not just a body filling a bed, or the name at the top of an order for medications or tests. I also gained respect for the mystery-solving aspect of diagnosing what ails the patient. If Dr. Ofri can't be my doctor, I would hope that my doctor would have read her book during their training!"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"This book is truly a must read. Danielle Ofri is a talented writer and gifted physician. How lucky her patients, to have such a compassionate presence for a doctor. Through her writings I felt the warmth and caring she brings to every interaction. I would hope that this book would be a primer for all doctors-in-training, so that they might be inspired to keep their humanity and be willing to be vulnerable when they become doctors. This book and this woman are an inspiration. I am richer for having read the book and grateful that Danielle Ofri shared in this way."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"As an aspiring physician, this book gave me a glimpse of medical training while I was still an undergraduate. Dr. Ofri's honest account of her experiences - good and bad - inspired me to continue on in the medical profession. What struck me most about her book was the relationships she tried to make with her patients, even the most difficult. Her passion for medicine is evident through her book and contagious to the reader. Although I myself am interested in medicine, the stories and challenges described by Dr. Ofri as she tries to make her way in her chosen field can, in my opinion, ring true to anyone in any field. I highly recommend this book as not only is Dr. Ofri a wonderful writer, she is also a wonderful teacher, person, and physician."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Singular Intimacies is a wonderful book, full of thoughtful stories, poingnant observations, and insightful revelations from the author about the nature of medicine, healing and the relationship between doctors and patients.It gives me great hope that Dr. Ofri is a leading light in modern medicine, because she exemplifies an honest and heartfelt approach to caring that is sorely needed in our overly technical healthcare system. Having doctors who are willing to be vulnerable at the same time they are competently sharing their amazing learning with their patients bodes well for the present and future of healing in this country.I encourage anyone interested in the changing of the guard in the medical field, or just interested in great stories from the frontlines of medicine, to read this book."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I read this book thinking that stories written by a doctor would be fascinating. I honestly got tired of hearing the author talk about crying every 10 minutes and all of her self esteem issues. I wanted to hear more stories and less personal musings. The stories were interesting in their own right, but went on WAY too long. I would have rather had a more brief description of events and more of them. (more about the patients much less whining and agonizing by the author)."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"The first time I read Danielle Ofri's SINGULAR INTIMACIES: BECOMING A DOCTOR AT BELLEVUE, I was drawn from one story to the next with barely a pause. When I reread it recently, I paused a lot - to find and take advantage of the structure of the book, to take part in the book, and to play this book off the two that followed it.The structure of SINGULAR INTIMACIES is elegant and very clear, like Adrienne Berneau, who presides over both prologue and epilogue. Fifteen patients line up in-between. Each of the intervening stories is whole; several stood on their own in literary journals before coming to this book. The fact that each is complete in itself makes it easy to stop and stay awhile with each one, to sink deep into the \\"poetic subtleties and convoluted irrationalities of patient care.\\" This time through, I did so.The title of the book invites the reader's participation throughout. What is the \\"singular intimacy\\" in each of the stories? How does it compare to the intimacies of the other stories? What do they teach us about doctors, about patients, about ourselves? Once I began asking these questions, other questions crowded in - about family, about writing, about education, about human nature, about faith. I found these stories good to think with.Two books followed this one - INCIDENTAL FINDINGS: LESSONS FROM MY PATIENTS IN THE ART OF MEDICINE in 2005 and MEDICINE IN TRANSLATION: JOURNEYS WITH MY PATIENTS in 2010. They are enough like SINGULAR INTIMACIES and each other - and yet different enough - to make it useful to play the three books off one another. Reading them together worked for me the first time through. Rereading them together worked even better."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"This is one of the most amazing books around! The author does a magnificent job in portraying her journey of becoming and being a doctor; you find yourself both laughing and crying! Her writing style is so honest and simultaneously entertaining! I am soo picky when it comes to books, but I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!! It was incredible. I felt like I gained such insight into what it means to go through medical training and become a physician; no other novel/article/text has ever left me with that kind of clarity. Throughout the book I felt so close and connected to the author, like I was rooting for her and wanted her to succeed. She shows the human side of doctoring, the love and care and the struggles and pain. THIS IS A MUST READ!!! Especially for those who are interested in going into health care and med school! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I went to medical school at NYU from 2003-2008 and did many of my rotations at Bellevue as well the private \\"University Hospital\\" Dr. Ofri mentions in her book (Tisch). Dr. Ofri captures the many, complex, and difficult-to-describe feelings that every medical student experiences, and she does it with beautiful prose. It definitely is an art to be able reflect back on one's experience with such clarity and then be able to write about it skillfully.It is also nice to see a doctor paint human faces on her patients--as a doctor in 2010, medicine has become much more industrial and commercialized. Most doctors try to see as many patients as possible and do as many procedures as possible to make the most money. Private practices are run like businesses. The book is a good reminder to physicians that the patients they see everyday are real people, with real lives.This book is a must-read for all medical students and housestaff at NYU."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I am not a doctor or a patient; I have nothing to do with the world of medicine, so I had a bit of trepidation about reading this book. It turns out that it is so well written that I had nothing to worry about! I loved it; I could hardly put it down. It was so interesting and informative and Ofri's character so attractive; there is no reason to not read this book. Besides, I heard that Ofri gives the doctors or/and residents on her team poems in the mornings to get their days started; how special and cool is that? Also, she is the co-founder and editor at the Bellevue Literary Review, a really excellent, high quality literary journal. She knows her literary stuff!"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Having experienced medical residency during the same time frame as Dr Ofri, I could relate to most of her experiences on the wards of New York University Hospital poignantly recalled in her book Singular Intimacies. I highly recommend her book to anyone mulling over the idea of becoming a doctor. I also recommend it to anyone who is going through residency or has gone through it as it will remind you why you chose this path.Robert Haight, MDFamily MedicineJuneau, Alaska"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Beginning with her first patient she clerked whilst a medical student, who kissed her shamelessly on the ward, continuing with her insecurities as a medical student and a resident, the patients which presented with ethical dilemnas concerning their treatment options, or the cases of patients with conflictive personalities, Ofri takes us on a journey that ends when she attains full maturity as a physician, and becomes confident in her attititudes and actions, but is at the same time aware of the limitations of the medical profession and of the fragilities of human nature.Some of the stories inclusively involved people from her intimate circle of friendships, like her friend Josh, who died of sudden death at 27 years old, or her former tutor, an attending physician she admired very much and who ended up committing suicide unexpectedly.I thus realized deep down that, even though actors and stages change, the problems faced by medical students and residents of a New York Hospital do not substantially differ, in their essence, of the daily problems faced by Portuguese family medicine residents.The book ends in a way that will please many family physicians. Those who only read the final chapter could end up thinking that Ofri is a family physician. But no, despite working in an environment obsessed with the search for a diagnosis and the fascination of technology, the author prefers to stress the importance of a physician's apparently daily routine moments for clinical practice:\\"And although many of the stories revolve around gravely ill patients who die in a stark and painful fashion, these don't completely illustrate the full spectrum of being a doctor. It is sometimes in the most mundane clinical encounters, the ones that don't lend themselves to a dramatic retelling, that medicine is most uplifiting. The smile on the patient's face upon hearing that her cholesterol has come down, the gratitude from the patient when you prescribe a three-month supply of pills instead of a one-month supply, the triumph of finding a Bengali interpreter when you need one - these are but splinters of satisfaction, but they are evermore common than the tormented deaths of the ICU. And these splinters, when coalesced, form a potent girder of fulfillment beneath me.\\"If Danielle Ofri had not decided to pursue internal medicine, she would have made a great family doctor, as well as an ardent \\"Balintian\\".[...]"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"In the beginning, you want to put your arms around this young medical student to protect her from the life and death decisions still to come. You will never forget Daniel Ofri and her patients, and her journey. This is brilliant, hold-your-breath storytelling.

As Ofri traces her journey from awkward medical student to polished physician within New York's famed urban hospital, she introduces the reader to sixteen people who shape her view of modern medicine and haunt her memories. Even though I had limited exposure to medicine, Ofri's appealing prose and clich&eacute;-free voice remained with me long after I'd finished the book.Now in medical school, I re-read Singular Intimacies this summer and found myself once again dazzled by Ofri's words--but also seared afresh by the power of her coming-of-(white)coat story. The untidy lessons Ofri gleans from her hospital encounters ring with the raw truth of cold coffee on Monday morning, the cacophony of a night spent on-call, and the beauty of a patient's genuine smile.

I found the book to be entertaining and an easy read from her style of writing, although a bit nerve-wracking to realize that the experiences she goes through are similar to those I will experience in my own training. I enjoyed the progression of her book from third year medical student, to residency and beyond. For anyone pursuing medicine as a career I would recommend this book as a way to realize that you are not the only one who is nervous about the responsibility that comes with being a physician. While some of her stories seem a bit grandiose or embellished, it is nonetheless a very entertaining and encouraging read."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Danielle Ofri has a unique voice in medical narrative non-fiction. Her descriptions of patient and doctor interactions were at times both painful and touching, and it was fascinating to be able to look over her shoulder and into her head as she navigated through her training to become a doctor.She has a gentleness to her personality that softens the edges of the hard things she talks about - her priorities as a doctor, the complex and sometimes uncomfortable feelings doctors have for their patients, and all of the frightening \\"firsts\\" she has to perform while learning how to do all of the procedures that doctors know how to do.I loved how she draws parallels between her outside life and her life in the hospital. After a close friend dies, she finds herself reflecting on his life and death while helping patients, and she brings a lot of empathy and care from her life experiences, into the doctor-patient relationship.I have read her next book, Incidental Findings, which is also excellent, but would definitly recommend reading this one first because there were a few parts in the second one where I felt like I was missing some background understanding or depth, which this first book provides."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I have read many \\"becoming a doctor\\" books and some are interesting but are written by people who have no business writing a book!

It was easy to feel the pain and emotion of the writer who communicated her feelings well.

I am encouraged that some one else with little confidence can survive, but I am afraid of the many daunting tasks and cases that I could meet. Ofri does a good job at expressing the efforts and troubles that an aspiring physician must face. However I think that few of us will find such entertaining stories. However embellished the stories are they make for good reading for everyone, non-medical folks will appreciate the fine story telling and people in the field will appreciate the stories and technical aspects."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I first read Danielle's writing in a Best American Essays book. It was such a wonderful essay that I immediately went out and bought the book in hardcover because I knew it would be a keeper. I was not disappointed. Her writing stands out because not only are the stories riveting but she has true talent as a writer as well. Each story teaches you something; sometimes a new medical fact, but more often you learn something about the human experience.

Ofri's book pulls the reader into the fascinating world of medical training. One is able to see what really happens on the wards of a busy hospital from her unique perspective. More interestingly, though, is the bird's eye view the reader will get of the life of a physician-in-training. Things you never thought possible will come into light, and Ofri will drag you through them as if they were commonplace occurrences. She has a knack for capturing the essence of learning medicine and putting it down on paper where even a non-medically oriented reader will not be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I couldn't put the book down.

The doctors are building the boat while they are sailing on it - learning to treat the patients while they are treating them. Dr. Ofri, a sensitive, intelligent and articulate young doctor just starting out, describes her struggle to master not only the technical skills of her profession, but also, not less important, the emotional skills to see each patient not as a case but as a person. The doctor must accompany the patient through what may be the most dramatic moments of his life, treating not only illness, but pain, fear, confusion, despair. And sometimes stand in wonder at the patient's courage and dignity.\\"Singular Intimacies\\" tells a human story of blood and guts and veins and organs, and also love and compassion that give us dignity in the most difficult circumstances."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I'm a long-time admirer of Danielle Ofri's writing.

Residency program is indeed a trial (and training) by fire which can either melt or strengthen the heart of a novice doctor. Being a doctor myself, I have been to \\"hell and back\\" with many of my patients. There are quite a few Dr Sitkins in the world of medicine : humane and highly sensitive doctors hiding behind a facade who snap when the reality of the harsh world and its inequalities,espeically, in life and death situations become unbearable."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Not that medicine isn't intense, but it seems as though Ofri is writing more to appeal to expectations of medical training that one gets while watching hospital dramas on television. While I can appreciate her approach and intent -- to show human relationships in the objective world of medicine -- I think that her overt attempts make the book fall short of what it could be. Her anecdotes are sometimes entrancing, sometimes engulfing, but in many cases are not entirely believable. She overstates the ineptitude of those in training while playing to expectations of doctors' callousness and scientific mindsets. Having read this book soon after another in the same genre that was, quite honestly, much better (Atul Gawande's Complications) I was slightly disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"There are precious few good books detailing the process of medical education and rightly so.

Ofri's book is a good attempt at capturing that transformation but, it does fall short not for what it does not include but for what it does.As a current medical student I find this book a good resource for those outside of the medical profession to see what labor and length of time goes into training a physician. However, I feel that in several places the author has taken great liberty in dramatizing medical education or scenarios. Surely, this is for the readers interest but I feel that gives a false sense of what really goes on in medicine much like Grey's Anatomy has everyone asking me who I am hooking up with at the hospital. The places where this literary liberty was taken will most likely not be evident to those outside the medical field and will generally serve as anecdotal for those in medicne.Overall the book reads well and would serve as a good starting point for those interested in learning the general structure of medical education today. I would not reccommend this book for those in the medical field seeking to add depth to their knowledge of medical education"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I couldn't put the book down. Danielle is a wonderful, gifted writer who made me feel as if I was right there with her on rounds. She wrote about people and the doctor patient relationship , not about medical jargon,procedures and tests. It was conforting to see how much a doctor cares about her patients."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I knew that Danielle Ofri was an outstanding editor (if you haven't read the Bellevue Literary Review, edited by Ofri, run out a get a copy--it's one of the best journals being published today), now I learn that she's an outstanding author as well. Reading Singular Intimacies I found myself weeping, cheering, and just plain enjoying. She captures perfectly the transition from medical student to physician, the internal and external changes, the growing sense of expertise, and the arrival of true caring. Along the way she reveals herself as fully human and compassionate. Among the many currently popular books by physicians, this one stands out."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I enjoyed both the content and the manner in which it was constructed. I found it had a really nice mix of human interest, medicine and self-deprecating humor. It was also interesting on a more psychological level as how humans react under stress and the small deviations (which have major ramifications for patients) that they can affect while operating within a much larger system.While the stress and the adaptation of the job was familiar to me, the additional pressures of New York and a crumbling health system created a very volatile backdrop.The book successfully highlights the role of a caring stressed doctor within a very unmanageable system."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"If I had to recommend ONE book written for a general audience by a physician, it would have to be Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue by Danielle Ofri. Dr. Ofri produces some of most stunning writing you'll find by a physician - or by any author.There are many excellent doctor-authors out there. Most write engagingly and incisively about their work. Once in a while, though, you find the work of someone who goes beyond journalistic skill to art that inspires wonder and awe: the work of a true writer whose prose moves and takes one's breath away. This is the kind of writing Dr. Ofri offers her readers.Singular Intimacies, issued in reprint just this month, chronicles her years moving up the ranks at New York's busy Bellevue Hospital. She begins her journey in a foyer \\"jammed with white coats and saris, kafiyas and dashikis. Spanish, Tagalog, Bengali, and English elbowed for air space as did the smells of coffee, curry, and homelessness.\\" Can't you just feel the jostling and detect those whiffs of New York?Richard Selzer writes of Singular Intimacies, \\"This book should be required reading by anyone contemplating a life in medicine.\\" Oliver Sacks affirms, \\"Danielle Ofri is a finely gifted writer, a born storyteller as well as a born physician.\\" Jerome Groopman says, \\"Her vivid and moving prose enriches the mind and turns the heart.\\" Amen.I'll give you another example of what they're talking about - a perfectly constructed sentence about a final conversation with a memorable patient, \\"The arc of our words shimmered in the air and her history settled softly into mine.\\"Beautiful.If you love medicine, or just love great writing, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Singular Intimacies is among the best memoirs I've read. I'm not in a medical field but after joining Dr. Ofri on her rounds through the essays in this book, I feel I understand something of that world intimately. As patients, potential patients and as the loved ones of those needing care, I think it's common to worry that doctors won't see our humanness. In reading this book, I saw theirs. The young doctor we meet in these pages is thoughtful, responsive and caring to the point of vulnerable. When I finished Dr. Ofri's book, I immediately missed her company. She writes with intelligence, candor and heart."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"This book does a great job chronicling the challenges both patients and physicians face in a busy public hospital. It explores the hardships the patients face, the resilliency of the human spirit and the strategies caregivers employ to offer the best care in sometimes very difficult circumstances. I believe this book portrays realistically and poignantly that shared experience. I fully enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"Ofri's Singular Intimacies, it a beautifully written book filled with captivating short stories. It is a must read for anyone considering a career in medicine. Ofri's experiences gave me a greater appreciation of the journey taken to become a doctor, and the understanding that it is much more than textbook knowledge. I have and will give this book to friends in medicine and its related fields.D. FischerBoca Raton, FL"},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"I read this one for a med school discussion group. At first I disliked it, feeling like Dr. Ofri was really trumping up Bellvue, how great the hospital is and likewise everyone who works there. However, then she went on to describe her relative incompetence in her medical performance as she transitioned through the end of medical school and residency. At this point in my education, I can relate to her lack of experience and feelings of inadequacy during her training.This is a great book to read if you are interested in the inner workings of medical education and its impact on patient care, especially if you prefer to read about it via entertaining anecdotes rather than those nasty boring textbooks. A good read for med and pre-med students, as well as those just wanting to eavesdrop on the system of medical education.This part of the review is by Kristi Florek, Matt's wife:I also read this book for a class in medical school, like everyone else reviewing this book. I really enjoyed reading it \\"for fun\\" even though it was assigned. Each time I read the assigned chapters I had a hard time putting the book down, and read several more chapters. I found the book to be a good sampling of what life as a med student and a resident is like. Sometimes life is hard: days are long and sleepless, patients die, you don't know what to do, you get stuck with a needle, patients and staff are difficult. But sometimes life is great: you diagnose a difficult case, a baby is born, one of your superiors gives you a word of commendation, you feel like you're succeeding at becoming a doctor. It is an up and down world with huge swings of emotion. One thing I really identified with were her feelings of inadequacy, realizing that I am not alone in thinking that I have no idea what I am doing!Overall, a very good book for anyone with any interest in medicine and medical education."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"How does medicine educate its upcoming doctors? When is it okay to let a medical student to do a procedure? Given a choice would you let a medical student do your surgery? In the big picture, young doctors need experience because they are the future. This is just one of the many issues surrounding medical education and the maturation of young doctors that Ofri tackles. Some stories will move you, others will demystify the aura surrounding doctors, other may make you think twice before going to the doctor. Ofri's humbleness and honesty allow the reader an inside look at the decision making process of a doctor as they go through their training, which is sometimes a marvelous progression of logic and efficiency, and other times a shot in the dark at best. A good quick read for anyone interested in medicine or what medical training is like."},{"Title":"Singular Intimacies: Becoming a Doctor at Bellevue","review":"A beautiful collection of stories from the hospital world. Dr Ofri provides a clear view of the resident experience as well as a vivid tales of many patient experiences.

As a journalist he decides to enter into that world to see how the other half lives. What he sees and feels cannot be debated, negated, ignored or even criticized. It just is.What Yoram experienced was an everyday existance of discrimination from the Jewish Isrealies he encountered. He wasn't brutally attacked or beaten or spit upon at every corner. No, his story is far more subtle. What he describes is a life of an outcast, of what it feels like to be someone who's viewed as &quot;less than,&quot; as the &quot;other.&quot;The routine details of this life are in fact some of the most important in the current debate about the situation in Israel. What Binur experiences is essentially the seed that has helped bring about the larger forms of violence with each side upping the ante. It doesn't start with a bulldozer destroying a Palestinian home. And it doesn't start with a Palestinian bombing a sidewalk cafe and killing a dozen innocent civilians. It starts with everyday hatred - and that's what Binur so clearly gives us.We already know that some (not all) Palestinians refuse Israel's right to exist. What we need, as Americans who have blindly supported Israel no matter what it does, is to see how some Israelis (not all) haves refused the Palestinians a right to their homeland - and their dignity. Binur's book is a step in the right direction in learning that lesson."},{"Title":"My Enemy, My Self","review":"Yoram Binur, an Israeli journalist fluent in Arabic from covering stories in the Arab areas of his country, decided to take on a fake identity as an Arab to get first-hand experience of the treatment Arabs receive from the Israeli police and society. He was convincing enough to be singled out for harassment and violence from the police, and he experienced subtle discrimination from everyday Israelis. He learned to really feel the terror Arabs in Israel feel every time an army vehicle approaches them, or even passes by their house at night, knowing they could legally be brutalized at any time for no reason. It was an eye-opening account from inside one of the most complex political situations on earth, and Binur always kept it personal and involving."},{"Title":"My Enemy, My Self","review":"It is a theme that is popular but few people know much about it. The author is compassionate, brave, and knowledgeable. A must read if you are interested in learning about Israeli/Palestinian relationships."},{"Title":"My Enemy, My Self","review":"This is an incredible book. Yoram Binur provides an entirely new perspective to an old issue. The depth of maltreatment of Arab Palestinians in Israel has not been put into such a consise, unobstructed manner in the history of literature. Anyone who is interested in educating themselves about the Civil and Moral Rights violations which are taking place in Israel should definately read this book. Any advocate of justice, any person concerned with the fact that there are people being horribly mistreated anywhere in the world, and anyone looking for a cause to support or solidarity to offer those who are oppressed should start with this book."},{"Title":"My Enemy, My Self","review":"In this book, Yoram Binur, a respected Israeli Journalist as well as an ex-officer in the Israeli Defense Forces, steals a page from F. H. Griffith's classic \\"Black Like Me, \\" as he takes a \\"walk on the wild side,\\" posing as a Palestinian\\" in a number of situational vignettes that take place both in the \\"occupied territory,\\" as well as in Israel proper. Driven by the desire to get to know the \\"Palestinian mind,\\" as well as to expose Israel's multilevel class ridden hypocritical society, rift with racial prejudices, among other problems, in the first half of the book the author comes just short of proving that our erstwhile middle Eastern democratic ally is little more than \\"Mississippi in drag,\\" cira 1950.The earlier vingettes (as an itinerate workers in a variety of settings) call to mind the famous debate (Has Zionism Succeeded?) between Ari Shavette and Jeffery Goldberg. The reader may recall that Shavette, in a spirited defense of Israel's errant ways with regard to its racist attitudes towards its Arab minorities, nevertheless did not try to sidestep the most important contradiction this issue raised for Israeli democracy: That given the very nature of Israel's establishment (on the ashes of the European Holocaust), Shavette stated with great conviction that for Israel \\"being \\"just\\" is a moral imperative and [is perhaps] Israel's only [real] strategic asset.\\"What is most interesting about the first half of the book is that the author's change of identity, as he clandestinely went about infiltrating vignette after vignette, revealed Israel to be both a narrow racist nation, as well as one anxious to try to get the Palestinian crisis in its past. This ambivalence becomes much more pronounced in the second half of the book as the author continues to force his way into the very heart of Israeli life, including successfully becoming a volunteer in a Kubutz. But also, and this goes beyond the Griffith motif, he discovers a great deal about the anti-Semitic prejudices on the other side. He probes into how the Palestinians have come to \\"cope\\" with their greatly diminished way of life, and how anti-Semitism, even when justified, also undermines the Palestinian cause and diminishes an already diminished Arab humanity. In the end, it is clear that it is the hatred on both sides that is eating away at the moral fiber of Israeli society.Although the book may not command the same classic status as Griffith's book, nor does it have the same gripping emotional impact, it does have its finer moments and is a much needed independent non-ideological view of Israel from the inside out. It is the perfect counterweight to the incessant and distorted American media view that Israel is a \\"perfect democracy\\" and can do no wrong.Five Stars"},{"Title":"The Blue Spaders at the Battle of Ap Gu, 31 March-1 April 1967","review":"The Battle of Ap Gu took place on 31 March through 1 April 1967.

I was always a straight A student so I don't think anyone thought I had a problem, but I knew something was wrong. I was always writing things backwards and a short term memory at times. I was hyperactive and I lashed when I got frustrated (then I would feel guilty) and I didn't understand why. I always felt unloved and stupid even though I had tons of friends and a scholarly academic life.I have been called smart and intelligent but it was sometimes coupled with the words crazy, over emotional, overly sensitive, mean, unsociable etc.No one could understand why this beautiful intelligent successful girl (me) could not see herself that way. I had been to a counselor once I got older but most diagnosed me as depressed. I had no clue these issues I was dealing with have to do with dyslexia. At the age of 28 this is a breath of fresh air and a definite sign of hope. I wish I had this information years ago. This book communicates what I tried to explain to my parents, my teachers, the counselor, my friends, my boyfriends, ie. but they could never understand. I'm not saying all people with these symptoms that have dyslexia, but if even if you suspect your child may pleeeeeaaaaaassssee read this book.

Plus the book was easy to read, not because it had few pages, or graphs & charts ... but because it was spaced properly. More space was given around each word and between the lines.This was not something you noticed immediately - I had to read it in the book - but then when I compared it to other books - Dr, Levinson was right!

When I went through the first part of the book, I realized how many other things were all related to the same root problem. Dr. Levinson's book explained why our son couldn't tie his shoes yet, and is still learning at Age 7. It made it clear why he couldn't ride his bike without training wheels at 7 when the 4-year-old next door could fly down the street. We also understand why he struggles with writing even though the end result looks nearly perfect. We had almost written off the thought of dyslexia because our son became a fabulous reader almost overnight once he figured it out. He loves to read, but this book was still a life-changer. We used to spend hours working on homework that other children did in 15 minutes. After reading the book, we went to see Dr. Levinson. Literally, after one week on his treatment, our son was doing his work in half the time and without the tears that he used to have. Now about 4 months into his treatment, we are still improving measurably. We still have frustrating times, but they are far fewer in number and are less intense. Our son got straight As on his report card for the first time ever after about 7 weeks on the treatment. It has allowed him to share his intelligence that has always been there, but that he could not get out previously.Dr. Levinson has absolutely changed our lives. If you or your child struggle with balance, hitting a ball, riding a bike, reading, writing, memory, double vision, learning disabilities, or a litany of other things that nobody else can explain, I would highly recommend that you read this book and follow it up with a visit to Dr. Levinson.We waited a full year after reading the book before we made an appt.

Dizziness, fatigue, inattentiveness, and even depression have been my salient symptoms.I always was smarter than most kids throughout school until late in high school when I felt my cognitive capacity was declining rapidly.

The jacket told David's life history. We actually took David to Dr. Levinson for an evaluation and treatment. The week after we started him on the treatment, the school psychologist stopped me in the hallway and exclaimed how obvious it was that we had put David on Ritalin -- David was a totally different child! When I told the psychologist that David was taking over-the-counter generic pseudophedrine, he was shocked and disbelieving, but hopeful that perhaps this information could help other children. This episode began a personal crusade to explain Dr. Levinson's work to every parent I've encountered who has a child with one or more dyslexic symptoms. The book is excellent at explaining the root cause of the various manifestations of dyslexia. It clarifies the relationship of ADD and hyperactivity to learning disabilities and even phobias. I went on to read Phobia Free, Solution to the Riddle Dyslexia, and Total Concentration; however, Smart But Feeling Dumb is key reading for any parent, relative, and educator to understand how to help those who suffer from many seemingly disparate symptoms, such as motion sickness, allergies, and impulsivity. I believe that for some reason, the children of the Baby Boomer generation have a greater propensity towards these problems than the 20% quoted in the book and that many more people can benefit from Dr. Levinson's leading edge research."},{"Title":"Smart But Feeling Dumb","review":"This book allowed us to understand the symptoms we were observing &amp; diagnose our 6 year old daughter.

I struggled with the frustration and hopeless feelings that often accompany inner-ear impairment and dyslexia for many years. I've been a patient of Dr. Levinson since 1992 and can say without trepidation that my inner-ear(CVS) based comprehensive medical treatment has been a lifesaver. Before treatment, my many varied and severe CVS syptoms had literally paralyzed me. Simple tasks like driving a car or riding a bike became extremely difficult. My mental faculties were so clouded that learning seemed almost impossible.Anyone who believes that dyslexia and related CVS symptoms are not treatable should read and understand Dr. Levinson's writings.

He is also gifted. Dr. Levinson has been the final key to helping my son break through his disability and love learning again. Dr. Levinson's book is for every parent and health provider not satisfied with the current and prevailing philosophy that dyslexia is a single symptom disability, and that learning disabilities in general are to be treated with one or two drugs and/or behavorial therapies, and that's all there is, and we're sorry, there is nothing else we can do. Dyslexia can be debilitating, not so much because of it's symptoms, but because of its effect on the dyslexic and his/her family, friends, teachers, etc. Dyslexics view themselves as flawed humans, inferior to others, yet they are often the brightest, most enlightened and creative humans among us. Dr. Levinson's medical premise is that dyslexia is due to an imbalance in the inner ear. Treat the cause, he suggests, don't just treat the symptoms. He outlines his approach through case histories and before and after results to his therapy.

They told me that he would have trouble learning to read. I did not believe them, as he was an extremely bright child with an above average IQ (as per tests, and as everyone kept telling me.) Well, they were right, and I was wrong. He did have tremendous difficulty learning to read.We spent time and money on tutors, made him practice reading (which he hated). Absolutely no results. After a session of sensory integration therapy (correctly done), he suddenly read fluently and quickly. This only lasted for a couple of hours, at most a day, then he would regress to reading very, very slowly and stumbling over the words. In the end, sensory integration therapy was only partly helpful, as the effects of therapy were not long-term, however sensory integration therapy is still in its very early stages, with therapists mainly using a \\"trial and error\\" method (each therapist I saw diagnosed him differently).However, the link is definitely there. I saw my son reading fluently after a SI session, it was like a light switch - on/off. The problem being that it seemed to switch off after a certain amount of time. His behavior also underwent a dramatic change after therapy - for the same limited amount of time. He was calm, happy, and easy to deal with. I suspect that when they come up with a way for parents to do this therapy easily at home - every day - we will have seen a \\"cure\\" to these neurologically based problems."},{"Title":"Smart But Feeling Dumb","review":"I had given up.

This book convinced me to go to Dr. Levinson with my son when he was in grade 6 and he went from a grade 2.6 reading level to a grade 6 reading level in 3 months. His teachers and our family were amazed.

Yet, the primary proponent of this treatment for learning disabilities remains extremely busy evaluating and treating these children.Neurophysiological Approaches (a critique) Author:? Larry B. Silver, M.D.International Dyslexia Association: Perspectives (info) Printed Date: Spring 2001 vol 27(3)Cerebellar - Vestibular DysfunctionSeveral investigators have suggested that the vestibular system is important in learning. They claim that there is a causal relationship between vestibular disorders and poor academic performance involving reading and written language in children with Learning Disabilities. Ayres, (1973), Frank and Levinson (1973), and Levinson (1980) suggest that such children require a specialized therapy before they can benefit from academic input. DeOuiros (1971) and Levinson (1984) suggest that evidence of a vestibular disorder is predictive of learning disabilities and that therapy can prevent these disabilities.In recent years, Levinson has published several books on the causative role of the vestibular and vestibular-cerebellar systems in learning disabilities. He proposes the treatment of dyslexia with anti-motion sickness medication to correct the vestibular dysfunction. No research is cited in his books to support his theory or the effectiveness of his treatment. His books refer to his clinical observations and case examples. In one book (Levinson, 1984), he proposes multiple other interventions along with the anti-motion sickness medication, including many other types of medication plus special education.The role of the vestibular system in the higher cortical functions required for academic performance is not known. Some of the symptoms generally associated with learning disabilities (faulty eye movements, poor postural coordination, poor balance, and poor spatial orientation) could be indicative of vestibular disorder. Such symptoms, however, are only indirect evidence for vestibular dysfunction. The most prorninent objective sign of vestibular involvement is nystagmus (spasmodic, rapid movement of the eyeball from side to side).The hypothesis that there is a relationship between vestibular function and the academic learning of reading and written language comes chiefly from the authors noted. Ayres used the Southern California Postrotary Nystagmus Test. In this test, the child is rotated in alighted room with eyes open, which provides both visual and vestibular stimulation. Thus, it may not be a valid test of vestibular function. Frank and Levinson, used \\"blurring speed\\" as evidence for abnormal vestibular function. This was described as the speed at which words passing across the visual field can no longer be recognized. But, because this involves the passing of stimuli across the subject's visual field at varying speeds, it constitutes visual stimulation, not vestibular.Consequently, none of the work of these investigators has provided conclusive evidence for vestibular dysfunction in individuals with learning disabilities. These data could possibly be interpreted as evidence of visual dysfunction. Other studies on vestibular dysfunction in children with learning disabilities have reported negative or equivocal results as well.A study by Polatajko (1985) investigated the relationship between children's vestibular function and academic learning using well-defined criteria for learning disabilities and exact measurements of vestibular activity. The evaluation of vestibular function consisted of examination of calibration records, search for spontaneous and gaze nystagmus, testing smooth pursuit, and vestibular and optokinetic testing. Vestibular nystagmus was induced by a rotating chair. No significant differences either in the inbsity of vestibular responsivity or in the prevalence of vestibular dysfunction were found between the normal learning children and children with learning disabilities. There was no evidence that children having low, average, or high vestibular responsivity differed significantly on measures of academic performance. There was no significant correlation between measures of vestibular function and measures of academic performance.In summary, there is no current evidence supporting the theory of vestibular dysfunction nor supporting the proposed treatment approaches. Yet, the primary proponent of this treatment for learning disabilities remains extremely busy evaluating and treating these children.(...)"},{"Title":"Analytic Number Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Vol. 177)","review":"This book is somewhat in the spirit of Aigner and Ziegler's &quot;Proofs from the Book&quot;: short, clear proofs of important results in Analytic Number Theory. My favorite parts are (1) the &quot;natural&quot; proof of the non-vanishing of L-series, which really does make it look inevitable; (2) the Crazy Dice, a simple and surprising example of the power that generating functions provide when you switch your viewpoint between formal power series and the functions they represent.To some extent the author keeps the proofs short by leaving out steps, so you'll need to read it with pencil and paper nearby to work out the missing steps. The first printing was loaded with typographical errors; most (not all) of these are corrected in the 2000 second printing. Unfortunately not all the remaining typos are obviously typos; this combined with the brevity can make the exposition hard to follow. The first printing was fascinating (for its content) and exasperating (for its typos); the second printing is still fascinating, and occasionally exasperating."},{"Title":"Analytic Number Theory (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Vol. 177)","review":"I find this book exceptionally clear. It's the thinnest GTM text I've ever seen, but there is a lot of material there.It's true that this book doesn't have a comprehensive treatment of analytic number theory, I like the other reviewer's analogy of an appendix to generatingfunctionology--this book does focus primarily on sequences and generating functions. However, it is a very clear, fun, and easy to read book. The book's thinness may be misleading; there is plenty of explanatory prose, motivation, discussion, and proofs are generally pretty easy to follow.The revised printing does correct many errors, but I was still able to find some (and I suspect this means there are a lot more than I was able to find).

People involved in the occult, or people who don't believe in the occult, will probably both dismiss the book without reading it. However, the story is so rich, detailed, thrilling, and genuinely heartfelt, that I would recommend it even if you aren't a Christian.At the same time, although it saddens me to do so, I must agree with some other reviewers that the story is very detailed in its descriptions of the deepest, darkest areas of spirituality, and it raises a lot of questions (even though it answers many as well). It may upset you if you aren't strong in your heart, or are otherwise struggling in your own journey. The book ends with a positive message, but I believe putting undue weight on certain aspects of the story could severely and negatively affect a person's world view and/or emotional state.I don't mean to say to outright distrust the author, like some have said. But remember that he is just a man, like you and me, with motives, emotions, thoughts, and beliefs. I suggest reading the book from that position; taking a trip through a man's life, then at the end you can challenge the authenticity of what you've just experienced by doing your own research.

More of a knee-jerk Chicken Little scenario of impending DOOM. I read it anyway and was a bit depressed that people actually *buy* this as a reality. Life is good, don't waste it with this tripe. Much like a braggart pulling others down to push themselves up, this books makes Christians look bad in their attempt to put other religions down.Satan is a character in Christian Myth. People who follow earth religions have no desire to create and honor a fictitious evil being by giving it the power of their belief. Nor do they blame *him* for their misdeeds and bad choices. Native American Indians, Pagans, Wiccans, and the rest have to take responsibility for their actions, rather than placing blame elsewhere. It's a very child-like concept to people whose beliefs do not have a central evil deity. The Devil made me do it does not hold up in court or in reality, just in movies and books.He's your devil, it's your hell...you burn in it, etc. I have read &quot;Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie&quot; by this same author and it was equally misinformed. More of the same &quot;You believe what *I* believe or you'll burn in my hell.&quot; type of stuff.

It ranks right up there with the Sean Sellers story in that the author has done no research at all on what Satanism truly is, instead just relying on his own concept of what it might be like if all those 70's and 80's horror films were true.I weep for all those people, Christian or not, that believe this book has any truth within its pages because it doesn't.

No doubt there will be many scoffers but this is a book on a subject which we ignore at our peril.The book is written from an autobiographical perspective, although the author's wife also has some input. Readers are presented with a detailed, in depth account of the experiences of this husband and wife &quot;team&quot; who were involved in numerous areas of the occult including satanism, witchcraft, wicca and vampirism to mention but a few. Their involvement is described with many confirmatory references which reveal the senior positions and levels that they &quot;attained&quot; during such involvement.The reality of these &quot;spiritual realms of darkness&quot; emanate from the pages of this book which reveal the depth and extent to which a plethora of occultic practices have permeated all levels of our society, including sadly some elements of the church.The book begins as the writer accounts his experiences of human &quot;vampirism&quot; where he describes that &quot;you have no idea what it is like to awaken to the need for the taste of blood in your mouth&quot;. Thus begins the description of this &quot;voyage&quot; into darkness and deceit in pursuit of &quot;power&quot; and what was thought to be the &quot;truth&quot;. A journey that will horrify and disturb many readers, who will likewise be astounded at the degree to which the occult has spread and how even &quot;human sacrifice&quot; is still practised in certain quarters.The immense amount of detail and dimensions of the experiences described in this book are impossible to cover in a review. Suffice to say that a terrifying descent &quot;headlong into hell&quot; began to come &quot;off the rails&quot; one day when this satanist came across an envelope containing his bank statement and a series of processed cheques relating to the &quot;church of satan&quot;. One cheque had been endorsed on the back with the words &quot;I'll be praying for you in Jesus' name&quot;. Although this was instantly dismissed, the writer's occultic powers began to cease and he was left feeling weak, sick and exhausted.From this point on we are presented with the account of a &quot;new&quot; journey which ultimately results in this husband and wife partnership both becoming &quot;born again&quot; Christians. A detailed account which is very moving and which shows clearly the Power of Deliverance through Jesus Christ. A revelation that no matter how far anyone has travelled along the road to depravity, there is still hope and Deliverance. An amazing true story which will elevate those in the darkest depths of depression.Basing all comments upon a wealth of personal experience, the book declares that all satanists, irrespective of the type of their involvement, are ultimately vulnerable human beings who are victims of deceit and delusion by the master deceiver himself. The book elaborates in chapter 15 that whilst their practices are to be deplored, the Salvation of the individual is to be prayed for. That such individuals should also be compassionately treated as people who are often wounded emotionally and/or physically and that they should not be treated as pariahs as regrettably some churches do. The book declares that the Power of the Blood of Jesus Christ can truly &quot;save to the uttermost&quot;.In addition to this astonishing true story, the book also documents the route to Deliverance for those who wish to be freed from the shackles of the occult. For those who become disturbed whilst beginning to read this book I would personally encourage them to persevere. The story is true and the message is essential to our times. An excellent book."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"This book shows what should be obvious to anyone with some knowledge of witchcraft: occult knowledge is no knowledge at all, just a mess of tricks performed by demons to entrap people in a continuous search of power, fueled by greed, lust and selfishness. People jump from one kind of occult philosophy to another, losing their identities in the process and becoming slaves of whatever \\"magus\\" or \\"high priest\\" is in control of that occult group. After some time, people lose their will and start doing anything their spirits tell them to do.This is total slavery, and it is surprising that those people think that occultism gives them supreme freedom and that Christianity is a religion of passive dumb people !Living in Brazil and having relatives involved in voodoo , I am very well familiar with the power of evil spirits and the disastrous consequences of dealing with them.This excellent book shows to Americans that evil spirits are not the \\"privilege\\" of Third World countries, but that they very well established in the USA.The best part is the wonderful story of how the author was freed by God from the hands of Satan. When God wants someone, nothing can prevent Him from doing His will.Don't bother about the negative reviews...it is pretty obvious that those people didn't even read the book, they are withches who got together to downgrade the ratings of this book and especially the other excellent book from the same author about Wicca. Read it and draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"Let me begin by saying that I do not intend to discuss the question of whether these events really happened. Despite the fact that other 'born-again' Christian accounts of previous satanic involvement have not stood up to scrutiny (sadly, you just can't trust anyone these), I assume that everything Schnoebelen claims to have happened either did happen or at least he thinks it did.As such there are a few things to note. First, there are some rather peculiar claims that he makes about his achievements. I am a mathematician, and I have only a few classes left before I am ABD (all but dissertation accomplished for a doctorate) so I will single out one claim in particular. He says that when he met 'Aquarius' (Michael Bertiaux), this person told him that before being consecrated a gnostic bishop he would have to undergo a comprehensive examination on Russell's 'Principia Mathematica.' He was consecrated a few weeks later.That's absurd. The Principia Mathematica is a nigh-impossible book which is something like 2000 pages long. It takes 300 pages to prove that 1+1=2! This is not a book that someone with a background in music and possibly theology is going to be able to sit down and bang through and then take a comprehensive exam in under a month. Very few mathematicians could do it! So either no such exam happened, or else Aquarius didn't require real knowledge of the math (which would not be surprising; go to any bookstore and look at the popular books on physics and you'll find New Age occult types claiming to have mastered quantum mechanics - they're full of it).And I don't think this guy is a math expert. He states in one chapter that if trying to witness to a satanist, point out to them that for satanic author, the author might be telling the truth, or blend the truth with lies, or be lying entirely, or be mistaken. He then states that since there are four possibilities there is 'at best a 75% of being deceived.' It doesn't take a mathematics expert to observe that not all four possibilities are of equal probability! If I say 'tomorrow either we will be hit with an asteroid killing 90% of humanity or we won't be,' does this mean that it is 50/50? (I guess also, there's at least a 75% chance that Schnoebelen is wrong in his book)!Furthermore, there's no such thing as 'Russell's Principia Mathematica.' The Principia was co-authored by Russell and Whitehead. I mention this because this book has a tendency to gloss over details... which leads to:Schnoebelen writes in a very confusing way about which organizations he was involved in, how he was involved, and the like. Anyone reading might assume he had been made a Roman Catholic priest, a gnostic bishop, and a Russian Orthodox bishop. Well...1. He was never a Roman Catholic priest. He was made a priest in a fringe group which was not in communion with the Vatican.2. It is not clear who chrismated him into Orthodoxy, but I suspect it is the same story for him as for his mentor Bertiaux, whose lines of succession can be viewed online. B. was brought into the Roman Catholic succession and into the Russian Orthodox succession by a 'wandering bishop.' A 'wandering bishop' is someone who has been ordained in a ceremony but is not in communion with the parent Church. Often, wandering bishops owe their ordinations to other wandering bishops. And in fact, while the Vatican recognizes such ordinations as 'valid but illicit' due to their wide-spread application of 'ex opere operare,' the Orthodox believe that no ordination can occur outside the Orthodox communion, AND they believe that if a person leaves the communion or engages in heretical teaching (such as modern gnosticism) the ordination is forfeited (Catholics believe that ordinations are indelible, but Orthodox do not).So he was never in the Roman Catholic communion as a clergyman, and if he was in the Orthodox communion at all, it was only for a few moments while he was ordained and then he lost that communion by teaching the heresies of gnosticism and satanism! But to listen to him, you would think that he was in full communion with both the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox. This is simply not true!In fact, wandering bishops tend to accumulate 'multiple lines' (of course, their claims to Orthodox lines are denied by the true Orthodox for the reasons stated above: even if their initial ordination was valid, they lose it if they go outside the communion, and any ordinations done outside the communion are viewed as not being ordinations at all), and pass on multiple lines at once. Thus Bertiaux received several 'lines' in a single day according to succession lists I have viewed.He also cannot keep straight the doctrines of these Churches. He claims for example that the Orthodox teach that in changing from bread and wine to the Body and Blood, nine pints of the Blood of Christ are miraculously contained in the Chalice (he says the Catholics teach this too). I asked an Orthodox priest who is a friend of mine about this (without telling him the source or why I wanted to know) and he said that this is definitely not an Orthodox teaching! As far as I can tell, it isn't even a Catholic teaching. The Orthodox do teach that even the smallest amount of the transformed bread and wine, when eaten, gives full participation in the Body and Blood of Christ. Perhaps this is where Schnoebelen became confused. But if we can't trust him to keep this kind of thing straight, how can we trust him to keep anything else straight about the beliefs of these Churches?This would not be such a problem except that Schnoebelen is so staunchly against Catholicism and Orthodoxy on the basis of his experience with these fringe groups which aren't even Catholic or Orthodox for the most part. Old Catholicism is no more Roman Catholicism than Lutheranism is (although Old Catholicism tends to be closer in form). Plus there's several branches of the Old Catholics (or more, perhaps), and the branch he got involved in was _very_ out there according to those who have investigated his story. And apart from gnostic iconography he appears to have had little to do with the Orthodox (of course, gnostic iconography is derived from Orthodox iconography, but it is not precisely the same thing). He may have been initiated in the vampire cult in an Orthodox Church, but the description sounds like a gnostic one (I have at least read of the 'little closed up chapel out back' being in a gnostic Church area, just as his initiation was described).In addition, for those who think this will be: 'wow, a vampire saved by Jesus!' it is more like 'a vampire, who didn't really want to be one anymore, was prayed for by a bank clerk, and became... a mormon!' That's right - for several years after his vampirism he was a mormon before being converted to the protestant doctrine of sola scriptura by reading, not Scripture, but... Chick comics! Although he said he converted because of reading Romans and Galatians, he said he 'compared them to the comics,' that is, he interpreted them as Baptists interpret them. In fact at his 'moment of conversion' he did not reach to the Bible but to the Chick comic for instructions (which explains why he didn't find the instruction 'by works a man is justified, and not by faith alone' or that the Lord gave His Apostles the authority to forgive sins, both of which are taught in the Bible)! I find it ironic given that much of his point in this book seems to be 'the teachings of the Apostolic Churches are false! Sola Scriptura!' but at this crucial moment he prefers the comic...Oh and while a mormon, he wrote a stunning and emotional apology (defense) of them, declaring how he could barely stand after his ordination, he had felt so much power, and the like (it is available online)... very similar to how he now gushes about his new-found faith.Don't get me wrong, I am very glad that he has gotten out of the satanism (and mormonism) but I wouldn't take his criticisms of the RC and Orthodox seriously for even a moment..."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"William's true story of being delivered out of the arms of Satan into the arms of the Lord Jesus Christ is fantastic.

But this book, unfortunately, is a shame. The author is unbelievably limited not only culturally, but morally as well. It doesn't take long to understand that he doesn't have a strong foundation and just keeps \\"changing sides\\" in religions and sects (and always keeping the same way of thinking), all the while claiming the others are wrong and bad. Of course, he is always correct.There are incredible distortions and half-truths, always trying to judge, condemn and destroy the image of everyone and everything that doesn't belong to his current affiliation. Check some dates related to Transcendental Meditation (which I don't care about), for example. Check some psychological concepts mentioned in the book (Reich and Jung, which, by the way, I don't defend) that are quite distorted here.One thing that really bothers me in this book is the constant use of subliminal messages. The author, for example, is constantly making extremely loose associations of anything or anyone he is directing his aggression to with someone or something satanic, never addressing the issue directly. We know very well whose way is this. Christians don't need that. Everything should be dealt with directly and by means of truth. You can't change sides and continue to act the same way. Only because you are able to make thousands of Bible citations it doesn't make you a better person. The way this book is written is the same way a book attacking Christianity could be, because of its questionable methods. Since the very author mentions the infiltration of satanic personnel in religious organizations, I got somewhat worried about it.I guess there is some useful information in the book, but after a while I had to become suspicious of everything said.May God bless him that the author becomes a real Christian someday. Anyway, the subject is really important and there are better and more serious books on spiritual warfare.

When people enter \\"Soft Sciences\\" I have noticed they put their faith in themselves instead of truelly investigating if there is a true god.

The other 18 were about the ever-inticing walk into the \\"dark side\\". The book has very detailed information about the \\"dark side\\", the accuracy of which can only be known by the initiates. In faith discussions it is useful to know something of the other belief systems, but it is equally or perhaps more important to know and understand the position you claim to represent. I would have appreciated more details on how his conversion to Christianity has changed his life.Another negative in my opinion is a bit of Catholic bashing, which is common to other Chick Publications I have seen (such as Death Cookie). Though the author reveals that along his life he has been one of the hypocrites (for example simultaneously moving through the Wicca ranks and the Old Catholic Church) that turn others away from Christ, which means that it isn't the insitution's fault but the sinners within."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"For anyone that thinks they know about what goes on in the life of a satanist, they have no idea until they read this book and see how the writer of the book realized there is greater power in Jesus Christ, and Christ is more powerful than any spiritual being hands down.

His understanding of the nature of occult magic, its philosophies, and theologies resembles nothing to that of traditional western occultism (i.e. Theosophy, Qabalah, Crowley, Levi, the Golden Dawners (both original and contemporary), Bardon, etc.) His experience is fringe and basically off topic to occultism in general.He associated with some groups that resemble western occultism in symbolism, language, and some theory, but are not traditional mystery schools. From a traditional occult paradigm, Schnoebelen was involved with teachings that mixed truth with lies. It's understandable why he'd want to leave them.Just as Satanism is a religion made in response to Christianity, so was converting to Christianity for Schnoebelen a response to his involvement with Satanism. He went from one religious, fundamentalist extreme to the other. His new crazy cult is fundamentalist/pentecostal Christianity. When will Schnoebelen think for himself?But a good read... If you want to hear about his first hand encounter with the science fiction character Cthulhu when he was in grade school, his dabbling with \\"The Greater Key of Solomon\\" in college, his Satanic, urine filled rituals, and his polygamous sex act to try and find the holy grail, buy this book. It really is entertaining."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"One thing that stands out from these low star reviews is the fact that the authors of these reviews have not read Schnoebelen's books. How can you say that a person who worked in the occult for more than a decade has not done his research? A good review argues the point, whether or not you agree with a book. I do not see that happening here. Antagonists only loose themselves in a frenzy of personal attacks on the author and vague, general criticism. Reviews are subjective ofcourse, but if you have a point to make please be specific so people know what you're talking about. Writing reviews in a vain attempt to be funny and attacking a paradigm you don't agree with instead of specifically commenting on the novel in question is not what this forum is meant for. You make yourself look stupid.. no one else. As for Schoebelen's writing: I have written a review on it before and I stick by it."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"I found this book both frightening,and inspirational.Truly the most interesting book I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"Brother William Schnoebelen has a great testimony for anyone that's been involved in Freemasonry, Wicca, Traditional Satanism and other occult organizations because he's been in a lot of them.

The book in its entirety is a testimony of an illuminist/satanist/vampire/witch/mason who was headed to eternal condemnation being saved by the grace of God through Jesus Christ.This man started out as a regular person but became involved in white witchcraft, freemasonry, laveyan satanism, branches of Roman Catholicism, hardcore satanism, the illuminati, vampirism, mormonism and finally being saved by Jesus Christ.These activities are going on all over the globe, in secret. God has been gracious to call out a number of people from the highest levels of the Satanic underground to testify what is going on. It's unfortunate when people mock at them but there will always be mockers. Let the mockers mock and the hearers hear.Christians should be aware that Satan's kingdom is more widespread and organized and more influential than they realize and very secretive. The media sure as heck aren't going to tell you anything because the media is on their side. But Christians should understand that the Holy Spirit in them is infinitely more powerful.For those who say that this book is fantasy, it's not. The truth is we're living in deception right now.

He is a genuine believer in Jesus Christ and has seen and experienced the dark and hidden side of Satan's world system. I also found useful his insights into sharing Jesus Christ with witches and other occult practitioners. This is important considering there are many of them in the United States. The book is also encouraging to a Christian who may fear those who are in the occult. He claims that these people need the gospel of Christ and that many will respond to it if only a believer will share with them. The book also gives a clear explaination what the Bible means when it says to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (John 3:16). I also like his statement in the book that one drop of the blood of Jesus is more powerful than all the power that Satan has. I recommend this book to Christians who want the truth about the occult from a Biblical perspective. I also recommend it for all who are now involved in the occult and are seeking to know more about Christ and the Bible."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"An anointed book revealing the deep dark forces that awaits anyone playing with the occult. It grips you like a fiction book until the very last page. Even the seemingly innocent practice of Halloween will open the door to demons. The first consequence of not believing in God is well, to believe in anything. Bill believed in anything because the church is not doing what Jesus has told it to do, go into the entire world and preach the Gospel. Reach the lost at any cost, the time is almost over. You can't please people and this world if you want to do God's will. Jesus said the whole world will hate you because of Him so don't expect a smooth ride. Satan wants to destroy you and only Jesus can put the devil under you. It's a war out there.

This is not usually alarming, until one delves into the details:At various points, Schnobelen has claimed to be a high-ranking member of various faith groups. However, many of those groups do not have any record of his participation or enrollment, and many of them don't even offer the services he claims to have obtained.Further, there are at least three *mutually exclusive* groups that he was, apparently, enrolled in or participating in simultaneously.His claims to have 'attained high rank' in several religious groups are laughable at best. He also claims to have become a Wiccan high priest in about six to eight months; I am Wiccan myself -- it takes *years* of study and practice before one can take on the role of a high priest.Please, for your own good, do *not* read this book."},{"Title":"Lucifer Dethroned","review":"I bought this book last summer (1998) and once I started reading it, I found it hard to put down.

Wardrobe's and Magic have been inextricably linked since C.S. Lewis (c.f. the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) and in this book the tradition continues.The illustrations are as usual delightful and the prose is beautifully expressive of the magic that always seems to exist between the very old and the very young (the Old Dancer and Tanya), between those who share a love of something greater than themselves (dance), and the magic of dress-up (whether in the theater or the play room).Our own ballerina asked for this story to be read three times the day we brought it home, and has asked for it again every day since.

Without appropriate content a book is a virtual wasteland after which the disillusioned reader feels as though he has sojourned in the desert, and, having encountered numerous mirages that promised but failed to provide relief, finds himself parched in spirit and soul with no oasis in sight.This book will elicit the full gamut of emotions as well as provide a welcome array of spiritual and intellectual stimuli. The main character, Hugh Sutherland, is introduced as a congenial young man who wishes no more than to make his way in the world. After the death of his father he is forced by financial constraints to seek employment in order to complete his education. This employment is, of course, as a tutor on a small Scottish estate where he encounters the estate foreman or steward, David Elginbrod and his daughter, Margaret or Maggie.Sutherland finds the Elginbrod family, although Christian in word and deed, to his liking when compared with the severe and mean manner of his employer. As a result, he finds himself at the Elginbrod cottage whenever time will permit, and begins tutoring both father and daughter. Although Hugh believes himself to be the educator, he will learn as he matures and discovers the various trials and tribulations that lie in his path that it was David, not he, who was, in fact, the real tutor.MacDonald has excelled in the characters of David and Margaret Elginbrod, while providing a practical application of their teachings in the lives of Hugh Sutherland and those with whom he comes in contact.Not only an exceptional spiritual work, David Elginbrod weaves a tale of ghosts, mysticism, the supernatural, and love in such a manner as to be both educational, spiritually-uplifting, and spellbinding. My sole regret was when I encountered the final page. I was prepared to begin anew.I invite you to join Hugh Sutherland as he learns that it is not position, education, prominence, or power that makes a man, but the willingness to serve, with joy and humility, his fellowman thereby doing his Father's will."},{"Title":"David Elginbrod,","review":"With such an amazing perception of human nature (complete with lumps and hard angles we all have but many authors ignore) George makes the characters live outside of the paper it is written on.

Watch out for the...&quot; Of course you feel silly talking to the book but great ones will do that to a person, and assuredly, this is a great book.

I wouldn't say I didn't, but I found it very difficult to read. I held out to the bitter end because I sensed that there was something great here, but I must confess that I was very lost for pages at a time at certain points.As most of the other reviewers have mentioned, I was drawn to Golding's other books (this and The Spire) by my experience with The Lord of the Flies. I recognize that this book may be no less of a masterpiece, but it's unfortunate that it is so inaccessible. I believe that worthwhile things are worth the expenditure of time and effort but, unfortunately, the nature of the modern world is that we don't have unlimited resources to spend on every literary work we come across. So, for good or for bad, the more accessible ones usually win out.I do think I'll hold on to the book and give it a try again sometime down the road, but I have to say it wasn't one of my more memorable reading experiences (as Lord of the Flies definitely was many years ago when I was a youth).I'm reading The Spire now, and much of what I have said about The Inheritors above goes for that book, as well. I'm not through with Golding, though. I intend to seek out yet others of his novels to see what else he had to say."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Had I known how difficult THE INHERITORS was going into it, I probably wouldn't have read it. Please understand that when I say \\"difficult\\", I don't mean \\"mildly challenging\\", I mean \\"one of the four or five hardest novels I've read in my entire life\\"; if you can picture a version of Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury: The Corrected Textin which Benjy, instead of merely being the point of view character for the first quarter of the book, serves the same function for 90% of it, you'll have some idea of what I'm talking about.William Golding was a writer of enormous imagination and subtlety; he requires readers of this novel to empathize with the protagonist, Lok, in a fashion and to a degree that, as far as I'm aware, is unprecedented in fiction. He also never lets the narrative slip into the kind of facile misanthropy that I suspect a lesser writer would. Having said that, it would be disingenuos of me to suggest that I enjoyed this more than I would have if a skilled writer of popular fiction had handled the same subject. THE INHERITORS was, in sum, a fascinating story that for me was largely drained of pleasure by the effort required to figure out what the hell was going on. I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone who isn't prepared to tackle a very challenging piece of work."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Another cautionary tale of the great capacity of Homo Sapiens to destroy, plunder, and feel guilty about it all at the same time.The writing, as is typical with Golding, is sculptured and evocative."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I looked at this book from the perspective of its title. There is a question of the fate of the Neanderthals, and this book gives one possible, and credible answer. The Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnon were very, very different, according to Golding.The Neanderthals were simple, crude, and gentle, but with an understanding of their own mortality, and employing rituals for important occasions. They may have gone around unclothed, and with minimal tools, sometimes walking on all fours, but they were not \\"animals\\" in the common meaning of that term.The Cro-Magnon people had already been building boats, had used the bow-and-arrow as a formidable weapon, developed a more complex social structure, knew how to ferment honey into liquor, and had an understanding of protection against the elements. These two peoples never seemed to develop a common view of each other, with the Neanderthal having more curiosity than fear, and more fear than curiosity from the Cro-Magnon. In all, a credible look at ancient peoples."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"When asked to read this book my first reaction was, it looks so old, it can't be good. As i started to read it i found it different from all other books that i had read. The book is slow at the start but it does become more interesting as the author discribes the way the world is seen by Neanderthal man; 'pictures' are memories and they believe logs are alive and have a mind of their own. William Golding's view point on their world is really an eye opener and this is a book that should be read by all. Inspiring!"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I found this to be a very disjointed, and often confusing, description of the clash between two human groups. Golding missed a good opportunity to create a compelling case that the Neanderthals could not compete with the new, more advanced, humans."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"To approach this story as any other is to board a train going the wrong direction. Before reading the first page you have to understand that this tale begins before human intelligence, and that every thought, every sight, sound, smell, taste, and feeling is a simple interpretation by a lower order of being. Just as many have spoken of much of what is written in the Bible as things interpretted by those less technologically advanced as ourselves, Golding endeavors to strip away a million years of evolution and learning and to think like a neanderthal. To enjoy the book the reader must do the same.This is the tale of the extinction of a species and their lack of understanding of what is happening. In that the book is very contemporary. The neanderthals attempt to understand; to put what they see into ideas they can understand, just as we do the same today. Golding bears that philosophical point like a club. However, reading the thoughts of a primitive beast, as interpretted by Golding, isn't so easy as one would think and the story tends to be as hard to follow as a mountain trail. In the end though, I think it's a story worth reading."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"A friend recommended this to me because I'm doing a thesis in philosophy of language and she felt I'd be interested in a book written from a Neanderthal point of view. She believed The Inheritors argued the Neanderthals were unable to compete against Cro Magnon men because their language didn't have words for cause-and-effect concepts, only static images. \\"Now there's a man holding a stick in his hand. Now there's a stick coming through the air at me. Now my arm hurts and is bleeding.\\" Cro Magnon man, by contrast, would describe the same incident as \\"A man attacked me with a spear\\". This is an exciting and ingenious idea.Unfortunately I found this book too slow, immensely difficult to follow at times and I thoroughly disliked the main character, the cowardly, boastful and ineffectual Lok. Had the brave and much smarter Fa been the main character I suspect I would've stuck with it. As it was I gave up halfway through and skipped to the last 2 chapters. I would've liked to see more from the point of view of the Cro Magnons.I get the impression that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from people who approve of the misanthropic viewpoint. \\"Yes! humans ARE vicious, fearful, evil, always destroying the gentle and innocent\\". Some humans are like that, most are not."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"But at some points there is just way to much to take in. Although the plot is very interesting and the characters and scene are well developed, you have to be very dedicated to reading this novel. In some sections it can be very difficult to understand what is going on at all.

Told almost entirely from the viewpoint of Lok, a slightly dim Neanderthal \\"with many words and no pictures,\\" it's an interesting story and a sad one. But the power of the tale is softened considerably by Golding's laborious, descriptive prose. At times I found it very hard to understand what was going on, as the Homo sapiens' activities - drinking wine, portaging boats, arguing - were described in Lok's limited terms at length, with little clarity. Discounting those passages, the novel was a good one, capped off quite amazingly with passages in two more narrative voices. First we see Lok as a hairy \\"creature,\\" an \\"it,\\" and then finally we hear the story from the view of one of the humans, who, it turns out, are as scared and confused as the Neanderthals, whom they consider fierce devils. A skillful comment on how far humans have come from a natural state of innocence, acceptance and wonder."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding takes us back to one of the earliest clashes between Homo sapiens and another culture, that of Homo neanderthalensis. In doing so, Golding seems to be pointing out that humanity's distrust of, and often violent response to, alien beings and ideas goes back a long, long time. The Neanderthals are the protagonists for most of this story and we see virtually all the action through their minds. They have a different way of thinking about the world in which they live and in communicating about it. They are the innocents who have the misfortune to encounter an encampment of Cro Magnon men. At the very end, Golding switches the point of view to the Cro Magnons and provides us with a different take on events.As a teacher, I've found this to be a terrific novel for teaching about the clash of cultures, fearing what we don't understand, different ways of seeing, thinking about and imagining the world in which we live. Students never fail to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors tells the story of a small group of Neanderthals, primarily focusing on Lok and Fa, as they encounter strange \\"new people\\" who walk upright, have little body hair, shoot pointed twigs through the air, and ride across the water on hollow logs. The Neanderthal tribe includes a young girl and a baby (\\"the new one\\") who end up with the new people. Lok and Fa must face their fears of the new people as they try to bring the girl and baby home.The word that kept coming to mind as I read and thought about this book was \\"clever.\\" Writing about life from the Neanderthal perspective poses a challenge, and Golding used some clever devices to describe the limitations of primitive beings. Golding's Neanderthals communicate by gesture and empathy as much as by language. Their names are simple compared to the polysyllabic names of the humans. The Neanderthals live very much in the here and now; they aren't good at planning; when they talk about doing something new they say they have a \\"picture\\" of it, as if they are having a vision. They search for food only when they feel hunger; if they're sated they don't bother to store food for the future. They prefer not to eat meat but they will if one animal has been killed by another; they don't want the \\"blame\\" of causing an animal's death. They have a touching burial ritual but they don't appear to contemplate the possibility of an afterlife.A startling event occurs toward the end of the novel that makes the whole thing rather depressing, particularly for those who (perhaps unrealistically) expect humans to behave more civilly than Neanderthals. Golding may be saying that the simple decency of primitive life was supplanted by early humans who (like those who followed them) lacked respect for other forms of life, killed ruthlessly, and used their wits to advance at the expense of others. If Golding is saying that these are human traits, the product of an evolutionary imperative, I don't know that the point is particularly profound (although it might have seemed so in 1955 when the book was first published). Still, the story illustrates that lesson in an entertaining way. The last chapter shifts to the point of view of the humans: again, a clever way to distinguish between the dying past and the evolving present, and a device that adds insight by demonstrating that the human's view of the Neanderthal may not have been much different than the Neanderthal's view of the human.According to the cover blurb, some critics think The Inheritors is Golding's best work (and Golding apparently thought so himself). I preferLord of the Flies, but The Inheritors is worth reading. I would give it 4 1/2 stars is Amazon made that option available."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Lord of the Flies is of course among the toughest acts to follow, and though this second William Golding novel does not match its immortal greatness, it is excellent in itself and would be many writers' best. Fans of Lord will most likely enjoy it, as the misanthropic viewpoint is carried over, and several themes are similar. However, in the first sign of the great diversity that would characterize Golding's fiction, The Inheritors is very different in setting, characters, dialogue, and nearly everything else.Where Lord made waves by using supposedly innocent children to illustrate evil, this focuses on an even more primitive group - the last surviving Neanderthals. Golding's skill truly comes into play here; he uses a limited narrative perspective, an extremely simple style, and broken dialogue to portray the Neanderthals' world. This is of course almost entirely speculative, but there is great verisimilitude; we see how Neanderthals' lives may have been in every aspect from speech to relationships to social functions. Golding pulls a brilliant trick by throwing us into the story with no introduction, leading many to assume primitive humans are featured. However, it eventually becomes clear that they are a prior step on evolution's ladder, which may first lead to strange surprise. Soon, though, we come to identify with them because of thoughts and feelings that, though far from civilized, are very much human; in particular, the depiction of love is one of literature's least conventional yet one of its most moving.The novel would be interesting for this alone, but it goes further by bringing in early modern humans and vividly dramatizing the ensuing conflict. As one might expect from an author with Golding's pessimistic reputation, the results are dark. Humans recklessly destroy the Neanderthals without realizing their significance or the magnitude of what they have done. They indeed fear the Neanderthals with superstition and ignorant assumptions that they are ostensibly too advanced to make. Along with lack of empathy, these factors get to the heart of Golding's bleak view of humanity, which is put forth less powerfully but more subtly than in Lord. Those stirred by the latter will find themselves agreeing again with Golding's tragic vision, while those who did not take to it for various reasons may be newly convinced.The unique style makes for difficult reading, especially early on, but I strongly encourage anyone having difficulty to persevere. As nearly always in such cases, it soon becomes nearly second nature, and the book is certainly great enough to be worth it. Highly emotional yet extremely thought-provoking, this is one of the rare works that can make one think as easily as it can make one cry. This combination is the key to Golding's greatness, and The Inheritors is a preeminent example."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Since reading \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" I've stumbled over other Golding titles in hopes I would find the same brevity, clarity, and thought-provoking concepts. \\"The Spire\\" came close, but lacked the imaginative setting. \\"Pincher Martin\\" had the setting, but became so myopic as to be disorienting, eventually losing its footing.Along comes \\"The Inheritors.\\" Reviews here gave mixed signals: \\"A mess.\\" \\"A work of genius.\\" \\"Bored to tears.\\"As with Golding's bestselling masterpiece, \\"The Inheritors\\" pulls us quickly into the story of an isolated people. This time, instead of marooned school children, we discover Neanderthal types who are utterly believable and likeable. This alone shows Golding's genius. He makes us care about these characters and see them as people we can relate to, and yet he gives little by means of communication or description. They act like humans with true personalities. Soon, though, the group is threatened by another group of pale-skinned Others. These intruders seem equally bent on survival, but by more violent means if necessary.In many ways, this is an elongated short story. It could've been told in less pages, albeit with less ambience. While I admired the setting and characterization, I despaired for more plot, more action, more...something. In so many ways, this was a masterful book. In the end, however, it seemed to be a work of muddled beauty. It lacked impact. For those who love Golding's style, as I do, you will surely appreciate this book. For others, it may be a slight disappointment."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I too, am appalled by the number of ignorant, uninformed Amazon reviews of \\"The Inheritors\\" by William Golding. It must be his greatness that has created such a polarizing reaction. It's difficult for me to be objective, however, because I am in awe of this book, Golding's craft, and his work in general (I have also read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Darkness Visible\\"). However incomprehensible or confusing one finds this text to be, the writing itself is transcendent. And if this book is difficult, then Western culture is definitely in a serious decline. All right, the Neanderthals had some trouble articulating. But please, this is a work of fiction. I am impressed by what must have been prodigious research on Golding's part to gain insight into the world of the Neanderthals, about whose specific reality modern man can only speculate. Whatever the Neanderthals lacked in intellectual capability, they more than made up for in their ability to use their senses, especially that of smell. As well as their possible telekinetic activity, which would have been unencumbered by more advanced intellectual processes. Golding's Neanderthals have an intuitive grasp of their world that is lacking in the modern human; on the other hand, the Neanderthals also live more wholly at the mercy of \\"Oa\\" (Mother Earth). The innocence of the Neanderthals is endearing, the \\"new people\\" Homo sapiens are dangerous and menacing. I felt compassion for the Neanderthals, and contempt for \\"the new people\\". The emotion that binds both species together is fear; -IE- Homo sapiens refer to the Neanderthals as \\"devils\\"; Fa tells Lok that \\"the new people are frightened of the air\\".The prose within \\"The Inheritors\\" is highly poetic; Golding paints an intricate portrait of a primeval landscape, such as our planet will probably never experience again; this description in itself adds to the atmosphere of suspense the author creates in this novel. It is not just that landscape in itself that is impressionable, but also how it is perceived by the Neanderthals and their \\"mind-dream-pictures\\"; -IE- the heightened colors seen by Lok during his hangover from the honey-drink. Golding shrouds his worlds in mystery to create a background of heightened effect, which becomes an integral part of the story; Richard Wagner used a similar technique by employing the orchestra as an additional \\"voice\\" in \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\". One of the major themes of this book focuses on the evolution of innocence into corruption; a problem, as other Amazon reviewers have noted, that still exists in humans today. This novel also points out the Machiavellian nature of mankind as whole, specifically in how that behaviour was starting to evolve in Golding's portrait of Homo sapiens. I actually found this work to be more engaging than the more commercially accessible LOTF (and certainly more so than the experimental-yet-inconsistent \\"Darkness Visible\\"). Golding is a recent discovery of mine, and I am looking forward to reading more of his work.Stephen C.

I really enjoyed reading that one when I took senior English, and I'm not sure now why it took me so long to read something else of his. I definitely recommend this for something a little out of the ordinary on your reading list, especially since this is Golding's favorite of all his own work.\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I wouldn't have read the book if i didnt need it for a university class. However I did enjoy it. Won't read it again but it was good for a quick read."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Make this a 2.5 star review because I\`ll give Golding the benefit of the doubt that his writing is way over my head. No reason to mark his novel down just because my poor Cro-Magnon pea brain couldn't follow it. However, I expected better execution in the writing from a Nobel Prize winner.The story line and point of view are good. If this isn't a parable about the effect that human contact has with any other species, environment, or place, I don't know what is. Golding gets points for making me ashamed of my own species as he describes what happens when the peaceful Neanderthal world collides with Homo sapiens in very dramatic and unpleasant ways.Perhaps that is his point; the Neanderthals were pushed out of existence because they were not as intellectually developed as their Homo sapiens \`Inheritors'.I caught on early that the Neanderthals' \`pictures' were personal ideas and memories, and the \`shared pictures' are ideas and memories transmitted telepathically. However, Golding tries to describe these pictures in a contrivance of words instead of pictures, and decides to constrain the description of the pictures to the individual's limited perception. That was a noble goal, and done well. However, when he cannot succeed via that route in describing events, he inserts an expository third-person (writer)point of view. That completely confused my pea brain about what was happening. Some scenes are terribly confusing because of this.I likened my experience of reading \`The Inheritors' to that of Anthony Burgess' \`A Clockwork Orange', which IMHO was a more successful writing experiment. Burgess at least provided us with a glossary to define the futurespeak of his Droog culture. Golding could have invented a word-picture map.I cannot believe that schools are recommending this as a reading assignment. But then in my day they were forcing the dreadful \`Catcher in the Rye' on us."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"As a fan of Lord of the Flies and someone very interested in the subject matter of this novel - the interface between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals - I was really looking forward to reading this book. Sadly, it failed to deliver either in terms of the story and writing quality I expect of Golding or as an interesting exploration of its topic.Golding's portrayal of the Neanderthals - the main characters of the book through whose eyes we experience its events - suffers from outdated notions of these intelligent and resourceful hominins as bestial if likable buffoons. One wonders how these dunderheads survived the harshest imaginable conditions for hundreds of thousands of years.Apart from that, I think Golding had the right idea, imagining a group of anatomically modern humans appearing as newcomers and coming into conflict with the indigenous Neanderthals. It's fertile ground for drama and Golding does not fail completely to exploit it. But as another reviewer commented, I think his ambition exceeded his grasp, and whether it's because he chose to imagine his main character as a Palaeolithic \\"Rain Man\\" or because his literary powers weren't chugging on all cylinders, Golding did not attain the clarity, coherence, or emotional impact I expected of him. Unlike fine wine, this book has not aged well."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"One might think that Aesop could have covered such an elementary principle with a more direct and poignant simplicity and essentialy kept it more moving. Perhaps I am just too much a fan of the haiku and other displays of Eastern efficiency and Golding's overdone style is simply not my interest, but there is only a certain degree one can take the &quot;we are simple people so we must burden a perceptive reader with our intellectual baggage&quot; novelty just so far before it becomes a chore to read.One more thing, on the back of my book there is a quotation from the New York Times Book Review which reinforces my disdain for their apparent practice of reading a summary of any classic author before proceeding to pelt him with praise. &quot;His prose is forceful and compact. He tells a rousing good story.&quot; The story is laborious, the prose is detailed and soft, not forceful, and I can not imagine anyone in their right mind declaring his prose &quot;compact&quot;. It's laughable.I suppose I should read &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; before my opinion of Golding falls too far.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've read some truly horrific books."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"At a first glance the book just seems to tell a story that kind of makes little sense at points but is very baisic all in all. This first notion isn't true at all. When you read it over carefully and study it you start to get a sense of that great complexity of the book. If you have to read this book for a class make sure you read it a couple of times it really isn't what it seems."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding's \\"The Inheritors\\" was originally published in 1955, and was his first book after \\"Lord of the Flies\\" made his name. Unfortunately, while his first novel was intriguing, well-written and suspenseful, \\"The Inheritors\\" is one of the most bizarre and confused novels of its time.There's no real story here. Neanderthal man encounters cro-magnon, and is killed off. While it sounds like an exciting premise, this book actually consists of little more than endless, repetitious, vague landscapes, repeated over and over and over again. These landscapes, which describe each and every leaf, rock, patch of dirt or sparkle of light on the water of a flowing river, take up literally sixty percent of this brief but agonizingly slow moving novel's pages. Along with the landscapes, we are told in painfully tedious detail of each character's physical movements as he or she walks among the minutely described leaves, rocks and patches of dirt, while looking at the sparkle of the light on the river. These details take up most of the rest of the book. There is very little here that actually constitutes narrative; instead, there is only description and accumulation of sentences.The two main characters, Fa and Lok, are quite different. While Fa is a smart and resourceful Neanderthal, Lok, who stands at the center of the descriptions, is extraordinarily dense and slow-witted, even for a caveman. Within a few pages, this reader found Lok annoying and exasperating. Why Golding chose to make him the center of the book is a mystery.One last point. This novel seems to have been edited severely (and not particularly carefully) from a longer manuscript, since many pages and the entire second-to-last chapter don't flow together in a coherent fashion. This only adds to the book's inertia and mystification. It's amazing that this was ever published in any form.I really wanted to like \\"The Inheritors.\\" Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it and ended up loathing it as much as any book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I'm reading this reviews and I'm just apalled. So it's boring isn't it? What did you expect for Christsakes, fireworks? It's just a bloody book and it's full of letters. In a way it's not finished until you read it. And it's up to you to bring it to life in your own brain. Have you got one? Stick to Swcharzenager."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"This book frustrated me to no end. While I can respect the endeavor to write a book from the perspective of prehistoric man, it just didn't follow through. While Golding's theme of dichotomous man was intriguing, switching from character to character, not clarifying who was who, and the generally unengaging characters made this a very average reading experience for me."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding simply holds up as an excellent, if not classic, author no matter what subject he researched and pursued. I couldn't put this novel down. Golding takes his readers on a journey into a world seen through the eyes, visions, and emerging language expressions of primitive man. His sensitively drawn characters, whose language is limited, form \`pictures' in their minds and use this mental illumination to guide them to food, to their seasonal homes and to acquaint them to possible dangers. The descriptions are marvelous: cold, wet, hungry, dependence on a sense of smell (you find yourself sniffing a lot), stones for weapons, hyenas signaling a kill for the band of our earliest ancestors to steal, recipes cooked in a style that remind one of haggis (no refrigerator raiding is elicited in this read by the way) and a lush plant entwined forest of the early spring replete with mystical ice women to be worshipped.Within the pages, the author's imagination, ideas, and symbols are used at their best removing the reader from the world of 2001 into a consideration of the earth and stars alone, untouched by any sort of technology. Essentially it is Lok and his small Neanderthal band that are faced with other humans, unlike themselves, for the first time. The 'other' (homo-sapiens) is armed with bows and arrows, sharpened tools made from bone and an ability to cross rivers and lakes by rowing logs. Golding possibly was inspired by the scientific find of a primitive people who could cross the water discovered sometime in the early 1950's. In any event this is a story that readers will find to be absorbing and has the potential to provide an insight into a daily life of a society devoted to survival with only the earth as a guide to how. Wiliam Golding tells a stirring, astonishing story with a writer's technical virtuosity applied as only he can do."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I haven't been so emotionally involved in a book since...well, for a long time.This novel is about a family group of Neanderthals who travel to their cave for the warmer part of the year and meet there a group of modern men. The resulting events are as intense and terrifying for the reader as they are for the Neanderthals. Because Golding shows everything from their point of view, we are often left as puzzled and uncomprehending as they. The descriptions of objects the we know about -- bows and arrows, boats, alcohol -- are written as the Neanderthals saw them. The actions of the modern humans -- their rituals and hierarchy -- Golding makes successfully foreign -- but when we sit and think about what we've read, we realize, wait, I *know* this, this is what humans do.The characterization is achieved deftly and sensitively, Lok and Fa are compelling as is their fate. Prehistory was very likely *not* like this -- but the themes stand, and this book is powerful.I do not think Golding is doing a disservice to our species, because this is how we are. He is telling a damn good, if tragic, story. I will re-read this book over and over again, I know. Golding is truly great, and this book is greater, in my opinion, than the oft-assigned &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"This amazingly inventive piece of fiction takes on some of the same themes the author dealt with in Lord of the Flies, but in a surprising way. In this novel, the protagonists are the last of the Neandrathals who are in deadly conflict with emergent Homo Sapiens for their survival. Golding imagines these people as being essentially pre-verbal and it is a testiment to his skill as a writer that he can create effective characters without the tool of dialogue. Because of this convention, and the need to keep the story from the Neandrathal's (not quite human) point of view, it takes some time for the reader to achieve an understanding of what is happening and why. It becomes, nevertheless, a very moving story and one of the more inventive tales in serious modern literature.As a companion piece from the current Homo Sapien point of view, one might want to read Beards novel about a hypothetical new jump in evolution, Darwin's Radio."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"This book is complex but worth the effort if you have an IQ of more than room-temperature.The comment by a previous reviewer is worth taking up:&quot;And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.&quot; Well, I'd agree, strongly. But it's not as simple as that: the Homo Sapiens Sapiens in The Inheritors are not shown as deliberately and strategically wiping out the last Homo Sapiens Neanderthalus. Rather, they are terrified of them. They think they are defending themselves against horrifying demons - why do they submit to the discipline of the whip to drag the canoe up the portage? Plainly they are half out of their minds with terror, which the Neanderthals cannot comprehend. Further, the Neanderthals, though gentle and innocent, are plainly inadequate. The process of their replacement by the Homo Sapiens Sapiens, or Cro-Magnards, is cruel but it is not morbid. The Neanderthals, it is clearly demonstrated, are at a dead-end (they are only a vestige of a tribe at the beginning of the story). The survival of the Neanderthal infant means some of their gentleness and innocence may survive into the new world. It is actually a relief to get into the Cro-Magnards' minds in the final chapter after the limitation of having to see everything from a Neanderthal point of view. The Cro-Magnards are at one point called &quot;the people of the fall&quot; - in religious terms they are the people of the &quot;Fall&quot; indeed - Postlapsarian Man. Unlike the Neanderthals, they do have knowledge of good and evil, and we see at the end even the rudiments of conscience - which is not to say the end of the Neanderthals is not utterly tragic.Like all Golding's earlier works, this is the exploration of difficult moral dilemnas. There are lessons there but they are not easy."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding's better-known \\"Lord of the Flies\\" examines humanity at its most primitive, and creates a painful but inarguable image. He does that again in \\"The Inheritors,\\" but this time from an outsider's view of humankind. He takes the unique perspective of Lok, a Neandertal, in the brief period when our two species coexisted.The greatest achievement of this book may be in Golding's creation of a whole mentality that is intelligent and articulate, far from the human norm but still comprehensible. His Neandertals are visual people, who think in images. They reason by matching the here-and-now to visual memories. To understand someone means 'to see their picture.' (I've known visual artists who almost seem to work this way.) Their animistic world is a place where fire may wake up, and where a log decides how to place itself in the river. Despite the harshness of their world, they are gentle, affectionate, and hopeful. \\"People understand each other,\\" says one, early on.Although heartfelt by its speaker, the book treats that statement with cynicism and disdain. Homo sapiens arrive, clever, complex, and surrounded by mysterious made objects. Saying much more would say too much - but H. sapiens is a very poor neighbor.Although I like this book, it could have been proportioned differently. I would have looked for more of the interaction with H. sapiens, and described Lok's people more succinctly. I'm not the Nobel winner, though, and Golding is. It's a meaningful, if discouraging look at what being human is all about, from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The basic requirement of reading is to remember and connect. I would ask those who have a distaste for such activity to refrain from criticing a book for its ambition and complication. To write successfuly through the eyes of a species whose experience of the world is different from ours is a difficult feat and one which remarkably, Golding has managed to pull off with both relative spareness and grace. Golding's &quot;ancestor bashing&quot; is, in truth, nothing more than a reminder and exploration of a given truth- the &quot;darkness&quot; in the heart of man and a human history full of violence and savagery. Moreover Golding's exploration is complicated- no simple black and white message is being propagated. The carving that one of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens works on at the end of the novel symbolises a future where the surviving Neaderthal will interbreed with the new race of Homo Sapiens. The idea is that modern man is comprised of both the innocent and caring nature that characterises the Neaderthals and the immorality of the more &quot;advanced&quot; species. Darkness visible by its very nature shows both light and darkness."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors takes you back to a time when the gentle Neanderthals became faced with the emergance of Homo-Sapiens, a collision which could only favour the Darwinian imperative of the survival of the fittest.The story unfolds in such a way as to make you identify with our Neanderthal cousins, who, skilled in their own environment but lacking in technology, must face the sheer ignorance of a more technologically advanced &quot;master-race&quot; which sees them as nothing more than strange and dangerous animals.The poignancy of this unequal contest is conveyed in a way which none the less makes Homo-Sapiens bad by accident rather than design. A lesson to all in these days of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and fear of those from other cultures. A haunting morality tale which has you praying for &quot;the other side&quot; to win."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I read this book about six years ago and I still frequently think about it. The book is brilliant and as savage and ruthless, in its own way, as Shakespeare's Lear. I actually read the book in the first place because I had gotten interested in real Neanderthals: what did they look like, what were they like, where and how did they live, why did they die? etc. I soon discovered that these questions were largely unanswerable; frustrated, I remembered that Golding had written a \\"Neanderthal novel,\\" and, science failing, I turned to art and read it.One of the chief virtues of the book is its invention of \\"Neanderthal consciousness,\\" a rather uncanny and striking sensibility which is definitely superior to animals, and definitely inferior to humans. We are drawn into the intimate--outer and inner--details of their world, and in the end of course they die. Humans populate the book as well, but in a far different way. I cannot say too much more without giving away a critical feature of the book's structure, except to say that the reader has no idea how good the book is until he/she finishes it. You must read it all, and then you will know.Why do the human beings behave the way they do in the book? It is not really possible to answer this question. The eye cannot see itself, and we who are human cannot see....this."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors is a fascinating fable of the time in history (not so long ago - only five hundred generations or so before you, valued reader), when Neanderthals co-existed with homosapiens. Golding brings all his imaginative powers to bear to imagine himself in the Neanderthal consciousness. Simple named characters such as Lok and Mal and Fa witness strange things happening in their limited world - such as the disappearance of their precious log bridge across the river. Horrific things start happening, which shake their world view, their limited conceptions of events as 'pictures' rather than a human consciousness, comunicated in linguistic form. This is the era of the end of their people.Golding draws the human conquerors as advanced only in the sense that they have mobilised natural resources to more sophisticated ends - such as hollowing out trees to make boats, and developing more sophisticated tools than the rudimentary Neanderthal implements. Morally, they are far more savage than the primitives they displace - a cruel, selfish species who will kill those alien to themselves, capture their young and become inheritors of the earth. The Neanderthals are an endearing, enclosed people with tender rituals of caring for each other and burying their dead. Their knowledge of things is fatally limited, and they struggle to express their horror of what is happening to them as they cannot muster up the language. They rely on their simple religion, Oa, the earth goddess who is a far more gentle and tender influence than the harsh pragmatic religion of the homosapiens with their savage stag mutilating rituals.By the end, the last Neanderthal is hunched in a ball, gibbering with grief and bewilderment as he has witnessed the end of his people. The humans, meanwhile, sail aimlessly in their log boats on the river, struggling themselves to make sense of their aims and purpose in a world without structure or meaning.Thirty thousand years later, are things any different?"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I read THE INHERITORS back in the early 60's when I was a home mother with six kids.

In order for these projects to work superbly, great care and pride must be taken in the making and assembling of each project.

These are undoubtedly exciting ways to &quot;tease&quot; students in his discovering of physics and mechanics."},{"Title":"Making Wooden Mechanical Models","review":"I agree with the previous reviews, even the negative one. You should be aware that these projects are not for the novice woodworker---they are an excellent way, however, to stretch your woodworking skills for those who want to go beyond the basics. Two things to be aware of: virtually all the projects require the use of a lathe, and the projects are bigger than they appear. If you're thinking that these are a couple of inches high, wrong. Most are a foot or more high or wide. You will also need to blow up the patterns on a copier, they are not full sized. All of that said, the book is worthwhile, though expensive. Check ABEbooks for price comparisons. The MORE book is cheaper on Amazon, this book cheaper on ABE."},{"Title":"Making Wooden Mechanical Models","review":"Basically, the contents weren't what I expected. The title led me to expect mechanisms for making wooden automata. This book doesn't give general ideas but the design of 15 particular mechanisms such as a wooden pump, or clock. I'll probably use it one day but only as a breather from wooden automata."},{"Title":"Making Wooden Mechanical Models","review":"I bought this book based on previous reviews. I had high expectations of it and made the decision to purchase it.This book is way overpriced for its contents. There are very little woodworking techniques described for these mechanisms. The author expects you have a solid woodworking background to make his projects.The biggest disappointment is that the plans lack dimensions. Each plan comes with 2 sheets. The first is a very confusing and hard to understand hand sketch describing the movement. The second is also a 2D sketch on a 1\\"x1\\" squared sheet. The lack of dimensions makes more work for you since you have to translate the dimensions from the sketch to make a template or any other method you decide to follow to build them. I've purchased woodworking plans before and ALL come with dimensions, this is a first for me. These sketches remind me of sewing patterns my grandmother used to have.The mechanisms are good looking but not easy at all to make.I feel disappointed. I do not recommend you pay the high price for this book. If you still feel the need for one, try to buy the cheapest you can around."},{"Title":"Making Wooden Mechanical Models","review":"Purchased book for $77 new with high expectations.

As my academic career progressed, I was writing less and less for other people, mostly just class notes for myself, and I made little attempt to write legibly. I was the only one who could read my increasingly &quot;individual&quot; penmanship unless I made a great effort to write clearly. Finally, though, I had trouble puzzling out my own handwriting at times, and I realized something had to be done. I had come to admire those with clear handwriting, and I wanted to develop a quick, readable hand.This book agrees with advice I've found in several sources: the italic alphabet is attractive and easy to write, the distinction between printing and handwriting is artificial, and the torturous cursive script we're taught in elementary school does most students more harm than good. Though the book does not require strict adherence to their italic model, I like it quite a bit, and I'm happy to integrate it into my own hand.Within minutes of beginning the simplest exercises I realized I'd been holding the pen wrong for as long as I can remember! Changing my grip required some awkward retraining, but once I adapted I realized that, for me, the traditional grip lends itself to more natural and comfortable motions, and my fountain pens work better, too! If it doesn't work for you, though, another grip is discussed.This is an excellent example of how the book works. It is not about changing your writing to the one correct way. It shows you how to experiment to find the best way for you personally to write. This doesn't mean your handwriting will improve without any effort on your part, but I've found the exercises relaxing, almost meditative. It's difficult to face each new challenge, fumbling to find a way to form the letters properly, but once I've found the way and practice it for a few half-hour sessions, the new method appears in my casual handwriting. I'm very pleased by the increase in the legibility and attractiveness of my handwriting. I don't have to concentrate anymore to write better; with practice my penmanship has improved naturally.My only problem with the book is that it's a little too vague. I like being able to choose the exercises most relevant to my own writing problems, but some more advice on how to practice would be nice, like &quot;Do one page of Exercise A, then 15 lines of Exercise L, then go on to Exercise M for ten minutes.&quot; I realize that different writers will have different needs, but I'm not sure sometimes if I'm doing too little of one thing and not enough of another--though I'm getting a better feel for that as I go along.I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their handwriting needs improvement. Better handwriting will make life easier in a lot of ways!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"I ordered this book to improve my penmanship. The results were no less than wonderful. In less than 3 days my writing had improve tremendously. What I like most about this book, along with the price of course, is the options that it gives you in writing techniques. I also liked that the author gives an understanding of why one may have difficulty in with their writing in the first place. I generally felt that good penmanship reflected a person who was deliberate and careful. This book shows that there is more than attitude involved here, there are basic mechanics to good penmanship that we were not shown in grade school. Great book to refer to anyone who is penmanly- challenged."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"I bought the book last night and spent over an hour working on the exercises before going to bed. This morning I have spent two hours working on the exercises and the time just flew by. Despite being well-educated (possibly over-educated) I have always written slowly and not particularly legibly. In the space of a few hours I have changed my writing position and pen-hold and have learned to make the simple strokes necessary for clear, legible and speedy writing. The book was a surprise and a delight and I only wish I had come across it in 1984 when it was first published or that it had been around when I was at school.I searched the Internet on a whim to see if I could find Rosemary Sassoon in order to thank her. That job has been made incredibly easy. I would urge anyone who has the slightest interest in improving their handwriting to get the book without delay. At a fraction under 7, it must be the bargain of the century. In a couple of hours and a few easy lessons it has changed what was a hard, painful slog for me into a process of joy and discovery. The book didn't promise instant results but it has certainly produced them. If I had known it existed I would surely have bought it sooner and consider myself lucky to have found it at all."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"Those who buy this book are, obviously, looking to develop a more readable handwriting style. And this will help you do it. The thing is -- you have to be prepared to do handwriting exercises. Fact is, handwriting is a series of learned hand motions which result in readable script; so when changing your handwriting, you have to develop some new habits and work with them until they stick. And this is not something you can do in a few minutes. On the other hand, it doesn't take years either, and I'm seeing clear results after a couple of days. How long it takes depends on how much work one has to do to get where one wants to go. The book has a lot of material on diagnosing one's current handwriting, and what to do about faults and flaws that one finds troublesome. The book delivers on its promise -- it has the basic information, by people who know what they are doing, about how to fix a handwriting style that one does not care for. One of the charming aspects of this book is that it is NOT what you were taught in school, is NOT dogmatic, and doesn't try to boss you around -- it tries to help you get where YOU want to go. Sassoon and her co-author fully expect that you will individualize your penmanship, that it should be individualized, and that it ought to suit you and your style. What this book will do for you is give you an intellectual framework to guide yourself. That's what I got it for, and I feel I got every pennysworth. One extra hint. I've not found it as hard to reform my penmanship, using this book, as I would have with a new musical instrument. It's really a matter of adding to what you were taught in school, and what you already do. It's not as easy as falling off a log, but if you really want to do it, it can be quite rewarding."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"I recently started collecting fountain pens. To do my collection justice I needed to improve my handwriting. This book did more than teach me how to write better, it taught me to discover and create a personal character in my writing. The practice sessions returned a sense of control immediately. For the first time in my life I actually got complements on my penmanship. I continue to tweek things here and there and my fountain pens are most appreciative."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"I found the book very technical and hard to penetrate, I just wanted to get down to the bottom line of how to improve handwriting, with practical guidelines, and this book wasn't very helpful."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"This book mainly tells you how to write quickly, cursively and legibly, if your former handwriting is slow, separate and illegible. Some common senses such as that you must write in relaxed mood and hand position, may be of help. However, if you are already a neat writer and aim at adding some artistic touch to your handwriting, no useful advice can be found in this book. Therefore, I think, that is the reason why this book is entitled \\"better\\" handwriting instead of \\"nice\\" handwriting.And, one thing I do not like in this book is, the authors' instructions are just too wordy."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Better Handwriting","review":"i was looking for a book with letter formations and completion of words with illustrations but this book has none to help a person in that area."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Norbert Monde, a fourth-generation bourgeois Parisian businessman, \\"comes to his senses\\" on the afternoon of his forty-eighth birthday, withdraws 300,000 francs from his bank account, and promptly vanishes, abandoning his second wife, gay son, and money-grubbing daughter to their own devices. He surfaces in Marseilles where he is quickly drawn into a domestic crisis at a hotel and winds up living a new life among gamblers, drunks and prostitutes in Nice. He's happy, for a while, in realizing his lifelong ambition to be nobody other than a man in the street. But when his work at a nightclub brings his first wife, Therese, into his orbit, Monsieur Monde finds himself drawn back into the world of moral responsibility. Beautifully understated and impressively human, Simenon's take on the familiar \\"walking out on your life\\" tale is one of the better examples. In its empathy for the desperation of middle-class life, and for a man whose childhood values have fed into a lifetime of limited scope, it reminded me of that slim European classic, Patrick Suskind's novella \\"The Pigeon\\"."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Let's take a plane to Saint Paul.Let's take a kayak to Quincy or Nyack,Let's get away from it all.\\"I have to admit that Frank Sinatra version of \\"Let's Get Away From it All\\" kept entering my consciousness as I read George Simenon's \\"Monsieur Monde Vanishes\\". The upbeat nature of the song is not remotely like the dark, reflective tone of Simenon's story but if you have ever sat in your office on a dreary day or sat in your home on a humdrum evening and just wondered what it would be like to just walk away from your life and start fresh somewhere else then you will have some understanding and, perhaps, sympathy for a man who wakes up one morning and decides to get away from it all.Simenon was nothing if not prolific in both his literary and public life. Born in Belgium in 1903, Simenon turned out hundreds of novels. Simenon's obsession with writing caused him to break off an affair (he was prolific in this area of his life as well) with the celebrated Josephine Baker in Paris when he could only write twelve novels in the twelve month period in which they were involved. Although perhaps best known for his Inspector Maigret detective novels, Simenon also wrote over a hundred novels that he referred to as \`romans durs' (literally \\"hard novels\\"). As with many of his contemporaries such as Chandler and Hammett, Simenon's books were marketed and sold as popular, almost pulp fiction. Also like Chandler and Hammett, Simenon's books have stood up well over time. The New York Review of Books publishing division has reissued much of Simenon's books. They are well worth reading and \\"Monsieur Monde Vanishes\\" is an excellent place to start.As with virtually all his protagonists in these hard stories, Monde is a stolid, middle-class member of the establishment. Based in Paris, Monde runs the family export/import business. His is a life of regular habits, from the time he wakes up, through his work day and then through the evening. He is married (a second wife) and has children. Beneath this surface regularity lies a yearning to get away, to just leave everything behind and as the book opens Monde does just that. The rest of the novel explores Monde's journey, his new identity, the places he goes (the French coast) and the people he meets. He sheds his stolid identity like someone sheds their clothing at night and finds himself in a world entirely different from the one he leaves behind. The reader witnesses this transformation in what can be best described as something of a voyeuristic fashion.Simenon's hard novels are often referred to as psychological novels but I find that term a bit misleading. Simenon does not analyze. He does not delve deep into his protagonists' minds. He presents the reader with a slice of the human condition and lets the reader deal with the implications, the psychoanalysis if you like. They do offer glimpses into his protagonists' lives even though (or perhaps because) he does not fill in the blanks for you. His character's actions speak for themselves and what they have to say is not always pleasant. In \\"Monsieur Monde\\" we are not presented with an explanation for Monde's acts. They are simply provided to the reader. It is up to us to judge them or analyze them if we so choose. In a world of fiction filled with happiness and redemption and the ultimate triumph of good against evil, Simenon is a breath of fresh (if pessimistic) air. \\"Monsieur Monde\\" does break away from this mold a bit as I found there was a bit more \`closure' (a hackneyed word to be sure but it seems suitable for use here) in \\"Monsieur Monde\\" than in some of his other works. Unlike some of his other books we see someone reclaim some of the responsibility he walked away from. However, the question that Simenon poses is a critical one, is the Monde that reenters the world left behind the same man?\\"Let's take a trip in a trailerNo need to come back at all.Let's take a powder to Boston for chowder,Let's get away from it all.\\"\\"Monsieur Monde Vanishes\\" was an enjoyable book to read.

This is how I found Monsieur Monde Vanishes. It is an economical and very visual book even though the visuals are of mostly unremarkable venues: cheap hotel rooms, the back office of a nightclub, train stations, etc. The narrative value, however, lies partly in bringing such sites to life.The largely passive Monde exits his successful life in Paris to allow another life in Nice to happen to him. In the end, this change enables him to return to his prior existence possessed of enhanced stature with his business, his wife and his son. The breaking of his life pattern, even though he is compelled to return to it, seems to give Monde additional power over his environment.Read this book and get swept up in the rhythm of an unspectacular life that is likely different than your own in detail but not in method."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"As author Larry McMurtry points out in his introduction to \\"Monsieur Monde Vanishes,\\" Georges Simenon wrote this Maigretless short novel at about the same time Albert Camus had published \\"The Stranger.\\" There are some parallels, certainly in the moods of the two books. That the French had recently experienced a traumatic military defeat at the hands of the Germans and were under Nazi occupation for more than four years could certainly have had something to do with the sense of alienation and detachment that are the central themes underlying both tales.In \\"Monsieur Monde Vanishes,\\" the story's protagonist, Norbert Monde, a man with a comfortable, upper-middle class life suddenly bolts from his marriage and professional responsibilities at the end of one ordinary workday and takes another identity and eventually begins to lead another life. Unfortunately for M. Monde, he is a magnet for others who are less fortunate or whose lives are less orderly. Through a series of encounters, his innate sense of responsibility (not shed with the old identity) pulls him back toward the accountabiity that he had hoped to be rid of forever. When he comes across the woman who was his first wife and his first great disappointment with life, in a state of crisis, the die is cast and Norbert Monde's vanishing act will soon be history.The story speaks to virtually everyone's inevitable dissatisfactions with life, but makes no attempt to provide answers or comfort. Perhaps there are none to be had.Interesting short novel. I have to admit that I prefer to have Inspector Maigret along for these crises de vie that are manifest in Simenon's writing."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"A good friend of mine recommended Simenon books to me. This story is about a successful, middle-aged man who, obsessed with pursuing another life, one day decides to remove himself from everything that he has called his own. Leaving no trace of himself, he uproots himself and heads off in no particular direction. As he continues on his adventure, he encounters a number of enemies and companions all of whom help him realize a new self-awareness. But in the midst of this new comfort, his old life invades. He must then decide not only which life to embrace, but which self he will be.Though this is the only book I've read so far from Georges Simenon, I'm certain it will not be the last. I appreciated his ability to write with a great economy of words and yet penetrate deep into my imagination. His style is simple, his story is believable, and the questions he raises are not easy to answer.

I have about 150 Simenon books in my library and have another five which I just ordered from Amazon so I guess that will tell you how much I enjoy them."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"MONSIEUR MONDE VANISHES is one of Simenon's roman durs, in which the author applies a darker and more noir edge to the foibles of everyday existence. The story is simple. Norbert Monde has lived a life noted by others for its upscale opportunities, but noted by Monsieur Monde himself for its straightjacket constriction. Living in the same house all his life, working in the business handed down to him, he longs to escape, existentially as well as physically, to the darker side. Out of the mansion and into the alleyway. He has had a glimpse of this in the past. His first wife had the hobby, before tucking her children into bed and kissing her husband good night, of posing for lurid pornography, sold on the back streets of Paris to whatever rogue wanted it.It becomes clear that others really do not see him as a man. He is instead a provider - of money, of position, of status. His 48th birthday is so inconsequential that it goes unnoticed.And so, on one day like any other, Monsieur Monde vanishes. Strikingly, he made no decision to leave his comfortable life. It was merely the normal, natural extension of that particular day. No more thought or decision went into it than on all the previous days when he returned home after work. This time, the natural progression was to just keep walking.Trading in his fine clothes for a cheap suit, Monsieur Monde arrives first in Marseille where he meets Julie, the type of common girl whose company would be consistent with his new life. Traveling further to Nice, the two create their new lives of striking simplicity. Working at the illicit casino, consorting with rogues and vagrants, Monsieur Monde is so determined to shed his old self that he is actually glad when someone rips off the money he had brought with him. It was a betrayal of himself for taking the money along to begin with.A novel as much about inner exploration, Monsieur Monde comes face to face with his former life, discovering along the way that real change (and I know this sounds wincingly like some new age mumbo jumbo) comes from within. The trip to the back alley, the gambling halls, and associating with loose women and morphine addicts, allows our good Monsieur Monde to find that, although his family had taken him for granted, he did in fact exist. He is substantial. And others, you better believe, will look into his eyes and know it, too."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"This is a great book but one would never read it if one merely read the back cover copy which is totally inaccurate -- so inaccurate that one suspects the writer of the copy has never read the book. I have read M. Monde Vanishes many times in French (La Fuite de M. Monde) and given dozens copies of this excellent English translation to friends and acquaintances. M. Monde learns, in the course of his adventures after he flees his unhappy existence, that true freedom comes from inside -- one does not have to tear one's life apart, one can to change one's perspective. In Simenon's usual concise, brilliant style."},{"Title":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Monsieur Monde Vanishes was first published as La Fuite de Monsieur Monde in 1952. It was translated into English by Jean Stewart. The novel begins like a Maigret novel, with a depiction of a Paris police station. Ill-lit, grimy, a waiting room of working class people waiting to fill out identity forms, Simenon presents the bureaucratic side of police work here. Into this drab environment sweeps an arrogant, self-centered woman, Madame Monde, reporting the disappearance of her husband Norbert. In his delineation of Madame Monde Simenon adroitly both sets the atmosphere, and states the man's problem. Monsieur Monde is the owner and manager of a successful export business, the fourth generation of his family to hold this position. He, it becomes clear, is both very able and very conscientious, and feels responsible as well, for those, family and employees, in his care. He has let himself become over the years a prisoner of his responsibilities. Unlike his father, who led an irresponsible, self-indulgent life which almost bankrupted the family firm, Norbert is disciplined, hard working and successful. On his 48th birthday (Simenon was 48 when he wrote the book) he does a kind of summing up, propelled to do this by the fact that no-one has remembered his birthday but himself. He has divorced his first wife, shocked by her lack of a moral sense, and married again, primarily out of regard for his two young children. His second wife, he has discovered, is one of those persons entirely taken up with her own wants and needs, and arrogantly dismissive of everyone who cannot share this obsession with her. Monsieur Monde considerately accedes to her wishes, defers to her demands, and yet earns her contempt. His daughter has married, lives with her husband in her family's home, and has little contact with her father but to ask for money. His son, who has failed to do anything with his life, has been taken on in the family firm. It gradually becomes clear to Monsieur Monde, that while he loves his son unselfishly, the boy is, like his wife, self-obsessed, and effeminate as well, earning the contempt of his fellow workers by making sexual advances to a teenage truck driver, although ineffectually. The effort to care for others has only succeeded in attracting to Monsieur Monde a group of selfish, self-obsessed exploiters. He longs for release from this pressure, which is a constant challenge to his rather idealistic morality. He decides to leave it all behind, to just walk away, to vanish. He's intelligent, and competent, and does so successfully.Poor Monsieur Monde! He wants to run away from all this effort, to be carefree, to just exist, but he can't run away from his own nature. In the seedy hotel in Nice where he ends up, he hears a quarrel in the adjoining room, hears a man leave in anger, hears a woman in hysterics, and goes in to offer aid. The woman has taken an overdose of sleeping pills, and Norbert calls a doctor. Slowly he gets involved in the woman's life. They become lovers. Simenon draws an astonishingly concise and evocative picture of this woman's whole life in a few paragraphs. Unlike Norbert's wife, Julie has few expectations, illusions or inhibitions. Precisely because she does not expect Norbert to care for her or stay with her weakens the bond between them. The two remain friends and occasional lovers, but in the life Julie has led, men don't stay around for long. And so when Norbert stumbles across his first wife, now living a drug addicted bohemian life and facing destitution, he begins to care for her, loses touch with Julie, and soon finds himself in his usual role of carer.But Monsieur Monde is an intelligent man. He soon becomes aware of the pattern in his own life. This is something he cannot run away from. The awareness changes him profoundly. Instead of a life made up of well meant good intentions, it has become apparent to him that all people have needs, and that some people have needs that can never be satisfied. He is aware what a terrible thing this is. At the end of the book, when he has returned to his life in Paris, he is a colder, more disillusioned man, but a more accepting man as well, able to deal efficiently with other people's limitations as he had never been before."},{"Title":"The Kid Comes Back","review":"One of the most interesting books in the Tunis series about the Brooklyn Dodgers, &quot;The Kid Comes Back&quot; is very unusual in that it's not really about baseball so much as it is about courage. Roy Tucker (&quot;The Kid From Tomkinsville&quot;) serves in the U.S. Army during the Second World War in Europe, where he suffers an injury in battle. This book deals with what he goes through in the war effort, his rehabilitation and his difficult return to major league baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Tunis, who also wrote &quot;Silence Over Dunkirk,&quot; is extremely effective at letting younger readers know what WWII was like. He also does a masterful job of painting a word picture of what it was like for veterans to come back to an America that had changed while they were gone. Of all the Tunis books, this (to me) is the best. The &quot;gee whiz&quot; tone of the first four books in the series is subdued, and a very strong storyline carries all the way through."},{"Title":"The Kid Comes Back","review":"Roy Tucker, baseball player and \\"The Kid From Tomkinsville\\" starts this book in a new role. He is the tail gunner in a plane that flies over occupied France in World War II. On a very dangerous night run, the plane is hit and crash lands in France. Roy suffers a leg injury in the crash and the survivors are found by resistance fighters. He is then spirited out of the country and makes it back to the United States.Once he has \\"recovered\\" from his leg injury, he goes back to baseball and this story is about his struggle to return to the Dodgers. It is difficult as he finds it difficult, mentally, emotionally and physically, to regain his former skills. Spike Russell, Razzle Nugent and the other Dodger players of the previous books also return, as the Brooklyn Dodgers struggle to win the pennant, which comes down to a final game.The climax of the book is when the young third baseman of the Dodgers cracks under the pressure of a game that will determine the pennant. The Brooklyn manager had asked Roy to play third, but his fear was too great. However, at the crucial moment, he simply walks wordlessly in from center field and takes up a position at third base. He makes the final out of the game by recklessly crashing into the wall while catching a foul ball.While wrapped in the context of a baseball game, this is a story that millions of American fighting men lived through as they came back from the war. Although a small percentage had no physical wounds, all carried internal scars of some form. Doubt, uncertainty and having to come back to a country that had changed made it difficult for all of them. Since baseball is timeless, in some ways Roy had it easier than some of the other guys. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Kid Comes Back","review":"I will be ordering this from Amazon soon.

Many have solid foundations, many are commercialized tripe. In MAKING DECISIONS, authors Russo and Shoemaker hit on a timely subject for professional managers or entrepreneurs. The economy has plummeted and the stock market has deflated propelling each individual responsble for their company's path to success into crucial, perhaps vital decisions on a daily basis. And the rapid rate of change is forcing all executives and managers to make decisions faster.Given the current environment, it is well worth the time to revisit an executive/manager's most basic of tasks: making a decision...a subject devoid of attention except in academic journals or business books. In a straightforward, well-presented fashion, the authors break down the decisionmaking process into four steps:1. Framing or deciding what you are going to decide-and not decide;2. Gathering intelligence-real intelligence, and not just information that will support your internal biases;3. Coming to conclusions-determining how your company acts on the intelligence it gathers, and;4. Learning from experience.The authors guide the reader through each of the steps providing insight into the process, highlighting key concepts, and providing case studies and worksheets so the reader can begin to track their own issues at hand. Russo and Shoemaker have presented this material in such a way as to demystify the &quot;process&quot; of decisionmaking. The &quot;process&quot; gets so much attention as being clandestine, complex and erudite. However, by providing a detailed framework reflecting a relatively mechanical and logical process to making a decision, the authors have uncorked the mystery. When confronted with the need to assess a situation, gather information and reach a decision, most managers depend on a hit-or-miss approach. This approach is different from executive-to-executive and is measured relative to the frequency and experience an executive may have &quot;putting out the proverbial fire.&quot; While there's nothing inherently wrong or incorrect about this type of venerable process, this process typically results in a lower-end spectrum result when nothing but mid-high to high results will suffice as a necessary competitive edge.The alternative approach presented by the authors allows executives/managers to reframe issues by asking such questions as &quot;What is the crux of the issue that I am facing?&quot; so that they don't end up solving the wrong problem (i.e. analogous to &quot;looking from the outside in&quot;). It also allows them to increase their options by doing such things as &quot;not necessarily taking yes for an answer,&quot; when it comes to initial research findings. In fact, these alternatives may result in something quite creative and innovative, a veritable whack on the side of the head.As they should, the authors stress to the reader that improving one's decisionmaking skills is not an ironclad guarantee to success. Execution of a solid operating (business) plan and being in the right place at the right time (luck) are factors tantanmount to any successful venture. However, it is rational and logical that if one makes better decisions, one's odds of success are bound to increase. And, as one gains experience in making decisions and acting upon the achieved results, desired or not, success rates grow exponentially.A solid read."},{"Title":"Winning Decisions: Getting It Right the First Time","review":"This is an excellent book, one of the best I've ever read about decision making. It takes a structured approach to making decisions and discusses the \\"how\\" of decision making. It gives a bunch of ideas to use, mostly questions to help the decision maker focus his or her attention on the process of getting the decision right under uncertainty and time contraints.The book, as great as it is, has one short coming to my way of thinking: it gives very little attention to intuitive decision making. I think that the authors have concentrated on deliberative decision making with the idea in mind that the process will ultimately become intuitive when practiced enough. Perhaps so. However, I would very highly recommend another book that talks about intuitive decision making, Educating Intuition by Hogarth. This excellent book may help a reader learn how to make the deliberative techniques part of the the intuitive decision making process."},{"Title":"Winning Decisions: Getting It Right the First Time","review":"This book is okay, but it's poorly structured and repetitive.

Hill, has much to please nearly everyone. The duotone black and white reproductions are sumptuous, among the finest I have seen. They illustrate Evans' seminal production during the years 1935-36, photographing for the US Government's Farm Security Administration during the Great Depression. Their selection, presented in chronological order, is a fine mix of the familiar - many of Evans' greatest images - with lesser known works and variants. Of particular interest to me is a plate comprised of two consecutive exposures that the author has joined together into a powerful panorama (pp. 158-59), a risky move that he manages in bravura fashion.John T. Hill has written, co-written, or edited, to my count, at least nine books and catalogs on Walker Evans, including \\"Walker Evans First and Last,\\" \\"Walker Evans At Work,\\" \\"Walker Evans The Hungry Eye,\\" \\"Walker Evans Simple Secrets,\\" and \\"Walker Evans: Havana 1933.\\" As Evans' friend and colleague for ten years at Yale University, and then as executor of Evans' estate for twenty years, John Hill is uniquely qualified to discuss the photographer and his work. And as a printer of Evans' photographs for nearly forty years, Mr. Hill possesses a thorough understanding of this photographer's oeuvre and intentions.John Hill's two essays - one on an unpublished lecture Evans gave at Yale, illustrating what the photographer called his \\"aesthetic autobiography,\\" and the other a short history of Evans' book publications within the context of their times - are important additions to Evans scholarship. Additionally, Alan Trachtenberg has provided an illustrated essay comparing the image selection and sequencing of the two major editions (1941 and 1960) of Evans' and James Agee's \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.\\"Of the countless books and articles that have been written about Evans in the thirty-plus years since his death, \\"Walker Evans: Lyric Documentary\\" is among the best. It is one of a few that I would classify as an essential Walker Evans book.Rodger KingstonKingston is the author of \\"Walker Evans In Print: An Illustrated Bibliography.\\""},{"Title":"Walker Evans Lyric Documentary","review":"Walker Evans' famous gift as a photographer is said to be his ability to erase himself as the creator of the images he captured, but he was there, of course, and made the necessary artistic judgments that distinguish his work. John T. Hill's masterful book, \\"Walker Evans: Lyric Documentary\\" is, in every way, an apt tribute to Evans' artistry.Giving us a comprehensive presentation of the best work from Evans' most creative period is valuable enough. Yet Hill has provided something equally wonderful and useful, by illustrating what Evans called his \\"aesthetic autobiography.\\" Using an unpublished lecture at Yale, in which Evans identified works of art, architecture and science he viewed as inspirations for his work, Hill furnishes compelling examples from these artists as visual annotations to Evans' work.The result is exactly what one would hope for--not a laborious reinterpretation or egotistical \\"appreciation\\" of these great photographs, but a vivid presentation of the images themselves in a fashion that invites interest in the background material as an additional reward for the viewer. \\"Walker Evans: Lyric Documentary\\" is John T. Hill's fifth book on Evans and provides new insights into the work of the legendary photographer, considered by many to be the greatest artist of our time. This book is a great achievement by Hill, although fittingly, the reader will scarcely notice the skilled editorial hand shaping and ordering these powerful photographs that need little adornment.Randall Roden"},{"Title":"Walker Evans Lyric Documentary","review":"This is the only book I know of that contains Evans' own account of his aesthetic genesis with illustrations of his visual sources. Excellent essay by John T. Hill, who was a colleague of Evans at Yale University. Particularly noteworthy are the very finely reproduced plates of the seminal work of Evans during the years 1935-36. These are easily the best reproductions of Evans photographs that I've seen. A scholarly work and an important research tool."},{"Title":"Hairspray","review":"If you've never seen one of Insight Editions books on films you don't know what you are missing. These are not just books that you read, but they are the next best things to actually seeing the films. You actually can experience the movie through words and pictures but also through the dozens of little surprises that pop out at you as you journey through the pages. The smash Broadway hit musical Hairspray came to the big screen in July to rave reviews from both film critics and fans alike. Newspapers and magazines such as the Boston Globe, Chicago Sun Times, Entertainment Weekly, New York Post, and Rolling Stone all gave the film a grade of an A or an A-. It just proves that film fans still love a good musical when its done right.In conjunction with the film, Insight Editions has released their wonderful book that brings the film home to fans in a unique way. Beginning with a foreword by John Waters, the book explores the making of the film from the original version, to the stage, and finally this Summer's blockbuster re-make, all in full, bold color. The book contains literally hundreds of photos from the film as well as exclusive, behind-the-scene shots of cast and crew.John Travolta not only plays the most unique role in his illustrious career as Mama Edna, but he supplies own thoughts on the role and why he decided to do the film. Travolta discusses his approach to the role in trying to make Edna a believable character, from her voice right down to how she walks. From his words, you can see that John had a great time making this movie, particularly the climactic dance number. Besides Travolta you'll meet the rest of the fantastic cast such as James Marsden as Corny Collins, Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle, Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton, Jerry Stiller as Mr. Pinky, Queen Latifa as Motormouth Maybelle, and Christopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad. (Man! That is some cast!)But this isn't just some dry narration on making a movie. As you begin to negotiate the pages you start encountering some of those surprises I talked about earlier. There are all sorts of inserts placed in the book...faux posters for TV shows that were seen in the film, postcards that have nostalgic, period designs, cling-on stickers, and envelopes that you have to open that contain other special treats. I'm not going to play spoiler, you'll have to get the book and open them yourself!There's also great articles about the films song and dance numbers and lots of trivia about the early 1960's like the top Juke Box hits of 1962, as well as styles of clothes and hair from the era. From cover to cover this is just a treat for the eyes and will put a smile on your face. A great collector's book!REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON"},{"Title":"Hairspray","review":"Awesome.

I'd give it \\"six stars\\"! This book was my \\"Bible\\" when I first became interested in Zen. Thank heavens it's now back in print after years of unavailability.Particularly inspiring are the 40-odd pages devoted to discourses of great masters like Hsu Yun and Han-Shan (Nansen), followed by the most inspirational extracts from autobiographies of classic masters from the \\"golden age of Zen\\" in China.Here's Zen straight from the horse's mouth, straight from the living experience of enlightened masters. If I were to have but one book on Zen it would be this one. I'd recommend anyone who takes Zen seriously to get it while you can.Scattered throughout the book are gathas composed after awakenings, such as:Waves and ripples flowIn the cool sky;Fish and birds swimIn one mirrorOn and on, day after day.Last night the moon fell from the heavens.Now is the time to illumineThe black dragon's pearl. .... ( autobiography of Han Shan )."},{"Title":"The practice of Zen","review":"Garma Chang's engaging book conveys a clear idea of what Ch'an/Zen practice actually involves - illustrated by succinct readings from classic Ch'an/Zen texts, spanning centuries. These are not just more 'Zen stories' - presented without rhyme of reason. You get a good spread of teachings, backed up by fascinating observations about certain key terms/idioms,and there isn't a wasted word, from cover-to-cover. While respectful of the Ch'an/Zen axiom - \\"not to speak too plainly\\" (pu shuo pu), Chang's remarks place the practice in its proper context of Mahayana Buddhism. So far possible, Chang takes you 'inside' the minds of the teachers and practicers quoted in this book. This book offers some refreshing 'angles' on Zen practice, which reflect Chang's own experience in mainland Chinese temples and a familiarity with key Ch'an/Zen sources. Chang had an excellent command of English (not always the case with Asian Buddhist teachers/translators), and was thus well placed to present the material in this text. Following the Communist takeover of China, Chang took up American citizenship and eventually became a Professor at Penn State Uni, drawing on his valuable experience with traditional Buddhist teachings.Alas, this excellent book has had a relatively low profile since its publication in 1959, and well deserves reprinting. It was perhaps, ahead of its time, hitting the market before Westerners wanted to practice Ch'an/Zen with any seriousness, or in sufficient numbers, to give it the profile it deserved. The subsequent boom in interest - fostered by the fruits of post-war contact with Japan, brought focus upon the Japanese Zen schools. Still, it is worth noting that - D.T. Suzuki, one of the most seminal figures behind this expansion of interest - based his most successful writings upon the records of Chinese masters of the Tang. I'm not suggesting, for a minute, that we should ignore the good things brought our way by dint of contact with the Japanese Zen schools - but,in some respects, we have become mired in institutional postures which matter far less than we might suppose. Indeed, Philip Kalpeau's Japanese Zen teachers had 'mixed' backgrounds - and, not everyone toes this 'institutional' line.Chang touches on this issue, which had its roots in Chinese Buddhism, but in the final estimate, it isn't such a big deal. Refreshingly, Garma Chang presents Ch'an/Zen Buddhism on a large canvas, reflecting his wide experience (he had Tibetan Buddhist teachers, besides Chinese ones). Besides this book dealing with Ch'an/Zen, he gave us a beautiful translation of Milarepa's Buddhist verses (The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa), a translation of the Maharatnakuta, and a truly groundbreaking translation of key Hua-yen texts, with lively commentary suitable for contemporary readers. These latter works have kept a stronger profile - but, if you value Ch'an/Zen Buddhism, don't miss this precious little pearl of a book - 'The Practice of Zen.'"},{"Title":"The practice of Zen","review":"Garma C. C. Chang \\"was trained in Chinese monasteries, and at a later stage was initiated into Tibetan Buddhism.\\"He wrote in the Foreword to this 1959 book, \\"In the hope of furthering an understanding of Zen and making things easier for those who have been searching for practical instruction, I selected, translated, and presented herein a number of short autobiographies and discourses of the great Zen Masters, from both ancient and modern sources, which ... are generally unknown in the West. From the contents of these documents one may obtain a picture of the lives and works of the Zen Masters, thus getting a clearer idea of how Zen work is actually done... Although as a whole this book is of an introductory nature, it is perhaps more specific on certain problems and in certain fields of Zen study than some other books of its kind available at present in the English language.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Zen can be explained in numerous ways because there are no definite 'instructions' for Zen to follow... However, in order to make Zen a little easier to understand, let us temporarily and arbitrarily allocate ... koans into the following three groups: 1. Koans that illustrate Zen-truth through plain and direct statements... 2. Koans that illustrate Zen-truth through a negating approach... 3. Koans that may be described as somewhat beyond...\\" (Pg. 17)\\"It the phrase, 'Not thinking of good, not thinking of evil,' is considered by itself, this koan is easily misinterpreted as being negative or nullifying. But the real point of the Sixth Patriarch's remark is in the words that follow: right at this very moment, that is your original face.' Nothing could be more direct and affirmative than this.\\" (Pg. 21)\\"One day, however, when (Prime Minister) Kuo Tse I, as usual, paid a visit to the Zen Master, he asked the following question: 'Your Reverence, how does Buddhism explain egotism?' The Zen Master's face suddenly turned blue, and in an extremely haughty and contemptuous manner he addressed the premier as follows: 'What are you saying, you numbskull?' This unreasonable and unexpected defiance so hurt the feelings of the prime minister that a slight, sullen expression of anger began to show on his face. The Zen Master then smiled and said, 'Your Excellency, this is egotism!'\\" (Pg. 31)\\"Buddhist enlightenment is not gained by holding onto or inflating one's self-awareness. On the contrary, it is gained through killing or crushing any attachment to this illuminating consciousness; only by transcending it can one come to the innermost core of Mind---the perfectly free and thoroughly nonsubstantial illuminating-Voidness.\\" (Pg. 44)\\"The work of our Ch'an has no gradual processes or successive stages. This Ch'an is the supreme Ch'an of seeing one's Buddha-nature instantly. But if this is so, why should one bother to practice the so-called Seven Days' Meditation? [We must understand that] people's capacity to practice the Dharma is deteriorating all the time. Nowadays people have too many distracting thoughts in their minds. Therefore the Patriarchs have designed special methods and techniques, such as the Seven Days' Meditation Practice, the koan exercises, the circle-running exercise, and so forth, to cope with this condition and to help persons of lesser capacity.\\" (Pg. 75)"},{"Title":"The Whirlwind Wedding (Wedded Blitz) (Harlequin Romance)","review":"In this second book in the Wedded Blitz Trilogy, the mysterious Cupid Committee turns its attention to matching super-logical Gray and his childhood friend, super-emotional Emma.

Doheny","review":"This book is a fascinating look at the life and times of one Edward Doheny the onetime founder of Mexican Oil Company prior to the nationalization of reserves by the revolutionary PRI party in the early days of their power. The narrative follows the career of Mr. Doheny from his modest prospector days in the Wild West to the heights of his infamy during the Teapot Dome scandal.This is perhaps a timely book as well given the questions being raised at the time of this writing about corporate malfeasance and corruption in the U.S. (Enron). Teapot Dome was one of the biggest political scandals in the first half of the 20th century and involved the leasing of government/public lands in preserve areas for energy development. More than one person went to prison and wrongdoing was proven against multiple individuals in the matter.The book makes the case that Doheny was more or less guilty of poor judgment and being in the wrong place at the wrong time more or less. It is true of course that Doheny was found innocent on the charges and it is also true that despite this Teapot Dome is the matter for which he is best known (despite for instance being a contemporary and rival of John D. Rockefeller in the oil business). If in fact he was innocent of the charges then he paid a heavy price in terms of his health and the somewhat mysterious death of his son, which was either suicide or murder depending on who you ask and how you look at it.For those with an interest in the biographies of the early titans of U.S. industry this is a worthy read in that it does detail Mr. Doheny's rise to power as well as his fall from grace. He came from a modest background and did not make his fortune until after the age of 40 in a time before life expectations averaged 70+. He suffered through personal loses and setbacks and managed at the time of his death, despite the misfortunes, to bequeath a sizeable fortune to his heirs. This book may also be of particular interest in the study of Los Angelos in particular and California in general in that the Doheny's were prominent citizens who built some noteworthy structures in the city including religious and educational facilities.The author acknowledges that she had the cooperation and blessings of the descendants of Mr. Doheny and that a good body of original documentation was available for review and research. This provides an intimate look at the lives of the people in question but it also may cause the thesis to lean towards their views. The book does tend to exonerate Doheny in Teapot Dome and it does make a good argument that his involvement was not profitable and that the Navy Dept in fact sought him out because of rising fears of the Japanese Navy in the years leading up to WWII. It was a condition of Mr. Doheny's development of the area under lease to him that he build an extensive oil storage and supply facility for the Navy in the Hawaiian Isles out of his own pocket. This he did and subsequently was not reimbursed when the lease was negated despite having spent many millions in pre-WWII monies. It is also I believe true to state that it was Henry Sinclair who was the actual lease holder on the Teapot Dome acreage and that Doheny was leased an entirely separate parcel of public land. Sinclair along with Interior Secretary Albert Fall went to prison in the affair but Doheny was also tarred and feathered by the affair.Whether the delivery of $100,000 in cash by Doheny's son to Sec. Fall was in fact a personal loan much as one might expect between old prospecting buddies (which they were) is really a matter of conjecture. At any rate there was clearly the appearance of impropriety in the matter and both Doheny's son and the man accompanying him that night were involved in a murder/suicide after indictment but before trial. With the principle witness gone and little other corobative evidence Mr. Doheny's celebrity legal representation did get him acquitted although he was convicted in the court of public opinion.Personally I am inclined to believe a man of his stature might loan a friend the sum in question but I also would not be surprised if a quid pro quo were expected in return. You see there was any number of companies competing in secret for the government contracts and it is interesting that both men who won had either the appearance of impropriety or were outright convicted of bribery. Part of the reason Doheny was spared prison was in fact due to the death of his son and his earnest and teary eyed appearance on the witness stand where he looked the part of a grieving grandfatherly figure who had lost something money could not replace.It is an intriguing story and well written book, not terribly long or archaic for the casual reader. While it is a history book it is in fact also the story of an interesting chapter in American business and personality history."},{"Title":"Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L. Doheny","review":"Margaret Leslie Davis has done it again with another fine biography. Ms. Davis shows us the inner man of Edward L. Doheny, one of the richest and greatest Californians in history, virtually the John D. Rockefeller, Sr. of the West. Doheny was flat broke at the ripe age of 40 and yet within a few years he became one of the richest men in the country through his wild-cat oil discoveries in Los Angeles and Mexico. The break-up of Rockefeller's Standard Oil by the U.S. Supreme Court left Doheny an opening which he exploited adroitly. Most impressive is Ms. Davis's keen legal understanding and her scrupulous attention to noting her sources. In fact, the &quot;notes&quot; at the end of the book are arranged so that the top of the page refers the reader to the page number of the text thereby making it very easy to flip back and check the source. A small detail, perhaps, but much appreciated. Ms. Davis is a true scholar; her legal training shows itself especially when discussing the Tea Pot Dome scandal that ultimately tarnished Doheny's reputation. In short, Ms. Davis is becoming our finest historian on the West and particularly California."},{"Title":"Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

Doheny","review":"This book chronicles the rise of Edward Doheny who was an oil tycoon much wealthier than John D. Rockefeller. Based in California, Doheny almost single handedly created the national and international markets for oil which started out with his discovery of crude in what is now downtown Los Angeles.Unfortunately for Doheny and his family, he never had enough oil wells despite owning thousands of acres of oil rich land in the U.S. and Mexico. The greed for oil led to the Teapot Dome scandal of the Harding administration which ultimately led to the death of Doheny's only son and the suicide of the son's partner in the mansion that oil built--Greystone in Beverly Hills.The book is well researched and the timeliness of it is as significant today as the story was from 1905 to the 1930's.The best part of the book is that it is rich in anecdotes not only about Doheny and his son, but also about his second wife who became an important rare book collector when Doheny's health declined. Her collection was auctioned off to benefit the Catholic Church and that story alone deserves the writing of another book."},{"Title":"Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

Doheny","review":"Good read, except for the fact that the author deliberately omitted the fact that Ned Doheny & Hugh Plunkett were gay. Ned Doheny probably was bisexual and he spent a lot of time with his buddy Hugh Plunkett. Certainly the Doheny family asked the author to downplay this issue in exchange for their co-operation with the book. Hugh was more than a \\"private secretary\\". I assume the author is straight; so she would not understand Ned's sexuality; Ned was spoiled rotten, an only child, and was given everything money could buy. It is a wonder Hollywood never made a film of this story; perhaps the Doheny family have something to do with this? In 1929, it was assumed that Ned and Hugh were lovers. Ms Davis has tried to change history? For a price? The public is not that stupid. Especially now with the scandals coming out of that seminary in Camarillo for pediphile priests that Estelle Doheny donated so many millions to. It is a wonder the Doheny family did not provide more photos as there are more at the USC library than Ms Davis was able to come up with in this book. The Beverly Hills Historical Society has a better collection of photos of Greystone; fully furnished in its heyday than you see in this book. Behind every great fortune there is a great crime. I expected to read something I had not heard before; but she is afraid to go there. Did Lucy Battson die with her secret? It was scandalous to be gay in those days, but not now. Maybe a gay author could have done the story justice. Her details about the oil fields are great; it is the social history that is lacking.

Dr. Palma is one of the best Assemblies of God theologians. I gave it the rating simply because it is not very deep and is quite short. At best it is an overview of cults and false teachings. The &quot;truth&quot; aspect is also very limited. Other books on cults should be read unless your time is limited."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes (Spanish Edition)","review":"I've studied Latin, German, Japanese, and French using various popular methods. This course with its accompanying audio and workbook materials is the best language course that I have ever attempted on my own. Most self-study language courses are either too simple to be of practical use or focus so much on grammar and sentence construction that they turn into drudgery after a few lessons. Unless the course material is engaging, it's very hard to continue the course with no mid-term or final exams as motivation. Simply put, I enjoyed this course so much that I looked forward to each of my weekly self-study sessions."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes (Spanish Edition)","review":"I received my book in a timely manner as promised. The book itself was in the condition listed, but the listing also said \\"with Audio CD\\". The problem is I only received 1 CD not 2. The CD I received clearly reads \\"CD 2 of 2\\" this means I am missing CD 1 of 2. I would be less upset if I had received the first CD, as that is the one I need for my class at this time. I should point out that at the time I made my purchase I was not aware that the book should have contained 2 CD's, if I had known this I would have been leery of the listing stating \\"with Audio CD\\" not CD's. I now need to purchase the first CD separately and will have to wait for it to be delivered. I prefer to buy my books on line as they are cheaper and for a student this is a very important aspect of maintaining my budget. That said this experience will make me reconsider future purchases. I recommend checking any books purchased and all accompanying accessories immediately after receiving them. I did not do this and that is my mistake."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes (Spanish Edition)","review":"Unfortunately I bought this thinking it would meet the requirements of the French class.

There are also many mistakes in grammar throughout. The decision to try to introduce slang was poorly made, as the slang that is used is incredibly outdated and, even if it were not now, it would be so in a year."},{"Title":"Watching TV with the Red Chinese: A Novel","review":"Mr. Whisnant takes us to a level of self awareness that we may not care to see in ourselves. Who are we as Americans? Can any of us pinpoint what makes us an American? Whisnant uses the first person, third party perspective to try and answer such questions. The structure of the story is clever, Mr. Whisnant uses the &quot;filming&quot; of the Chinese men to tie in various segments of his book. A great way to visualize the characters. And I especially enjoyed the eroticism between the main character Dexter and his 'love' Suzanne. Too bad the &quot;bathtub&quot; scene couldn't have been more detailed. But perhaps that can be enhanced in another 'possible world'."},{"Title":"Watching TV with the Red Chinese: A Novel","review":"I discovered this book serendipitously about five years ago. It's fantastic. Funny, wise and poignant in ways that most modern novels of the past two decades have completely missed. I kept waiting for another book...but I guess this one wasn't such a hit. Too bad. Luke Whisnant seemed to have real insight to the outsiders among us and a compassion that is all too rare in young novelists."},{"Title":"Watching TV with the Red Chinese: A Novel","review":"I was fortunate enough to take classes at East Carolina University with Luke serving as my Associate Professor. The man flat-out knows how to write concise, tight and poignant prose. Just for better understanding of his style, I bought this book and read it prior to taking my second class of his - it's very good. His short stories are exemplary as well, and could be found with some good searching skills."},{"Title":"Choreographing Difference: The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance","review":"Albright has certainly accomplished a task few dance history scholars have: she gives us a comprehensive approach to dance from a variety of theoretical perspectives. However, I find her narrative style elliptical, and I also find fault with her seemingly overzealous application of theory. Albright applies many of the theorists currently en vogue in academia to dance study, often with great results. On the other hand, the variety of rubrics she uses obscures the most important part of her study: her point of view. Her pairings are stimulating, and certainly evocative. Yet what results is a good amount of speculation, not firmly grounded in rigorous historical/cultural research or in choreographic analysis. I found each chapter glittered with fascinating ideas and concepts which could have been better fleshed out. Albright presents those interested in applying theory to dance with an interesting challenge: how can dance theory change its reputation from being a field of dilettantism to a field of scholarship? I think the first step is to set out a cohesive analytic frame from the start of a study, rather than throwing a hodge-podge of post-structural/post-colonial theory to bat against a corpus composed of two hundred+ years of history and thousands of works."},{"Title":"Choreographing Difference: The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance","review":"An essential read for the socially concerned dance lover. This book navigates a tricky path that follows the dancing body through subjectivism and objectivism, and the identities that it cannot escape. Albright delicately manages to show how lines of gender, race, form, ability and other identities can be created and crossed by dances and the bodies that dance them. Recommended to choreographers, dancers, dance watchers and anyone who is interested in social constructs of identity."},{"Title":"Choreographing Difference: The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance","review":"I felt some type of connection to this book as I passed it in the shop. I have been a dance teacher for 13 years, and I have never thought to use dance as Ms. Albright has. Her section on Sex in Dance got many more students to join my class. Ms. Albright is an amazing author and some day I wish to see her dance. Her ideas are on dance are brilliant and artistic. This book has changed my life as a person, artist, but mostly as a dancer."},{"Title":"Choreographing Difference: The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance","review":"this was a very beautiful book, ms.

It didn't disappoint me. The characters, style and plot twists, some of which I'd forgotten in the intervening years, all reminded me how much I enjoy this sort of mystery. My only regret is that this is, as far as I can determine, the only novel by the late author. It is a genuinely delightful christmas mystery."},{"Title":"A Carol in the Dark","review":"While this book is not specifically about Christmas there is a plot aspect that does take place only at Christmas. But even though it is not about Christmas it is a great mystrey. I would classify it as a cozy. There are two mysteries: a thresure hunt and two murders. The treasure hunt would need a specialist to solve but that did not detract from the fun. It had interesting characters and plot turns which kept me turning the pages and staying up too late.Alas this seems to be the only book by this author which is a great disappointment. My recommendation: don't miss it."},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"Although this cookbook is a Zen vegetarian cookbook, it is an essential for all novice cooks or people seeking to understand the basics of meal preparation and cooking. It teaches knife care, cutting technique, and how to combine foods. Tassajara Hot Springs, after about 167 years as a resort became the first Zen monastery outside of Asia. The author, Edward Espe Brown, was a dishwasher at Tassajara who worked his way to cook in a year, just when the resort became a monastery. Tassajara Cooking was his second of three books (the first was the Tassajara Bread Book). The third book is the Tassajara Recipe Book.Because it is steeped in Zen philosophy, Tassajara Cooking emphasizes understanding the elements of your food. If you master the basics, what can you add in the next level? What is the simple flavor of the food? What complements that food? What might be in season at the same time that you can include to make a full meal and not just a dish?Tassajara Cooking does not rely on exact measurements. In fact, this doesn't look like a modern cookbook at all. The recipes are conversational and list only ingredients and then describe how to make the dish in paragraph form. You adapt to your taste and eyes, which is how you learn to cook and how you develop a relationship of trust with yourself and your kitchen. If you are afraid to cook this way, bypass this book. If you want to develop independence in the kitchen, grab this fast so you learn to cook extemporaneously.If you want a vegetarian cookbook that teaches tofu and seitan recipes, this is not the book. This book hales from the era when vegetarians ate vegetables (and nuts). As I recall, there are no tofu or seitan recipes. You'll have to find your fake meat recipes elsewhere."},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"This book is a how-to-cook, not what-to-cook book. Instead of individual recipes, the emphasis is on how to take ingredients and create tasty and appealing meals from them without much fuss. The book begins with a short chapter on knives and how to use them. It then moves on to various cooking methods, such as saut&eacute;ing, and braising, before briefly listing common vegetables and their seasons. The main part of the book is organized into 3 sections: vegetables (ordered by season), other ingredients (fruits, nuts, grains, dairy, etc.) and combined foods (condiments, soups, sauces, and casseroles). The book closes with a brief section on caring for kitchen equipment.Rather than specifying exact amounts, Brown describes the general idea for creating a recipe for each vegetable. He suggests several ingredients that might go well together with the vegetable at hand, and a cooking method, but it is left up to the reader to decide what ratios and amounts to use. One advantage of this approach is that the recipes can easily be scaled to feed one person or one hundred. Instead of specific cooking instructions, Brown draws the cook's attention to factors that may affect the taste or aesthetic qualities of the dish, and leaves it up to the cook to make the final decisions. The lack of specific amounts in many of the recipes might be disconcerting to some, especially those who are just starting out in the kitchen. Others will find Brown's approach liberating, and they may finally learn to cook, instead of just following recipes.Although the recipes are entirely vegetarian, the book could be useful for anyone who regularly cooks vegetables. Some of the recipes call for dairy or eggs, but in many cases, Brown also suggests options that would be suitable for vegans. In addition to covering common Western vegetables, Brown includes suggestions for cooking some sea vegetables and other common Japanese ingredients like miso."},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"Tassajara is famous as the first Buddhist monestary outside of Asia. I believe it's in California. But you don't have to give a damn about Zen to get a lot of useful info out of this book. I like it because it is very basic. It teaches you how to cook, rather than just listing recipes. Some of the stuff may be a little too basic for the practiced chef, but most people have never learned the best way to saute or even slice an onion. My favorite part is the recipe for soup. No particular kind of soup, just a chart for making any sort of soup, based on what you have on hand!"},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"Maybe you are learning to cook by following recipes in good cook books, and (one hopes) varying from the recipes based on the ingredients at hand. This is a wonderful companion for the student chef - and very much worth a little time tracking a copy down second-hand. (The book is, sadly, out of print.)The book is so friendly and accessible, with early editions including amateurish drawings and hand-printed messages, with such a playful (while certainly informative) tone, there is no intimidation. At the front of the book is a good orientation on knife care and safe chopping, as well as different styles of chopping (the &quot;julienne&quot; versus the &quot;round cut,&quot; for example). The book is then organized into food groups, with chapters on basic ingredients essential for healthy (and tasty) vegetarian cooking. The facts about each vegetable, legume, or grain, and some very basic recipes to show how it might be prepared - with a strong encouragement to improvise!"},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"I picked this up at a used bookstore, with not very high hopes for it, and was I suprised. I feel like my &quot;recipe books&quot; are holding me back. Tassajara cooking teaches you to cook in a spontaneous and practical (using whatever you have in the fridge) manner. The Zen Buddhist perspective is refreshing. It is a fun book and you never have to worry about having the ingredients because the recipes are more vague guidelines for going insane in the kitchen. I used to get frustrated by things not turning out, now I know that everything turns out in its own way. This also has a section on cutting and knife-sharpening. Definately track this out-of-print book down!"},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"Back when I was a teenager, in the early 1970's, I decided to become a vegetarian. I nearly gave up. There was no 'vegetarian option' on menus, and precious few vegetarian cookery books about either. I had two. One was a stern Mitteleuoropa tome heavily concerned with 'Food Reform', full of recipes utilising grated carrots and lots of nuts. The other was a macrobiotic tract which was more of a work of philosophy than a practical cookery book. Then along came this cheerful, laid-back Californian Zen monk who said \\"Hey, relax. It's really not that difficult. Just watch me.\\" And that's what it's like. Watching someone cooking. There are very few cookery books which can take the place of a one-to-one lesson, and Tassajara Cooking is one of them. There aren't that many actual recipes, it's more a case of 'you've bought some... brown rice, brussel sprouts, lentils, whatever. Now, this is what you do with them...'With the hindsight of thirty-five years, there are faults you could find. There is probably more in the way of fat, sugar and dairy products than most modern vegetarins would like. If your'e looking for precise recipes for particular dishes, this is not the book for you.On the whole, though, these are minor quibbles. This is without doubt, a book which celebrates food, in a way that few others do. And it it is without doubt, the book I would recommend to a beginning cook, whether or not they were a vegetarian."},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. If I had to choose just ten books to take with me to the assisted living center, this would be one of them because1) Brown's prose perfectly, elegantly embodies Strunk & White's \\"plain English style.\\"2) It is a fine cookbook with simple, healthful, tasty recipes and sound techniques;3) Through my interest in cooking, Brown introduced me to Zen Buddhism. I have read other Buddhist literature and still think Brown is among the best in expressing Buddhist philosophy.4) Brown is so gently funny.5) In summary, this is a practical, profound, artistic, spiritual, and humorous book that is useful in many ways.Here are some of the quotes that changed my cooking and thinking:\\"But why not ask the cucumber, why not ask the radish? What is the taste it would like to express? (p. 21.)\\"\\"When are the vegetables still good? Vegetables are still good up to, but not including, the point at which they become rotten (p.18).\\""},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"It's a good thing this book is back in print because mine is totally trashed! Tassajara Cooking is not for the intuitive cook who can fly around the kitchen throwing things together to make a meal. If you're not a confident intuitive cook, however, it will help turn you into one. I've got the First Edition and have referred to it over twenty years. I've never seen another cookbook like it. It takes the stress out of having to strictly follow a recipe and buy every single ingredient by teaching the fundamentals of creating something tasty and nutritious with what you have on hand. Its gentle presentation and hand-drawn pictures make it \\"comfort food\\" in book form, turning an intimidating kitchen into a fun and creative place. Think of the exhausting list of ingredients in the average soup recipe. The soup section makes the best soups I've ever had, with very few common ingredients. You just don't need all that other stuff to make great-tasting healthful food! I like Tassajara Cooking more than Tassajara Recipes, but I recommend both. And I HIGHLY recommend the Tassajara Bread Book."},{"Title":"Tassajara Cooking - A Zen Center Book","review":"I thought this might have updates, changes from the original brown covered Tassajara Cooking that I have and love.

What is timeless about the style of this book is that a basic recipe is given and then other ingredient choices follow to add variety if desired. The book focuses on simple recipes using vegetables with grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, dairy, and eggs as enhancements. You will not find a bunch of exotic ingredients. If you are the type that likes recipes with exact measurements, this is not the cookbook for you. This book is about cooking and experimenting as much as it is about the recipes. It is enhanced with line drawings. It is a very calming experience to cook from this book."},{"Title":"Volcanoes of the national parks in Hawaii,","review":"This is an informative guide and picture book covering the volcanoes of Hawaii's Volcano National Park. It contains a brief introductory section covering general information about volcanoes and the types of volcanic activity that built the Hawaiian archipelago. There are then separate chapters for each of the volcanoes in the park: Mauna Loa, Kilauea, and Haleakala. End material includes a brief history of the volcano observatory on the rim of Kilauea, a selected bibliography, and a glossary. The book is amply illustrated with color photographs and maps.Although brief, the text manages to convey considerable information. As we hiked through Volcano National Park, we wondered about the age of the different lava flows and the chemical composition of the lava. Answers to these questions and more were easy to find in this book. The book also contains images of most of the well known sights of the park."},{"Title":"Shadows of the Future: H.G. Wells, Science Fiction, and Prophecy (Utopianism and Communitarianism)","review":"This book suceeds in it's purpose of conveying the blatant themes that run through all of H.G. Wells writing.

Much more than a tourist guide for kids, this points out local attractions plus a bit of history and legend. Attractive captioned illustrations enliven each page and at times add a touch of humour. Some of the vocabulary may be difficult for youngsters, but the format lends itself to reading aloud. Ms Kaupuiki also includes a glossary and pronunciation guide for many of the Hawaiian words, although it seems to be taken for granted that readers will know that Peter and his dog are wearing helmets that ancient Hawaiian warriors wore, though why they wear them, I don\`t know (because he is skateboarding?) I grew up in Hawaii, with local history lessons and all, but even I learned a thing or two from Peter Panini. My two boys enjoy hearing about places they know, as well as finding out about the other islands and some basic history and lore. I wonder if other states have as interesting geography books for kids about their region."},{"Title":"In Times of War and Peace","review":"This is the best photography I have ever purchased. Amazing work these two brothers have done over the years. I was touched and awed many times when I was turning the pages. I spent an hour in my favorite reading chair silently looking through this book, beginning ten minutes after it arrived at my apartment. It is an inspiration to anyone who takes photographs. This book has incredible integrity and beauty. The photos are not only glimpses into important events of the last 20 years, but they also work very well as examples of real mastery of the camera and of the power of images in our lives.This book means a lot to me. Every photography student should have it on their shelf. It has helped refresh my faith in the importance of taking pictures.I've learned a lot from it and I would like to express my gratitude to the Turnleys."},{"Title":"In Times of War and Peace","review":"David and Peter Turnley have happened to be present at some of the most interesting moments in world history...some of the their subject matter is subtle, some obviously important. All of the events covered have far reaching repercussions upon looking back in time. (Perhaps with the exception of Peter's photos of Paris at the end of the book...those are simply lovely photos from a design perspective.) The Turnley brothers are true documentary photographers... catching people and events in motion, not setting up a pretty shot for a magazine cover. In that way, their photographs combine a raw beauty with important storytelling if you know enough about world events to &quot;read the shot.&quot; Even if you don't, these photos will make you want to know more about what has been happening in these different parts of the world. Amazing, sometimes painful, always truthful photo collection."},{"Title":"In Times of War and Peace","review":"...honestly, this book would be among them.Say what some might about photojournalism, this book holds a remarkable cross-section of \\"news\\" photography - the scope of this book is truly impressive, especially for *only* two individual photographers; nevermind the fact that they're twins!As I continue to research and untangle the trecherous and painful history of this world - and the wars that serve as it's unfortunate landmarks - I've often turned to this book for a window to many of the events that I read about. ... the photos in this book are rife with emotion expressed by the subjects of these shots.This book may be unsatisfactory for those who require a thick dose of melodramatic action shots in order to feel like the events covered have been done justice. But for those who wish to see what these events looked like through the subtle (and many times not-too-subtle) vista of civilian life, this book will absorb your again and again.From the South African Apartheid to The Palestinian Intifada; The First Gulf War to the one in Kosovo, this book will take you to all the places that you read about in the news, and give you a very candid look at what's really going on, and what it meant to the millions of ordinary people who are caught in the middle of it all, then subsequently overlooked when the memoirs are written."},{"Title":"In Times of War and Peace","review":"These two photographers managed to put themselves into the middle of where history was being made, and have next to nothing to show for it. There probably were great moments of tension, passion and danger taking place while they were taking pictures, but none of them show up in the book.

How about capturing some emotional depth, or at least something more than flat played-out scenes the NYT has already run into the ground."},{"Title":"In Times of War and Peace","review":"Come on. These guys are OK, but do they really deserve their own book? Yeah, they've got the twin factor going for them, but as photographers I wouldn't spend 60 bucks on this book unless my coffee table was lacking a good paperweight.

The nearly 250 photographs relating to American cities from the pre-Civil War decades to the eve of WWII are roughly divided into the four stages development, maturity, transformation, and diffusion. Earliest photographs from the 1830s and '40s capture plainly the crude, clustered buildings sprouting up in open spaces, as in uncomprehending witness to what was unfolding. Photographs from the latter 1800s reach into the impoverished, fragile, hectic lives of immigrants flooding into the cities. Jacob Riis's photographs figure prominently in this period. Into the 20th century, the photographs again change in subjects and perspectives to go along with modernism's tenets of Promethean, prodigious, growth, large-scale enterprises, and celebration of technology and design. Springing from the \\"discipline [of] American cultural history,\\" this revised and expanded edition of the 1884 publication not only contains additional photographs, but also related added text reflecting the growth of government sponsorship, mass-market reproduction, the place of women and African-Americans, and the diminished presence of \\"individual studio practice.\\" Yet despite this last new topic, Hale also in one part brings out the \\"photographic studio as itself [in italics in original] a part of the developing American urban fabric.\\" Like the earlier edition which has now become a collector's item, this revised edition is patently the leading study on photography as it took cities as subjects and reflected evolving attitudes toward them."},{"Title":"The New Webster's Crossword Dictionary","review":"This is a great book for anyone wanting help with crossword puzzles.

A Room at a Time is an easy to read book, with wonderful information on the Womens' Suffrage Movement, and women in the powerful place of politics. I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics","review":"As a young boy I was always fascinated with the tales of intrepid archaeologists, Schliemann at Troy or Carter in Egypt. I imagined myself accompanying them as they dramatically uncovered humanity's hidden history.Many years later as an adult I volunteered for an archaeological survey. I followed a trail of Anasazi flint chips to the top of a hill and discovered an 13th century American tool factory with a great view of the Utah high desert. Not exactly the walls of Troy or the treasures of Tutankhamen, but a source of joy and wonder neverthelessAccompanying Jo Freeman as she uncovers the hidden history of how women entered into the political parties gave me a similar sense of wonder and discovery. Her book begins with a section called \\"Myth As History\\". Freeman meticulously demolishes the convenient myth that the Suffrage Movement \\"failed\\" because women did not storm the barricades of American politics and vote as a revolutionary bloc.As a political activist as well as a scholar, Freeman understands that political change is a complex process with many fits and starts. She explains that women political activists were a diverse group ranging from radical feminists to stalwart big city machine bosses. Sometimes these divergent groups worked in tandem when their interests coincided. More often they worked separately or even at cross-purposes.Yet, as more women slowly entered politics \\"a room at a time\\", politics became more democratic. Voting moved from the saloon to the local grade school polling place. Issues like child labor and public health came to the forefront. Is it a coincidence that most of the significant social legslation in America came about after women entered politics as activists and voters?Freeman dug deep into the sources to bring this hidden history to the surface. While doing so she uncovered a political tragedy worthy of a Sophocles or a Shakespeare-- the moral decline of the Republican Party.It may surprise today's readers to learn that for most of its history, the Republican Party was the party of feminism and women's rights. The GOP began its life as party of radical reform, attracting feminists, abolitionists, free soilers and even socialists to its ranks. Susan B. Anthony, Ida B.

It will leave you with a solid knowledge of what a workhorse it is - not as sexy as the Shuttle - more like a crew cab pickup truck that just gets better and better with every version release. The majority of the book has great relevant technical detail with some good yarn spinning to add flavor. The functional relationship between Soyuz and Salyut, MIR and ISS is nicely detailed in this book.With that said, it's a shame the authors released it with out more editing. There is one section that clearly was published in draft form with the notations left in for further clarification or to add more information at a later date. It is actually kind of amusing that the authors where using a shorthand at one point that was meant to be searched and replaced - and they didn't - thus they share there cute nickname for the Russians.The authors should be applauded for the hard work they put into researching and assembling this book. The publisher should be spanked for not finding them a couple of hungry graduate engineering assistants to help turn this into something more readable"},{"Title":"Soyuz: A Universal Spacecraft (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"The Soviet/Russian space program has already operated 4 space stations ( Salyut-series, Mir, ISS ). This book by BIS president Rex D. Hall focuzes on the story of the Soyuz spacecraft which has been used to bring both visitors and resident crews to the Space Stations. An integral element of Salyut , Mir and Internatioanl Space Station ISS operations, the small ferry has been the mainstay of cosmonaut transportation since 1967. In addition, since 1978 the unmanned freighter version called Progress has provided a means in which to regularly re-supply a space station and so prolong its orbital lifetime.Using authentic Soviet and Russian sources this book is the first known work in the west dedicated to revealing the full story of the Soyuz series. The book describes Mission Hardware and Support Docking Missions from 1966 - 70 , the 1971-81 Soyuz Manned Ferry, the 1978 onwards Progress Cargo-Resupply Ferry , the 1979 - 86 Soyuz T manned ferry, the updated Soyuz TM, 1986 - 2002 to Mir and the very latest Soyuz TMA which has become the vehicle to bring crews to ISS since the accident of shuttle Columbia.An excellent reference work (it includes a complete listing of vehicle production numbers ), the only minus I see is that this book is not available in Hardcover ...Philip CORNEILLE"},{"Title":"Soyuz: A Universal Spacecraft (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"This book provides an overview of the Soyuz hardware and Soyuz flights up through the Soyuz TMA, with in-depth coverage of many early flights.

A must have for anyone who loves Blake and Extremely helpful for anyone who wants to know him and his work."},{"Title":"William Blake: The Creation of the Songs, From Manuscript to Illuminated Printing","review":"I used to buy art books only from bargain shelves and tables, sometimes from bookstores that were only selling bargain books. Amazon.com has both varieties of books, and it would be unfair for me to review one book when I really think you should buy the other (bargain) variety. There should not be much confusion between two 304 page books with the title WILLIAM BLAKE when the books are actually the same, but the contents are of such variety, listing Peter Ackroyd, Marilyn Butler, Robin Hamlyn, and Michael Phillips as authors of the exhibition guide for the exhibition at Tate Britain, London, 9 November 2000 - 11 February 2001, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 29 March - 24 June 2001, so it might be possible for someone who was looking to see if the listing in two places was identical to discover differences in the information given, though I believe both books are published in 2001 by Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated, New York (Printed and bound in Great Britain).If you just want pictures, some of which seem quite large, this book has 250 illustrations, including 240 plates in full color. If you like descriptions of pictures, you might find yourself jumping around in the book. A large picture on page 10 is labeled: \`Opposite: \`Newton' 1795/c. 1805 (no. 249, detail) on page 11. After the Index on pages 296-298 is a Checklist of Works Exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on pages 299-304 provide a variety of numbers, including a catalogue number in brackets as follows:129 [249] Newton 1795/c. 1805 Color print finished in pen and ink and watercolor 46 x 60 (18 1/8 x 23 5/8) on paper approx. 54.5 x 76 (21 1/2 x 30) Tate; presented by W. Graham Robertson 1939The full picture is shown on page 213 with a tiny number 249 in the corner by the top margin and a description on page 212 that includes more information than above about \\"Signed \`1795 WB inv [in monogram]' and the inscription. It is possible that the detail page 10 is about full size, showing the lower 30 cm. of a picture that is 46 cm. tall. Catalogue number 248, Sketch for Newton c. 1795 described on page 212 as being on a paper slightly smaller than standard typing paper, might not appear in this book at all. Turning back the page from 212 to pages 210-211 reveals a gigantic crawling Nebuchadnezzar 1795/c. 1805 (no. 247, detail) which is a 30 x 46 cm. (almost 12 inch by 18 inch) enlargement of less than half of a picture that was even larger 44.6 x 62 (17 5/8 x 24 3/8) originally. Pages 210-211 is almost lifesize, with a nose 2 inches long and 5 inches from the bottom of Nebuchadnezzar's lower lip to the part in his hair just above his forehead.It is difficult to tell how many numbered pictures are not in this book. The final catalogue number 303 described as \`Jerusalem. The Emanation of the Giant Albion 1804 - c. 1820' on page 282 is a general reference used to cover paintings of Jerusalem plate 97 (detail) (p. 283), Plate 1 (p. 284), Plate 2 (p. 285), Plates 3, 4, 9, and 11 (p. 287), Plate 12, Plate 26 (p. 289), Plates 51, 69, 70, 84 (p. 291), Plates 92, 97, 99 (p. 293), and pages describing these 15 plates describe 7 plates from Jerusalem that are not shown.People who are interested in reading interpretations of Blake's works will find a sponsor's forward by Stephen Deuchar on page 7, Acknowledgements and Preface by Robin Hamlyn, Christine Riding and Elizabeth Barker on pages 8-9, \`William Blake: The Man' by Peter Ackroyd on pages 11-13, \`Blake in His Time' by Marilyn Butler on pages 15-25, a Chronology on pages 26-28 and initials of 10 individuals indicating other authorship on page 29.\`One of the Gothic Artists' on pages 32-97 describes items up to catalogue number 96, \`The Queen of Heaven in Glory.' \`The Furnace of Lambeth's Vale' on pages 100-171 starts with a description of Blake's Printmaking Studio and various techniques, including a detail on page 111 shown more than 5 times the original size of the small print no. 107 There is No Natural Religion 1788/1795 Copy L shown on page 110. There is in this part a political section called \\"Lambeth and the Terror\\" on pages 152-167 which mention items of \`Rex vs. Blake' catalogue numbers 208 through 210, items that are not shown. Perhaps we learn more by merely seeing no. 212, The Accusers c. 1804 Copy E on page 167, \\"A Scene in the Last Judgment.\\"Pictures are generally clear enough for the lettering by William Blake to be legible, where it is not too small, but pages have been selected without regard to the continuity of the original text. For example, Blake's comments on Swedenborg in his book THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL, Catalogue no. 127, pages 132-135, include Plate 21 and Plate 24 but not the pages between to and from which the thoughts carry over.\`Chambers of the Imagination' on pages 174-257 includes items numbered from 219 to 297 The Ancient of Days 1824? \`Many Formidable Works' on pages 258-293 concludes with many plates from a few of Blake's works. No. 298 Plate 42 \`The Tyger' on page 269 (upper left) is lightly colored, \\"Shown in profile beneath the pale blue bark of a tree trunk,\\" (p. 268) while no. 163 Plate 42 Copy G c. 1793-1794 on page 155 shows a tree and tyger with much darker colors.Anyone who plans to enjoy looking at the pictures more than anything else could start with this book.

This book has a lot of great ideas but in my opinion does have some flaws. There is a section on cardio and eating which is good, the workout programs in the book are good but not my favorite. Over all I would say this bood is a worth while book on strength training and most people would learn at least something from the book to make it worth your money."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"This book has extensive variations of all sorts of exercises. In the first impression, I felt that was a distraction from simplifying life for exercisers. Yet, the variation of equipments, environment, and exercises convinced me that could help people to choose among many options. One exercise of T-bar row was done with the bar anchored on a dumbbell, which made me feel uneasy. Yet, it could help people where machines are scarce. Many gyms I visited lack the T-bar row machine and the idea of using a heavy dumbbell isn't bad for a beginner. It could cause injury if the dumbbell moves, though.Also, few exercises were done by tubes tied around the vertical pole of a squat rack. In the beginning that looked weird. Again, it sounds like an innovative idea if you do not have access to the right equipments. My fear is that if the tube snaps cut, it might bounce back and hit the face. Many of the exercises that involved tubes pulling a barbell or attached to hands or legs, made me uneasy as well.What attracted me to the book were the chapters on cardiovascular disease, arthritis, injury, and overweight. Here, the authors were very restrained, erring on the safe side by providing almost germane information without attempting to pontificate, with few exceptions. I did not entertain the idea that whole grains and fruits help overweight people lose weight. Nor did I like the idea that going to the gym on an empty stomach is a bad thing. Overweight people are extreme in overeating and obsession with food and advising them to fill up prior to going to the gym is unwise. In addition, lifting weight does very little (in 12 weeks) in regard to losing weight.Many overweight fellows, I knew in my life, who frequent fitness literature have read and believed in the fallacy that eating 5 to 7 meals a day helps lose weight. They would unconsciously pick and choose what is congruent with their desires and forgo what is not. A 400 lb fellow at 25, whom I advised to start training in the morning on an empty stomach, did show up as advised. After a casual inquiry, he admitted that he drank half a gallon whole milk and a litter of grape fruit juice. He believed that his stomach was still empty since there was no solid food involved. For him, \\"empty stomach\\" has a different meaning of what I thought an empty stomach should be. He was not able to do seated press in a 30-pound barbell. Moreover, to my surprise, his wife adored his fat flaps and enjoyed feeding him with all sorts of fattening food that should be forbidden even to skinny folks. That shows that nutritional opinions should be left to specialists with credentials in that science.The chapters on strengthening isolated muscle groups are inclusive and dense with great assortment of relevant exercises. Even the antiquated one-hand snatch and cleans are included, though under gluteal and hip strengthening. All the squat poses in the book are lousy. Even the persons photographed in the book have disproportionately slim legs. The front squat is a joke with the bar displaced forward from the shoulders and the elbows lowered to the sides. One big guy is performing shoulder shrugging with a 20-pound barbell while his arm muscles are greater than his thighs. That demonstrates the poor body proportion with people preferring isolation of muscle groups over integration of compound exercises.The Sport-specific chapters and the weekly plans do not belong to the book. The authors could not claim to be experts on all sports to which they prescribe exercises. Such inflated ego diminishes the credibility of its authorship. The weekly plans lack proper sequence of exercises and ignore individual variations and volume periodization. The book is a great reference on innovative exercises and exercising methodology and should limit its scope to its strongest facets.Mohamed F.

I believe I'm in a good position to write a review for it. What I like about the book is that:- It describes a large number of exercises in great detail (along with \\"make it easier\\" and \\"- harder\\" versions)- It included traditional as well as newer exercises- Useful for beginners as well as advanced lifters- Includes topics like nutrition, cardio-workouts, sports specific fitness etc. in reasonable details- The book doesn't make any unrealistic promises. (The results you achieve depend on the efforts you put in; a book can only guide you along the path)- Gives injury prevention tips- Makes an excellent reference guide- Although the title says \\"Men's health\\", it can be used by women too (My wife often looks up exercises from it)- Offers advice based on science-backed wisdom- Useful if you want to do strength/weight training (as opposed to ONLY bodybuilding)- Doesn't promote any brand-named productsThis book helped me a lot when I was a total beginner and I still look it up when I feel like changing my routine or to check if my form is correct. Although I have used other fitness books, this book remains the backbone of my lifting plan. Over all, I'll highly recommend this book if you are serious about fitness and weight-training, even if you are a beginner."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"This book is exactly what I've been looking for. As an ex-college athlete, I still play in three sports in amateur city leagues and take fitness very seriously. Prior to getting this book my main lifting regimen was basically the same as I did while in college, without the supervision. I basically hit a plateau and improvements were hard to come by. Since getting this book, I've jazzed up my lifting routine a lot. A vast variety of exercises a presented for every muscle group, and there is very good literature on the physiology of the muscles for optimal results. The weekly plans are a good trade-off of quality and quantity, with good variation to hit all muscle groups and have enough recuperation time between. I do not like the previous review stating that the models in the book had skinny legs. As a matter of fact, I thought the models looked very athletic. The athletic build is very different from a power-lifter or weight-lifter build. Bulky legs with fat calves and a small acheles heel seen on a lot of weightlifters actually hinder athletic ability (agility). Though the extra literature on body types, sport related workouts, back pain etc where sparse compared to core workouts, I still found the info very useful for people involved in weight-lifting not only for bulky muscles, but for everyday muscular efficiency. I think the exercises and plans in this book will suit anyone who wants to look athletic with reasonable size (not overly hunky), and also be able to apply the size/strength gained in everyday activities and athletics. Five stars all the way."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"I bought this book about 2 years ago. I wanted to brush up on my lifting and gain a more thorough understanding of the intricacies of lifting. This book is designed for one purpose. To get people, (men) big. It does just that. The advice, the programs, the food and supplement info, even the injury prevention and rehabilition are top notch. Try it you will see results.Special things to note about this book. It understands that low rep, heavy weight, and short workouts are the fastest most efficient way to size. You may have to read between the lines and get creative on your own. It encourages you to come up with your own training splits. I have found that the exercise programs listed take about 45 minutes. Personally I feel the most benefit splitting my workouts further keeping them at around 30 to 35 minutes. But using his workout plans I have popped up to 205 from 190. Looking at the programs it may be a shocker to see 3x2 in a workout. But it has the benefits. This is a book that will work for everyone. Forget the insane volume programs endorsed by bodybuilding greats Arnold Schwarzenneger and Bill Pearl. Its not necessary. Furthermore they are less efficient. If I were to recommend program to anyone I would start with this book."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"This training manual will teach you everything from how many calories you should eat each day, to overall healthy habits."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"This is a great guide for the new or experienced lifter who has the interest and motivation to stick with a regular, self-directed fitness regimen. It presents itself as a complete guide for the lifter, addressing a little muscle science, motivation, hundreds of exercises broken down by body part, suggested workouts to achieve a variety of ends (size, strength, hybrid), and addresses diet/nutrition, gaining or losing weight, and workouts tailored for specific situations (overweight, arthritis, back pain, etc). At just short of 400 large pages, and crammed with excellent b&w; photos, there is a lot here.The strongest part of the book for me is the presentation of the many different exercises, with accompanying photos showing proper form for each one. True, a lot of the different exercises are essentially the same movement using dumbbells, cables, or tubing; but even so, there is tremendous variety here. Further, there are suggestions on making easier or harder almost all of them. For lifters who fall into a dull regular routine, there is a lot of material here to help shake up your workout and stimulate new growth.Also good are the suggested workouts based on the lifter's goals, be they for straight strength and powerlifting, or body building, or for the improvement of individual sport performance.The areas I found weakest are the sections on nutrition, which is not covered in the kind of detail I would have preferred to see. It's nice that the reader is not being urged to buy specific brand-name supplements or the like, but in the case of this book some more directed information would I think have been useful.All in all, the book is outstanding if the reader is a lifter who enjoys building and rebuilding his workout routines. The advice is realistic - you get out of a fitness regimen what you put into it and nothing more - and the book is not going to promise some overnight physical conversion. It gives the reader a lot to chew on, and what you do with it is entirely up to you."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"This book has many different workout plans for total body, arms, shoulders, etc. It also has a ton of good information on calorie intake, health habits , and tools to create you own, powerful workout plan."},{"Title":"Men's Health Maximum Muscle Plan: The High-Efficiency Workout Program to Increase Your Strength and Muscle Size in Just 12 Weeks","review":"just out dated.

(Goosebumps Series)","review":".I have enjoyed reading the Goosebumps Books with my little friend very much. The stories are a challenging way to introduce children into the wonderful world of books, plus the give them the thrill of a little fear that is resolved. Together, we have shared strange and intriguing adventures. Each has been satisfying, but this book was a bit of a disappointment.Mr. Saur was angered by the report turned in by his student Greg Banks (from book 4, this is 44). Greg turned in his report about a cursed camera, and Mr. Saur called him a liar and demanded he bring the camera to school. In addition, he would have to write a \\"truthful\\" report.Old Sourball, the teacher, said, \\"If you can't taste it, feel it, see it, hear it, or smell it -- it doesn't exist.\\" Oh, what a surprise was in store for him.The events that occur when someone takes a picture or is the subject of it are hectic, delightful and funny. Greg, in trepidation decided to take the camera Sourball snatched, from the class, but he was caught. The teacher took a picture of the class. By now, everyone knew it was really cursed, and Greg's classmates were fearful.They learned that for every picture, there is an adverse reaction, which takes time to learn and find a way back to normalcy.When my little friend and I finished the book, she looked at me perplexed and said, \\"Huh?\\" It did not conclude; he simply stopped writing. Being a writer myself I wrote 4 chapters that night (5 pages), and read them to her the next day. I explained what happened and wrote a satisfying ending, available to anyone who asks.It made the difference in her desire to read another book. So, if you find a Goosebumps book that leaves you hanging ... write your own ending; your children will love it. This shows them that they can imagine whatever they want, and just because a book ends, it doesn't have to stop their imagination.I tried to increase the stars by one, but all to no avail. It must have something to do with the camera."},{"Title":"Say Cheese And Die--Again!

He read them to me. I read them to my kids and my grandkids. The vocabulary, the cadences, the varied plots and the sheer magic of these tales is timeless. The poems at the beginning of each chapter are related to the hours. Kids insist that you read them too. Pyle always sees to it that bullies, evil magicians, cheaters and older nasty siblings get their comeuppance. Little ones enjoy that aspect. Great archaic words are dusted off along with long disused similies and metaphores. It's the kind of book that comes to mind when you meet a bright eyed new child who has read everything else or seen everything else. At age 70 I still keep a copy in my bed's head board. Rap, tap, tap he knocked at the door."},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"The Wonder Clock book has been a favorite source of bedtime stories for three generations of Leadley boys (my father, myself and and my son). It is best read (and read and read ...) from ages 7 to 10. The book contains 24 separate faux fairy tales that are just the right length for a 15 minute bedtime story. The short stories are bound together by a metastory of the &quot;wonder clock&quot; that whisks the narrator off to observe and recount the other 24 tales. Each story is preceded by a short, illuminated poem, starts with a scrollwork capital and contains at least two wonderfully ornate illustrations. DO NOT buy a copy of this book which doesn't contain the original illustrations! They are part of the &quot;wonder&quot; for young readers. The stories are set in the Middle Ages somewhere in northern Europe (&iquest;Belgium, Holland or southern Germany?) and feature lots of minor kings, princes, princesses, woodcutters, swineherds, ruffians, rogues and magical creatures.Caveats:1) Although the Wonder Clock book can be read alone by precocious readers as early as second grade, I would recommend a joint reading the first time through with asides on morality. It is my belief that the actions in stories that feature villians being dragged to death behind wild horses, beatings, blindings, whippings, etc. need to be given moral context when a young child is first exposed to them.2) I'm not sure whether this book would have as powerful an appeal to girls. Among us, my grandfather, my father and I have only raised one girl out of ten children (my aunt) and don't have much experience to offer. Upon reading the book again from an adult prospective, I've found the female protagonists (the wise queen, the wise princess, the magical Swan Maiden, etc.) curiously passive. Even Princess Golden Hair, who treks to the end of the earth in search of her beloved husband banished by magic, seems unassertive.Conclusion: Kids, especially boys, love it. Don't feed it to them unadulterated :-)."},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"I agree with everything Scott Leadley said, with the additional comments that 1) my daughter, now 10, has always loved these stories as much as my son, in spite of the lack of active female characters (at least on the side of Good); 2) Pyle, like Kipling, understood how to write a story that would be read aloud to children. The paragraphs are short, the vocabulary pointed, and something interesting happens two or three times a page; 3) as Pyle admits in the introduction, the elements of the stories are extracted and mixed from classic fairy stories; for example, in one story the hero kills a dragon by digging a pit, waiting until the dragon crawls over him, and stabbing it in the belly, an obvious borrow from the event in the 'Volsunga Saga' in which the hero Sigurd kills Fafnir the dragon. If you know the older stories you'll enjoy spotting Pyle's sources."},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"I have been searching for this book for quite a while.

Drawings are included to add further depth. Each ends with a morality lesson, which never interferes with the story, but helps wrap up that entry.This nineteenth century collection is remarkable in different ways depending on the reader. The tales provide insight into daily household life and the morality of a bygone era.

If you at all like the original Grimms Fairy Tales, you'll love this book"},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"The Wonder Clock is one of my favorite books of all time. I am now 76, but I read it (and it was read to me) throughout my childhood. Its stories had morals, but they were subtle; your nose was not rubbed in it. The language is stimulating, because it\`s slightly archaic, not slangy. Some of the stories are dramatic and some are very funny. (Some would be scary to 3-4 year olds.)In subsequent years in my professional life, I came to realize that these stories are about peasantry--its moral sense, its lack of productivity, its class structure. In fact, when I was in graduate school, I was detailed to assist another grad student from Central Europe in writing his dissertation. He was himself a peasant and wanted to explain to Americans what peasantry was all about. His English was excellent, but his writing skills were meager. If I had never read The Wonder Clock, I could have made nothing out of it.I suppose the point is that Wonder Clock can be enjoyed at many levels. Kids love the fanciful stories that are a little more tart than Mother Goose. And the parent can get a lot out of them, too. I have read this book to my grand children and they loved it."},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"I'll keep it short and sweet, the *Dodo press* edition of this classic title is *completely without illustrations.* This book is robbed of much of its beauty and utility without them.Do not order the Dodo Press version.

Two thumbs WAY up ;o)"},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"This book has been in my family for four generations, the 1912 edition having been given to my father by his grandmother in 1948.The premise of the story is given in the introduction; the narrator happens upon a marvelous clock in Father Time's attic, which strikes the hour with songs and puppet dances. Twenty-four stories follow, one for each hour of the day. Each story begins with a verse that corresponds to the hour of the day: lighting the fire, preparing breakfast, sending the children to school, making the noonday meal, milking, tea, bedtime. The verses alone are fascinating, as they bring to life the househould routines of a very different era.The stories are illustrated with Howard Pyle's remarkable drawings. Each tale has a frontispiece for the title, and the beginning of the text and each picture caption is heralded with a large ornmental letter like those in illuminated manuscripts. The illustrations are gorgeous. Pyle was fond of capturing scenes of nobility and royal splendour, pastoral life, and witchcraft. Some are stylized portraits of princesses in exquisite gowns and classic poses, while others demonstrate Pyle's gift for caricature and expression.The stories themselves are wonderful, full of heroes and heroines, bravery, beauty, wits and trickery. Although there are allusions to mystic and Christian themes, and to folklore and fables, most of the stories will be unfamiliar and fresh to modern readers. The langauge is rich with metaphor, droll imagery, and dialogue that is made to be read aloud. As with Aesop's fables, the stories are meant to instruct, but the morals take a back seat to the storytelling, at least until the conclusion of each tale, and a great deal is left up to the reader to interpret.This was my favorite book as a child, and I still turn to it on sleepless nights. But our beloved family heirloom is growing very delicate, so I am very glad that the book is still in print. I hope to share it with my own children someday."},{"Title":"THE WONDER CLOCK.","review":"I bought this book from the recommendation of Livingmath.net's booklists. We love fairy tales, and this book was supposed to tie into a time theme for math studies. Unfortunately, this book has nothing at all to do with time. It's merely a book of fairy tales.The book is introduced with an story about a \\"wonder clock.\\" Each chapter is preceded by a portion of a poem that goes through the 24 hours of the day. But the stories themselves have no connection to that particular time or any time at all. They are fairy tales, plain and simple. There is no math in this book. This is not a living math book. A living book, yes, but not a math book.Some of the stories are better than others. At the end of about a fourth of the stories, my daughter will look at me and say, \\"THAT was weird!\\" Yes, in fairy tales, you have to suspend disbelief. But talking sausages, a fox who marries and then later eats his goose wife, and a rabbit who begs a prince to chop of its head to break a spell all seemed too far-fetched even for fairy tales. On the positive side we've enjoyed some of the unique vocabulary and expressions as well as the wonderful illustrations.

Boy...did I make a mistake not reading the reviews first on this one (which I almost always do first and won't make that mistake again!).The book started off on a good note - beautiful and bewitching blond socialite meets up with handsome and dynamic high ranking duke and a relationship develops.Although, I didn't mind the heroine Venus not being a virgin and actually preferred she had a little experience as the virgin thing is over-rated...I did not on the other hand enjoy that she appeared to have dozens of lovers over her life time of 25 years and was quite the sex maniac.The hero Jack is the man about town sleeping with nearly everyone and anyone. The first time the two meet, they are attracted but, she thumbs her nose at him once she knows who he is and his reputation as a ladies man. Then in a complete turn of events, within minutes of their second meeting they indulged in some hot and heavy sex.I had hoped the story line would pick up and become more interesting after this initial get together and although there were some twists and turns....most of the book revolved around their sexual needs and desires which were constant.And I need to be clear about one fact...this book is only about sex...only about raw lust...NOT love...that seemed to be added to make it fall under the category of a romance. A few of the scenes were more graphic than I like - such as the cork top to a bottle, a wine bottle itself and a sewing spoon...you'll have to read the book to understand how those \\"trinkets\\" fit into the book.I really enjoy passionate historical romances but, I like to see interest and attraction build over a period of time between characters and hold off on complete intimacy for a bit to make it even better. Some of the dialogue between the characters was brash, abrasive and coarse as can be. It was dirty from beginning to end. I thought this book bordered on soft to hard core written porn. I imagine some readers will be looking for just that. I was not. I like love stories to be more developed (such as the characters and their feelings and hopes and wishes and dreams), some adventure and then intimacy. I guess the problem is this is not a true love story.This book was really sex, sex, and more sex. I got tired just reading it.I bought a second book by this author.I thought about returning it but, instead told a friend about it and gave her the 2nd book to read. I didn't want to waste another evening reading this author.I like some things left to the imagination. This author doesn't allow you to have an imagination - she lays it out for you to read in graphic detail. This one should not be listed as a historical romance - the period might have been in this time frame but, the content was not. It belonged in the \\"how to have raunchy and dirty sex\\" section of the book store.This one just wasn't for me - a real \\"turn-off\\" instead of a \\"turn-on\\".If I could have given less than one star I would have. Sorry."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"As a fan of Susan Johnson's books, this one presents me with a real dilemma. On the one hand, Legendary Lover is filled with Johnson's trademark sensuality and historical research. On the other hand, this book is virtually identical to the two other Johnson books I have read. Johnson has found a successful formula and sticks very closely to it. The hero and heroine meet, they immediately jump into bed for lots of intense sex, the hero virtually kidnaps the heroine and takes her to his private hermitage by a river where they spend a week or so running around naked and having lots more sex and then - 100 pages into the book - some sort of plot emerges. What is it with these river houses? If you've enjoyed the Johnson formula in the past, you'll probably like this one, too. I do have one major complaint about the book, though. I was really appalled by the fact that the hero repeatedly ignored the heroine's desire to use birth control. Not acceptable today, not acceptable then. No matter how urgent the circumstance."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I recommend LEGENDARY LOVER to those who are willing to stretch their boundaries, put aside preconceived ideas of what a romance novel should be. This story is a wonderfully intellectual erotic read, a true EROTIC ROMANCE. She simply achieves a very appealing balance of love, history, and lots of hot sex! In the erotica department, Susan's imagination knows no limits. This story is about Venus Duras the daughter of Pasha and Trixie Duras (A Touch of Sin). Jack and Venus are two headstrong people who make a darling couple. Neither of them want to make comments or become married.

The hero (Jack) and heroine (Venus) are very likable characters. There is no bickering between the two. They have a wonderful relationship throughout the entire story. They are so sexy and charming together. This was quite a treat."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I'm a little ashamed to even have this on my \\"read\\" shelf. I noticed it had a lot of 4 and 5 Star ratings and I literally had to double check the book I was reading... (or was trying to read), I guess that's what makes this forum so great, everyone has and is able to share there own opinions, and in my opinion it was really, really bad!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Passion, steamy page turning plots, and incredible characters have made this book such a page turner, that its forever creased from reading it over and over again. One of my favorite romances of Johnson. If you want passion, and a great book to keep you up all night wondering \\"oh whats next?\\" Read this book! Its remarkable!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"After To Please a Lady, I was hoping Ms. Johnson would somehow magically revert to her earlier writing style. I picked up her earlier books because they were well written, filled with historical information, and had very sensual scenes. Legendary Lover has none of the above attributes. The writing is sophomoric and crude. I don't mind plain speaking or using \\"dirty\\" words, a little spice sometimes is nice. But sprinkle it in, don't drown the reader in it. There is nothing historical going on in this book. We get a brief glimpse into the Crystal Palace and the fair in England in 1851 (which has some great historical ramifications), in the first 5 pages of the story and a quick trip to the Derby and that's it. Unlike her earlier books where the stories revolve around what is happening in the political and social arena of the time, this book is strictly about sex.I never got to like our lead characters. Venus, at least, has one redeeming quality: she opens hospitals for the less fortunate. I suppose when you are drowning in money you should do something to help the poor. Besides this superficial plot, there is nothing to our main characters (besides sex). I always enjoyed the little historical journeys Ms. Johnson's provides in the endnotes of her books. Unfortunately, after cramming 5 endnotes in the first 30 pages, we only see 2 or 3 more for the remainder of the book.The biggest disappointment to me is the sex and the way it was written. Where some of her previous stories have had some pretty explicit scenes, they where well written and I always thought they stayed in the realm of sensual. These scenes, which rolled from one paragraph to the next, (there was very little writing here except sex scenes), were boring. After the first time, we don't need any more since they are all the same and not very descriptive. (There is a fine line here, but...everything was graphic but not descriptive.) I would rather see one long scene where our characters are making love (say 30 pages) then them going for another romp every page and a half. Although I don't like to say this...don't bother reading Legendary Lover."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Legendary Lover continues author Susan Johnson's highly sensual and erotic romance style and, like the others in the Duras family series, this one sizzles with sex from beginning to end. Pasha Duras' daughter Venus is similar to Daisy Black in another of Johnson's series on the Braddock-Black family. Venus is independent and wealthy enough to thumb her nose at society and do as she pleases in and out of bed. Like many of Johnson's female leads, she has an interest in more than just society life. Jack Fitz-James, young and cut somewhat out of the same mold as Trey Braddock Black, is the rich and sexy Marquis of Redvers, a notorious rake. The book plot, a little weaker than her other books but still good, is propelled largely by steamy sex as the two try to avoid marriage to each other and any other suitors. You definitely don't have to read the previous two books in the series to enjoy this offering. As always, Johnson incorporates a heady use of elegant and sophisticated vocabulary to create her scenes and her dialogue entices with its brevity, laced with innuendo and suggestive spice."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Jack Fitz-James and Venus Duras are stunningly attractive, wealthy, independent, and bored, bored, BORED! Bored with popular society and it's aimless pursuits. Bored with the countless members of the opposite sex who throw themselves at them. Bored with the love affairs that they have both had. And then...Venus and Jack meet. Sparks fly. Clothes are thrown off. A torrid love affair begins. And Venus and Jack begin to wonder - is this just lust? Or is the irrestible pull they feel toward each other something more...?Why do I enjoy reading Susan Johnson's books? Is it for the labyrinthe stories? The deep and moving characters? No, no, no! It's for the erotic and imaginative love scenes - and this book has them (plenty of them). No one writes witty repartee between lovers better than Johnson does, and there is plenty of that here, too. The previous Duras family books are my favorite of Johnson's novels, and this one is right up there with the other two.I don't mean to sell this book short. Ms. Johnson does research her novels well (her books are the only romance novels I know of that have footnotes). And there is a story, of sorts. But really, you won't care because the love scenes, and the lovers, are so hot and so much fun. If you're looking for a fast, sexy, and witty romance, this is the book for you. Thanks to Ms. Johnson for an entertaining read!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"While I do not like the work of Susan Johnson, I feel obliged to defend her use of certain vulgarisms in this book about the Regency era. The F word is known to have been in use since the 1400s. Back then, it meant to destroy or spoil. Its use to describe the act of copulation has been in existence since the late-1600s. The C word is even older than the F word, and has been in use since the early 1300s. So, contrary to what various reviewers have said previously, Ms. Johnson IS entirely accurate to have Regency era characters use these words, vulgar as such may be.Information about the historical appearance of English words is available in the book, English through the Ages, by William Brohaugh. It was published in 1998 by Writers Digest Books."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Legendary Lover is a wonderfully light novel about sex, society, and secrets in nineteenth century England. Susan Johnson is known for her inventive love scenes, and this book certainly doesn't lack in that respect. I do disagree, however, with the reviewer who said that sex was all that Venus and Jack's relationship is based on. The main point of Jack's attraction to Venus is that she is different from all the society belles he has known: she has a brain and thinks for herself. Johnson's novels of late all feature this same sort of independent female lead character and it makes for some intriguing dialogue and situations. It's true that this book doesn't have as much plot as some of Johnson's older ones, but you probably won't care because the characters are so interesting. And the sex is as hot as is to be expected from Susan Johnson. She is truly the queen of romantic fiction, and I look forward to having the chance to read her again."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Let me sum up the plot of this entire book for you: SEX.An oversexed man and an oversexed woman meet and they have a lot of sex. And then they have more sex. And more. And more. And, let me think--yep--more. I never thought I'd grow tired of reading about sex, but well, there you have it...I did.If you think I'm exaggerating, think again. This book was page after page of nothing but sex with very little plot or dialogue in between scenes. And of course, when there was actual dialogue, the hero and heroine were usually having sex at the time. The most exciting part of the entire book was when they got tired of having sex in the country, so they boarded the heroine's boat to have sex at sea. It wasn't much, but at least it was a change of scenery.Still, I gave Johnson a three for a few reasons: (1) she's a good writer, (2) unlike the majority of her books, the hero and heroine remained faithful, even during their inevitable separation toward the book's end, and (3) she does write good &quot;scenes&quot;--the problem is that she just writes too many of them.Johnson would be incredible if she used her talent for the erotic in combination with the culmination of an actual plot. As is, however, Ms. Johnson gives new meaning to the phrase &quot;too much of a good thing&quot;."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"No story line. The only thing the book is about is sex. If the book was made into a movie it would be rated XXX. I like romance not porno."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Susan Johnson never fails to exude an indulgent and passionate style in her stories, and with Legendary Lover, she scores again with her fluid grace and stark eroticism. Venus Duras and Jack - the Marquis of Redvers are attracted hypnotically to each other from the start of the book - and showers of sparks flew between them with their witty and quirk innuendoes and dialogues. They are too obstinate and independent to let passion overrule their mind, but as they entrenched in hot carnal mating, both are discovering their inexplicable infatutation and desires for each other.Susan Johnson is one of the few romantic authors of today who dares to be unbridled in her sensuality. Her writing is refreshing, teasing and engaging. None of the authors today can rival her in crafting scintillating dialogues and feisty heroines like Venus. Lengendary Lover is indulgent and scandalously bold - with such melting chemistry between the two characters. There is a lush moment of poignancy when Jack realizes he rather trade his freedom for the love, and behind the treachery of the ton and whimisical villains such as the Palmers - the exciting pace of the romance is set.My only complaint is that Johnson's trademark historical details are quite lacking in this book - but with the story's wit and wicked sensuality, it more than makes up for it. Detractors may find the sexual scenes in the book an affront, but for me, it just spice up the chemistry even more.Susan Johnson never fails to amaze readers with her richly-taliored historical details and sensual writing. It is what sets her apart from accomplished erotic writers like Thea Devine and Beatrice Small - who strays onto dark eroticism. Her style is warm, passionate and inviting - and that is what makes up Legendary Lover to be the hottest book up-to-date."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read , possibly including college textbooks... at least those have some educational value.Johnson's novel, however, was horribly disappointing. There was so little character development and plot that the only thing that I remember about the hero and heroine was that they were physically engaged more often than not. What was even worse was the abundance of crude conversation throughout the novel. And just when I thought there might be some small hope for redemption, the book ended.The thought of keeping it on my shelf (with my keepers, of all things!!!) was so distasteful that I donated it to the local library. I think that the only reasons that I chose to finish this book (and it was a very conscious decision) was because I've never stopped reading a novel before its ending and I was on vacation in Laughlin. I should have spent more time in the casino..."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I buy all of Susan Johnson's novels. Unfortunately, the last one that I actually felt had a good story and interesting characters was Brazen (which I'm re-reading now). Legendary Lover is not that great, but I got through reading this one as opposed to her last two novels in the Duras family saga. I would say, that if you're a fan of Ms. Johnson's previous novels you'll enjoy Legendary Lover, but it doesn't live up to her previous novels."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"This was one of the worse books i have ever read and I usually like this author very much. There is no plot at all. The entire book is one sex scene after another."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Jack is pushed into a set-up to meet Venus Duras by his meddling godmother, and the moment they touch, voilins play, fire works go off, birds sing, the ball room breaks out into a dance number a la Rogers and Hammerstein, and pretty soon he and Venus are boinking like rabbits. And that's the rest of the book. The hero and heroine have an endurance level that even the Olympian gods wouldn't be able to match, and if you cut out all the \\"love\\" scenes and only kept the portions of this book devoted to plot, it'd be less than fifty pages long.I'll stop being a grouch for five seconds to admit that Johnson has potential as a writer. Jack was a likable character, when he wasn't being written into the 19th century's version of Mark David Chapman, and the reader wants him and Venus to admit they love each other and get married, if only to put an end to the sex scenes that occasionally border on the S&M; side. However, I was never convinced their attraction for one another was more than temporal, and the scenes that may have convinced me otherwize, -- where they talk as friends and two people with shared interests -- the author only told us about, sacrificing the heart of the story in favor of . . . well, the warm bath, I suppose. The subplot, where scheming members of the ton try to separate the hero and heroine, was also unconvincing, and added nothing to the story except pages.This is not a love story, or even a romance, but pornography with a pretty cover, plain and simple. To be honest, I didn't know whether to give this book four stars for the sex scenes or one star because of them, but it appears my literary sensibilities have won out. If you're looking for sex, buy this book. If you want a story worth more than the paper it's printed on, don't waste your money on LEGENDARY LOVER."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Some authors add horror, suspense, mystery and other extravant plot twists to their love stories because their romance can't stand on their own. Us die hard SJ fans know why she doesn't need these other crutches and you will too after you read this book. Heck, she could write about grass growing and make it sound fascinating, clever, and romantic. With Legendary Lover, her settings are less lavish and adventurous than her earlier books Blaze and Sinful. Thank goodness! Because this allows her to concentrate on the more important things, such as letting us see how this very smart, independent and sexually experienced couple battle each other with their quick wit, clever dialogue and oh-so-hot bedroom scenes! (hint: this couple is not restricted to the bedroom only! ...As if you could hold these 2 back from their burning passion with ANY restrictions)There is a distinct difference from SJ and other so-called &quot;erotic-romance&quot; writers. Robin Schone, Thea Devine and Bertrice Smalls all left me cold. SJ is the teacher and the rest are her pupils. When I say this book is hot, that means not only are the words hot, but the way she puts them together can just take your breath away. When Venus felt a stir in her stomach, so did I. The cadence of this book is perfection. Just like the anticipation of the ideal roller coaster ride, when you finally catch your breath from the last heated physical and verbal exchange between Venus and Jack, you realize the ride has barely begun and at the next sharp incline, you hang on tight for the ride of your life because the next exchange between Venus and Jack WILL take your breath away! And as the roller coaster screams down the track, scream away because Venus and Jack can't hear you above their own deafening cries."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Susan Johnson is a wonderful writer!

The steamy sex scenes were typical of Susan Johnson's style, but I was hoping that they were less predictable. Venus supposed to have a mind of her own, except when it came to her sexual desires. Often, she would tell herself that she should not do this or that but still succumbed to the sexual temptation. The author only touched on briefly about her intelligence and knowledge. I would prefer more coverage on what Venus and Jack talked about when they were not having sex. The author wanted to convince us that both of them intrigued and attacted each other as equals but there was little character development in that arena. The storyline was rather straightforward and predictable, definitely not her best but readable."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I kept waiting for a plot to emerge in this book. After page after page of explicit, but not erotic sex, a thin story line did surface. I never did discover what the principal characters found to &quot;love&quot; in each other.

Oh, well I guess they got on with perpetuating the race and another cast of selfish characters."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I do hope this boring exercise (&quot;How many times can I say &quot;f**k&quot; and &quot;c**t and still call this a Regency?&quot;) is not a sign of things to come in Romance fiction.Couldn't finish this thing, couldn't even get halfway, though if you like a lot of obscenities and coldly abrupt copulations, detestable protagonists and no plot whatsoever, this is your book.I couldn't help but feel that this is breaking new ground in introducing obscenity to the frilly but innocuous realm of romance fiction.

Recommendation: Save your money."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"While not quite as good as \\"Wicked\\" this book is on my keeper shelf. Last night, having plowed through several more \\"serious\\" historicals this month (including one of Johnson's), I reread LL. Johnson's characters are cheeky and unrepentant about their sexual appetites, and she's a master of sexy, clever dialog. True, this is not one of her more weighty historicals, but as always, I found her footnotes with research facts about the time period in the back of her book completely fascinating. If you skip these - you're missing out! Understand - this book is primarily about sex, so don't expect some complicated plot. With this type of SJ book, the characters, the sex, and the process of their moving from lust to love is the story. Truly, this should be classified as erotica (at its finest!)."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Although this isn't a particularly great romance novel, I'm giving it about 3.5 stars because I think it's perfect when you're in a certain mood. And there really aren't alot of authors that can do this kind of book well. First let me be upfront. Neither of the main characters are very deep. Venus is beautiful, rich, smart, confident, and if I met her on the street, I'd instantly hate her. Jack is sexy, spoiled, rich, a little immature, and totally glib. FYI, they are 25 and 24 respectively. He reminds me of an ex boyfriend I had, and not in a good way. :) The first time I read this was in my teens and I thought it was awful. Back then I loved Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught and I couldn't believe how shallow these characters were. I'm 35 now and reading this for the second time, and having totally forgotten the plot, I found it amazingly refreshing! It's great to have a heroine who is pretty modern in her sensibilities (well-educated and not a virgin) even if she is a little too perfect; I found it pretty believable that she could bring a guy like Jack to his knees bc she's so supremely confident. In the real world, it's much more believable that a woman like Venus would manage that rarist of conversions, NOT your usual historical romance simpering virgin! This is a light book with lots of sex, witty banter, and very little plot. In typical SJ style, lots of use of the f-word and many many steamy scenes. I found it the perfect antidote to a stressful week at work!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I've read most of her books and they usually start out strong but left me disappointed.

Not her best, but certainly worth the price. The name &quot;Venus&quot; was a little grating on such an independent woman, but this book will certainly stay on my shelf with all the others."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I only got half way through with the book when I put it down. It was obvious to me there was going to be more of the same in the last half of the book and frankly I didn't want to waste my time. It was then that I checked the reviews from other readers that confirmed my suspicions. I didn't like it that Venus gave in so quickly. I thought the book was going to be about a rake pursuing a woman who didn't want him when all the others did. I was so wrong. If you like sex scenes galore, this book is for you... if you like interesting plots and maybe some (the key word here is some) sex to spice it up, then look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book is lacking in plot, and historical data. However, the numerous sex scenes are great. Undoubtedly, Jack Fitz-James is a &quot;legendary lover.&quot; Another deviations is that the female lead character is neither a virgin nor a widow, while the hero, typically, is a rake and a rogue. While many writers devote their entire plots to efforts by the hero to bed the girl, this book begins with the couple having sex the second time they meet. Jack arrives at midnight, and after a 10-minute waltz with Venus, he drags her to their hosts' library where they spend hours locked in a fantastic sexual encounter (after she makes him find and borrow some condoms). The use of condoms is something you don't usually find in historical romances either. In spite of the weak plot, this is one you can't put down."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"This is the worst of Susan Johnson book's. It is also the first of her books a read, I almost didn't read any others. The dialogue is forced and contrived. The love scenes are almost indifferant. I wanted to take the characters and slap them both. They are shallow and self center and hard to care about. Luckily I decided to give Ms. Johnson another chance and I have been very pleased with the other books I've read."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Venus Duras (Pasha's daughter) is a twenty-five-year old independent woman who is totally uninterested in getting married. She's also an experienced woman who enjoys her sexuality. She's managed to juggle that enjoyment and maintain respectability under scrutiny, a feat not easily accomplished in atmosphere of the ton. The introduction of Jack Fitz-James into her life threatens that accomplishment. The word &quot;marriage&quot; has a visceral affect on twenty-four-year-old Jack Fitz-James, the Marquis of Redvers. It makes him sweat, poises him on the edge of &quot;flight or fight.&quot; There are others who would be unhappy with a marriage between the two: those who've set the sites on Jack for themselves, and relatives who would stand to lose if Jack produced an heir. In Legendary Lover Ms. Johnson has poised herself on the edge--between romance and erotica by veering away from the thematic, plot driven standards of romance. Legendary Lover is hot, hot, hot!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I've read all of Johnson's books and I was highly disappointed with this one. Like all of her books, there are lots of HOT love scenes, but unlike most of her other books, the story lacks depth. Both the hero and heroine are highly attractive people, but the plot does not take advantage of this. On the whole, it's a good read, but I wouldn't advise paying the full list price for it."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"Even realizing that authors are integrating explicit sexual scenes more and more in current romance novels, &quot;The Legendary Lover&quot; makes no effort at a storyline other than sexual exploits.

Think of them as descriptions of sex with a little plot thrown in. Oh, and yeah, her characters happen to live in the 19th century.I normally enjoy a hot Susan Johnson romance, but this book is too much of a rehash of her others--a horny, rich, and bored hero encounters a gorgeous, voluptuous, and brainy heroine. Their love affair consists of trying every sexual position imaginable. To keep up the pretense that she is writing an historical romance, Susan throws in a few footnotes at the end. Don't you just love her cheek?Seriously, if you want to read a good plot that has tons of creative sex thrown in, pick up one of Susan's earlier books, like OUTLAW. LEGENDARY LOVER is ok, but it is tepid compared to Susan's first efforts. But, hey, what do I know? I also like Stephanie Laurens and Thea Devine."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"This is the first Susan Johnson book I have read. I did not appreciate the lack of plot and explicit language used by the characters during the &quot;love&quot; scenes. The main characters were fairly silly, not to mention unbelievable. At the end of the novel I could not establish how the two had fallen in love. Lust, yes; but love no. It would have been more realistic if they parted as friends; given the fact that they spent too much time in bed, instead of trying to get to know each other. Plenty of action, but alas, no story to hold it together."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"They meet in the first chapter; he's interested but she resists.

Spend your money on something else."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I have read only a few things by Susan Johnson, but I have enjoyed them very much. Her style is very erotic and sensual and so it was surprising that some of the reviews were so negative about the erotic nature of this book. It seems that if you are reading a S.J. romance you should expect a high level of sexual content. That said; I found the book witty, fun, and of course, STEAMY! The bedroom banter between Jack and Venus was terrific. I liked that they kept their relationship together throughout all the obstacles thrown their way. No tantrums, or running away, or big miscommunications. They dealt with everything with humor and wit (and a trip to bed!). It was refreshing to have them take so long to fall in love (it would have been unrealistic otherwise), and a little longer to figure it out. Great characters, and a really fun story!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I was highly disappointed in this book. I remember reading Susan Johnson's beginning books (starting with Sinful) and there used to be some plot with enjoyable characters. The love scenes were steamy, but yet romantic. This book was pure sex and the plot was very weak. I skimmed through most of the book and that didn't take very long, that I returned it the very same day. So unless you enjoy just reading the sex scenes, this will be enjoyable for you, if not then stay clear."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I have it right now and I'm about 50 pages from the end and I'm not sure if I'll even finish it; it is so dull and lackluster. There is no erotic tension between the characters, the heroine climaxes endlessly, and the hero has no problem getting aroused 4-5 times a night (ouch). In addition to this, the dialogue is full of needless profanity, the descriptions the worst sort of purple prose, and the author seems to have done very little research into the historical period the novel is set in. Just don't buy it; re-read an old favorite instead. I'm serious."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"I love this BOOK!...I've been a fan of Susan Johnson for two years now..and have read most of her books.This book doesnt dissapoint me and it has its usual fire like her other books. I truly recommend this!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"In 1851 in London's Crystal Palace, legendary womanizer Jack Fitz-James, the Marquis of Redvers, bumps into a beautiful woman as he tries to escape the clutches of two other women. Jack turns on his charm at full blast while inviting his new acquaintance to dinner, but to his shock Venus Duras rejects him due to her knowledge of his outrageous reputation.Not long after that, everyone in the Ton claims to have seen that encounter. Wages on who will gain the upper hand between this pair becomes the most popular bet in town. As Jack pursues Venus, she stuns him further with her attitude. She wants a passionate affair without the ball and chain of marriage. Jack and Venus fall in love, but neither one has ever learned to trust and without a deep faith in the other, their relationship seems doomed to fail before it can fully blossom.LEGENDARY LOVERS is a warm humorous Victorian romance starring two wonderful characters. The story line is a lighthearted romp that fully entertains the audience. The way the Ton reacts will remind the reader how almost every male baby boomer claims to have been at Ali-Frazier I in the Garden and at the ball park for McGuire's sixty-second homer. Though Susan Johnson pokes fun in an amusing manner at the manners of the era, the historical tidbits are well researched and blended into the plot. Ms. Johnson has written a fabulous historical romance that will give much pleasure to sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"The main characters have a weird relationship, but it is definitely not like a normal romance novel relationship. The female character is stronger and more independant than most. The love scenes are very hot!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"At first I didn't think I'd liked the book. The sex scenes seemed too impossible and the language much too modern. However, I found myself thinking about the book and the characters quite a bit and even went back to re-read it!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"What a disappointment. The basic story line was ok..Man and woman meet, sparks fly, and because each has refused to ever marry; they ignore the deeper feelings between them and just have an affair. In come meddling relitives and a jealous mistress and that's it! The main characters were fairly strong but the secondary characters were very weak and not developed enough. Mabye if the book were longer in length (it is only 288 pages long) she could have developed characterization better. Another thing I did not like about the story was the profanity. I mean &quot;come on&quot; how many times do we need to read the &quot;F&quot; word in one sentence let alone on one page. Better than half of the book had the &quot;F&quot; word on each page at least once and on several pages it was said several times, used both in context and in casual conversation. If you ask me, that particular word may have been used in regency England (as it is so often today), but give a reader a break and stick with the sensuality and romance that we buy these books for. Sorry Ms. Johnson but this book is going in the rummage sale!"},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"The classification on Legendary Lover says historical romance--imagine my surprise when I found myself reading soft porn. I've never read anything by Susan Johnson nor heard of her. The back of the book sounded like two strong willed people getting ready to battle it out. I was expecting great dialogue and witty scenes between the characters. What I got was, no story line and lots of graphic sex. I didn't care for this book and won't buy anything else by the author. If this is erotica, then call it erotica--not historical romance.On another note, did they really use the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;c&quot; word back then? If anyone knows when these words came into existence let me know."},{"Title":"Legendary Lover","review":"This is the worst book I ever bought. A total waste of my money. I do not think this book deserves even one star.The only reason I even call this piece of writing a 'book' is the fact that it is bound and sold as one.There is no story here. It is boring, crude porn interspersed with bad language."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"We are retired and face the challenge of maintaining a healthy eating regimen without a daily schedule of work and three meals a day. We transitioned to living an imprecise, unscheduled life style with freedom to choose when and what to eat. Dr. Katz's interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America, clearly demonstrated practical results achieved by women expressing complete satisfaction after preparing The Flavor Point Diet meal plan for themselves and their families. Their testimonials made sense. We purchased the book and tried some of the recipes. I liked it, my husband liked it and I am singing Dr. Katz's praises at every meal. Next, we gave several books as gifts to friends. Two of my favorite recipes are Almond-Crusted Tilapia and Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies! Thank you Drs. Katz!!!"},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"I have tried many different diets in the past years. The Flavor Point Diet, has been very easy to adapt to. The recipes and meal plans in this book seemed as if they would of taken alot of time in preparing the meals. Once you start preparing the meals you find they are done in less than 20 minutes. Reading the information in the book and the reasons for making healthy choices made me think, why shouldn't I take the time to do this,take the time to shop and take the time to prepare healthy foods. It was a very different way to shop compared to the usual run into the grocery store and grab the usual items and the prepared food. The book provided necessary information to eating healthy. Yes, it was different then any diet I had ever tried. No more missing meals. I was shocked to see the results on the scale, I have lost 22lbs in 8 weeks. I am 50+ years old and feel unbelievable. I always had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and taking medication everyday, the change in my health has been fantastic. Everyone should take the time out of their busy lives to choose a healthier way to feed their bodies and mind. Reward yourself and your family. This is one easy way to do it everyday."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"I was already an organic, whole foods, veggie eater, but I have struggled with food cravings and appetite which has prevented weight loss. I was beginning to suspect that my taste buds where behind the problem when I found this book. It really makes sense. This \\"diet\\" is not a fad in any sense...wholesome eating principles with the flavor aspect controlled to keep the appetite in check and make lowering calories EASIER.I wish, however, that the book was a little easier to use. In order to plan menus for the week for my family, I have to flip back and forth between menus, recipes, and brand preference lists which he provides. I can see myself easily becoming frustrated with following the program due to this inconvenience.

I Love the food and the results. I do have a few questions now that I am about to begin phase II. Surprisingly, the only thing I seem to miss on the diet is spicy food. Perhaps that is just a matter of getting used to, but will I ever be able to add Tabasco sauce, chili peppers or strong curries?I intend to stay with this diet even if the answer is no.As a Special Education teacher at a economically depressed Middle School in Sacramento, CA; & it's been very exciting to have my students recognize the changes. We, like most schools in America, have a large population of obese children. I intend to try to set up a program, to educate our students.

I lost 16 pounds in six week and I plan to follow this method the rest of my life. Even though you do feel satisfied with the meals, it's also very satisfying to know that you are no longer loading your body up with sugar, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.Since the book includes a six week, flexible meal plan with all the recipes, the hard part has been done for you.

The recipes are delicious! I don't know which we like the best, but the turkey with cranberry and prunes is a favorite. We don't follow the diet, however, I always have a cold cereal, usually one of the cereals by Kashi..a mid-morning snack consists of a piece of fruit or yogurt..and then one of the dinner recipes. We have not tried any of the desserts, as I usually have fruit topped with fat free yogurt. We have not had any sugary desserts in a month and don't miss them.

I also fix everything this way for my 2 sons as well. They recently complimented me on my cooking!! It is kid friendly and easy!!! Most importantly, scientifically based and easy to stick to.As with any eating plan, it takes planning, but there are shopping lists included. After the first major shopping, the usual weekly shopping excursion was enough, with occaisionaly a run to the grocery store.The food is quite delicious, and I even got my kids to try the pumpkin soup. They didn't LOVE it, but they liked it enough to eat it and said they didn't mind if we have it again.Most importantly, I could stick to this the rest of my life.Try it.

I bought a copy. The concepts are easy to grasp, the messages clearly stated. I was delighted to see the bold critique of product advertising that misleads, equally pleased to have brand names of products that meet the Katzes criteria for healthful foods.

The plan was simple and easy to follow. I've combined it with a little more exercise and I'm down 9lbs. Thank you Dr. Katz."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"The benefits of this plan for me are as follows:(1) Focus on nutrition - the plan focuses on what you should eat everyday and it is healthy (not just weight reducing). This means the whole family can eat together and it is good for all of us. My wife can continue the plan when she gets pregnant - they are balanced meals designed for a healthy lifestyle.(2) Written around what you should eat - rather than a laundry list of stuff you can't eat, the plan lists each day's meals and snacks. I am constantly eating something healthy (and have all snacks planned) - and that is a very effective technique to keep me from eating junk.(3) Rather than forcing us to sign-up for a meal plan where we purchase from a company, the plan provides a list of different brands and ingredient lists that you can choose from. The author isn't on a particular company's payroll, but he does provide brand names to simplify shopping.During the first 2 weeks of the plan, I dropped 5 pounds. This is a healthy rate of weight loss. And my family and I all feel good as well."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"The book is based on not providing too many flavors at one time as your system then wants to satisfy all four taste senses, salt, sweet, sweet, bitter. I enjoyed reading it and have somewhat practiced it. My friend has lost 68 pounds so far and is still going. I didn't do that good, but dropped 8 so far. I am now doing YOU on a diet.

The recipes are amazingly good - I love the lentil salads, and the simple salad dressing is excellent. Other fantastic recipes include the chicken salad, butternut squash soup, sun dried tomato tilapia, white bean and lentil salad, carrot sandwich, and on, and on. Each day there is a different flavor theme, which the author claims prevents cravings. A side benefit for me was finding out what foods I am sensitive to - mushrooms, for example. Who knew? Two of the biggest benefits for me are the lunches - delicious and healthy; and the substitutions - fat-free yogurt and fat-free buttermilk replace cream in some recipes, for example - delicious and satisfying!

I've lost over 15 lbs since I started, and my husband has lost 7 lbs. It's not really a diet, but a different way of preparing meals. The premise of the program is that over the past decades we have inundated our taste buds with a wide variety of pleasurable tastes and we consequently are not able to feel satisfied except with larger portions. The Flavor Point Diet focuses on one or two flavors daily and you feel full and satisfied with a smaller portion. Obviously, it is easier if your entire family buys in to this for it to work, unless you're single."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"The recipes & narrative were boring.

I am finding that I want to stick with it for several reasons...first and foremost - the food is delicious! I am feeling like I'm on a gourmet adventure every day! Foods that I would never have thought I would like are great! I have yet to try a single dessert - there is simply no room for more after dinner. I'm finding that cravings are gone, and I am never hungry!

The ideas, the rationale, the program, the recipes - down to the smallest detail (what grocery aisle contains what item)are so clear, so concise, and so compelling.The tone is friendly but authoritative. There is the \\"one-on-one\\" sense that draws you in to a personal relationship with the authors (love the comments that go along with the recipes) and a feeling that you are interacting with someone who's done the research, put in the time and knows what it's all about. There is wit and wisdom - science and culinary artistry - what a scrumptious stew of possibilities - all beautifully served up and easily digested. And best of all - this feast is for the ENTIRE FAMILY!!! (As a mother and grandmother - that really matters.)Congratulations to the authors - you did it - and I love it! Tonight - stuffed peppers - pecan encrusted tilapia - or shrimp in basil pesto? Who can decide?

(following his doctors instructions) He has lost over 20 lbs. (DANG! I hate that he lost more than I did!) The recipies are so delicious and I have served them to guests and they have raved about them. The first few weeks the shopping and food preparation was time consuming, but well worth it.

We also wanted to lose some weight. However, because we both work full-time jobs, teach college courses part-time, and have two children (ages 3 and 9) to keep up with, eating healthy and losing weight was a challenge. We saw the Flavor Point diet featured on 20/20 and thought we'd give it a try. The meal plans are easy to follow and offer a lot of variety. My husband and I, who have gotten sick of the same-old PBJ or turkey sandwiches for lunch, are really enjoying the lunch recipes. Our favorites were the spinach salad with lentils, raisins, and walnuts and the black bean and tomato salad. We made them the night before, put the salad in one Tupperware and the dressing in another and brought them to work - they were delicious. Our one challenge was figuring out how to have smoothies in the office. We tried a couple of different things but what I found that worked was to make them the night before, freeze them and then put them in our lunch in the morning. This worked like a charm -- they were the perfect consistency by 2 or 3 in the afternoon. My favorite dinner recipe was the roasted chicken with currant wine glaze - I made an 8 lb chicken and we had enough leftovers for two more meals! That is a real plus given our busy schedules. My oldest daughter is a picky eater who absolutely HATES EVERYTHING but chicken -- even SHE LIKED the Baked Tilapia with tomatoes, capers, and black olives. Her favorite Flavor Point dinner was the Mexican stuffed bell peppers which is easy to make and very kid- friendly. We love the food and we've started to lose weight!

I tried to diet and exercise and I couldn't budge that number until Dr. Katz's book. I am beyond thankful for how this book has impacted my life.I lost 22lbs using Dr. Katz's book and I couldn't be happier. David and Catherine Katz are a fabulous team.

Sensory-specific satiety is not a new concept, yet to my knowledge Dr. Katz is the first to consider how the average person can understand it and use it to their advantage. His plan makes it easy to control the appetite simply by eating a variety of lusciously satisfying, healthy balanced meals and snacks while following a \\"theme\\". Does it take effort? Some, but most anything worth doing does! Besides, this plan is as easy to follow as all the others. The difference is: you need not sacrifice your health nor your taste buds to get the results you've been wishing for!"},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"I was mostly interested in the THEORY of limiting flavors to aid in weight loss and management, so when I saw that half the book was devoted to recipes, I was somewhat disappointed.However, after trying just a few of the main course dishes, THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE RECIPE BOOK! Each meal has wonderful flavors and textures, are beautiful and quick to make, and I had most of the ingredients on hand already (that which I did not were easy and inexpensive to obtain). I haven't been as enchanted with the breakfast and lunch menus, but I feel I've already gotten my money's worth many times over with the dinner meals. Roasted Currant Chicken and the Mexican Stuffed Peppers were two of our hands-down favorites. Fits with many diet strategies, too.Highly recommend, both for the theory AND the recipes!"},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"I also participated in the trial for the Flavor Point Diet and am happy and so very proud to announce that my 16 lost pounds have remained so,lost and not missed by any means. Goodbye and fair well. This is quite an accomplishment for me and this is the only diet that I have been able to adhere to. My eating habits have changed for the better and I have discovered trigger foods that make me sluggish and tired (sugar) and achey (ground beef) as examples.I highly recommend this book, it shows how you can accomplish a healthier lifestyle by buying and preparing healthy meals and snacks from the grocery store and not have to rely on pre-packaged, diet meals that add an extra expense to the food budget. Once you learn how to shop and prepare the meals, you're set for life."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"I always thought of myself as a decent cook but I had no clue how and what to cook to be healthier. If people are looking for the diet that will allow them to continue to eat as they had, and lose weight they will never find one. Why else would they be looking for a better diet. I see ads for pills that will take off the weight, diets that will send you the food, and cards so you can count points on what you are eating. Who knows what the adverse effects are in the long range for those diet pills. I mean physics teaches, for every action there is a reaction. For the foods that are delivered, you still have absolutely no idea on how to prepare them for yourself, so when the costs gets to high you are right back where you started. As far as the cards go, I'm sorry I don't want to think that much about what I am eating. The point I am trying to make is this, the book is wonderful. With going through the flavors it helped me appreciate different flavors. Kept me feeling satisfied without ANY effort. and tastes good.

I know what works for weight control and what doesn't, so here is my take on this book:In theory this makes sense. How too much variety of foods and flavors at any one time will cause overeating long term. I completely agree with this. He also is on track with advice on exercise and processed foods. He compares processed foods to cigarettes as far as consequences for your health. Couldn't agree more. I also like how he explains why you find sweet foods too sweet and salty ones too salty after you get used to not using excessive sugar and salt. I tried this myself on peanuts and it's true. The recipes are good for the most part. What I don't like is the diet plan that mandates the same flavor throughout the day. I couldn't and wouldn't want to follow this. While I believe in keeping meals simple and ingredients natural, I don't want to eat the same flavor all day long, but I do think keeping flavors limited one meal at a time is a good idea. One other piece of information he doesn't cover, is when to eat. There is now enough evidence that shows that people who eat the brunt of their calories in the first half of the day (matching it to their metabolism) have a much easier time keeping weight off. Unless they work 3rd shift (and start their day at night), night-time eaters are usually fat because their bodies are forced to store this food since it's no longer needed for energy. This should have been addressed in this book also. I would recommend some parts of this book, just not the diet plan."},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"This book is not for me. The premise of the book is to reduce cravings by eating a particular flavor in all of your meals throughout the day. For example, the flavor of the day may be pineapples. With your breakfast, you will have pineapple juice. Your midmorning snack will be pineapple yogurt. Lunch includes pineapple chicken salad.

He then suggests that our brain has set points for these and if we eat one of the tastes, such as sweet, we have to keep eating this until the set point is satisfied. Maybe. Where this falls apart in my mind is his dietary suggestions, supposedly evolved from the above observations. That is, such things as the peach diet, where the only consistency throughout is the \\"peach\\" with plenty of other opportunities for sour, bitter, savory set points being initiated.

Many of us who are overweight know how to eat healthy - we just don't do it. We are addicted to our ice cream, sodas, sugar, etc. Forget buying this book if you & your family like beef, pork, lamb, veal, etc. On this \\"way of eating\\" you are allowed chicken, turkey & fish. (Most of the people in my family are not fish eaters, including me, and especially talapia, which is the fish that is recommended in the recipe section of the book. Talapia tastes like dirt to me.) Therefore, if I were to follow the instructions, I'd be serving only chicken & turkey. Dr. Katz's research seems sound, and I agree that the food industry has succeeded in \\"addicting\\" us to sugar and over-processed foods. I intend to try some of the recipes (they look pretty good) and I also intend to cut the junk food out of my diet. I've already cut out white bread. Dr. Katz says that our appetites are lulled by flavor consistency. So his theory is that if you eat the same flavor during the day, your brain will turn off the hunger and you will be satiated. So, the first day you incorporate raisins & currants into your meals, the next day, apples, the next, pineapple, and so on. I really would have tried it, but my family likes other things besides chicken & turkey!!"},{"Title":"The Flavor Point Diet: The Delicious, Breakthrough Plan to Turn Off Your Hunger and Lose the Weight for Good","review":"Sorry I bought this book....it wasn't anything that I could follow thru on...guess I'll just stick to watching my 'over active fork'....TJ"},{"Title":"Clifford Algebras and Dirac Operators in Harmonic Analysis (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"This book is helping me a lot with my Ph.D. dissertation.

The heroine with (selective) amnesia. And the thoroughly evil manipulative relatives. In my opinion American romance writers cannot do evil relatives. I mean. The heroine forgets about the man she loved, the fact that he married her and the baby she lost. For what? To live as a moonling companion to a malicious step-father. The entire plot hinges on the serendipitous death of the step-father. And if that hadn't happened neither Isobel nor Eliot would have found happiness together again. I just wanted to shake the pair of them.Strictly speaking this story involves TWO doormats. Isobel and Eliot are abominably abused and lead by the nose by their jealous relatives. Both of them are supposed to be intelligent people. Eliot was a lawyer. Pardon me. But when a man marries, he becomes the legal guardian of his wife doesnt he? So why does Eliot allow the step-father to refuse him access to Isobel when she is injured in the car accident? Why does he get himself banged-up on a trumped up charge? Because he's a masochist who loves being a martyr. Thats why.That Bobbi. What an abomination. That Edmund. What a perv. And let me just explain the 2 sets of parents relationships to each other.

This seems like an obvious answer even for a 4 year old, but 400 years ago his response would be meet with ridicule and even worse would be considered heresy. Thomas S. Kuhn is able to beautifully and logically describe from a scientific perspective the ideas and discoveries through the ages that lead to the enormous conceptual leap from a geocentric to heliocentric world. This alone makes this book a great read. But what I valued more from the book is Kuhn's revealing of the impact of the \\"Copernican Revolution\\" outside the scientific world. It's influence on religion, society and the entire scientific process is still felt today. The idea of a heliocentric universe was not only a great scientific theory, it was really a turning point in the human race and how we see ourselves in the universe.

The book is a classic. Kuhn understood how ideas influence each other and hang together in a system. He could write with equal erudition about observational astronomy, medieval theology, astrology, and Aristotelian physics.\\"The Copernican Revolution\\" is a trove of historical and intellectual insights. Perhaps the main lesson is that scientific progress is not a simple matter of theory being adapted to observation. Multiple theories can account for the same observations, theories have complex non-observational bases of support, and extra-theoretical assumptions provided by \\"common sense\\" (such as the immobility of the earth) can be highly contingent products of a culture. Scientific progress is never guaranteed. Erroneous theories -- such as the theory placing the earth at the center of the universe -- can hold sway for centuries and generate a vast body of supporting evidence, only to fall out of sync with new observations and a new climate of opinion -- at which point they can hang on tenaciously, or collapse \\"suddenly\\" over the course of a generation or two. It all comes down to history.Kuhn's great contribution to thought was to situate the history of science within the history of ideas -- he treated scientific theories as the products of cultures, institutions, and sheer accidents, not as deliverances of pure logic. \\"The Copernican Revolution\\" is fantastic and should be ready by anyone who enjoyed and learned from \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\\" It's become fashionable to bash Kuhn lately but his books have a secure place in the canon of history and philosophy of science.

Kuhn's attempt succeeds at placing the reader on the road to scientific revelation, not only the Copernican Revolution per se, but the political and religious currents which not only resisted it, but made it necessary. His work traces the early work of Greek astronomers and the problems they dealt with in depicting the motions of the planets and the position of the earth in the universe. He moves into Copernicus' work as a quasi-scientific endeavor synthesizing neo-Platonic forms and astute astronomical observation. This he elucidates fully, by infusing the work of other astronomers, namely Kepler,Galileo and Brahe. On a whole the book is a good example of how attitudes are changed by a revolutionary figure and a radical departure from established &quot;paradigms&quot; of science. Moreover, Kuhn shows us the genre of scientific history which is so important to understanding these types of issues. His book is easy to understand given cursory astronomical background and will prove invaluable in understanding not only the thought of Copernicus himself, but more precisely, the real revolution which it began. It is a must for all history students and would provide interesting topical information for science majors and star-gazers alike. You should come away with the idea that &quot;astronomers&quot; of the past were not as scientific as we would expect them to be, and furthermore, revolutions do not take place in a vacuum but rather are dependent on an atmosphere and necessity for acceptance."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"This book, written before his Structures, is condensed, well written and, for me at any rate, highly entertaining. No one with a casual understanding of the history of astronomy can read this and not be surprised. Of special interest is the illumination of the fact that at the time Copernicus offered his Helio-centric cosmology there was no good, scientific reason for accepting it - it being a geometric inversion of the Ptolemaic system and thus inheriting exactly all of the Ptolemaic deficiencies. Kuhn explores the reason for the gradual shift to Copernicanism and the effects a moving earth had on other sciences."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"It is a pity that the Amazon rating system is limited to only 5-stars. This book is, in my opinion, worth many more. I must admit that I hesitated getting this book for many years as I was misled by the sub-title \\"Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought\\". I believed this to be a thick and imponderable philosophical tome - it is not. The book is clearly written, and does not require that the reader have a mathematical, philosophical or astronomical background. The book describes the paradigm shift from an earth-centered universe to a sun-centered one. It thus begins with the astronomical beliefs of the ancient Greeks and shows the evolution of astronomy from this to that of Copernicus and then to Newton's explanation using his equations of gravity.I learned a lot from this book. For instance,1. I learned a bit about solar and celestial navigation.2. I never even realized that the seasons are of unequal length, now I do and I understand why.3. I now have a reasonable idea of the complexity of the Ptolemaic (earth-center) view of the cosmos and why it was believed for 2000 years. Kuhn does a great job of explaining and describing the essence of this very complex system.4. I now understand some of the influences that led Copernicus to believe that the Ptolemaic paradigm needed to be replaced. The reasons for this shift were many and complex, but are clearly stated.5. I always thought that the system developed by Copernicus was what we believe today, but now I realize that it was much more complex, but that while it was as complex as that of Ptolemy it was not more accurate in its predictions. I also see why some of the incorrect assumptions made by Copernicus led to this complexity and lack of accuracy.6. I clearly see why in spite of its complexity and lack of increased accuracy the Copernican paradigm gradually replaced the Ptolemaic paradigm, but not without overcoming a considerable amount of resistance.7. I understand the importance of the contributions of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler to the ultimate dominance of the Copernican system.8. I learned how Johannes Kepler, Rene Descartes and Robert Hooke influenced the work of Isaac Newton and that Newton's laws of gravity were not a unique creation of his alone, although its complete mathematical formulation certainly was.These ideas in this book are presented in a very clear and very accessible manner. I now have to add this book to my short list of those that I think anyone who considers himself/herself well educated should be acquainted with."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"This book is an excellent and entertaining book for a scientific reader and/or for a general reader who doesn't mind being challenged a bit by logical arguments. Don't let this discourage you, though, since the logical arguments are not too difficult and really need to be discussed for completeness sake. The historical background adds to the book in a way comparable to Carl Sagan's 'COSMOS' series or to 'The Mechanical Universe' series. This book should be required reading for all enlightened westerners. It's THAT good."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"This is a great review of astronomy prior to Copernicus and how astronomy then changed. The old Aristotle/Ptolemaic constructions were much more thoughtful than I had learned in secondary school and their predictive power was much better too. So in both a qualitative and quantitative way these theories were hard to dispute even with Copernicus' new sun centered universe, which did not do any better quantitatively. Gradually, as the telescope came into existence (Galileo) so that the observational data pushed the astronomers away from the circles and epicycles to the ellipses, did astronomy advance to predictions quantitatively better. This book shows how that all came to be and how it affected the world outside astronomy. It shows how the old cosmology had come to be adopted as a world view in religion and why they clung to it so. Anyone reading this book will gain a greater respect for what the ancients accomplished and how brilliant they were in building the cosmology that was replaced by Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. It also showed how these built on others who are not so well known. It is a fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"Kuhn's The Copernican Revolution was written as a text for an undergraduate course in the intellectual history of science. As such, its approach is focused and temporally expansive. The drawback of such an approach is the deficit of analysis in key areas. The analysis of the Church's role in science during the late middle ages and Renaissance was rather one-dimensional, but this obviously is not Kuhn's focus. Instead, he would like the reader to realize that any set of data can be modeled to an infinite number of paradigms (in anticipation of Structure of Scientific Revolutions). The heliocentric argument solved some qualitative problems but was largely Ptolemaic in articulation. Its aesthetic and geometric harmonies were extracted by astronomers who could could apply a mathematical rigor to it, in a post-Ptolemaic tradition (Kepler and Newton).Kuhn challenges the reader's imagination to decipher the heavenly phenomena in the same way Ptolemy might have, without being hampered by the technical minutia of astronomy. He writes so lucidly as to pick the reader up and drop him or her under the ancient sky, and to follow a long, through time. Paramount to Kuhn is the practical importance of astronomical data and the logic of its categorization.Perhaps the most persuasive analysis that Kuhn endeavors is that of the progression of the Renaissance neo-Platonics: Brahe, Galilei, Kepler, Descartes, and the mutation of the Copernican system into Newtonian synthesis. In one sense, his analysis is very non-Kuhnian as it can't point to a singular moment, and involves more of a patchwork of adopting new features (that is until Newton).A concise introduction to the evolution of astronomical thought from antiquity to newton and a compelling classic."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"I just want to focus on one aspect of this book. The first chapter and the appendix forms a very nice introduction to basic astronomy.

It's not easy reading, but Kuhn has a lot of very good pictures."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"This book was interesting, but is not for the casual reader. Kuhn's condensed summary of pre-Copernican cosmology is still too technical for many readers; I found some passages difficult to slog through myself. Many of his insights and connections were wonderfully interesting, but I was a little disappointed that after the long, technical build-up there wasn't a little &quot;more&quot; there. Usually a book that leaves you wanting more is a sign of a satisfying read, but although I enjoyed this book and found it enlightening in many places, in this case my wanting &quot;more&quot; was because I wasn't quite satisfied by it."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"Unlike 'the Structure of Scientific Revolutions', this book is well-written and informative, if you want to know about the development of ancient astronomy. Belongs with serious, entertaining and informative books on the history of science like those by Hoyle (who explains what Copernicus really did) and Barbour (who pointed me to Hoyle in the first place)."},{"Title":"The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought","review":"This is a great overview of the development of the Copernican system. The main text is very clear and readable and the \\"technical appendix\\" has good expositions of key mathematical arguments. Nevertheless, I think Kuhn's interpretation of \\"the Copernican revolution\\" has some shortcomings.Kuhn wishes the Copernican revolution to conform to his idea of a revolution brought on by a crisis (e.g. p. 139). To prove this he relies entirely on Copernicus' preface, which he elsewhere calls \\"one of the classic descriptions of a crisis state\\" (Structure of Scientific Revolutions, p. 69).Kuhn's interpretation rests on the following two points:(i) Determination of the length of the year for calendar purposes was Copernicus' \\"first\\" motivation and \\"heads his list\\" of motives: \\"When Copernicus listed the aspects of contemporary astronomy that had led him to consider his radical theory, he began, 'For, first, the mathematicians are so unsure of the movements of the Sun and the Moon that they cannot even explain or observe the constant length of the seasonal year.'\\" (p. 125) \\"In Copernicus' day an adequate account of precession was the principal prerequisite for the most pressing problem of practical astronomy, the reform of the Julian calendar ... and it is this remark which heads his list of motives for innovation.\\" (pp. 270--271)(ii) Copernicus' \\"monster rather than a man\\" metaphor expresses a general dissatisfaction with the state of Ptolemaic astronomy. (pp. 139--141)But (i) is an underhand trick for two reasons. Copernicus' preface is addressed to the Pope and he is clearly interested in emphasising that \\"my labors contribute somewhat even to the Commonwealth of the Church, of which your Holiness is now Prince,\\" mentioning specifically how the calendar issue was a concern for Leo X, for example. Perhaps this is why he put the calendar first in his preface. Furthermore, when Copernicus says \\"first...\\", he does not mean \\"first\\" as in \\"most important,\\" for he continues with a \\"second\\" and then reaches \\"the chief point of all.\\" This chief point of all is the fact that the Copernican model enables the determination of the planetary distances. (A geocentric model cannot give such information because we could scale the orbit of Saturn, say, to make it twice as big and it would still look exactly the same seen from earth. But in a heliocentric model the distances are determined because if we scaled the orbit of Saturn then it would look the same seen from the sun but different seen from earth. So with the earth in the center we cannot determine planetary distances because we are at the center of scaling, but with the sun in the center we would notice scaling and thus the planetary distances are locked.)Copernicus' \\"chief point of all\\" is the basis for a correct reading of the \\"monster rather than a man\\" metaphor, thus refuting (ii). As Copernicus puts it, the heliocentric system \\"binds together so closely the order and the magnitudes of all the planets and of their spheres or orbital circles and the heavens themselves that nothing can be shifted around in any part of them without disrupting the remaining parts and the universe as a whole.\\" For this reason he can claim triumphantly that earlier astronomers \\"have not been able to discover or to infer the chief point of all, i.e., the form of the world and the certain commensurability of its parts. But they are in exactly the same fix as someone taking from different places hands, feet, head, and the other limbs---shaped very beautifully but not with reference to one body and without correspondence to one another---so that such parts made up a monster rather than a man.\\"Thus I say: Copernicus was driven not by a crisis of Ptolemaic astronomy but by the beautiful consequences of his theory, such as the determination of the planetary distances and simple explanations of previously unexplained phenomena (e.g., retrograde motion, bounded elongation, etc.).Kuhn admits that Copernicus' determination of the planetary distances is \\"crucially important\\" (p. 180) but dismisses it as the main reason for the acceptance of the theory:\\"'Harmony' seems a *strange* basis on which to argue for the earth's motion ... Copernicus' arguments are not pragmatic. They appeal, if at all, not to the utilitarian sense of the practising astronomer but to his aesthetic sense and to that alone. ... New harmonies did not increase accuracy or simplicity. Therefore they could and did appeal primarily to that limited and perhaps *irrational* subgroup of mathematical astronomers whose Neoplatonic ear for mathematical harmonies could not be obstructed by page after page of complex mathematics leading finally to numerical predictions scarcely better than those they had before.\\" (p. 180; emphasis added)The correct reading---beauty before truth---is staring Kuhn in the face. In fact, Copernicus even spells this out in the very first sentence of his work:\\"Among the many and varied literary and artistic studies upon which the natural talents of man are nourished, I think that those above all should be embraced and pursued with the most loving care which have to do with *things that are very beautiful* and very worthy of knowledge.\\" (Copernicus, emphasis added.)But Kuhn refuses to listen, opting instead to dismiss Copernicus as \\"strange\\" and Kepler as \\"irrational.\\""},{"Title":"John Glenn: Astronaut and Senator (People to Know)","review":"The book 'John Glenn' is a small biography of this astronaut and senator from Ohio.

There is no indication (other than the reviews, which I unfortunately did not read) that it is simply a selected set of related excerpts from \\"All The Rage\\" which was published in 2000.

Taken on its own, \\"The Last Rakosh\\" is a good short story, which is what it is and should have remained--at least in terms of being the sole title of a published work. \\"The Last Rakosh\\" was extensively lengthened and turned into a very good Repairman Jack story called \\"All the Rage\\". Bravo F. Paul Wilson. However, this short story has now been published on its own--at the same price as a full Wilson novel. Perhaps, if readers had had previous knowledge that this nearly thirty dollar list price hardback was in reality a simple short story, then collectors might buy it. Or not. However, as it was advertised, I thought I was getting a brand new Repairman Jack novel. Which this is not. I believe what upsets me most about this is that Repairman Jack is a character with great integrity. Whoever was responsible for selling this short story disguised as a novel lacked integrity.

Wilson incorporated this yarn into \\"Rage\\" so that his fans could finally read the story.I for one am pleased to get my hands on anything written by F. Paul Wilson,including this little story.

I did read the reviews here before purchasing (something I usually don't do) and yet still bought it. Why? Not everyone is a Repairman Jack fan. Some of us are an F. Paul Wilson fan. I've only read the Adversary Cycle books and am a HUGE fan of those. I saw the Last Rakosh as an extension of those books and that is why I bought it. As for the content, when I first read the book, I almost wanted to review it 1 star. Repairman Jack failing? A Rakosh showing mercy? I then bumped up to 2 stars figuring it was at least a good read. Then it hit me. I was surprised by the ending. I don't want to be able to guess what happens everytimes I see a movie or read a book. Thus, the quick jump to 4 stars. 1 star removed for the expense.

If I bought a computer game that looked awesome and was called \\"All the Rage\\" and then a few months later I see a computer game that looks awesome that's called \\"The Last Rakosh\\" and it's by the same publisher as the first game I bought that I had thought looked awesome and turned out to be awesome so I faithfully trusted that this new game would be also awesome... would that be legal? It's basically the same thing. Are we going to have to start researching every single book by this author to make sure we don't buy the same book twice with a new title?

I read this book for a course in graduate school and thought it would be appropriate to read to children to teach them about what frontier life was really like. I also think it's a keystone book to use to teach about internal conflict, as this book was centered on a large internal conflict. Finally, I think it's an easier-to-read book because it focuses mainly on one character's point of view, thoughts, and actions.

Jean Fritz created this historical fiction novel based upon some people and events from her own family history. It is a great book to read while studying westward expansion and is a tribute to the brave pioneers who helped our country grow.

The 10 year old girl named Ann was one of the main charters, along with a little boy who lived down the street. The problem they faced was Ann's family moving from the East to the West. I liked the book because she was my age. She also had lots of sibling, but they did not really talk about her siblings in the book.

It kind of tells a true story about Mr. Washington, our first United States president, had dinner with the Hamilton Family. Well, I don't want to give away the secret between Arthur Scott and Ann Hamilton.

There was a storm and that storm was BIG!She would go back to her garden just to get peas. One day it was a bad day for Ann, everything was going wrong. Until someone comes and asks \\"What are you having for dinner?\\" he said. Ann was so happy that was the one thing that would make her day."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"This is a great story about a ten-year-old girl that moves from her town of Gettysburg to the western country. Complicating the fact that she misses her cousin back in Gettysburg is the fact that there are no girls close to her age anywhere nearby. Ann's two older brothers mostly help their father but they do have time to joke around with Ann and to try to make light of the situation out west. A neighbor, Andy McPhale, makes things more interesting for Ann because she becomes involved in tutoring him and their families learn the true meaning of a neighbor in the western country. The most endearing part of the book is when Ann is caught having a tea party and when her mother discovers her, the reaction is most surprising. Near the end of the book, there is a most unexpected guest to the cabin and Ann gets to have a fancy dinner just as she had been longing for. The ending of this book brings new hope and a renewed sense of sprit to Ann in her new home. This book is great for students because not only does it demonstrate several literary elements, the keeping of a diary, the writing of letters, and the teaching of reading and writing, but it teaches a bit of history about the west as well.

The titles of her books captured my attention and her writing made history come alive for my kids. I have read nearly everything she has written, but The Cabin Faced West gave me a glimpse of why she is such a wonderful author. The book is a fictionalized version of a story handed down in her family from generation to generation. Apparently, the phrase \\"George Washington was here,\\" had a special meaning to Jean's ancestors. Even though the founding father did not spend the night with her relatives, he did have supper with them. Washington's presence left an indelible mark on Ann Hamilton, Jean's great-great-grandmother. Her story impressed her children and her children's children--and went on to give Jean the inspiration to write this novel so that our children could experience the awe that surrounded this great man. It is not a complicated story, but it does give children a rich insight into what life was like on the frontier in the early years of this country, just after the Revolutionary War. It also makes me understand why Jean Fritz was such a wonderful writer. Her stories were inspired by her heritage. That should be a lesson to all of us: encourage our children to know and love who they are by telling them about their past. Then perhaps they will have the courage to face the future!"},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"Needed to find an interesting \\"historical fiction\\" selection for daughter's 4th grade book report.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"This book is about a girl named Ann that lived in the early1800's. Ann moved to the west from Gettysburg and she wants to goback. There is no other girls to play with. I liked when George Washington came and ate dinner with the family.

As a kid, I thought it was great BECAUSE of the low action format, and that the concentration was on what life was like for the REAL heroes of our nation during a most underrated time in our nation's history. Ann HATED the idea of moving 'out west' (western Pennsylvania) at the beginning of the story, but, by the end, she learned just what an impact every day people such as she and her family had in helping our nation's growth. Such interesting historical facts like not letting the cooking fire go out (no lighters or matches in the 18th century!), and showing, pretty accurately, life without electricty, TV, videos, radios, cars, or even paper to write on. No, there's not much action, but there IS much more, especially for the youngster who has an interest in the past. When I was ten, this book was a favorite - even though the main character was a girl - taboo at that age - and I recently reread it and I found I STILL could not put it down. Not every life was filled with fighting and killing. And 'The Cabin Faced West' is one of those that show life as it really was in the late 18th century America. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!"},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"What better way for a child to learn history than through reading a well-written, fascinating story set in a previous era? This book is outstanding in that category. The history is authentic, the story engaging, the reading level accessible for an elementary age reader. I especially appreciated the realistic and warm family relationships in the book. Beautiful themes of adjusting to change and accepting new challenges. My 6-year-old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"The Cabin Faced West is an intriguing story of a family that has moved west, which is such a remote place that it is only populated by two families.The two families contain nothing but male figures (that are Anne's own age!) Anne Hamilton is having a rough time working out this problem. She must stay strong and overcome these dissimilarities and strive to be friends with the outgoing, down- to- earth, Andy McPhale. She has almost given up when suddenly a visitor changes her thoughts and gives her the ability to go on. I think this book is very tasteful, witty, and also seems very real. I would definetly recommend this book to a friend . If you like the Little House On The Prairie you'll love this book.If you like mysteries,adventures, surprises,or you just enjoy reading books on the early frontiers,and pioneers, you'll love this book.As I said I would definetly recommend this book to a friend , as I recommend it to you.*****"},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"I actually chose this book to read for a graduate level children's literature class. As a school teacher I feel this is a wonderful easy read for children beginning to tackle the longer chapter books.Ann Hamiltion is the main character, in which girls who are about 10 years old, could relate to. The entire Hamilton family seems to have embraced their new life out west except for Ann. She longs for her friends and old life she has left behind. There are not any girls who are Ann's age for her to spend time with and not many neighbors nearby. Ann is left to tend to her new vegetable garden and help her mother with chores around the home and care for her new baby brother. Ann tries to pass the days by writing in her journal. There are a few travelers that pass through town along with some surprises that make the days more exciting for Ann and her family.The descriptions of the setting are very vivid and helps the reader to really imagine what is going on. This story would be a terrific read-aloud for children who are being introduced to historical fiction or for children who are interested in the pioneer days. It is a great way to show children what life was like in pioneer days, especially for children in the 8-12 year old age group."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"This book is about a young girl who just moved to the west from Gettysburg. She misses Gettysburg so bad, all her friends and all the civiliztion. Her brothers made a rule that if anyone of them was caught complaining about the west then the others would get to pour a bucket of cold water on the one who said it's head. Later on in the story, one of her brother's get caught doing it. That is a really funny part in the book to me. She also has other fun experiences. She meets General George Washington and a young man on his way to find land, which later she marries. She also gets to teach the boy that lives down the road from her to read and write. She has many great experiences in the west. I recommend this book to any boy or girl who is interested in the way people lived in the west and a little excitement."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"The novel I read is an awesome book. The main character in my book is Ann Hamilton, a young English girl trying to live in the West. She had to leave her dearest cousin, Margaret who was living in England. She had to give up being clean, wearing clean clothes, and wearing shoes. She out grew the clothes she wore in England, so Ann and her family had to make all their clothes by hand, because there were no shops, or markets near by. Ann lived in the West on a farm, where they grew beans, corn, and cabbage etc.I gave this book five stars because it was a very interesting novel. It was interesting because I got to read about how Ann had to live in a totally new place, where she had no church, no school, and no market like the markets she had in England. In this book there was nothing I didn't like, I admired Ann when she moved to a new place, because she dealt with it very well. It was very neat to learn about how she got to meet General Washington. I especially liked this book because it had a very happy ending."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"Where can 10-year-old Anne Hamilton find a girlfriend in the rugged Pennsylvania wilderness in post-Revolutionary times? She hates the road which leads back East, to her former Gettysburg home. Many people have caught Wilderness Fever, but not young Anne, who misses her cousin and comfortable life in civilized country. Curious thing though--at different times, that same road brings two very special men into her life.Her older brothers make up THE RULE, which means No Complaining about living out in the West (of Pennsyvania, which lured hardy pioneers). But can a mere dirt road inspire moods in people? Will Ann grow up to be proud of becoming a Western girl? Ann keeps a diary which reveals all, including a surprise visitor for dinner by a great man.Quaint vocabulary and expressions contribute to the Colonial flavor of the times: such as putting someone's name in the pot and a kind of food called &quot;wonders.&quot; Based on the life of the author's 3x great-grandmother, this little book will delight elementary readers with its simple, truthful style; yet it can charm adults as well. A very relaxed introduction to the Western Movement."},{"Title":"The cabin faced west","review":"Jean Fritz is an outstanding author!!

This book was like an old friend, comforting me, guiding me through the process, assuring me that everything I was feeling was normal and to be expected. A year later, it still sits on my nightstand, battered and highlighted in yellow marker, being read and re-read whenever I need support. Of course, this book is not substitute for therapy, but I don't think I could have gotten through this past year without it. I would recommend this book to ANYONE going through a divorce. I've also seen some reviews on here by someone who finds the book to be \\"pro-divorce\\", and that is not the case at all. The authors merely acknowledge the fact that divorces happen, provide comfort and advice without passing judgement on the how and why, and help those of us who are going through the process to make the best of the situation and feel somewhat hopeful about our futures."},{"Title":"Not Your Mother's Divorce: A Practical, Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Guide to Surviving the End of a Young Marriage","review":"This book is not for people who are not sure whether they want a divorce. It will not suggest that you work harder on your marriage, and it will not tell you that you are making a mistake. It will also not give helpful advice on how to save a marriage. I think the title should be sufficient warning of its target audience.That said, it is a completely unique book that allows a young, childless woman going thorough divorce to feel that she is not alone. It gave me hope that I might someday be happy again. As someone who had been repeatedly lied to and betrayed by a husband who had been given countless \\"second chances,\\" I was not interested in hearing that I should try harder to save the marriage.Well written by intelligent, educated women who had been through divorce themselves, the book really does sound like the advice of a close girlfriend. This book was a life-saver for me."},{"Title":"Not Your Mother's Divorce: A Practical, Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Guide to Surviving the End of a Young Marriage","review":"I went to the bookstore to pick up a book on divorce - what I found was books that were either very heavy on the legal end or books for women with children. There was nothing out there for books for 20/30 somethings going through a divorce within the first 5 years -that spoke to me, not my mother. Someone recommended this book and I ordered it within the first 3 weeks after the big break-up. I was looking for something that spoke to me, in a girlfriend type of tone, not a preaching tone and this was PERFECT. It took me through what to expect in the beginning, the cycle of what would happen, how to tell people (or not tell people), and what to expect. It had great vignettes within it that illustrated situations similar to what I was going through and served as a general companion that helped me get through the healing process in the first six months. It was exactly what I needed. I would strongly recommend this to someone in their 20s/30s, first marriage, no kids - its right in-line with the chick lit out there and laughs and cries with you. Without this, I don't think I could have handled everything as well as I have. A must read over all the other books on the subject out there!"},{"Title":"Not Your Mother's Divorce: A Practical, Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Guide to Surviving the End of a Young Marriage","review":"Not even 30 and struggling with ending my marriage only 3 months old has left me with a myriad of feelings. Coming from a family of divorce I obviously did NOT want to go down the same path. Not Your Mother's Divorce has shown me that I'm not alone in what I am about to go through and in &quot;real world&quot; terms. I found that other books tend to focus on bitter custody battles and how to cope as a single mom- neither of which applies to me or anyone else going through a &quot;starter marriage&quot;. Moffett &amp; Touborg give a perspective that I could completely relate to - reading this book is like having my best girlfriend sitting next to me encouraging me that what I'm about to go through will only make me stronger and that I WILL in fact survive and be better off for it and a MUCH happier person! I can hardly wait! I can only say that I am grateful to have read this book at this point in my life.

I wasn't sure if it was what I was looking for, but as soon as I started it, I couldn't put it down. As a soon to be divorcee in my late twenties, this book was really something I could relate too. The authors understand what you are going through and really give you hope for the future. I'm already halfway through re-reading it for the second time, and it won't be the last.The only thing that was missing from this book is that it is written for women without children.

No kids, just lives and 'things' shared, etc.. This book was tremendously helpful when the decision was made and the 'now what' portion of the split started. The best part was--a year-plus later when I was hitting a critical but tricky new phase of moving on--I remembered some of the things I'd been thinking about lately and going through were mentioned in the later chapters of the book (all good things, but things new nonetheless!). Even though they weren't very applicable at the time (I couldn't see past the current state of feelings to imagine a time when it wouldn't royally suck), more than a year later I re-read those chapters (and earlier ones, too), and realized not only what a valuable book this was at the time, but still is today. Highly recommended, and a great gift to girlfriends going through the same situation (post decision).

A huge help for anyone going through a divorce, especially since the time around a divorce can be isolating. Here are 'friends' who already understand, and who offer sympathetic advice on a wide range of topics. The surprise was how much people not going through a divorce could also learn from the book. The courage and curiosity of the authors, and their willingness to honestly share their and others' experiences, helps anyone learn about life and its challenges. Refreshingly intelligent and well written. Both practical and empathetic. Certainly get a copy for yourself and a friend or family member who could benefit. A good and easy way of doing something for yourself and someone else in a time when a little thing can go a long way.

The authors come across as very self absorbed and insecure. I felt like I was reading Sex and the City for divorcees. I think a chapter on attempting to reconcile the differences you and your spouse might be experiencing would go a long way. This book gives you absolutely no hope and makes divorce sound like a positive thing. I once had many of the same feelings (or lack there of) that the women in this book describe, but I found it in me to work out things with my spouse. I have never felt stronger and more in love. What we went through was very difficult, but I cannot imagine my life without my spouse. In our world today, it much easier for a woman to walk away from a marriage than it was in the past. This can be a good thing, but also a very bad thing. I almost gave up to soon and I know and I know others who have. Many of them regret their decisions."},{"Title":"The kingdom in history and prophecy,","review":"Chafer demonstrates the keeness of his theological mind in this fantistic work.

The book provides a chronological overview of British exploration and colonization efforts, but also discusses motivations and imperial ideologies. There are more recent and more specialized works than this now 20 plus year old account, but it still serves its purpose well. With good footnotes and bibliography, the book can also lead readers to more specialized sources (primary and secondary) in any area it covers. I would recommend the book as an introduction for anyone with a serious interest in the origins of early modern British empire."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"After watching the Tony Award show this year I was curious about Elizabeth Spencer, a Southern writer whom I had not heard of before the show. I have just finished reading her novella \\"Light in the Piazza\\" (haven't seen the touted play yet)and it was a memorable read. It starts out like a fairy tale---you don't quite know why Mrs. Johnson and her daughter are in Florence, what time period they are in, their background---and you're quickly engaged in a charming romance story. But there's also an undercurrent of tragedy. You discover lies, family strains, an accident in the past. Every character in the story becomes suspect. You start to question every character's motives, possible deceptions (with the exception of Clara, who becomes a symbol of clarity and innocence, as in the Virgin Mary). For the last 30 pages of the story I am nervously living inside Margaret Johnnon's head, worrying about the future of her \\"simple-minded\\" daughter Clara.Elizabeth Spencer is a masterful storyteller, making me ponder what level of control we have in life, how easily we make assumptions about people soley based on appearance, how we can manipulate others and fool ourselves. Her prose is deceptively simple at times. I found myself reading and re-reading many a sentence to decipher the multiple levels of meaning. I closed the book wistfully, wishing for a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"After spending six months in Florene, Italy, I saw the movie Light in the Piazza on a late night television movie channel. I fell in love with the movie as it gave me great memories of Italy. I have never been able to find the movie on video as it has not been released. So instead I read the book. The story is a true romance between a naive mentally-challenged woman and an Italian man. Very quick, easy reading. A must for anyone going to or having been in Italy."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"The author, born in Mississippi, brings a Southern sensibility to these stories. She has written a series of short stories about Southern women living and visiting in Italy in the 1950's. Ms. Spencer writes beautifully, and her stories are never overly sentimental or superficial. They ring true. Italian words are sprinkled throughout the text which adds to the overall effect.I found the stories a little \\"dated\\" though. These women are trapped here in an era of proper white gloves, cocktail parties and long cigarette holders. The 1950's was a rather repressive time for women, and in many of these stories we find women struggling to be in control of their own lives. They have come to Italy to vacation \\"abroad\\"; to fulfill a lifelong dream; to work, or to distance themselves from the past.By far, the best of the stories is \\"The Light in the Piazza\\" which has a warmth and appeal that I found missing in most of the others."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"With a healthy anticipation of seeing the New York theatre production of \\"The Light in the Piazza\\" I decided to orient myself with Elizabeth Spencer's story of the same name. After finishing this tale, I went on to read the others.\\"The Light in the Piazza\\" is perhaps the most defined of the collection and one gets an instant taste of Ms. Spencer's writing and the kinds of characters she prefers. Women are central in all of them, no less Margaret Johnson in \\"Light\\". The author's women command attention as they maneuver the action around them. Manipulation is an even better word. All of these collected stories begin somewhere in mid-sentence and finish not much farther along. Enigmatic, troubled, wistful and \\"vagabondish\\", Ms. Spencer's men and women prefer the waft of an Italian breeze to any set action or direction. The vignettes are more or less satisfying, if only for the time that one spends with them. \\"Knights and Dragons\\", the longest of the stories, is an aimless sojourn but the final one, \\"the Cousins\\", is second only as a success to the title tale.Elizabeth Spencer has put together a nice group of stories. Even though her writing is mostly even and descriptive, some of her offerings end up being less so, though her depictions of Italy are true to form. Still, the bookend chapters are worth the read."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"Light in the Piazza appeals to your sense of hope and optimism. It is a beautiful story that involves a mildly mentally impaired young woman and her mother, who travel to Florence in the 1950's. The young woman falls in love, which forces the mother to make a difficult decision about her daughter's future. It's a great story that pulls at your heart strings no matter how many times you read it. This compelling story is tender and sensitive without being overly sentimental. The story has also been the basis for a very successful 1962 film and a hit Broadway play. I highly recommend it.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"I purchased this book because the Broadway production of the title story had proved so enchanting. Don't be mistaken, though. The play bears little resemblance to the story. The story tries so hard to be symbolic and airy that the characters become cardboard symbols and I did not find myself caring much for any of them. The story may have proved more engaging had I not been expecting beauty and life to match what I had seen onstage, but as it was, I couldn't bring myself to read the rest of the stories."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"I have not yet read the book, but I too love the movie, although I keep missing the beginning. I just wanted to reassure the person posting the question that the book definitely precedes the film, and that yes they are the same story. You can doublecheck me by just looking at the books on zstores and auctions-- same author, same title, and one has a banner that says &quot;now a Hollywood film!&quot; The book was published in 1960, the movie came out in 1962."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"Apparently highly regarded as a writer, Elizabeth Spencer's \\"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales\\" left me cold. The title story, recently made into a Tony Award winning musical is the tale of an American woman and her daughter vacationing in Italy. There, daughter Clara meets and falls in love with local Florentine, Fabrizio. However, what the besotted Fabrizio doesn't know is that the beautiful Clara is mentally challenged, having suffered a childhood injury to the head. Should mom reveal her daughter's handicap to Fabrizio and his family? This is the question around which the novella revolves. I won't reveal the ending. However, what could have been a poignant tale of maternal love and responsibility becomes a comedy of manners examining the national differences between Americans and Italians. To me the portrayals of both groups were stereotypical. This story was the best of the lot. The others were boring beyond words. In fact I did something I rarely do. I put the book down three quarters of the way through. A waste of reading time. I plan on avoiding the musical."},{"Title":"The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books)","review":"Unfortunately, you don't give a synopsis of Light in the Piazza and I want to know was it made into a movie -or was the title borrowed from the movie with Olivia de Havilland, Rossano Brassi, George Hamilton and Yvette Mimieux? Since I can't find a video of the movie I would like to read the book as I loved the movie."},{"Title":"Creepshows (Illustrated Movie Guide)","review":"Creepshows: The Illustrated Stephen King Movie Guide got off on the wrong foot quick by crediting (On the lower back cover) the Berni Wrightson cover illustration to the woman who DESIGNED the cover layout. Very sloppy, especially considering Wrightson's rendition of \\"The Creep\\" is world-famous.....The book covers all of the films that have sprung, however tenuous the connection may be (Children of the Corn 666), from Mr. King's stories. Stephen Jones does an interesting job of digging up little-known bits of trivia; I'm a King fanatic, and there were quite a few things here that were new to me. The irritating thing is the division of space in the book: A gem like The Green Mile gets the same amount of space as Children of the Corn. Jones devotes too much space to films that have nothing to do with King at all, such as the awful \\"House\\", covered because the main character is a King wannabe. The book is an American reprint of a British book, published in the UK by Titan Books, and the fact that Watson-Guptill couldn't even be bothered to Americanise the Brit spellings gets annoying after 100+ pages of \\"Favourite\\" and \\"Colour\\". Jones also seems to love the word \\"Eponymous\\"- He uses it on almost every page, and one would hope that someone has since bought him a Thesaurous. There's a brief King interview at the end, and the book is heavily illustrated with stills and poster reproductions. King fans will probably enjoy Creepshows a lot, but it could have been better...."},{"Title":"Creepshows (Illustrated Movie Guide)","review":"This large (in size rather than actual volume of text, as most of the book is occupied by photographs - the vast majority of them in black and white) guide to films, TV productions, fan videos and other filmed works based on or inspired by Stephen King's prose (and one poem...) is not particularly detailed, but certainly contains enough basic information, facts and trivia about almost every minor, major, cancelled or planned King production as of late 2002 to satisfy a King reader interested in the visual media.Unfortunately, it leaves much to be desired. The layout is clunky at times, and there are a few truly pointless parts thrown in at the end most likely just to increase the volume (what in heaven's - or hell's - name would otherwise be the point in including such entries as Sean Cunningham's &quot;House&quot; [apparently listed because its protagonist is a &quot;Stephen King-like writer&quot;], &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Maximum Homerdrive&quot; [whose only relation to King is the title, as the book even admits], or some German porn flick which features a mad naked janitor [allegedly a ripoff of &quot;The Shining's&quot; Jack Torrance]?), and the book does not actually list *all* adaptations of King's writing (where is the best of the King shorts, &quot;Strawberry Spring&quot; from 2001?).The most annoying thing about the guide, however, is the fact that it discusses the films in a chronological order rather than the proper, alphabetical one. This awkward (to put it mildly...) decision makes the book extremely inconvenient for quick checking, looking up particular titles, or comparing movies. Fortunately, there is an index, but still, flipping 87 pages to reach that index after reading an entry for one film, then flipping back 61 pages to find its sequel is infuriating."},{"Title":"Creepshows (Illustrated Movie Guide)","review":"Stephen King movies have a pretty bad reputation (just watch Maximum Overdrive or the dozen Children of the Corn movies and see what everyone is complaining about). But I like Stephen King movies, for the most part. Some of my personal favourites are: Storm of the Century (a mini-series written by King), Sometimes They Come Back (a film based on his short story of the same name) and Creepshow (anthology film with a screenplay written by King based on his own short stories). And of course there are the classics like Carrie, The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption.I don't really understand when people complain that King movie adaptions \\"ruin\\" the book because movies are never as good as the book anyway. Here's what King has to say about that:\\"They may not be good movies but they haven't ruined the books. Look here they are, lined up on the bookshelf.\\"Creepshows: The Illustrated Stephen King Movie Guide is a thorough handbook for all films based on King's work. Some of the films I haven't even heard of before. And it's fairly recent; the last movie featured is Rose Red, which came out in 2002. The book also includes short films, forthcoming projects (so far only two of them have been produced), unproduced projects, associational titles, King cameos, television episodes, other media (i.e. plays), recurring talent in his films and an interview with King.The write-up about each film includes the tagline, a listing of the cast, a description of the film, how they made the film, a brief background on the book/short story it's based on and various quotes from reviews, King, and people who worked on each film. Each write-up is incredibly thorough and it's interesting to see what King thinks of the movies based on his work. But the films are listed in chronological order rather than alphabetical, making it annoying to find a particular movie without looking it up in the index, unless you know the year it was released.Creepshows also features a lot of nice illustrations, such as movie stills, film posters and book covers.This is an interesting book and I would recommend it if you're a fan of Stephen King or just a fan of horror movies."},{"Title":"Creepshows (Illustrated Movie Guide)","review":"This is a nice book to have if you are a King Collector."},{"Title":"Being rude (A children's book about)","review":"I read these books as a child and now have bought them for my kids.

But they lost me a tad when they started discussing aromatherapy and Chinese medicine, and then I started questioning most of the book.While I can appreciate this isn't a technical book, there is no attempt to show research studies backing up some of their claims, and some of the claims sounded like they were simply winging it in an attempt to paraphrase in an accessible way (\\"this causes heating in the brain\\"?? I'm hoping that was a typo). Other claims just sounded like pure BS, like they took the word of some schmoe in a pharmacy who claimed to know a lot about herbal supplements.While I don't doubt a more natural and nutritional approach to treating ADD works best for many people, I believe there must be far better books out there on the subject."},{"Title":"A.D.D. the Natural Approach","review":"My husband and I have 3 children who are ADD, this little book has helped us so much that I would highly recommend reading anhd followimg the authors suggestions."},{"Title":"A.D.D. the Natural Approach","review":"If you are just getting started with Natural Approach's to ADD this is a great guide book."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"This kit was an excellent study tool.

The point of the e-trainer is to give you a path to Mr. Lammale's partner: RouterSim.

Yes, yes about 1/3 of the errors *are* covered on the errata page at their website... but guys, this is the second edition in, what, it's 5th printing?? Lots of errors, contradicitons, gross errors (similar with CD/flashcards). Virtually all printouts are &quot;cut,&quot; and one has to search repeatedly for the very rare complete, i.e. helpful, printout. Some *very* poor diagrams throughout, e.g. figure 10.9 in which you have to guess which router is which, guess who has what addresses, guess which route is where, etc. - and this is suppose to be helpful? That's the book. And then we come to the complete debacle of an &quot;e-trainer.&quot; What a mess. Yeh, yeh the first third works okay, but then it's very rapidly downhill from there. I got sucked in by the hype 'cause the &quot;Virtual Lab e-trainer&quot; was &quot;Designed for Use in Conjunction with Sybex's&quot; CCNA (Lammle) Guide. What the advertising didn't mention was that many (most?) of the labs in the book simply are not *in* the supposed &quot;e-trainer.&quot; In some chapters only one in three labs is included, in others one-half of one lab out of four labs in the book is semi-on-the-e-trainer; another section has only one out of seven labs from that chapter in/on the &quot;e-trainer.&quot; E.G. there is virtually no WAN coverage (no PPP, no HDLC, no ATM, no ISDN, and an extremely poor Frame-Relay). The IPX numbering scheme is amazingly fouled up (e.g. all three routers having the same MAC addresses??). It just goes on and on, or, more accurately, it doesn't go on at all. It sometimes does not remove static routes, it tends to apply clock rates to all serial interfaces, in telneting it'll actually change the hostname, duplicate hostnames, all sorts of things. To say the software is &quot;buggy&quot; would be an understatement. And, of course, there are a very great many commands not supported. This e-trainer mess comes across like a *very* bad piece of shareware/freeware.... Yeh, yeh, it might be better than nothing - but certainly not by much. And, yes, if you've never touched a router in your life it *might* be helpful (but, I suspect, it might just as easily be more frustrating than helpful). Buy the book, and hope you find the errors - and I am authentically sad if this actually *is* the &quot;best&quot; book out there. Habraken has a pretty good book.

Excellent in explaining each topic you need to understand. THE ONLY WAY IN MY OPINION IN GETTING YOUR CCNA!"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"I bought this kit in the first week of February and took the test on February 28th. I passed the exam on the first try with a 946. This book is very well organized and very well written (save a few typos). It is really good at giving you all of the right information to where you will be able to carry it into a live network, not just to pass the test.The only shortcoming if there is one, is the tests are straight forward, and the Cisco test is NOT that straight forward, but since the book gives you the right foundation, it was easy to make it thorough. Definately worth it!"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"I managed a 956 on the exam just using this kit. Between the book and the simulator, this set does a very solid job of preparing one for the exam. In hindsight, I should have paid for a Boson test, or the Cisco Press book or something like that. You can get a skewed perception of what the real test will be like by taking the same sample test repeatedly. However, compared to paying thousands for classroom training, this item is a great buy."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"I found this book to be excellent.It gives in-depth explaination about Routing Protocols and everything else that has to do with networking.I can compare this book with other books of Todd Lammleand I find that this book is a great improvement over other books.I definitely would recommend this book to every-one that wants to pass the CCNA exam.It couldn't have written better!Also the CCNA Router Simulator is a must. CLI Commands you better know inside out!The FastPass Book is the topping of the cake. This is the latest fase just before doing the exam."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"For one, the book is a great book for review of the CCNA exam. It has practice exercises, practice tests (after every chapter), and four bonus exams, which makes this book not only great for practical knowledge, but a bargain as well. You don't need to buy practice exams when you get this book. The author Todd Lammle writes it in an easy to understand format for someone that has no networking knowledge. Now for the routing simulator, for me I thought it was great and simulates a real world environment. Don't listen to people that say ping or some of the other commands don't work. For ping to work, each router has to have the clock rate and encapsulation set the same on the serial interface (on both routers) to be able to work (I tried it, ping does work). This has everything you need to pass the CCNA exam. The only thing I wish it had was a few more scenarios to troubleshoot in the simulator for the real-world. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating. Believe me, get this!"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"great book, easy to follow along for the most part. i had to read the subnetting chapter twice but eventually i got it. if you read this book and understand it, youll pass the test"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"Lammle's book helped me get my ccna with a score of 860. The strong points of the book are his way of explaining and breaking down router configuration and protocols. There are what I believe to be slip ups though. Wan protocols seemed to be thrown in at the last minute with minimul explanation. There are errors or typos in the flash cards program for the palm operating system. And the emulator doesnt let you do all of the labs because it only supports a set number of commands. Bottom of the line to me is the fact that I got my ccna. And I got it with this book and alot of studying. Study the book, take the practice tests provided and study more."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"Yup, this will get you through the test but when you walk out of the testing center you will think like I did: I paid way too much to prepare for this test.

Cheers"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"I passed my CCNA exam after using this kit. I am an MCSE and MCP+I and now a CCNA thanks to these materials. The kit covers the vast majority of what you need to know to pass this exam. After using several other books to prepare for other exams, this is by far the most thourough. The simulator did have some bugs, but it was still a valuable tool to simulate hands on practice. You can pass the exam using this kit alone, but I would recommend some hands on experience, or another book to supplement the material included. (No single book covers it all, but this one was close.)"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"Prior to this book I was reading the Cisco Press CCNA Self-study: CCNA Preparation Library.

The information in the book was enough to pass the test from first time. I was quite frustrated with Frame Relay section of the book. My knowledge of Frame Relay was very vague and the book didn't provide enough information for me to feel prepared for exam. I had to find additional info about it. The book will definitely help you to pass exam, but doubt it that you can 1000 with it."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Kit (2nd Edition)","review":"In 2002 this book and test CD was good enough to pass. But after Nov 2007 when Cisco changed the test to make CCNA harder it is not. The book is good enough. It has been updated with all the info you need to pass the new test. The practice test has not been updated. It resembles the format of the questions you would have seen on the old test. It only has multiple choice questions. It has no simulators, no drag and drop, and no simlets. I passed the old CCNA exam 5 years ago. But I failed the new one just using this book and practice tests to study. I would recommend the book but would look elsewhere for practice tests. The lab simulator is flawed but adequate.

It is most like a airbrushing book, that goes even in painting things that I would never paint on cars... and really hate to see on cars...Craig Fraser is surely a very good airbrush painter, but if you are looking for some custom painting, without getting your car out of mind, I'd suggest rather to buy \\"how to paint flames\\" or \\"pinstripping masters\\"... maybe also \\"advanced custom painting technics\\", but not this book.All in all, it is not a bad book, is just not the kind of information I like to have on my library."},{"Title":"Automotive Cheap Tricks & Special F/X","review":"This is a great book for beginners like me!!!

Even if we are able to produce names, dates and places, it still does not proved that we lived at that time and place.\\"So why the book?\\"Because, even without conclusive proof, the benefits for personal empowerment, healing and enlightenment are tremendous.\\"The \\"theology\\" of reincarnation comes from unsure sources, one of which is the primitive African Zulus. As explained in this book the souls of people depart and go to sleep until notified that another learning experience awaits it. Then it returns as a human or as an animal.My own personal view is that man should seek God for spiritual knowledge. Once one begins trusting in \\"suggestions\\" of unsure memories, the foundation becomes more than a little shakey. Three different people claiming to be the same historical figure is something that should cause anyone to reexamine this belief in past lives, and this is something that's not difficult to find. False memories seem real but aren't.

This is really a great book"},{"Title":"How to Uncover Your Past Lives (Llwellyn's How to Series)","review":"This is a helpful book written in a very straight-foward manner. In addition to offering a number of insights into the meaning of various aspects of the standard reincarnation model, the author presents a current perspective on the psychology of using these methods and on the necessity of pointing the insights so gained towards helping with the management of current-life circumstances. One thing the author does not mention is that there is a great deal of time that must be spent by a person, more or less in solitude, in implementing the techniques to obtain an effect. Another thing is that although many of the procedures point to ways in which information can be obtained about past-lives the resulting effect is quite different from actually entering into those lives (instances of the higher-self as it were. To give it its due however, some differentiation is made using the left-brain right-brain model to posit intellectual as opposed to emotional \\"facts\\".The work is really about \\"opening doors\\" rather than \\"going through them\\". On the whole however, this is a very useful book and well worth the very modest sum of money required to buy it.

Reincarnation and karma are shortly but rather well explained, while soul mates are presented really poorly. You can find many very practical instructions (scents, crystals, divining rods...) and deeper causes for seemingly ordinary things (the important function of flowers, candles and black clothes at funerals, why a pregnant women has this special glow, sudden death of babies...). There are many carefully prepared exercises for uncovering your past lives, but while they may perhaps really stimulate *also* your intuition, the result will most likely be just a million of confused and evidently imaginary images.Bottom line: very interesting if you want to expand your view on these things and really pleasant to read, but if you want to actually uncover your past lives with a grand of reliability, I am afraid this book is not the right address."},{"Title":"How to Uncover Your Past Lives (Llwellyn's How to Series)","review":"Ted Andrews has done it with this book!

Although I learned few things I did not know before, and it made me contemplate a few different questions, it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.

No surprises - just a good instinct of letting you know that if you think you were here centuries ago because of ----say de ja vu around a specific place or a drawing of a building from centuries ago - there is a great chance you really were.

Young Johanna (raised in America but with a Dutch father) has spent the last five years with her grandparents in a small village in Holland. She has come cherish the the simple but dignified lifestyle in northern Holland, the last part of the country to be liberated. While some were collaborating with the enemy, she made a private vow never to look a Nazi soldier in the face.The village treasure consists of a set of 12 Little Riders of metal (modeled centuries ago to represent Crusaders); they ride out and salute each other when the church clock tolls the hours. Johanna's favorite viewing spot is her attic room--just where her father used to sit and admire them as a boy. But when the Nazis invade the village, her family is forced to house a young officer (who plays the flute on summer nights). She has to vacate her little room with its view of the Riders (and a secret hiding place at the back of her closet).The villagers' worst fears are realized when the commanding officer orders his men to seize the Little Riders and melt them down for ammunition--to be used against the very people who love them. How can 11-year-old Johanna help her grandfather prevent this desecration? Even children can exhibit heroism for a noble cause, for these Little Riders represent more than just medieval art. They now symbolize the spirit of joy and yearning for liberty of the Dutch people. Who will suffer Nazi retaliation when the Riders are discovered missing? A thoughtful tale which will charm adult readers and inspire youthful ones."},{"Title":"the little riders","review":"Johanna, a young Dutch-American girl, is visiting her grandparents in Holland when World War II breaks out and Holland is invaded by the Germans. To her dismay, the Nazis appropriate her bedroom to be the living quarters of one of their officers. This not only produces inconvenience for the girl, but also endangers her grandparents who are leaders in the resistance movement. She takes consolation in watching the village's treasured Little Riders, iron figures of noblemen commemorating the Crusades, which make their circuit in the church steeple as the great clock strikes the hours. When the Nazis announce their intention to melt the Little Riders down for ammunition, Johanna joins the movement to keep the statues out of the Nazis' hands. When plans to smuggle them out of town go wrong, Johanna is left alone with them and she heroically implements a desperate solution. The story ends with a surprise which underscores the humanity of all people who participated in this war.This riveting story gently introduces the pain and evil involved in World War II, without going into graphic detail about the horrors of the war. Johanna's courage and loyalty are very admirable, and they seem to grow naturally in the context of her family's values of love and courtesy. The book is written at a transitional reader's level and (unlike most war stories) is appropriate for precocious pre-readers."},{"Title":"the little riders","review":"This beautiful little book is extremely well written, with beautiful prose and a beautiful message.

I thought that it showed the real problems in Holland at that time and I am very proud of my grandmother for writting it."},{"Title":"the little riders","review":"The Little Riders is a believable tale of the experience of one ten-year-old American girl caught up in World War II when blitzkrieg comes to the Netherlands while she is visiting her Dutch grandparents. The novella offers drama and excitement for young readers. As the reader follows the story of the small acts of resistance against the Nazi occupiers, the imagining of the trials and despair of the war become possible, yet the brutality is kept at a level that allows even a ten-year-old to read the book and emotionally cope. This is an excellent book for introducing World War II studies and for cultivating the understanding that courage is often shown by ordinary people in times of adversity, that creativity and standing together can defeat an enemy. I recommend this book for initial studies of World War II as well as for personal adventure reading."},{"Title":"the little riders","review":"This has always been my favorite book it's a don't miss for kids and even as an adult I enjoy it.

I love this book!"},{"Title":"Thomas Cranmer Theologian","review":"This is a helpful work that attempts to portray Cranmer as a theologian as Bromiley discusses key issues such as Cranmer's views of Scripture and tradition, justification, baptism and the eucharist. The discussions of such topics as Cranmer's nuanced view of baptism, not unlike other Reformed churchmen of his age, is discussed with care. Bromiley considers Cranmer a learned fellow, well versed in the controversies of his day and well read in the church fathers, especially the Latins, yet the author is forced to conclude that Cranmer is more of a scholar than a creative theologian. He does not handle man themes at length and Bromiley argues his lengthier eucharistic discussions do not produce anything genuinely original. Cranmer is clear, consistent and shares a wealth of biblical and patristic texts and is in large measure responsible for shaping \\"Anglican\\" theology as formularized by his 42 (later 39) Articles and the Book of Common Prayer, but he is not original. As a theologian Cranmer is seen at his best in his shorter treatises and in the 42 Articles of Religion. \\"With his alert and not too rigid or dogmatic mind, and his genius for the right formula, Cranmer would have been an invaluable chairman for the ecumenical discussions which he attempted to convene. ... What he did do was to give to his own church a balanced synopsis of its Reformation convictions. If he was not a theologian of the first rank, he certainly exercised a decisive and lasting influence.\\" Very well said. Bromiley notes that the wealth of patristic citation was especially prominent in Cranmer's writings and might reflect an innate conservatism. Whatever the reason for Cranmer's penchant for patristic citation Bromiley concludes he established a precedent for his successors in the Church of England. If you happen upon this book or are particularly interested in Cranmer this work is helpful for delineating the key points of Cranmer's theology, but much more recent and lengthier works such as Diarmaid MacCulloch's outstanding biography of Cranmer and Ashley Null's work on Cranmer's soteriology surpass this work, though not making it obsolete."},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Deryni","review":"I read the entire Deryni series years ago and just recently thought to find them again. They are well written and thought out. Lots of ancient realism, though they are fantasy novels! Though I am not Catholic, these books gave me insight to the Catholic Church's beliefs and taught me much about what certain traditions/customs of the Catholic Church meant. I became extremely involved with the characters; truly caring for and worrying about them as the series carried me through the years of the story. I heartily recommend them to anyone who loves magic, understands what it might be like to be an outcast or different from the accepted \\"norm\\", and/or anyone who loves to get involved in a really believable fantasy world. Both my brother and I love/loved the Deryni."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What can I say, except that this book is truely a pleasure to read.

I really liked the premise of the book and how Moning is exploring the world described by the Highlander series. I agree that the ending is abrupt if you don't know to expect it.However, I really liked seeing the darker side of things in the world of the Seelie and Unseelie. The book raised tons of questions, but that makes me all the more interested in reading the next book in the series.The only thing I didn't quite like is the character of Mac. She annoyed me in the beginning, but I think the characters IS a realistic representation of a 22 year old who has been thrown into a situation that was totally unexpected.

However, the main character is an airhead barbie doll with a low IQ, and by the 4th chapter you really wish someone would kill her and make one of the other more interesting characters the lead. I kept reading this hoping the main character would mature, throw less ridiculous tantrums, be more concerned about civilization than her nails, and do something intelligent, but alas, no. The torture of listening to her wine about her situation and talk about her clothes and nails goes on and on. The reader jumps to conclusions about the story line way before the she does, and it so painful waiting her to catch up, and watching her do stupid things (which the author excuses because she is supposedly in a stupor of grief). Skip this one - for a great female lead in fantasy, try Ilona Andrews Magic series, or Patricia Brigg's Mercy Thompson series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesMacKayla Lane is bereft when her sister Alina is brutally killed while studying abroad in Dublin. When the Dublin Police declare the murder an unsolved mystery and close the case, Mac flies to Ireland, determined to find the answers herself. Mac's only clue is a disturbing phone message left hours before Alina's death, mentioning a dark book called the Sinsar Dubh.Upon arrival in Dublin, Mac is immediately pitched head first into a dark world inhabiting monstrous creatures more frightening then her worst nightmares. As if that isn't enough, Mac discovers she has the rare gift of Sidhe-seeing, the ability to see the Unseelie through their projected glamours to their true forms. She also has to fend off the attentions of Death-by-Sex Fae, V'lane who has Mac in his sights. Mac's only ally is Jericho Barrons, who is after the Sinsar Dubh for his own purposes and is not above using Mac to get what he wants. Unsure who to trust, suspecting everyone and everything, Mac is in for a dangerous game. For if the Dark Fae get the book first, it would mean the destruction of all humans.While this is a book by a master romance novelist Karen Marie Moning, this book is by no means even remotely a romance. Darkfever is much darker in tone, has a continuing storyline throughout the entire series, and while there is some physical attraction and sexual fantasizing occurring, there is no romance found here. I knew this going into the series so I wasn't upset, but if fans are looking for the usual romance and happy ever after from Moning, they may be quite disappointed.I loved the whole premise of Darkfever and am I glad I waited to read/listen until I could do Books 1 and 2 (Bloodfever) back to back. Though now I have to wait for book 3 (Faefever)! I love Karen Marie Moning as a romance author and now I love her as a dark fantasy author as well. The descriptions of Dublin, the Unseelie, and the circumstances of the war between human and fae were brilliantly done. I even found myself cringing a time or two over the appearances of some of the nastier of nasty dark fae.The idea of Sidhe-seers was a fascinating one and added depth to the story, since we know the horrors of what Mac is seeing that no one else is even aware of. I did often find myself wondering as we went along, how people seeing these monsters could possibly pretend everything was normal in order to protect themselves from discovery. I sure would have had a very hard time ignoring the disgust I felt at seeing these creatures. I also loved the fact Mac is a null. Her touch has the ability to freeze the fae in place briefly, usually just long enough to escape. I've seen the idea of nulls in other fantasy books and though the most basic principle of the gift is familiar, Moning took it one step farther here.Mac is a character I couldn't decide if I liked or hated in the beginning. She's such a fluffy, stereotypical blonde initially that I wanted to smack her for being so clueless. I was with Barrons in my original impression of Mac. She quickly grew up however once she got to Dublin and realized what exactly she was fighting for. Though she still had some of those flightier moments, she had changed so much by the end of the story (fighting for your life will do that to you) that she is like an entirely different person. Jericho Barrons is an enigma and I can't wait to learn more about him. I also found myself quite curious about the old woman who saves Mac very early on in the book and appears a few more times. What are her stakes in Mac's mission?I am glad I listened to Darkfever though since I'd have never been able to figure out the proper pronunciation of some of the words used here. I can only hope there was a glossary in the print books that tells how to say the words. If I had read this in print, I'd have been beyond frustrated trying to figure out some of the words and it would have stolen much of the enjoyment of the story from me. Joyce Bean handles all those unfamiliar words with skill. I love her voice and her ability to bring the books to life so I was quite pleased to see she was the narrator of Darkfever.Kelley A.

It keeps you wondering the whole way through. The style reminds me of a Dan Brown book, where you are not sure till the end who is good and who is bad.

Was I disappointed that Adam, Deagus (my favorite), Drustan, and Cian didn't show up to help save the day - of course. Did I get over it. Yes.Take the book for what it is. It's a good read. My only gripe is that even in series mysteries we as a reader get some resolution there wasn't enough resolution with the plot to me. We should have at least gotten a confirmation on who Jericho really is."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I usually love Moning's books and I picked this one up without knowing anything about it. Mac has to be the most annoying and boring protagonist in any book I've ever read. \\"Vapid\\" is too kind a word. I have no interest in her story; I made myself finish the book but the cliffhanger didn't make me interested in getting the next book at all.

Our protaganist is upbeat, funny and polite (my favorite type) and kicks \\"petunia\\" (you'll get the reference once you've started reading). Every character was interesting, side characters too, and the plot moved right along.I appreciate that Ms. Moning avoided full-blown romance and sex scenes, though I imagine those will follow later in the series. I did think the fae-tantalizing was way over the top, but at least those scenes were fairly short.Given the genre and the serialized format, this was an excellent read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a really good book. It is well written, though sometimes she repeats herself a bit more than necessary...the author does a great job of creating a reader's sympathy of MacKayla. Young, underachiever, lost in the desire to be simple/selfish/shallow, she's forced to face a world of danger is not the smartest, but, by choice.I related to this woman right away. The characters are interesting, her perception of the fae are also unique; adding her own vocabulary, which she incorporates well into the story.

In the process she discovers some disturbing things about herself as well. She isn't who she thinks she is. The book has fairies, but not in the little pixie sense, and other characters who will be introduced as you read through the book (such as Jericho Barrons, who there is no earthly description for! Think Harlequin romance cover and you're just barely scratching the surface. The Fever Series is a far cry from Harlequin romance. It's much, much more!). You won't be able to put it down.The Fever series by Karen Marie Moning is fantasy/fiction at it's finest! These books keep me intrigued and up late into the night anxious to find out what happens to Makayla next. Karen's writing is such that I felt so totally engrossed in the story that I found myself thinking about the story throughout the day when I couldn't sit down to read it, then dreaming about it throughout the night!

The Heroine started at shallow but still likeable. As conflict grew, she grew into herself, her potential. Even though it was supernatural and prophetic, I could absolutely relate to her soul searching.The love interests are amazing. Both V'lane and Barrons are both so undeniably sensual, the sexual tension just makes your breath catch as you read.I have read this book twice and will probably read it again. The plot is a twisting, live thing which could go either way. Even after you've read it you feel like the finale is not set in stone. The characters are layered and intense. The relationships complicated and very realistic. The sexual content, while consummation doesn't occur, is not lacking in any way. In fact, I love the idea of the effect of the Fey's charisma, that there is sex worth dying for.I would recommend it to anyone, man or woman. It's not a girly romance.

I love venturing into the paranormal once in a while and this novel really fit the bill for me.MacKayla (Mac) Lane is a small town, 22 year-old Southern girl who loves nothing more than sitting out in the sun by the pool or shopping all day. She has a crazy obsession with anything pink and loves to be a girly-girl. So when her sister Alina leaves a cryptic message on her cell phone and ends up dying a mysterious death in Ireland Mac is left with no choice but to haul butt out there and try to figure out what happened on her own.What she didn't expect to find in Ireland was a whole other world that runs parallel to ours that she had no idea even existed. Worse than that, from the very beginning things begin to happen that lead Mac to wonder about herself - just who is she really. Is this what her sister Alina meant by leaving a message telling her that she didn't even know who she was. So far this is proving to be very true and scaring the crap out of her as she's encountering creatures that were better left unseen.Mac learns of the Fae world, meets Jericho Barrons who introduces her to a world that just shocks her, and bigger than all that finds out that she herself is what is called a sidhe-seer. She's one of those rare beings that can see through Fae glamour and freeze them with a touch. That would be enough to send any normal Southern girl running home but not Mac - she sticks it out. She has to get to the bottom of her sister's murder - she has to know who killed her and get revenge.Now Mac is caught in this shadowy world with only the very mysterious Jericho as a guide and she's not too sure of him yet. It is in his best interests to keep her alive though since they are both after the same thing - the Dark Book - the Sinsar Dubh. Whoever holds this book holds the power of both worlds and there are many after it - many who are extremely dangerous beings. All Mac has to do is stay alive long enough to learn more about herself - who her family was and what her power is and how to use it.I enjoyed this book and I'm really looking forward to reading the whole series. This is the kind of series I can really get addicted to and of course Darkfever leaves us with this big cliffhanger that leaves a person itching to get to the next book to see what is going to happen. I loved Mac's character. I found her funny and spunky and she had me giggling more than a few times. I'm curious to see if there will be any type of relationship blossom between her and Jericho. However I do have to point out that this book is not for the faint hearted or shy - there are definitely some steamy goings on in these pages."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I had no idea what to expect from Darkfever. I was under the assumption it was vampire romance and I was completely wrong. Darkfever is a fae novel and much more urban fantasy than paranormal romance, although it did have a few titillating scenes.MacKayla is an average young woman, working as a bartender, enjoying her freedom, without much ambition for the future. That all changes when her sister is murdered and she travels to Ireland to investigate after the police give up on finding the killer. Mac soon comes to kind that she's far more than average, but has the ability to see the fae. This ability puts her in danger, but also gives her an edge while tracking her sister's murderer.Barrons helps Mac, but grudgingly. He's attractive but his demeanor leaves something to be desired. There seems to be an attraction between Mac and Barrons, but that remains to be seen in future books. The real steaminess comes from Mac's encounters with V'lane, a fae royal whose mere presence makes Mac take her clothes off - literally.The liked the story in Darkfever, but what I really loved was the humor. It wasn't humor for laughs, but more Mac's general personality and what she thought of this previously hidden to her world. Even with her new found ability, she still thought like a human - wondering things like what's up with the fae always wanting to take women on their knees? It was definitely nod and smile type of humor.Darkfever is a very good series starter which leaves the reader ready for more."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What a fun roller coaster read!Darkfever (Fever Series, Book 1)is all about transition - from sunny Georgia to rainy Dublin; from sweet light innocent MacKayla to dark vengeful bitter Mac. You cannot help but feel her pain and guilt as the story develops, just like you cannot help but feel a heart-pounding anticipation whenever Barrons enters the scene - although whether that is a good thing or a bad is yet to be seen. Moning's take on the au courant fairy-tale is not necessarily the most original out there, but is certainly one of the more engaging and I look forward to the next installment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Mac's sister is dead, and the Irish police haven't caught the killer. When the authorities inform Mac's family that they are sending the case to their cold case division, Mac takes it upon herself to fly to Ireland, and she'll make sure she hounds the police until her sister's murder is solved. But things aren't that simple, and Mac finds herself on a search for an ancient text as well. There are creatures in Dublin that not everyone can see, unfortunately Mac can, and it's making her sick. So she turns to the one person that has the information and skills that she needs to find her sister's murdered and the book, Barrons. But there's something not quite right about him...\\"Darkfever\\" was an interesting read, and the beginning of a series that people refer to as crack. Essentially, this means that not only is it a much loved series that people will defend to the death, but it is epic as well as addicting. I did enjoy Mac's character, I like to see characters break out of the regular stereotypes I see a lot of in urban fantasy - most of the female characters are tough, in charge, and never really bother with their hair or nails. Mac cares a lot about what she wears, what she looks like, and disdains dark colors - she'd rather be in bright pink and rainbow colors than dressed in all black leather. And along with all the pink, she has some brains as well. She's incredibly inexperienced when it comes to the magical world she's thrown into, but she's smart enough to learn and develop the skills she needs to survive.Fans of the book, or at least a lot of female fans of the book, swoon over Barrons. I didn't really understand that obsession. Frankly, I found Barrons incredibly uptight and extremely aggravating, I wanted to tell him to pull the stick from his rear end and loosen up a little. However, he was redeemed a little, at least in my eyes, near the end of the book. I saw some development there, and I hope to see that continue in the future books, and then maybe he will achieve swoon levels.All in all, the book was alright, and I enjoyed it enough to finish it, and I do plan to continue reading the series. I saw a lot of potential in this first book, and everyone speaks to highly of the Fever series, I want to know why! So if you're a fan, feel free to follow my progress as I move on to the next book.

Then Kelly (fellow reviewer at FanLit), whose opinion I esteem, recommended the Fever series and, simultaneously, Brilliance Audio sent me the last volume to review. So I decided to get the first book, Darkfever on audio, and give it a try.MacKayla (Mac) Lane is a delightfully shallow Southern girl who we meet as she's tanning herself by the pool in her pink bikini. She works as a bartender, takes some college classes, loves her parents, eats a lot, and adores her Juicy Couture purse. The biggest stressor in Mac's life is her fear that Revlon might discontinue her favorite pink nail polish.But reality hits when Mac finds out that her big sister, who's also her best friend, has been murdered in an alley in Dublin. Devastated by her loss, frustrated by the lack of closure offered by the Dublin police, and spurred on by a cryptic clue on her voicemail, Mac sets off for Dublin to get some answers. She leaves behind her grieving and panicked parents.When Mac arrives in Dublin, her pink princess life suddenly turns into a dark underground world of deadly shades, life-sucking faeries, dangerous black-market relics, and powerful magic. When she meets Jericho Barrons, a wealthy and mysterious bookstore owner, he warns her to leave, but Mac is determined to get answers and the more she learns, the scarier it gets.I was immediately drawn to Mac, understanding the culture she comes from and being completely convinced of her authenticity. Mac is charming and funny, is concerned about maintaining decorum, and expects to receive Southern Hospitality wherever she goes. Her personality, manners, and wardrobe worked well for her debutante life in Georgia, but when she hits the wealthy and sophisticated section of Dublin, she seems like a Barbie doll. As Barrons puts it, she's \\"a walking, talking catastrophe in pink.\\" But she's so real -- grieving over her sister, concerned about her frightened parents, realizing that she's shallow, and knowing she doesn't have what it takes to save the world.Also impressive is the complete lack, so far, of a romance. I know it's coming, but it's not at all obvious that it's being set up. At this point the focus is firmly on the plot and the world-building. While I welcome a romance, I find that fantasy novels that are set up around the romance (often what we get from books found next to Moning's on the paranormal shelf) are usually weak in the areas of plot and world-building, and this is why I had dismissed the Fever series for so long. But I was wrong about this one. Darkfever is a fast-paced, compulsively readable novel with a relatable heroine, a wonderful setting, and a plot that's full of tension of the non-romantic type. Now that this solid foundation has been laid, adding romantic tension on top will be a bonus to the plot instead of a burden.This audiobook was read by Joyce Bean whose voice and acting skills easily range from Sweet Georgia Peach to Cultured Irish Alpha Male. Really impressive. I'm looking forward to the next audiobook, Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read the whole Fever Series.

I am definitely now a fan of Karen Marie Moning!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After a reading bonanza which ended with me feeling oddly depressed about the ever expanding urban fantasy genre, I found this. I was a bit hesitant considering that it was in the romance section but pleasantly surprised by the contents. It isn't much on romance though I suspect we'll be seeing some in following books but I found it to be good fun. Ignore the other reviews that says this book is anti-woman. I don't see it like that. Yes, some of the antagonist characters that are seeking the same mythical book as our heroine are anti-woman but then, that's why they're the bad guys. The main character is a bit shallow and appearance obsessed but then, how can we expect a character to grow if she starts off the book all grown up and strong willed? This is a fun, quick read with a nice little cliff hanger that made me go out and buy the next!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla (Mac) Lane's protected, southern life is going well. She is holding down the fort at her house where she lives with her parents. The Lane family's lives are irrevocably changed when Mac receives a call that her sister, Alina, has been murdered in Ireland where she has been attending Trinity University in Dublin. There is one clue that is left behind by Alina. She leaves cryptic message on Mac's cell phone alluding to the fact that Alina was caught up in a quagmire of trouble.Mac decides to travel to Ireland on a crusade to find of answers. There Mac is caught up in the scary, elusive world of the Fae. Her Southern Belle reality makes a huge paradigm shift when she realizes she has a peculiar power that allows her to see the Fae's real face through the glamor they project to assimilate into the human world.As Mac gets further entrenched into the mystery of her sister's demise, she meets the mysterious Jericho Barrones. Barrones and Mac come to an uneasy alliance in the quest to search for Fae objects of power, one of which was specifically mentioned (the Sinsar Dubh) by Alina in the last voice mail message she left on Mac's phone before she died. The Sinsar Dubh is a very dark, evil book which was created by the Unseelie King.This book was an absolute joy to read. Karen Marie Moning's unique voice lures the reader into a world you could never dream up on your own. The smooth anecdotic writing of the author is stunningly resplendent. Moning builds a bridge between the reader and Mac through her writing by eliciting the feeling that the reader is the one and only confidant Mac feels safe enough to confide all of her secrets, insecurities, epiphanies, and emotions to as she is led into a very dark, scary, unfamiliar world. Hold on tight to your book as you are sucked into Mac's world. This story will amaze and tittilate while emotions you never thought a book could could call forth swamp your imagination.Happy reading from Bona Fide Reflections!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It took me a long time to find a new writer that I liked, and I bought everyone of Karen Marie Monings novels. I was so disappointed in this book that I'm going to sell it and try to get some of my money back.1st. I have never read a romance novel( and I've read alot)that didn't have romance in it.2nd. I felt like I was reading an action book. It didn't even seem like it was one of her books.3rd. Not one single love scene(and lets be honest that's why we read romance novels right)in the entire book.I guess we have to buy the next one that goes with it but after this one I most likely will not. Where is the old Karen Marie Moning at? I've read her other books at least 3 time each, I want those fantasy's back.I would not spend the money on this one unless you get it alot cheaper, that way you will not feel like you got ripped off like I did."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Normally, I don't do reviews. I read them to judge a book. Sometimes I agree and sometimes I don't. For this different type of book that KMM wrote I had to share my thoughts.I loved it. It was so different than the other books being offered. I am so sick of the vampire series even Nora Roberts is sweeping into that arena. This book was just different enough to be very good.I can't wait for the next one. I hope this helped a little in making your decision about reading it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am not a avid reader. But since I stumbled across the Highlander series I have read every book. I am a romantic at heart so I enjoyed the series very much. I went to Barnes & Noble and purchased the first book in the fever series, \\"Darkfever\\". I have just finished reading 136 pages and I am disappointed. This young gal \\"Mac\\" is immature, dumb, and reminds me of the so called valley girls when many years ago I lived in L.A. I sure hope the book gets better or I will have a hard time reading the rest of the series. The other characters in the book are great and the story line is good. I think that Karen Marie Moning has come a long way since her first book and has reached the top of her game,but there is always room for improvement!Robert Harper"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"No test to speech. Publisher must hate vision impaired people.Otherwise, it's a fun story. The author does an excellent job ofbeing true to the mythology she has created."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Yet another supernatural/urban fantast series that fails to deliver. It's very shallow and uninvolving, the heroine comes across as a slacker and rather whiney and the hero is brooding and uninteresting. I lost interest around chapter 3 and chucked it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"DARKFEVER by Karen Marie Moning. (2.5 stars) Perhaps all the sensational, brilliant, stunningly jaw-dropping writing from other authors is making NYT Best Sellers look like child's-play? I don't know, but I'm not convinced this kind of mediocre writing is inspiring this many people to buy these books. The romance is so convoluted I don't see how anyone could have \\"felt\\" anything for the characters being together romantically. He's an ass, she's being held captive, love connection? Not buying it. Stockholm Syndrome much? No thanks!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'd suggest that this is a cross between buffy and the twilight series. Well written, but the teenage angst was just replaced with twenty something angst - not for every reader. Best enjoyed via used or borrowed books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"From the beginning you know this is not your typical fiction book, its about non-earthly creatures who apparently are here to destroy our world. While the plot is not well developed there are certainly points in the book that keep your attention. However, there is definitely a lot of \\"fluff\\" that caused me to lose attention and didn't excite me to keep reading. Overall I give it three stars as there are some great elements along with the mystery of what will happen as the series continues and how the characters will further develop. The main character certainly matures throughout the first book (given where she started that wasn't difficult) and hopefully we'll learn even more about the other characters she encounters during her adventure. I would read the next book, and if it is better I will continue to read the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The book just ends as though it is in the middle of the story. I don't mean there is a cliffhanger it just ends. No idea still about her sister; did not find her sister's diary; don't know about adoption; etc., etc.. I was shocked and have really never seen this before. I won't be reading the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I read in the prologue of this book \\"The only good Fae is a dead Fae,\\" my eyes widened with astonishment. What a racist/specisist or whatever you call that attitude is,but exploiting old biases under a new guise is what she is doing. Sadly, it didn't get better from there. Unprotected fae sex makes human women get uncontrollably lustful and long for what they never should have had in the first place, she tells us. Oh this is pathetic and juvenile. What I first took for a positive trend in fantasy literature that would keep the old lore alive and with us in a contemporary setting is being plumbed for dollars without a care for the roots of actual Faerie lore at all, and presented to an audience that likely doesn't know the difference. I find this author highly irritating. Many swear her Highland series is just the best -- I will take them at their word, for I doubt I'll ever get those books on my reading list, based on this one. Thankfully I tested the waters with this series by borrowing this book from my library, and was only too glad to take it back and not have it anywhere on my shelves."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I wasn't sure I'd like this book as it was supposed to be a 'sidestep' from her usual Highlander books (which are absolutely fabulous!). But I found I couldn't put it down. It IS different, but grabs your attention just as well, and right from the start. Mac is funny, smart and a little cocky, especially when she becomes aware of powers she never knew she had. How she handles herself in this world and the 'other-world' she is entering are what keep you engrossed in the story. Jericho is drop-dead gorgeous, of course, but Mac can handle him and in a way, I'm sure, he's never been handled before by a woman. She's as much a mystery to him as he is to her. As they begin their quest of looking into the mysterious death of her sister in Ireland and finding the powerful, dark, book Sinsar Dubh, Jericho proves to be mysterious, powerful, almost magical and, throughout their adventures together, you get the feeling he is going to be her defender, her hero, and maybe in the future, her lover?...... I only wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next \\"Fever\\" book - \\"BloodFever\\" coming out this year. There's actually no sex in this first Fever book, well, OK, maybe just a little, but not between the two main characters - (a lot of subtle 'flirting') - but sex is put on the back burner as these two enter the world of the Fae, Vampires and all those other-worldly creatures Mac and Jericho encounter. A book full of mystery, adventure, danger and the like. Characters that pull you in and keep you wondering what's going to happen next. Can't wait for the next book in this series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was soooooooo good! I will have a hard time waiting for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I realize that DarkFever is the beginning of a new series, but it also is pulling elements from the established Highlander series. After I adjusted to the 1st person POV, it was a good story. But left me with many questions: How/Why did the Unseelie get free? When did the walls between the realms come down and why? Did something happen to the MacKeltar's that voided the Compact? Where is Aiobhiel? I thought Adam was the most powerful, dead-sexy Fae - so where did V'lane come from? Who or What is Jericho Barrons? The questions go on and on. Hopefully, BloodFever will answer some of these. Boy, it's going to be a long wait until August 07."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"In first person our only definition of the heroine is through her own eyes. In this case, the heroine is a lazy, self-absorbed 22-year old with no ambition beyond working a part-time fun job, brushing her hair, painting her nails and working on her tan. It's impossible to sympathize with her or identify with her and irritating to read this story unfolding through her juvenile conscience.My second problem with this book is the price vs. length. At 304 pages of story, it's barely longer than a novella, but the retail price is $20. Although the author states that Mac's story couldn't be told in 500 or even 600 pages, I suspect it could easily be told in a novel of normal length, especially since each new book will contain a recap of previous books, adding to the length, but not the story.It has been 15 months since her last novel, Spell of the Highlander, was released. At that rate, this series won't be completed until at least 2011. Fifteen months between installments is entirely too long for a cliffhanger series. The books need to be released no more than a couple of months apart.If the second installment is as irritating and shallow as the first one was I'll be praying for the Shades to get her...."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved Ms. Moning's Highlander series and was really excited to read this new book (even though I was disappointed she had decided to start a new series rather than continue with the Highlander books). This book was terrible- Mac is annoying and Barrons does nothing for me. I can't believe this is part of a 5 book series- I will not be reading any more. Hopefully after she finishes this series, Ms. Moning will write more books like the Highlander series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla is a small town unambitious Georgia girl who works as a bartender, loves rainbows and the color pink, and cares about good manners and looking nice, but soon after Darkfever opens she is devastated to learn that her older sister and lifelong best friend has been murdered in Ireland where she had gone to study. Worse than that the police have given up trying to find the killer. Though her parents are falling apart and don't want her to go, she is determined to prod the local authorities into reopening the investigation, but what Mac finds when she arrives in Ireland turns her whole world upside down and has her questioning who exactly she is. Almost as soon as she is off the plane Mac starts noticing strange people, creatures really, who shimmer back and forth from gorgeous to hideous though almost no one around her seems to notice. It turns out she is a sidhe-seer and is able to perceive the un-glamoured appearances of fae, the magic race who most likely killed her sister. To avenge her sister and save her own skin Mac must drastically change her Barbie doll good looks and prepare to fight.Mac forms an uneasy alliance with Jericho Barron, a tall dark intense maybe-human guy who owns a Dublin bookstore on edge of an abandoned neighborhood that has gone missing from human maps and is now filled with shadowy dark fae. This book is the first part of a series and ends with an abrupt cliffhanger. It also fits into the New Adult genre recently described in a New York Times article. Darkfever has a 22 year old protagonist, paranormal elements, and steamy action beyond what would normally fit into the Young Adult category."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It was a good book, but there were a lot of boring passages, the ending was very thrilling though, so I might read the next book too."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let me start with this:I entered the foyer of The Clarin House and hurried to the counter. \\"Evenin''t'ye, m'dear,\\" the desk clerk said cheerfully. \\" 'Opin you 'ave reserves, a'sure ye'll be needin' 'em such a foine night th'season.\\"Please take note..I'm Irish, i have never nor has any member of my family ever spoken like this in my life!!!!!!!!Luckily this fades away as the book goes on till eventually it disappears altogether and then I really got into this book.I understand why Mac is so pink & pretty at the start as we clearly see her changing both internally and externally as the story goes on.I enjoy this author's style of writing and the tale she's telling which is predominantly Fae based and will definitely be a series I will be continuing.I definitely want to find out what happens.If you're hoping for a series with an ending at the end of each novel but a common thread throughout than this isn't it, I feel there won't be a resolution for a good number of books to come.Also romance wise it's going to be a while I'm guessing before we see where that goes but I'm willing to wait :)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This whole series was great. I highly recommend it to any one who likes reading original work. I had been lazy with reading regularly for almost a year, until my friend recommended this book. I always want to be polite and follow friend recommendations, I did not think it would hook me like it did. I read all 5 books within maybe 2 weeks, when I hadn't read anything the previous whole year. Thanks for getting me back into reading!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I actually read this because another reviewer objected to the sex. (There are fairies that turn women into nymphomaniacs at least temporarily.) My problem with the book is that the female protagonist can't spot a clue until it bites her, not just on the ass but in a tender spot, and she is mildly incompetent. I like heroines who are at least fairly intelligent and resourceful. To me that is bottom line."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My friend recommended this series, so I picked it up and started reading it. Needless to say that I couldn't put the book down and read it in less than a day. It is about Mac who tries to find her sisters killer in Ireland and gets swept up in this dark and light fae war. Then there is Jerricho Barrons in the middle being a dark, handsome, and mysterious man that you want to eat up! This series is one of my favorites!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Currently in literature paranormal is uber popular, from vampire's to Fae they are everywhere. This book is about the Fae, except, this book doesn't seem to romanticize them in any way. I am new to this author, but I've heard many good things about the Fever series, and I always enjoy reading some Urban Fantasy/Paranormal books. I did enjoy Darkfever, I knew that with all of the hype, I'd either love it or hate it. I really liked it. MacKayla goes from being this flighty girly, bartender young lady, who has no real goals in life, to throwing herself into the center of things, by investigating her sisters mysterious murder. She is a clueless young lady at the beginning but toward the end of the book you can see her starting to take shape. I like the characters, MacKayla is interesting, and there's a lot of potential in her. Barrons is a mystery and so are pretty much all of the male characters in this story. The whole world of the Fever series is different, with something scary potentially hiding behind every corner, and a mystery hiding behind the others. It's interesting, looking forward to picking up #2."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The main character is MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Mac is a sidhe-seer, which is someone who can see the true nature of the Fae and are not fooled by Fae glamour or magic, but she can be hurt by them. Her life changes when her sister, Alina, is murdered in Ireland. Mac goes to Ireland despite her parent's disapproval to find out what happened to Alina. Once Mac gets there her whole life is turned upside down again. Alina left a message for Mac telling her to find the Sinsar Dubh and that a man who she thought loved her was one of them and out to get her. The problem with this is that Alina didn't tell her how to find the Sinsar Dubh or her boyfriend's name. Now the action starts.DARKFEVER is a fast paced, well written book. I liked the storyline, I like the paranormal suspense, and the characters are well developed. This is book one in the FEVER series and I look forward to reading book two, this was a fun read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Okay, I am writing this after reading the entire Series. I have to confess up front, this is my favorite series of all time. Jericho Barrons and MacKayla Lane are my favorite characters and Jeicho Barrons is most definitely the sexiest alpha male in any story or series I've read so far.This book was a very slow start. In fact, I stopped reading it to read another book and then came back to it. I'm so glad I did. The story did finally get moving along and it was a roller coaster ride.I was a sheltered southern girl myself and I had no trouble accepting Mac as a naive airhead type in her early 20's. She's not an airhead at all as we realize later in the story but I doubt I would have liked her much if I had met her before she went to Ireland. Neither am I a big fan of fae and those kinds of creatures, however, I accepted this story very well. Maybe because it takes place in Ireland and the entire country seems mystic to me for some reason. I really loved this story.Mac is determined to find out what really happened to her sister. She gets little to no help from the police and meeets some strange characters. Then the stumbles into Barrons' book store and meets... him.Not sure who she can trust, she partners up with Barrons for whatever help he can give her and she begins to learn things, shocking things about this world and the fae world. The journey begins and I'm never sure if she should trust Barrons or not either but... oh my I hope he turns out to be a good guy.Great read, I highly recommend this entire series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book and the entire series were so exciting and imaginative that I had a hard time putting them down. I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next book. I liked the fact that it was more sexy than slutty. I didn't think of it as a romance book at all. It was more of a sexy action/Sci-Fi/fantasy story. I was pleasantly surprised because I purchased the first book from the Romance Novel section.The only problem now is that once I finished this series, I am having a really hard time finding another book that will keep my interest. I have started 3 books and stopped halfway through because they were so boring. I want to experience the same passion that I felt for the Fever series, and the other books are just not doing it for me!If you like Sci-Fi/fantasy and a kickass heroin, you will love these books!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, let me start off by saying that I agree with many of the \\"bad\\" or negative reviews posted... MacKayla Lane is a self-centered, annoying, ditzy, blond bimbo... at first. Having lived in the south for a few years, I have actually known women like MacKayla Lane. Her character in Book One really didn't annoy me as much as some reviewers because I saw the potential for growth in the character and felt the author was making a point.One of the best things about this series is how the heroine transforms from your typical southern belle into an ass-kicking sidhe-seer. Book one, Darkfever, is just the beginning of this transformation. The other characters, the plot, and the setting (Dublin, hello!) made me continue reading the series and I am very glad I did.I would encourage those with mixed feelings about Darkfever to try reading Book Two, Bloodfever. I'm sure MacKayla Lane will surprise you given the chance."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Its the classic 'ordinary meets extraordinary'. MacKayla Lane is the cherised daughter of hard working parents who have it all together and nothing in her life is as it shouldnt be until her sister is killed. She finds out she's adopted, that there are multiple realities blah blah blah.I absolutely hate that she turns out to be adopted. I'm sick of stories about adoption. It would've been much more interesting if the plot went like this:MacKayla never new her grandmother but it turns out her grandmother is a Faery maid on the Seelie court and the Faery gene is dormant in her father so he has no idea about the alternate reality. Her grandma comes to find her and help her kick butt etc, etc.I love the personalities that are created as well. I like that she's innocent and naive. It doesnt make her seem like a 12 year old to me, it makes her seem like what she is. How would you react if you been thrust into a world you didnt know existed. Its hard to teach an old dog new tricks.Jerricho.... I'm gonna marry that man and have his babies. Right after i've had a 10 night stand with the death-by-sex Faery Prince.HOWEVER! There was not enought romance in this book for me. I'm used to reading Hannah Howell's books full of passionate sex, hot hormones and war. I've just ordered the second book, I hope Jerricho kisses her again...and again, and again. lol.I like the authors story telling."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a new style for me.

I'm not sure how I feel about Mac, but the Fae world seems intriguing. Mac seems a bit immature for twenty-two and it's explained by constantly saying she is from a small Southern town...sort of an insult to a small Southern town.About halfway through, I am feeling a little bit bogged down with details and characters. I know a back story is important, but I found myself skimming through lots of info.Overall, I am interested enough to continue the series. I would recommend this book for sure."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Moning is renowned for her romances, but she should also be worshipped for her deftness in the paranormal genre.I could not put this book down.MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane's whole world gets thrown in a new - and deadly - direction when the Dublin police telephone to inform her and her family that her sister has been found torn up and dead - murdered - in an alleyway. There are no leads and the case is being closed.

In fact, she's finding out things about herself she never even knew.(This is not a book for tweens, unless they're mature, or you're not a \\"restrictive\\" parents. There's nothing past first base or anything, but one of the character's is a sex fae, so things can get downright wet and hot when he's around. Besides, the storyline and characters may be a little to complex for this generation's tweens.)With a strong, sassy heroine, a smoldering, mysterious hero, and the fantastic plot and ideas of Mrs. Karen Moning a great series has been born.Buy it.

What a wonderful, dark, interesting surprise this book has turned out to be. Granted, it practically reeks, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\"--only Mac (i.e.--Buffy) slays fae. She even haves the all knowing mentor who ownes and lives in his own abnormally extensive library. What impressed me more about this book than her others was the fact that she seemed to have actually gone out and done a little research on the Irish culture and current places. She describes the pubs and streets very detailed. I, unfortunately, have never been, but her detailed descriptions have a ring of truth and accuracy. Her character is likeable, regardless of the blonde, barbie-doll, always wears pink and accessories, style. Mysterious Jericho is definately someone I would like to hear more about. I especially liked the painting nails scene. It gave the story a lighter, softer touch after so much dark and depressing scenes.Overall, I could have taken or left behind Moning's Highlander series, but this newer Fever series has got my attention and my curiosity going. I think this time I will watch out for the next and let the other books be the fluff fillers between."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Probably the worst book I ever read. I would give negative stars if I could.I got this book through the Kindle deal. I am not a romance reader, I don't know the writer, never read her previous works. I don't think I will. Ever!The plot is boring, it is not leading to anywhere. The characters are weak.The heroine is a mindless town girl, whose biggest fear in the world is the discontinuing of a some stupid pink shade nail color. She is taking time to describe her clothes and hair (in her journal) even when she is chased by an evil fae.The author keeps describing her barbie like like matching pink outfits through the book. Half of the book is filled w/ outfit, hair and make up descriptions.I was glad when it was over.Even for the Kindle experimenting, keep away from this book, seriously.

Romance is really all I read. I love reading romance and so after reading many reviews about this book I was very wary of reading the book. In fact, I even got it from the library when normally I purchase a Karen Marie Moning book the day it is released.Imagine my surprise when I started reading the book that I really kind of liked it. As I got further in to the book I found myself liking it even more. It really is a fascinating story. The creatures in the book are terrifying and the Gray Man is very frightening. However, I loved all of that. I couldn't wait for what was about to happen next. The ending was great and only left me hanging for more. I can't wait for the next book.Yes, there is really no romance in this book but for me it was just the beginning of a great story line. This book is the build up to four more very interesting stories. As Karen says the romance will appear just not in this first book. Jericho is very mysterious and I'm very curious to discover exactly what he is all about and who he really is.Read the book...it's not boring and definitely keeps you wondering what the next page will bring. Just like me you'll be left waiting for the next book and wishing that it was being released tomorrow!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The glimpse into a different side of the Fae world was interesting. It was odd that a 1st person story could be so distant-no connecting with any of the characters. I didn't feel any of Mac's grief/rage and she did come across as juvenile which isn't bad in fiction, but if this is a romance over the series I don't look forward to a glimpse of her sex life--ick! There's happy/sunny personality and then there's childish and Mac was really treading that line. I read romance for the sexy brooding hero but here the viewpoint kept me from understanding Barron's motivations and background so he wasn't much of a hero to root for. The characters in this book are defined as really hot or really repulsive. I saw the repulsive, the hot ones are seriously debatable. Hopefully V'lane doesn't make a future appearance in the series because Mac defined his actions best as tantamount to rape. Very disturbing in a romance. The stars I gave for my review is for the fascinating Fae world, not the characters."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I downloaded this free on my Kindle and am so thankful I did. Wow, what a fabulous book! Character development cannot get much better than this. I am on the edge of my seat with this series. Love the interaction between Mac and Barrons. Chemistry, but not romance. Though you think just maybe ... someday ... something may happen. Who knows, but I am hooked! If you love action-packed, book with characters that have so many dimesions you may never think you'll figure them out, you have to read this series. It's one of my favorites now!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Found this book on a rack at the local King Kullen grocery store. Best find I ever had. Devoured the book and when I learned it was part of a series, I immediately purchased the others. Can't wait for the last book! The only drawback is that each book ends on such a cliffhanger! Bit frustrating having to wait for the ending, however the author was ingenious! Creating a story so fascinating and keeping you wanting more..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It started with a free book on my kindle and bam, I am a Karen Moning fan! This is a great series for a grown-up fan of the whole fantasy/romance/twilight story craze. But, unlike some authors just cashing in on success by slapping some cheesy gag fangs in a hot male mouth- Moning can write! This isn't a tween dream about finding love with a neutered male with sharp teeth and no bite, this is about end of the world stuff. Honestly, it seems unfair that Moning appears to slipping under the radar with her intriguing and dark Fae series. I quickly consumed my free introduction and happily plunked down my own money to continue the series. The final book comes out this year and you can bet that I will be pre-ordering that one... AND my own Team Barrons shirt."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just got the Kindle application for my Iphone and this book was a free offer so I took it. It just sat in my folder for a few weeks until my husband and I were waiting to be seated at a restaurant. I decided to check it out while we were waiting, and the first FEW LINES of the book drew me in so completely that I read the entire time we were at the restaurant-even while I was eating! I've never read a book with a plot quite like this and I was so bedazzled with the characters and the story line that I wasn't able to put it down. I went back and read some of the reviews that were posted about the book and I have to say I'm a little disappointed. Do not believe everything you read as far as ratings go. I'm not sure what some of these readers have been reading in the past, but I found nothing negative about this book. I was absolutely in love from the first sentence. I'm so glad it's a series because I don't want to leave Karen Marie Moning's world!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Karen Marie Moning. I got addicted to her highlander series and when I found she had started a new series, I had to get it. It didn't disappoint. She has fused the real every day world with magic and has written a truly intriguing book. My only disappointment lies in the fact that I have to wait until the next book comes out. If you liked the Highlander Series or are a fan of Sherilyn Kenyon, you will likely enjoy Dark Fever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have the DarkFever bug now, and it won't quit until I read All of the series. This was my first Moning novel and I am glad I picked it up. I don't see how this book could receive anything less than five stars because it had the creepy elements, sexual tension, amazing characters and it is a dark literature. The book is told in first person, which didn't bother me because reading from Mac's point of view allows me to feel what she is going through, and we see everything going on through her eyes- we peek into her world and I can relate to her being that I am in my twenties and all. I appreciate Moning for introducing this series because now I have another Fever approaching in October- BloodFever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have been a Karen Marie Moning fan for a long time. This new series of hers is outstanding. She has done a fabulous job with the world she has created within this book. Darkfever is book 1 in a series of 5.Mac's sister is murdered while attending school in Scotland. Mac sets out to Scotland to investigate her sisters death. While there she discovers that she can \\"see\\" things others can't. Mac learns that she has a gift to see the world of the Fae. She finds protection and guidance with Jericho Barrons, a mysterious man who also seems to have gifts of some kind.I honestly don't think 5 stars is enough. Karen has done an outstanding job. The mystery, the good and evil, the sexual tension. It is a great novel and I highly recommend it.Some may be surprised at the end, for it is abrupt. But it is a series of 5 books. A person can't very well give everything out in the first book of a series, that wouldn't give them anything to write in the other 4. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Take every terrible insulting thing that makes both the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series horrid anti-woman nightmares, put them together and decrease the quality of the writing even further, and you have this travesty of a series opener. The main character has an IQ slightly above that a rutabaga and a personality well summed up in her own admission that she guessed she \\"was a Barbie doll after all.\\" The series manages to insult women in general, southern women in particular, people form small towns, adopted people and anyone with the slightest knowledge of mythology.The fae are relegated to universally evil aliens, but don't really succeed at being Lovecrafitan horrors from beyond the void of time and space, and there are no explanations for the many deviations from traditional lore. The story centers around the search for a set of \\"hallows\\" a word that was not a noun prior to J.K. Rowling's use of it as such. The first time in was at least different and therefore somewhat imaginative, now it's just imitative and trite, a phrase that could describe the entire book.Every male described as in any way sexy is invariably also described as dangerous and despite saying how much this pisses her off the main character is also helplessly attracted to every single one, despite being universally treated as a brainless sack of meat by every male in the book. (Granted in her particular case the description is almost justified.) Despite making rounds to visit all the powerful movers and shakers in the Dublin magical community, not one of them is a woman, or has any respect for them.A previous reviewer condemned the writing for it's obviously 80's inspired image of male beauty, That is a minor quibble to its' 1880's ideas of gender. The growing wave of these spineless, brainless \\"heroines\\" who supposedly appeal to more \\"normal\\" readers outside of the fantasy market is deeply distressing. It is an insult to \\"normal\\" women if publishers think this is who they are, and most certainly should not be given to our daughters to say this is who we think they are.Disturbing themes aside, the book is also slow paced, full of plot holes and highly incomplete. Unlike many other series with large plot arcs, there is no internal resolution to allow this book to stand on it's own, as well as function within the series. Its free status basically makes it a come on, like the proverbial drug dealer, presuming that an already well selling author could not get this dud of a series to sell."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book! This is Moning in serious romance/intrigue mode. It's written in first-person which is different from her previous novels, but I found that this view enhanced the story. I read it in one sitting on my wedding anniversary! She's obviously a master at building erotic anticipation and I have to say, I'm downright greedy to get my hands on the next novel. (My husband was not disappointed either!) When's the next one coming out???? Thanks Ms. Moning for supplying many more hours of fantasy-fodder!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I devoured Darkfever in one sitting and am now savoring my second reading of it. I've read a lot about this book here and elsewhere. One thing I noticed from people who loved it and people who didn't was the fact that they wanted to read the sequel. Right there, that tells you how fabulous the story is.I admit that I am a long time fan of Ms Moning and after reading this book, that won't be changing anytime soon. She has enriched the world of the Fae that she had created in her earlier books while creating new and exciting characters that leave me guessing and wanting more.Mac promises to be an interesting and oh so human character who I will enjoy watching grow and develop and Jericho has me intrigued beyond belief. While this book may not be one of her \\"highlander\\" novlels it is still classic Moning, with fleshed out characters that I care about and a wonderfully written story. Now all I have to do is count the days until Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"KMM has put a great new spin on her world of Fairy, Magic and Suspense. While the book doesn't have the quick romance of her previous books, it adds rich new characters with room to grow. It doesn't give you easy instant answers, but keeps you thinking, questioning, and wanting more. The book engages long past the first reading, and brings you back to reread it for more clues. For me, that's just good entertainment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I would say not to waste your money and time and skip to book 4 & 5which are absolutely good plus they summaries the first 3 book . The series feels incomplete."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"wow whoever thought that this narrator could pass for 22 year old woman was out of his/her mind. I couldn't stand this audio book, I kept picturing a middle age woman acting like a total ditz. why couldn't they find a voice actress closer to Mac's age or young sounding, man way to ruined a good story.Don't waste your credit on this audio book, get the actual book instead."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book drew me in and kept going at a very steady and engaging pace. It was only near the 'ending' that the author lost me. I'd go into specifics, but I'm trying to write a review and not a spoiler. The ending is definitely a cliffhanger, and I have no problem with that, but be forewarned.One of the things this novel could definitely benefit from would be more \\"show don't tell\\" in the writing. The book has a lot of potentially rich imagery and situations, but I often found myself annoyed at the author telling me how a character felt, instead of making me a witness to how a character felt. The descriptions get so hyperbolic at times that I stopped taking them seriously, especially when it comes time to convey horror or revulsion.The in-depth descriptions of the main character's outfits got a bit old. The use of acronyms made the book feel too much like a role playing game at times, and I found that really distracting. Words like \\"Null\\" also felt like they came from a game, especially in contrast to the many Gaelic rooted words in the novel, like \\"sidhe-seer\\". The characters were a little on the Buffy side of things, as were some of the situations the main character finds herself in.In other words, there were a lot of things I found wanting in this novel, but that said, I did tear through it, and I did enjoy myself.Would I recommend this to my hard-core fantasy/sci-fi friends, who like Tim Powers and Julian May? Probably not. Would I recommend it to my friends who are Buffy lovers? Maybe.A nice, light modern fantasy read that could have been a lot better. I give it three stars because it drew me in and I couldn't stop reading it, but it came dangerously close to two."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Well, there have been a lot of reviews on this book; and now I see why so many people said it was a cliffhanger (literally)!!! The book started off way to slow and the main character MacKayla \\"aka\\" Mac talks a lot in this book!!! And I mean a lot!!! I know I am one to talk about manicures, cute clothes & other varies stuff-but this main character took the cake. I mean sometimes I had to put the book down and just pray that the next chapter got better.So, the plot is very much vengeance with a capital \\"V\\"; she wants to catch the person responsible for her sister's (Alaine) death. Her sister decided to study aboard in Dublin, Ireland; this is where Alaine discovers that her and her sister MacKayla are not entirely human. They are both what is called a null, a null is a side-seer with powers to freeze a Fae with the touch of his or her hand (this is stated in the book). But before Alaine was killed she left a message to her sister, she wanted MacKayla to find the Sinsar Dubh before it falls into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, her sister dies but not before she can leave one last clue. When Mac finds the clue and sees all the danger the human world is in, she is determined to put a stop to the war. But, the war has just begun between the two courts called Seelie & the Unseelie. The obstacles she has to overcome doesn't have to be done alone, she has Barron. Or does she? Plus, she doesn't know what he is yet nor will she ever!?! She half trusts this handsome, superpower, bookstore owner!!! But he has saved her life, and they have worked together to acquire some Hollows need to read the Sinsar Dubh. As soon as the book takes off it ends and when I say it ends, well you will probably be just as disappointed as I was. I can't say that this book doesn't have potential because it does; I just hope the next one picks up full force!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm an avid reader and have read other books from Mrs. Moning and have liked them. This one however... I kept expecting it to get better but it never did. I have always finished each book that I have started until I got to this one. I couldn't make my self get to the end. Maybe it's just me but I just couldn't bring myself to like it even a little."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was okay - if I could I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. I've never read this author but heard she's really good, so I was a little disappointed.Mac takes some getting used to. Though she lacked maturity, it didn't bother me as much as other reviewers. I think she behaved as I'd expect a 22 year-old who has lived her life in a sheltered little bubble shielded from the world's uglines to behave. What annoyed me about her was her sugary sweet, cuteness and pink obsessed personality. Towards the end it was toned down somewhat.I liked Barrons, despite him being your basic mysteriously sexy alpha male character. The author keeps you on your toes about him, wondering if he's good or bad.The Fae prince, I did have an issue with, but I don't think it's his fault. Mac is never depicted as a very sexual character, in fact quite the opposite, as somewhat innocent and cutesy, so her abrupt sexualization at the hands of the \\"death by sex fae\\" was uncomfortable. Perhaps the author meant it to be shocking, to show the brutality of the Fae, but I had a big problem with it.My major problem with the book is that nothing gets resolved. You never find out who or what Barrons is, Mac resolves none of her issues (who she is, who killed her sister, etc...) - it's as if the book was cut off mid-story. I understand this is the first in a series, but this was ALL set-up and no closure. Some of the major conflicts, and I guess potential romance elements, were introduced, as was the world the characters inhabit, and then the book ended. It felt unsatisfying.But, by now I think 3 or 4 other books are released, so it may be worth it if the second book picks up the pace, since the characters and the conflicts they face are interesting and this is a quick read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It took me a while to get used to the writer's style used in this series, but once I got used to it, I have enjoyed reading the series. The problem is the first book only presents the situation, so you want to read book 2 to see how it gets solved. Book 2, fun read, but it still slowly showing you what is going on, and leaves you with more questions, so of course you are now hooked, and need to go to book 3.I just finished book 3, and I have to say, had I read the reviews, I would have NOT read book 3 until I had book 4 AND 5 in my hands. Book 3, leaves the heroine in a VERY bad spot. I am waiting to read book 4 from the library. I will NOT buy it, because according to reviews for book 4, it has another messy ending.It would probably be wiser for me to just wait for book 5, to avoid having to read another book that will leave Mac in troubles, but I really want to get the bad taste of book 3 out of my mouth, so I will have to bite the bait and hope 1) book 4 ending is not as awful as book 3's ending, and 2) book 5 gets publish soon.Do yourself a favor and do not start the series until you have the 5 book available for reading."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was just \\"okay\\" to me. I found myself skipping paragraphs to get to things that mattered. Immediately after I finished this book I read Bloodfever and I was glad that it hooked me enough to want to read the rest of the series. I am now reading Dreamfever and can only say that if you can muster through Darkfever you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"They give you the first book and then drag it out for several books in the series--never coming to an end. I've read the first three, which could easily be combined into one book (the author spends about 1/4th of each book explaining plot and character development from the previous books).Kindle should smoosh them together for one low price. Although I want to know what happens in the last two books, I don't want to spend my $ on two more books that should be one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I would unread this book if I could. I have never read a book that took so long to say so little as this one did. As other reviewers have said the book just ends, not having answered any of the more important questions. In frustration at the thought of buying/reading another subpar book just to get some answers I read the fan chats. After discovering that answers are still not given by book 4, and that many are hoping the next release will have answers, I am going to pass on this series.Mac doesn't have the sense to ask or investigate some things that should concern her, but her nails will be perfectly polished at all times. Even when she breaks her arm she insists on having painted nails, and you will know exactly what color they are painted everytime. Her actions are a blur to her in a fight, but she knows when she breaks a nail.There is also no romance in this book. Her interaction with V'lane is comical...death by sex? Don't worry she resists, although those scenes are the worst in the book. As they carry on a normal conversation he is barely even aware of her stripping and really doesn't seem to care that she is. She stands out in the street repeatedly lifting her shirt and flashing people, unaware of what she is doing at first, but redressing by thinking of her dead sister. This repeats over and over through her interactions with him with her skirt, panties, bra and bracelet. Barrons is no better. He essentially laughs at her and picks on her until he sees potential in her that makes her suddenly worth his while. Even then he barely seems to like her. I can't blame his character. She isn't very likeable."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While I have greatly enjoyed Moning's highlander novels, Darkfever is the promise of an amazing world of fantasy, magical adventures and dark intrigues to come!It is unlike the predictable light-hearted highland romance tales. This book will satisfy the most sophisticated of paranormal/sci-fi reader palettes.I'm so excited for the new and amazing direction Karen Marie is taking. It's a refreshing departure from the predictable/cookie-cutter romance novels!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read all of Karen Marie Moning Highlander books which I loved. I assumed I would love this one also. I was so wrong. I have never read a book like this its almost like watching a movie for 2 hours and at the end its \\"to be continued\\"... If I didnt have to wait mths maybe even a year for the continuing story it wouldnt be so bad but the next one will be \\"to be continued\\" also:("},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have loved all of her other books but this one was very disappointing. I wouldn't waste my money on it if I were to do it over."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I felt ripped-off after reading the last page of the book from her series where the author is hawking her web-site GIFT STORE to purchase t-shirts and coffee mugs. YEP the true colors shining through are greed. All this author wants is to split up what could have been ONE awesome book into 5 different parts so she can make more money.Yes, the first book in the series was free on kindle....but that's where they hook you in. At the end of the first book, I felt there should be SOME resolution and that the story should tell more about the characters. WRONG....it feels like each book is just a reincarnation of the same theme.First book was free, second book FIVE bucks, third book SIX plus bucks, and the fourth book was TEN bucks...minus a penny. The last book in the series doesn't come out until 2011. I feel utterly ripped off. I feel like I wasted my time and I wish I'd never read the first book. I'll never pay for another book from this author again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I guess this book just isnt up my alley, as I could not even get past the prologue. Perhaps if i had given it more of a chance, who knows what I would have thought, but going further just felt like it would be a painful endeavor.By far not the best free of the downloads available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The cover is a bit deceiving, and was expecting the usual format. But to my surprise the different content was good stuff! It was suspenseful, riveting, fun, sexy, and I am looking so forward to Darkfever II. I enjoy paranormal books and Karen has a great knack for this subject. Her imagination is fun, and her characters are some of the best I have read. All of her books are quick page turners. I will buy anything she dreams up and puts out because so far I have never been disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Finally..!! Something a bit different from Karen Moning and it was excellent. Plus I like the fact that she's explaining things slowly and didn't try to jam everything in swiftly since Fantasy/Paranormal books need a tremendous amount of disbelief suspension as it is. I can't wait for books 2 - 5."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Yes, I'll admit it: I was stalling on buying this book ever since I heard it was not a romance at all. I suppose I could forget the highlanders for a while, they were sort of getting redundant...ok, I'm lying here...but I finally broke down, needing my KMM fix after so long, and bought Darkfever. It had me instantly intrigued and I turned pages until I couldn't keep my eyes open only to reach for the book again come morning. Our beloved author has embarked on a delightfully interesting new series with great characters and a clever and intricate plotline. The first person tone of the book took some getting used to as this is not KMM's typical writing style, but she has proven that she is a wonderful author no matter how she tells her tale. Now the long wait until the next installment comes out..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Alright so the newest book by Karen Marie Moning isn't exactly part of her Highlander series but it runs intertwined with it. And it's not exactly a romance...yet atleast. And to be honest I almost stopped reading in the first chapter out of disappointment, but I'm so glad I continued! This book is very interesting even though it does jar us from our intended and beloved stories of the hunky and bedeviled highlander druids.Written very beautifully, this story is of a girl from small town Georgis who doesn't realize that she and her sister are sidhe-seers. If you've read the highlander series than you know that these are people who can actually see fairies and aren't affected as much by their magic. Mac, our erstwhile heroine, has her nice bland-but-cozy world detsroyed when her sister is murdered on the streets of Dublin, Ireland. She runs off to Dublin to help the police track her sisters killer, even though it seems hopeless. What she finds is a city being eaten alive by the dark fae, the ability to see creatures she never even believed in her wildest dreams actually existed, the fact that she's a null and kind of a metal detector for fairy objects, and a safehaven in the most unusual place- the bookstore of the very excentric, gorgeouse , and equally arogantly frustrating Jericho Barrons. Jericho just happens to also be a sidhe-seer ( the only male I've heard of being one in the series)and is after the dark book wich has become lost. If their is any hope of saving Dublin than the two have to stick together.I think this new series, while not exactly what any of us were expecting, definitely has possibilities. Tiny sparks already shoot off between Mac and Jericho and I'm interested to see what happens. I do believe it would be better not to drag this series out though and get the next book on the shelves in the next few months."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was hesitant to buy this book based on the Amazon postings. Many readers complained it was not like Moning's other books, and I agree. It is MORE!! This is no simple story. It is intense, dark, and non-stop. I can't wait to see what happens next and will buy Blood Fever the day it goes on sale."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning has done it again. This is a really great book, hard to put down. I read it in 2 days. Can't wait for the next sequel."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Karen Marie Moning books! I bought this book like everyone else with preconceived ideas...and no it's not exactly a romance but the storyline which to me is most important painted a picture of a world her other books danced around. If your impatient this isn't for you, but if you can wait I truly think this series will be worth it. This book pulled me in and didn't let go. I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have never, ever ripped a book in two... until this book.I always enjoyed this author's work and was beyond disappointed at the end of DARKFEVER. Granted, I think part of the blame lies with the publishers who neglected to point out that this book is the first in a five book series (In that vein, Ms. Moning should take a page from Tolkien and Rowling and actually wrap each book up and not leave so many open ends simply because she intends to drag the story out into 5 moneymakers). Also, they masqueraded it as romance, which it isn't. It's a paranormal thriller. If Ms. Moning is switching over to a different genre, then her publishers need to list her books correctly and refrain from conning her romance readers into purchasing books they won't like and can't return for a full refund. I enjoy scifi, fantasy, non-fiction, psychology and philosophy books. I read romance for its brain candy appeal. Thriller bores me to tears. Rarely, if ever, are the heroines or heroes in any real danger-- they survive to the end. If this book had been listed in the correct genre, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money.This was the most obnoxious, overbearing, redundant narrative style I've ever had the misfortune to read. If I read one more time how important it was to the heroine to be cute and decked out in pastels, I'd throw up in my own mouth. Also, the action scene at the end is so light on action and details as to be laughable. Maybe Ms. Moning will build into a better thriller author, but she fell far short with this book. I resent that I had to waste my money to discover that romance is her better genre and that DARKFEVER isn't a romance novel."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I hate this book beyond belief. The book lacks a little thing called substance. I wanted to just strangle the main character Mac. She was a little defenseless Barbie stereotype, whose delicate southern female sensibilities were hurt when somebody so much as cursed! She cant lift a finger to defend herself, and would rather slouch off her parents with a part time job, work on her tan, then do ANYTHING. It had immense potential when it came to plot but the characters made it unenjoyable. Jericho was a horrible character who did nothing but yell, bruise, and order Mac around. None of the characters are well written and have as much substance as a toilet brush, not to mention that Mac is the most worthless excuse for a heroin in any book I have read so far. Don't wast your money on this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I thought this story was very incomplete...I also did not like the 1st person voice. Not comparable to previous books. I won't buy a hardcover book from this author again. I'll also wait to read the viewpoints from other readers before I spend money."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Moning has provided me with first-rate Scottish time-travel romance reading in the past, so I eagerly picked up her latest book. From the steamy cover art, I assumed it was part of the same series as her last book, The Spell of the Highlander. My bad. I was disappointed to find no, that is, none at all, sex in this book. I could imagine there might be some sex in the sequels, but don't come to Darkfever expecting bedroom scenes. The only bedroom scenes show the protagonist sleeping with the lights on for fear of the things that go bump in the night.Darkfever begins a new series that uses the same body of legend as the Highlander series, but which, at least this first book, takes place in Ireland, not Scotland. The main character is a young blonde southern slacker named MacKayla who is more concerned about her hue of pink nail polish than current or historical events. Mac's sister is violently murdered while on a semester abroad in Dublin. Belatedly, Mac hears her sister's last voice mail message and launches herself off to Dublin to uncover her sister's murderer. With as little experience of the world as Mac has, this is bound to get her in over her head fast. In the world of the Fae, ignorance can get an ignorant Sidhe-seer killed fast.Without spoilers, Mac's quest is not completed in this book; she has a hard time telling friend from foe, and ally from adversary. Her character development is interesting to watch as she learns more about her personal history and her inner strengths. But truthfully, I miss the sex."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so disappointed. The main charactor Mac is so annoying and self-absorbed, such a lazy and shallow stupid 22 years old girl which the crap won't stop from her. I really wish I could get my money back, such a waist of everything."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't get the cult following for this series. The heroine was TSTL most of the time and I can't see why Baron even liked her. I couldn't stand her. I won't be continuing the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I confess that I read this book because I fell in love with The Highland Series. I knew this was going to be different because the author warned us. That said, the main character was so juvenile that I found her unbelievable and I had trouble finishing the book~~and I missed not having any romance in the story. I will read the next installment and if the storyline does not improve, I will not read another."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so impressed with this book and was hooked after the first couple pages. I really loved the main characters. Jericho Barrons is hawt! Mac is really loveable and it's fun to watch her character develop. Even though this more urban fantasy than romance(I think it will turn into a romance) the tension and possibilities for romance are there. Sometimes the anticipation is better than the real thing. And there is the mystery of what Jericho really is. Such a mysterious man! While Mac is telling her story in the middle of crazy events, she mentions things like 'later on I would find out that things aren't exactly as they seem....' (not an exact quote but you get my drift) and it really creates such an anticipation for what is going to happen and what you will learn later on. This is a great start to a series and I can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can honestly say a book like this is a first for me. I'm traditionally a \\"romance\\" type of gal. While this book certainly has it's share of tiny tidbits of chemistry between the leads, it really has very little romance in it (so far:).This is urban fantasy at it's finest. The world building in Darkfever is so intense and mesmerizing, that it sucks you right in. You are so immersed in this new world, that time suspends, pages fly by, and before you know it, you are left at the door of a cliffhanger ending that will have you reaching for the next book. I feel for those of you who had to wait between installments:)I really enjoyed the first person narrative. Although at times Mac bothered me, I felt like I knew her. Her honesty and tenacity to find justice and vengeance for her sister's murder was admirable. Her immaturity in the beginning of the book gradually fades away as she morphs into almost a completely different person. The shallow, spoiled, and self-centered Mac slowly gives way to a tougher and more likable Mac. Her courage began to win me over as the discovery of her true self leads to horrors that defy imagination.Jericho Barrons is very intriguing. Who is he? What is he? What are his motives? What are his feelings for Mac? Just when I thought I had him pegged as a ruthless, no holds barred type of hero, KMM has him painting Mac's toenails in the end!!! These types of contradictions in Barron's true nature and self have me sitting on the edge of my seat. I need to know more about this man!I've already started Bloodfever and won't stop this series until it's over! This is great reading!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Synopsis: Mackayla Lane is a typical 20-something girl. She lives in the small town of Ashford, Georgia, with her parents. She works part time as a bartender and enjoys working on her tan and spending time with her family. But Mackayla's world is changed forever when her elder sister, Alina, who is studying abroad in Dublin, is murdered. The Lane family is stunned and shaken by the experience. More troubling is the fact that the Dublin police have no clues about Alina's murderer. Mackayla refuses to see her sister's death go unsolved, so she goes to Dublin herself in the hopes of lighting a fire under the investigators or possibly turning up new evidence herself.Alina's murder takes on an entirely new and sinister view when Mackayla finally listens to her voicemail and discovers that Alina left her a desperate and puzzling message several hours before she was murdered. Mackayla plays the message for investigators but gets nowhere. When she asks a local bookseller about a Gaelic word Alina mentioned in the voicemail, Mackayla is told to go back to Georgia and forget she ever heard the word. Unwilling to take no for an answer, Mackayla continues to dig, but what she discovers terrifies her. Mackayla is a sidhe seer. She can see faeries.Desperate for help and not understanding how she sees what she sees and if her ability has something to do with Alina's death, Mackayla returns to the bookseller, Jericho Barrons, for help. Uncertain if Barrons is using her or helping her, Mackayla has no one else to trust in learning about being a sidhe seer or the death of her sister.Review: I tend to avoid books that generate an insane amount of hype. Sometimes, I should have stuck to my instincts (Twilight. I just don't get those books). Other times, my instincts were totally wrong (Harry Potter, The Hunger Games) and I am glad I went against them. Darkfever is another example of me being glad I went against my instincts.I almost don't even know where to start with this review. This story was complicated (in a good way).Mackayla is a great character. I enjoyed her Southern charm, which wasn't over-the-top, thankfully. Despite her supernatural powers, she was really normal. She was a normal girl trying to get justice for her sister. I enjoyed Mackayla as a whole.Moning creates an interesting paranormal world. I like the power with which she imbued Mackayla. I really enjoyed her faery structure and hierarchy. Moning created a tantalizing world for her story to operate within.The plot was quickly paced and kept me interested and entertained.I checked this book out from the library, because I was skeptical. I ended up liking it so much I went out and bought the entire series, including this book.I would like to point out that most booksellers have this series categorized as \\"romance.\\" It is definitely not romance. It is hard core Urban Fantasy with some racy sexual scenes. If the \\"romance\\" label has kept you from this book, don't let it.Overall, I enjoyed this book immensely and cannot wait to read the next installment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I had a blast submerging myself in this world! I may have to re-read the entire series as I already miss all of the characters! Well done indeed!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm a voracious reader, and it's not often that I reread a series. I think the last time I did so was about 20 years ago, with Dorothy Dunnett's Francis of Lymond series. But I finished the last book a couple of weeks ago, and tonight I started over with Book 1 on my Kindle. That's high praise. But it's not an easy read.This is an impressive series not just for the finesse that Moning uses in creating her spectacular alter-world, but also for the splendid transformation of MacKayla from a shallow, over-protected girl-child into a gritty, disillusioned fatalist, and finally into a whole and real woman.And, of course, there's the man in her life. Definitely a fine reason to grow up."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning's Fever series can usually be found on the romance shelves, but having just finished reading the first installment, \\"Darkfever,\\" I'm more inclined to classify it as urban fantasy. While there are a couple of men foreshadowed as possible love interests for the heroine, and while there is some sexual content (most stemming from the mind-control powers possessed by some of the fae), the primary focus is on a murder mystery and on the magical goings-on in Moning's Dublin. The series also follows urban fantasy tropes in another significant way: it is written in first person and follows one heroine, Mackayla (\\"Mac\\") Lane, throughout its five books rather than featuring a different heroine and hero in each volume.Mac is normal. Painfully so. She's smart but unambitious, content to while away her days painting her nails and getting a tan. That is, until the day she learns her beloved sister has been murdered in Dublin. The police and her parents seem content to chalk it up to random violence, but Mac isn't satisfied with that, and goes to Dublin to do some investigating of her own. There, she learns that her sister was mixed up in the dangerous world of the fae. She also meets the enigmatic Byronic bookstore owner Jericho Barrons, who warns her that she will share her sister's fate if she doesn't learn the ropes quickly.Making Mac ubernormal was a brilliant decision on Moning's part. Mac is probably more \\"mainstream\\" than most of Darkfever's readers; if a fantasy fan found herself in this situation, she'd at least have \\"genre savvy\\" to help her navigate the dangers. Mac doesn't. She's suddenly thrust into a world full of horrible creatures she never even imagined. She's scared witless. Because we see through Mac's eyes, we're scared too. And the fact that she's willing to stand up to the fae, even though she knows she's a pampered Yorkie snarling at wolves, makes her easy to admire. (I love some of the more seasoned, tough heroines too, but I worry less about whether they'll make it out in one piece, which decreases the tension in the story somewhat.)And there's plenty to be scared of. Moning's fae are terrifying, both the hideous monsters and the beautiful creatures whose monstrousness lurks under the surface. For me the most chilling element is the Dark Zone: taken over by devouring shadow creatures, this part of the city is simply forgotten by the human inhabitants. This works into the plot in ways that sent shivers down my spine.Moning's prose is transparent; it stays out of the way of the story and propels the reader quickly through the plot. You probably won't stop reading to gawk at a stunningly poetic turn of phrase, but neither will you trip over any awkwardnesses.Most importantly, if you're anything like me, you'll reach the end and think \\"MUST. HAVE. BOOK. TWO. NOW.\\" \\"Darkfever\\" is compulsively readable and leaves readers salivating for the next installment,Bloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Moning has a rare and perfect gift--the ability to transport me to other worlds and captivate me with every book she writes. In this noisy, hectic world we all live in, I find it very hard to totally lose myself in a book. It takes a special author to guide me on such a mesmerizing journey, and Karen is on a shortlist of authors who always--ALWAYS--make me lose myself in her world. DARKFEVER is no exception. Suspenseful, sensual, and immediate, she weaves her famililar magic in this series launch book, making me want to read more (and stamp my feet and pout until I can get it in my eager hands!)If you're a fan of Karen Moning--or even if you've never read her other books--this new book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a very interesting, promising, and intriquing start to a new series. The new series will use many of the same characters and mythology from her Highlander series - the Faes: UnSeelie, Queen, King, etc. However it is darker, and none of the Druid characters from the Highland Series return (no Adam Black).As fasinating as it is, the problem I have with this first book is the unbelievably dumb protagonist. She's blond, and described with 'Barbie-doll' looks on numerous occassions. She grew up in rural Georgia, and acts like she's never been anywhere once she gets to Dublin (which she has not). The most irritating thing about her is her unwillingness to believe any of the warnings she gets, nor any of the dark visions that she has - even when she has them on numerous occasions. Her steadfast refusal to believe, coupled with the way the story is written - in first person, with the 'inside your head' nature of that way of writing, lead the reader to slap their foreheads with the palms of their hands and shout in frustration. Now I know what they mean when they say you have a character who is Too Stupid to Live. The problem in this book is that she's Too Stupid to Live - on every single page of the book, rather than just in a single scene or two. You want to slap her, or shout 'hello' when she can't figure things out.In her defense I'll say that she's supposed to be 22 and sheltered. But it is really hard to take. I have the feeling that the author thought she would be funny - with her endless descriptions of what she is wearing, her fingernail polish, and/or what people look like. But I found it almost unbearably irritating, and detracted from what would otherwise be a fascinating addition to fantasy lore about the Sidhe (Irish for 'elves' - of the Tolkeinsq variety).What makes the book bearable is the mysterious character Jericho Barrons. He is a joy to read, and steals every scene he is in. If Adam Black were the Capt. Kirk of Ms Moning's writings, Jerrico Barrons is her Mr. Spock - clever, logical, emotionless, poised. (OK, he's not strictly emotionless, just tries real hard to be that way). A fascinating character. And the conciet - the world that Ms. Moning has created, is also ... fascintating. ;-)So, regrettfully, I have to recommend this book - even with everything I said about the irritating protagonist. I eagerly look forward to the rest of the series.OH - BTW - this story is not yet a romance, so those looking for paranormal romance will be disappointed. It is a pretty good straight dark fantasy, with sexual tension. And judging from the previews, the romance part might unfold downstream. This doesn't bother me, but just a warning in case you are just looking for a romance book like her Highlander series.PS #2: I happen to have listened to the audiobook and can report that it is a real pleasure. The reader does justice to all the different voices, from Mac's southern accent, to Jericho's weird mediterrianian whatever it is, to the different fae and vampires. She creates a fantastic mood for this book. She's not in the same class as the guy who does the Harry Potter books - he created about 200 voices. But she does a great job with this material. Not all audiobooks are wonderful, so I wanted to pass that along."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"WARNING: You will lose sleep once you start the series, because you won't want to stop reading until you get to the last page of the fifth and final book...but it's worth it!This is the first book of five in the Fever Series. It is by far the best series of books I've read since I finished theThe Twilight Saga Complete Collection, which got me hooked on paranormal romances. While it isn't about vampires, it has plenty of interesting paranormal creatures...all set against a richly detailed view of Dublin, Ireland. The books are part fantasy, part mystery, part thriller, with a paranormal romance thrown in to raise the stakes even higher. You won't be able to read just one...you'll have to read the entire series. Fortunately, the complete series has already been published, so you won't have to wait for the next one to come out when you're finished with this one.;^DI read all five in one week this Fall, and I can't stop thinking about the characters, creatures and the unique world the author created. I recommend you get all five as soon as you decide you're hooked, so you don't have to wait for the next one to arrive before you finish the one before. Here's a complete list of the Series in order:1.Darkfever (Fever Series, Book 1)2.Bloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)3.Faefever: The Fever Series4.Dreamfever: The Fever Series5.Shadowfever (MacKayla Lane, Book 5)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was recommended this series by a friend who really likes the Harlequin romance genre and thought this was something I would enjoy. I had very low hopes for this novel and was pleasantly surprised. In the beginning I wanted to fault the main character Mac, for her ignorance and large bouts of stupidity. However as the book progressed I realized that author was insuring her growth.Mac is a young woman of 22, who has never been out of her small southern town. She had lead a pretty sweet, naive existence of tans and being surrounded by pink. Her parents don't ask much of her and she is extremely close with her sister. That changes when she gets a call that her sister had been brutally murder in Ireland. Mac, nor her parents can seem to function and all Mac wants is revenge. She cashes out her life and goes to track down her sister killer for revenge. There she discovers a world not like her own and meets a man with secrets who helps her to stay alive. I won't give much more away except that Mac is not prepared for what she is, can do, and will be subjected to.The author is a pretty good writer, putting enough description and thought into making the novel cohesive. As I stated I hated Mac in the beginning because she had no brain. What would a pink, frilly girl be able to do against whatever mutilated her sister? She never thought things through and how she did not cruse or how shallow she was, did not work in her favor. But what should I expect of someone who has never experienced these things? Mac started to learn from her mistakes and I grew to like her more. I will admit that about 100 pages in I wanted to be through with the book but I continued reading and I am glad I did. I don't know what Barrons is or if he and Mac will end up together but he is one of the best male characters I have seen written in a while. As I am writing this I have already began on the second book and plan to continue the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked this book up randomly at the bookstore, because it sounded interesting and different. I had finished the book within 48 hours and made a special trip to the bookstore to get the second book. (Followed by the other three.)The book is amazing. Ms. Lane starts out as a simple girl who is looking for answers. Her story draws you in and before you know it your at the end of the book.The book doesn't have any actual sex scenes in it, but their are some scenes that are close.The author draws off of old legends and expands on some. This review is kinda short, mainly because I don't want to give spoilers for the next four books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"But I got through it, took a break, and then read book 2... after book 2 the series got much better."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book had so much potential to be great. The world she has created is so interesting but there's hardly no action. Mac has all these advantages to kill the fae but its rarely acted upon. The actual story I felt like someone was going blah, blah, blah. I was disappointed but like I said it has potential to become a good series so I'll read the next book and see how it goes."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As an urban fantasy fae-world epic, this is a quenching victory. But outside of the narrow confines of MacKayla's first-person POV, it's also a bit limited.The narration is long-winded and the romance is non-existent. I repeat. This is not a romance. MacKayla's male counterpart, Barrons, is cold, dizzying, and standoffish, and since you don't get to experience his viewpoint, you don't get to know him at all.MacKayla, on the other hand, is an in-your-face exhale of nerve and verve. While you might grow weary of her garrulous internal monologue, you'll be immediately charmed by her actions as you free fall into another world. The scenes involving the life-sucking Unseelie creatures and the forgotten neighborhood are nothing short of magical. The best part? When confronted with these otherworld nightmares, she doesn't cry in her Jimmy Choos and wait for a man to save her. She has no man. Just a dead sister, a cyptic voicemail, and a mission that might echo the pedestrian theme: Save the World.So, while this is not a romance, it's a tale of heroes: MacKayla and Barrons bonded together by a common goal. It's this very volatile alliance that sinks in teeth and holds you to the pages. Is Barrons who he says he is? Can he be trusted? And romance addicts will be panting to know: Will something carnal and earthly ignite between them? How long will Ms Moning make you wait for it? You'll pick up the next book to find out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My sister loaned me this book and said I would love it. However what she didn't tell me was it was a series!!! I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down! All the deadly immortals and secrets, not knowing who to trust!

I had to order the whole series the next day because I couldn't wait to find out what happened."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm always weary of fantasy novels. Usually they are unbelievable or poorly written. I really loved this book. Mac Lane is a spoiled, shallow girl in need of having her eyes opened to the world.

Really good character and plot development and the chemistry between Mac and Barrons is off the charts!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"How on earth has it taken me so long to read this book?!?! I'm officially hooked, I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was really suprised when I met MacKayla Lane, Mac for friends.She a southern belle/bimbo with long blond hair, always dresses in pink and pastels, with perfect manicures matching her outfits.

And the Fae are not cute little pink creatures with fluttering wings...It took me a bit to warm up to Mac but by the end of the book I really liked her. Barrons, hmm, not sure what to think of him yet... I don't really trust him, he keeps way too many secrets. But he'll protect Mac even if it's only cause she's useful to him, although I'm starting to think it's more than that.And V'lane, the supergorgeous Seelie Prince, or the Sex-by-Death Fae as Mac calls him... I really don't know what to think of him. I definitely want to see more of him in the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I enjoyed the fast pace of this fantasy adventure and will certainly continue reading the Fever Series. The story develops with lots of twists and turns."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I finished this book in a few hours. If you're looking for a stand-alone novel with depth, don't come here. If you want an urban fantasy frolic with an interesting world and frustrating but likeable heroine, give this a try. The main character (Mac) has a tendency to come off ditzy and airheaded but shows surprising moments of strength (the author's note at the end helped me understand a bit better). Her love interest is cold, hard, and barely discernible as her love interest at all.Ms. Moning creates an interesting picture of the far, and some cool abilities for Mac, but the world isn't well-developed or deep. Like I said, this is not a stand-alone novel. Hopefully things broaden in the next few novels. For once, the main character isn't a PI/police type but just a regular girl. She may not be the strongest or the smartest but she's forceful, real, and flawed. You can't help but empathize with her throughout the book.The sexual tension between her and Barrons could be cut with a knife. They have a strange relationship and Ms. Moning definitely made the reader want more of them. It will be interesting to see where she takes things. Giving this 4 stars because I think the series has a lot of potential (though nothing can live up to the Hollows series) and I'll be immediately reading the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book and its sequel Bloodfever!

Her world is turned upside down when she learns of the death of sister, Alina, in Ireland where she had been studying. With no other clue to go on apart from a voicemail on her cellphone left by Alina, she packs her bags and heads for Dublin in search of answers to the mystery surrounding her sister's death and murder. In the cryptic message in the voicemail, Alina mentions the quest of the sinsar dubh. Only problem is what is the sinsar dubh and what has it go to do with the death of Alina?When Mackayla arrives in Dublin all sorts of strange things start to happen. She sees things which are not real. At first she does not know that she is a sidhe seer, a person who can see past fae magic. And then she discovers that she has further powers which can lead her to the much sought after Sinsar Dubh. During her stay in Dublin, she meets Jericho Barrons, a wealthy bookstore owner who too can see past fae magic. Jericho takes Mackayla under his wings and together they do battle against the evils of Dublin.Other colorful characters introduced in this book include V'lane, the death-by-sex fae, the gray man and the many-mouthed-thing.This is the first book in a series of five. After finishing reading this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next installment, Bloodfever. Karen Marie Moning has created another World with her stories of the Fae and you can almost believe that they exist on the streets of Dublin. This book a is departure from her previous books in that it is much darker and there is no romance or sex scenes. Although there is a hint that there might be in future books. I highly recommend this book and make sure you have Bloodfever ready to read once you have finished this one.

I'll be anxious to read many more books by this author!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't believe I ignored this book when it first came out. Shame on me!I've read all of Moning's Highlander books, so when she came out with this new series that wasn't Highlander...well... I wasn't all that interested. I'm usually turned off by books written in first person but a friend recommended it, so I finally picked it up.I'm so glad I did! I applaude the author for breaking the rules and being brave enough to plunge us into a story that is not quite a romance. Mac's story is engaging and told with such fluidity, I envy Moning's storytelling skills.From the very first page, I was engaged and immersed. Mac is a great character right from the start and you see her growth from the the beginning to the end. She's spoiled and naive, not yet aware of the threats surrounding her in the dark world of Dublin.And the moment Jericho Barrons steps onto the page, the book is on fire. He's strong and sexy, refusing to put up with Mac's immaturity and ignorance of what she really is.I loved this book. I love the characters. If you're looking for a dark urban fantasy that's not quite a romance - pick this up. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Great book, but not for the devoted romance reader. You must love fantasy and accept the darker side of people. Wonderful read and I will definitely continue with this series!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first started reading Darkfever I thought to myself \\"Oh great, a fantasy book\\". I had to check the spine and it said \\"romance\\". Well, I do not normally read fantasy or romance books. However I decided to stick it out with this book. Maybe because it is set in Ireland and I am Irish. I decided early on that Mac was pretty funny and came to think of her as the \\"ditzy blonde\\"--(forgetting that I dye my own hair blonde). She made me laugh and I truly enjoyed her character. I could see where she would be maturing as the series ran on. As far as the \\"Fae\\" go, I do have to say that being Irish, I know that not all fairies are beautiful and sweet. There are some pretty nasty ones. My sister has a book about fairies and you should see some of the drawings by people who claim to have actually seen these creatures. As I read the book I began to believe in the plot more. I began to believe in this other \\"world\\". I like to think of myself as being a logical and reasonable person. Because of that I do not look at the world as if it were all in black and white. There are things we have no understanding of and when other people try to tell us of these things we usually shrug them off as being \\"ridiculous\\". Because of her abilit y to provide detail I was able to understand this hierarchy of the Fae. I am still a little confused about how the supposed \\"good\\" ones can still be bad and vice versa. That will come with further reading. I do believe in vampires (again this is not based on the Ann Rice vampire craze but on deliberate, logical research on my part for many years) and it was rather sad to think the vampire in this book came to his end. However once again, there is good and there is bad. Or good and evil. I believe that Ms. Moning is opening up an interesting door for us and I am thrilled to be entering. By the way, I could not remember the name of the book or the authors name and I really wanted to order the next book in the series. I tore my whole house apart looking for it and spent at least 3 hours on Amazon doing advanced searches for it. I finally found the book. I would suggest Amazon put in a few more choice words for their books. I looked under -- fairies, evil, suspense, romance, ireland, irish, sister, dead sister, vampire, shadows, night, and about 10 other words. I was desperate. I am so glad I finally found it and I can read it during Christmas break (in between taking my kids to the movies, making cookies, wrapping gifts, watching \\"guy\\" shows, and a million other things wifes and moms have to do for Christmas) Ms. Moning you are an excellent writer. My husband who hates to read would give you highest ratings. He says that he likes the way I write because it is as if I am talking to the reader. You have that gift. I was totally lost in your book and sometimes even ignored the phone because I did not want to quit reading!! Thank you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have just started reading books of this genre. I couldn't put the book down.

I totally recommend this series . an awesome adventure !"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Books4Reviews!)22-year-old MacKayla just had the worse experience of her life - her sister was murdered and she had to go and identify her mangled body. But now the police over in Dublin want to put the case on a back-burner because they have no leads, and Mac can't bear to let that happen.Quitting her job and taking every penny she has with her, Mac leaves her grieving parents and travels to Dublin where her sister was studying, intent on finding her sister's killer. What she doesn't expect though is the strange things that begin happening to her when she begins making enquires about something her sister said she was looking for in her last ever message to her - the Sinsar Dubh.Suddenly pulled into a world where the fae are a strange and menacing reality, Mac must try and solve her sister's murder, whilst at the same time preventing her own. What was it that Alina was trying to tell her though? And will she fall into the same trap?I enjoyed this book, although considering that it was set in Dublin, I didn't get much of an Irish vibe from the scene setting. I've been to Dublin and I can't say that the places that Mac visited reminded me of Ireland at all, and although she commented on people using the word \`Craic' (pronounced \`crack' and meaning fun) she didn't comment on the fact that Irish people also like to say \`that's grand' and \`t'anks a million', so the whole Irish thing was kind of lacking.Also, Mac commented on areas of the city that she called \`dark spots', abandoned areas where shades (lowest caste of unseelie fae) prey on humans and eat them! Mac says that these areas have been forgotten, and that they are not even on current maps! How bizarre is that? How can nobody notice a huge great chunk of space in a city like Dublin where nobody ever ventures? Bit odd.Anyway, other than the Irish thing, and the dark zones thing, I liked the characters, I liked the storyline, it was a bit dull in places, but then action packed a few pages later. Mac reminded me a lot of Sookie Stackhouse, probably in part because she was southern too, but she had a lot of the same ideals about clothing and food and stuff, she also ended up dealing with supernaturals too!This book did shock me in places though, mainly because it ran along in a very YA, PG13 sort of way, and then suddenly, some random fairy turns up and she starts talking about orgasms and touching herself inappropriately! It's not that I'm against sex in books, in fact quite the opposite, I love the black dagger brotherhood books, and I even enjoyed the first book in the fifty shades trilogy, but this was just so sudden, and totally out of the blue that I was just a bit stunned!Anyway, I did enjoy this book, and I'm interested to see where the rest of the series goes.7.5 out of 10."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Star stats:Jaded Adult: 3 1/2 to 4 StarsForever Young: 5 StarsFirst off, I loved the cover art to Dark Fever! Karen Marie Moning nailed it. Even before reading I was intrigued. A lone female standing in the center of a cobblestone circle surrounded by a mysterious fog mist. From 6:30 to 7:30 both am and pm, I was glued to pages trying to take as much in as possible.Sometimes you have to get the ending out first because that is what keeps you inclined to reading. How I love Moning old school appeal to writing when she left us with the classic cliff hanger. Many authors today give the readers of today more and more, epic type stories, because that is what we demand. So very few are willing to take the old school stand and the epic tale build. I for one salute Moning for the classic cliff hanger and can't wait to dive into book 2 Blood Fever of this series.Mac's life is great. She has the good friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so just like mine. In other words, she could be me or any other woman. When Mac's sister is murdered, leaving a message on her cell. Mac ventures to Ireland to light a fire under the Dublin britches to find her sister murder or she will not stop until she does.Along the journey Moning trusted Mac in a realm where she can't tell good from evil?? Sounds just like everyday life, right? Not exactly. Mac learns that she has a gift that allows her to see things that others can't.In my opinion you have two types of young adult books. You have the ones that are written by middle age people who have become jaded by life to remember what it was really like to be seventeen or twenty-two. Then you have ones written by people who for one reason or another can recall that being twenty is just as confusing as being eighteen. Moning falls in the later, able to grab hold of that teenage awkwardness that doesn't seem to pass until your mid-twenties and land it smack dab on her characters.Being in my mid-thirties, I find Morning characters a little on the immature side. But as my daughter pointed out, I must be much too old to remember what it's like to be young.In a way she is correct, not that I am too old, but I have been jaded by my life experiences and just expect more maturity out of people and the characters I read. All that aside I did enjoy the book. And can't wait to jump into book two to see what happens between Mac and Barron."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"great book. very entertaining and has an original story, which unfortunately you dont see to often. all and all this is a great great series!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I ordered this book, Dark Fever by Karen Marie Moning to replace a copy I'd loaned out.

(Karen Marie Moning) does an excellent job at pulling the reader into her world. She does this in all of her novels, but for me it was especially good in this novel because I went into it expecting not to like it. In Darkfever, KMM is building a world for us....but she's not just describing a complete fantasy world. She first, builds our images and understandings of Dublin and the Temple Bar district. I have never been to Dublin, but after reading this book, I sure as heck felt I had! Then, once she has you convinced that you \\"know\\" Dublin, she sort of slices it open and exposes this other world that exists right over/on/between/among the Dublin that we \\"know\\".I'm not sure what it really was about this series but it really drew me in and became one of my favorite series. K.M.M. has become one of my favorite authors. She began as a strictly romance author with her Highlander series and then ventured more into the urban fantasy genre with the Fever series. I finished Darkfever and immediately downloaded the next four books in the series....then pre-ordered book five!I'm not really sure that I would consider the Fever series as romance but it does definitely get \\"rated R\\" in a few places so be forewarned if you don't like that kind of stuff. If you can handle a little bit of romance/ludeness then I definitely recommend this book and the entire series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I hadn't read this author before, and was tempted by this, the first in a series, as a free Kindle download. The plot moves along quickly, with plenty of nail biting suspense, but the author also adds a lot of almost laugh out loud humor, which kept a smile on my face through much of the book, and although some of the wise sayings scattered about were a bit trite, others were worth stopping to ponder for a bit. The book doesn't really have a conclusion, and thus leads one on to the next (not for free) volume, which I am now enjoying."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane's sister, Alina, was murdered. This sends Mac, a 22 year old beautiful, blonde southern girl on a quest for justice.. or perhaps vengeance. Alina was murdered in Dublin so after a short introduction to Mac in this story we're off to Ireland and an entirely new world.Within the first day of Mac's trip she's exposed to an Unseelie - a festering ooze of a man called The Gray Man who exists to steal beauty. This, obviously, throws Mac for a loop and from there on...the excitement and adventure grows.I've always been fascinated with Fae. Both Seelie and Unseelie have been topics of interest for me when it comes to Fantasty/Urban Fantasy novels. This book is a re-read for me, but as I was reading it I was reminded of just how much fun it was. Not only do we get introduced to Seelie royalty in the form of Prince V'lane, but also the mysterious, heart-pounding owner of a bookstore on the edge of the darkness, Barrons.If you are an urban fantasy lover, these books are a must read - but a word of warning. They end on some of the worst cliff-hangers I've ever experienced. Before you start reading be sure to have all four books around you, and be prepared to wait on another cliffhanger after the fourth until Moning sees fit to put us all out of our misery."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I thought this was a great start to a series that I wanted to keep reading more of."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I found this series after reading several romance/paranormal books and was quite surprised at how quickly i was sucked in! Some question this book even being linked to romance, however I feel it was the possibility (or impossibility) of a romance that was the heart of the story. It's not a book for those of you that like the typical romance novel. It is not the focus of the story, but is an underlying factor. The author builds strong characters that you become attached to and a world that is ever changing and interesting. You wont be able to put the book down. This by far has been one of my favorite series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Fever series is simply the best. Darkfever starts it all. I am fascinated, delighted, engrossed, ecstatic, electric, enchanted, thrilled, surprised, fulfilled. Ok, running out of adjectives. Characters MacKayla Lane and Jericho Barrons are simply the most fascinating characters that I have ever read about. Even though they are both still a mystery as to what they are and what they can do, the story has gripped me and kept my mind occupied in all my quiet moments."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first bought this book it was only because it was one of the free books from kindle and it sat unread in said kindle for quite some time. I finally started it one day when I was at the gym and finished the book I was reading mid work out. At the start the lead character Mac seems really flat, but it quickly draws you in with the constant suspense and leaves you teeming with unanswered questions. If what you're looking for is a steamy hot romance this might not be your best choice but, if you are looking for a great suspenseful story rich with sexual tension this is an excellent choice. My only negative would be the cliff hanger ending but in the end that has only lead me to read the next two books in the series in record time and leave me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first started reading this story, the Characters took a while to develop but this story is so good! I fell in love with all the Characters, even the insignificant ones. The storyline is interesting enough to keep the pages turning and the cliff hangers at the end of each book leave you literally wanting more. Coming from someone who never thought she'd stray away from vampire stories, this Fae world that Karen Marie Moning creates is fun, exciting and different. I loved all the books in this series and can not wait till the release of the last one! Although, I would recommend waiting to read the whole series until after all the books are out, if you are like me and a series really fast and can't wait for the next book! And remember, stay in the light:)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When you first meet MacKayla, she's spending her day lounging around the pool, working on her tan. You can tell she's a girly-girl and takes pride in her appearance. Mac can be off-putting. She's about as deep as a 2 inch puddle. Until her sister is murdered. Against her parents' wishes, Mac travels to Dublin to find her sister's murderer. Not only does she have to face the horror of her sister's murder but also has to come to terms with what she is and that her life as a 22 year old Southern belle no longer exists.I loved Darkfever. And I loved Mac. I was hesitant about her being the heroine of this book because of how her character was portrayed at the beginning of the story. But in true heroine fashion, she realized she is important in destroying the Fae and that she needed to get it together and do what was needed to learn and train. There were moments of whining and complaining and of course, denial. It didn't last too long to the point of being annoying. I loved Mac and Barrons' relationship. I'm glad that it didn't develop into a romance (yet) because I think it would have undermined the gravity of what they were up against. Barrons' sardonic comments regarding her appearance provided many laugh out loud moments. My favorite is when he referred to her outfit as a \\"perky rainbow.\\" I loved how he continually referred to her as \\"Ms. Lane.\\" I kept waiting for the Superman reference but didn't get one. Maybe in the next book? The book ended with no real resolution. No tidy ending where everything is rainbows and sunshine. At first I kept pushing the next page button on my Kindle, thinking this surely can't be it! I'm looking forward to reading Book 2 - Bloodfever. I have plenty of time to get caught up on the series before Book 5 - Shadowfever - is released in December."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have been putting off reading this series. I have heard about its painful cliffhangers and I am generally not a fan of that sort of thing. My theory was... I can put it off until the last book comes out and just read them all at once. However, I am weak when it comes to peer pressure and I was pretty sure @smokinhotbooks was going to beat me up if I didn't read it soon. So I gave in and dived in.The synopsis above gives a pretty good teaser into what happens in this book so I won't rehash it. I liked Darkfever enough to read it in 2 sessions... in one day. It was addictive, like those Ferrero Rocher chocolates.I found Mac to be an interesting lead character, even if she does obsess about her nail polish and the color pink a bit much. She is stubborn, often to a fault. I like where the author is pushing her character by forcing her to change her appearance - I look forward to lots of growth of Mac as a person and woman.Barrons just plain annoyed me in this book. He is obviously sexy, but I did not find him likable Instead I found him arrogant, selfish, and untrustworthy. I am curious as to what he is and where he goes from here considering all the crazy book bloggers who adore him as much as I adore Bones. Obviously he has to have some redeeming qualities and we just don't get to see them yet.All in all, I give Darkfever 4 stars. The writing was good and I enjoyed the first person narrative. My only gripe is I dislike the way foreshadowing done. Phrases like \\"I would come to know just how wrong I wass...blah blah blah\\" just irritate me. (BTW - not a direct quote). I get thats it is part of the cliffhangers, but argh. The book does end with things unresolved, but I was prepared for it and it seemed like a natural place for things to take a pause. Now, I must get started with book 2.... thankfully hubby is home today to feed me and the kids so I feel no shame in doing nothing but sitting on the couch in my pajamas with BloodFever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Still scratching my head over why this one is filed under ROM for Romance. Not a speck of romance in it, as far as I could tell. Maybe her previous Highlander series was romantic, I dunno. This one has a couple of hot guys and some sex in it, but no romance. Mac Lane is 22, blonde and perky and pretty. Her older sister has been murdered in Dublin and the local police have closed the case for lack of leads. Mac flies to Dublin, determined to track down her sister's killer, and finds herself immersed in a world of dark Faeries that only she can see. She meets a man named Jericho Barrons who offers to protect her in exchange for her help in locating a very old and very dangerous book, the Sinsar Dubh. Mac is moderately irritating with her obsession with clothes and matching fingernail polish (Ice Princess Pink Blush) and Jericho is not much of a hero (yet - there are 5 books in this series.) Not even sure that Jericho is human, although that hasn't really come into play yet either. Needless-to-say (but say it I will, haha!) Mac gets herself into all kinds of trouble both with and without Jericho, and the ending is a cliffhanger meant to lead into the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning has produced a riveting storyline captured within the first book of a series of 5 novels all tied together in a Land filled with monstrous and deadly Fae that are being unleashed upon an unsuspecting Ireland. Following the death of her beloved older sister Alina, who had been brutally murdered while attending college in Dublin, Ireland, MacKayla Lane, a young, pretty, carefree blond, decides to go to Ireland in the search for answers as to why her sister was murdered. Upon arrival in Dublin MacKayla finds that the police have no leads and have closed her sister's case, that her hotel room is 2 stories up the stairs, plus she is sharing one bathroom with 4 other rooms; that the English language is not really understandable when spoken by the Irish, and that she is apparently losing her mind because she \\"sees\\" something that could not be real. MacKayla's life continues its downward spiral into terror as she discovers that she is a rare person of talent that is very valuable to certain humans, but also a death sentence if discovered by the Fae that are infiltrating Ireland. A protector, and potential love interest named Jericho appears, and Mackayla is soon living under his protection; but the situation is critical, and soon survival becomes upper most in MacKayla's mind. I was totally enthralled with this story. I love the premise of this story, the fight against evil, and all of the shades of gray that appear in this fabulous story of good vs. evil, and the courage of the human spirit to seek revenge against evil that kills just for the sport of killing. I recommend this novel, I loved it, and I cannot wait for the next book in the series. I would give this book 10 stars if I could, but I am restricted to only 5. Do enjoy this story - it will keep you up reading all night long.Susiq2, Reviewer, Cata Network Romance"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I preordered the book, received it yesterday, and read it last night. To be completely honest, had I not seen Ms. Moning's plog, I'm not sure how I would review the book. She's right, it has to be taken on it's own, unrelated to her Highlander series. So, here I go...... Yes, it's well-written. Yes, it's fast-paced. Yes, the characters have some potential and I will probably read at least one more book in the series just to see what develops. However this book, Darkfever, is, in my opinion, derivative. It's not quite science-fiction/fantasy, though it reminds me of a number of science fiction novels I've read, some as recently as this summer. At the same time, it definitely cannot be categorized as a Romance. As a matter of fact, I actually found any sexually charged scenes in the book repelling, not compelling in any way. (Which makes me wonder if that is the author's intent.) The thing I've loved about Karen Marie Moning's books are the appealing characters, the humor in the midst of chaos, and the amazingly well-written romantic scenes. For me, this book contained none of the above. I certainly can understand and appreciate an author's need to tell a new story in a new way. I'm just not sure this particular series is what I want to read when I'm seeking a light-hearted escape from my very stressful, busy home-life/job/multi-tasking existence. I read a lot of books from all genres, and I found Ms. Moning's Highlander series to be a fun, fantastic, sensual vacation from everyday life. Darkfever, rather than allowing me to escape, kind of smacked me in the face with a whole lot of nasty stuff. While Ms. Moning may be onto something with this series, I'm just not sure I'll follow her very far. Sorry . . . . ."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so hooked on this book! I found the first one as a free kindle download and bought the next 4 books because I couldn't put it down. THe 5th book just came out but when I finished the 4th I didn't realize that it wasn't out yet. I had to wait a whole 20 days for it and it about killed me! I had to know what was going to happen! If there was more books in this series I would read them in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is not even my genre whatsoever. I happened to join goodreads a year ago and saw this book recommended and I read the whole series in a week (minus Shadowfever). It was that good. I am now reading Shadowfever and loving it too!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I admit, I had no interest in really reading this series until I kept seeing everyone chatting about the final book in the series on Twitter, Blogs, and well...everywhere! So, I finally caved and requested the first book from the library. I waited on requesting the rest in the series because either I will like the series enough to buy them all, or I will not enjoy it enough to continue. Needless to say, I have already put my order in to Amazon to receive the rest of the books in the series.At first, the book seemed to progress at a slow pace. Mac is telling us the story of how it began and how the phone call she receives changes her life. When she is notified that her sister has been murdered in Ireland, it crushes her. Especially finding out later on that her sister also tried contacting her hours before her death on Mac's cell phone. Mac had dropped her phone in the water so she was unable to get the messages from her sister until after her death. Determined to bring her sisters case out of the unsolved files in Ireland, Mac journey's to the last city and place her sister was at.I was disappointed that it took so long for Mac to run into Barrons. I had heard everyone stating how sexy and hot Barrons was and when they first meet, Jericho seemed cold and full of himself. Throughout the entire book I kept wondering what everyone saw in this character and how they could think he was all that and more. Yet, as I devoured the rest of the book and got sucked into the mystery of the series, I found Barrons growing on me. Especially when near the end of the book, Jericho is painting her nails and taking care of Mac. It showed me he had a caring side to him that you know he doesn't show often or to many people.That also brings me to the sexy scenes involving V'Lane. Now I will say right off the bat, these scenes were hot! The simple fact that he could just do that to Mac so easily was amusing yet sexy at the same time. V'Lane seems to be warmer in the romance department than Barrons at the moment, but I will trust in the remarks of fellow reviewers and readers that Barrons is the ultimate package in this department.Will I continue to read this series? Yes. Mainly because I still want to learn more of the mystery and unsolved questions that the book has left me with. Of course, knowing that Barrons will have some sexiness in future books doesn't hurt or sway me in the least! I have caught the \\"Fever\\" of the series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I actually wrote most of this in response to a previous review and thought, why not post it as a review?I've been reading KMM since the beginning and the Fever series is wonderfully written and some of the smartest books out there. One of the great things about this series is you don't know what's going to happen. My friends and I rave about the fact that we can't guess what's going to happen which is so common on TV and in books.I do want to point out to a previous reviewer the fact that Ms. Moning has been using the term hallows since The Highlander's Touch came out which was released in 2000 (according to Amazon) and I never thought of Harry Potter while reading about them. In fact, KMM's hallows are a part of a complex mythology which she laid the ground work in her earlier books. I've been incredibly impressed by the foreshadowing her earlier books provided for this series. I also love the fact that you don't have to read her earlier books to enjoy the series so if you're looking for something deeper and more complex it's there or if you're looking for a read that's escapism and you don't want to see any deeper then what's written on the page you still have a extremely thrilling, engaging story with a heroine who has plenty of flaws but grows and evolves with each book into a kick butt heroine! Who wants a heroine who is perfect? Mac makes mistakes but you know what, she learns from them and it's exciting to see the woman who she is becoming. This series is a journey and one of the best series I've ever read. I hope that you give the first book a read and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was a great book for me. i am new to Moning, but I am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I stumbled on this in a roundabout way but I am so glad I did!

I await the fifth and final book with great anticipation and will be sorry to see it all finally end."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you come into Darkfever expecting it to be a paranormal romance complete with happily ever after, in the same vein as Monings' Highlanders series, you'll understand why the ratings for Darkfever are so mixed. Darkefever is not a romance and other than sharing the world of Druids, Fae and Sidhe Seers, it is nothing like Highlander books. Instead Darkfever is the first installment of five in a paranormal urban fantasy series, and unlike the HEA of the other books Darkfever leaves us hanging not coming to a natural stopping place until the end of the second book Bloodfever.In preparation for the upcoming release of Faefever, I just finished rereading both Darkfever and Bloodfever. Knowing what to expect this time my experience with Darkfever was quite different from when I read the book when it was first released. But story held up well to a second read. It is still every bit as interesting, even with my having a vague recollection of the key points.Darkfever slowly introduces us to Moning's world along with the lead, and narrator Macayla Lane as she heads to Ireland to try to get closure and justice for her murdered sister. Notice that I didn't call Mac a heroine, that's because in this book there is not much heroic about her. She is a beautiful, self absorbed and shallow southern Barbie, often too-stupid-live, but lucky enough to survive mostly because fate brings her to the doorstep of Jericho Barrons.Barrons is a dark, dangerous, powerful, enigmatic man and is exceedingly harsh, demanding and arrogant to Mac, but then again kindness would only get Mac killed. Barrons finds Mac's naivete irritating but intends to use her for her rare 'Sidhe Seer' skills - Mac is able to see through Fae glamour, sense magical objects and to freeze the Fae with a touch. These are important weapons because the Fae of the story aren't Tinkerbell, the dark ones are soul stealing nightmares and even the beautiful ones are cruel and dangerous. And the Fae are invading Mac's world in ever increasing numbers leaving pain and death in their wake. Some how tied into this incursion and Mac's sister's death, is a supremely evil and dangerous magical Fae book of spells, and Barrons intends to use Mac's newly discovered skills to find it and he's going to push Mac until she grows beyond the sheltered aimless life she lived before her sister's death until she decides to fight back and survive.None of the characters in the story inspire warm fuzzies, not Mac, Barrons, the nameless Sidhe Seer who leaves Mac in potentialy deadly circustances multiple times, or V'lane the gorgeous death-by-sex Fae prince whose presence brings the only sex to the book - inspiring clothes-shedding mindless lust in Mac everytime he crosses her path. But it's okay that we aren't in love with them yet, because Mac and Barrons and their uneasy alliance will all morph into something different by the end of the book. And the process of getting there is worth being annoyed with them at times as the story unfolds. And really, the reason that they can frustrate us is that Mac and Barrons are such vital and well developed characters.Even though I liked Darkfever the first time I read it, I enjoyed Darkfever even more this second time, especially since I kept on reading straight through Blood Fever and series only gets better and more interesting as Blood Fever picks up pretty much right where Darkfever leaves off. (Now only one more week until Faefever!)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After reading the excerpts and a few of the reviews posted here, I was a little unsure about whether or not I would like DARKFEVER. Like many people, I absolutely love the Highlander novels, but this book seemed to come out of nowhere. I'm glad I gave the book a chance because it turned out to be a pretty amazing read. I was thrown off by the first person narrative at first, but Karen Moning does a good job easing the reader into the mind of her heroine.Speaking of the heroine, Mac turned out to be a stronger character than I thought she would be. I was totally prepared to be annoyed by her immaturity, but I couldn't help feeling for her as she worked through her guilt and sorrow over her sister's death. Yes, she is young and immature at first, but I think this makes her a more compelling heroine because you actually get to see her grow and slowly start to accept the fact that she is now a part of something darker and much more dangerous. I really enjoyed the tension between Mac and Barrons and actually laughed out loud during a few of their verbal sparring matches.Overall, DARKFEVER is fast-paced and suspenseful, and I was hooked early on into the story. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read good and bad reveiws on this book and was a little scared to buy it. However, I love Monings work so much I knew it was a necessity! I loved it, really I did! I read it in one sitting and now I can't wait for the next one. I think the next books will only be better. I found this book to be much more visual than her others and while no, this isn't like the Highlander novels, it's just as good in a different way. I like the characters in this book and can't wait to know more about Jerico although I have an idea about him. I am in my late 20's so Mac didn't seem like a complete child to me like others have said. She has just been sheltered and as a Southerner myself she is understandable. I look forward to seeing Mac have love in her life. She deserves tenderness and I hope Jerico is the one to give it to her...."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is an awesome new direction for KMM,while still retaining the quality feel of her older novels.Read the plog Karen did and the blurb for what the book's about,and THEN say you were disappointed that it wasn't her \\"style\\",or a \\"traditional\\" romance novel.It IS different,and that's what makes it such a great book,such a wonderful start to this new series.I've seen Mac bashed pretty hard,and while I do admit she got on my nerves a little in the beginning,the Mac at the end of DF is definitely a more mature woman.I don't think some people are giving her a chance,considering the circumstances which brought her to Ireland to begin with,not to mention the crazy situations she finds herself in.People have complained that she is not a \\"normal\\" KMM heroine.I disagree;in fact,I think she may just be the MOST \\"normal\\" out of all KMM's heroines,in that she is a live-at-home student,with a loving family and she isn't really sure what she wants to do with her life yet.Certainly,young women like this do exist all over the world.They are happy-go-lucky and carefree because they CAN be,and reality intrudes on Mac soon enough.She has enough intelligence to answer her wake-up call,and with a firm voice.Throughout the book you can see her changing mentally,and I liked her more and more as the story progressed.The first person perspective was a must for this story,because it lets you into Mac's head in a way third-person would never be able to match.Anger,fear,suspicion,lust,regret and hope are just some of the things you will feel as Mac struggles to find answers,not only from Barrons and the city of Dublin,but from herself as well.Jericho Barrons is an interesting,mysterious character,and he's not the only one;Karen treats us to MUCH more of the Fae world,and anyone who has ever wished for a closer look at the Seelie and Unseelie will relish thisbook.You get not only the lethally sexy V'lane,but creatures that make the Boogeyman look like your best bud.I would like nothing better than to see an all-out war between the Seelie and Unseelie,and it looks like it's coming.Karen feeds your imagination a buffet with DARKFEVER,and although we may have to wait for dessert,I am sure it will be delicious and well worth it!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I could not put this book down & I was hooked from page one!

I love MacKayla, and far from thinking her character as \\"lazy and self absorbed\\", I found her to be a normal young woman with a vivacious and witty personality trying to find her niche in life when she is suddenly thrust into an unspeakable personal tragedy. She jumps into the mystery and horror of her sister's horrifying death with both feet (albeit yes, with a well done pedicure) and I find her search into this new world she discovers fascinating and compelling and also felt immense sympathy for her character and her plight. I believe Ms. Moning is initially writing Mac as a 22 year old Southern ing&eacute;nue with normal foibles & quirks through a trek into a here-to-fore unknown fantastical world. Mac's personality and character will no doubt grow and mature throughout this series into an exciting and self prepossessing woman who is initially fighting to discover the murderer of her beloved sister and the truth and reason behind her murder and leads her into a fascinating new and dangerous world.I do not want to give away any spoilers, but I am on pins & needles in anticipation for the next book, Bloodfever, and also found the first person writing lent more insight to Mac and was very well done. There are of course so many different genres of writing and I enjoy so many of them and have an open mind to new reading experiences---where I have no doubt romance & the HEA will come in this series, please do not cheat yourself out of a fabulous read because it is not what you might have been expecting. If you are looking for a fascinating and engrossing new series with an entertaining and intriguing plotline with irresistible, engaging, and yes dark, magnetic and mesmerizing characters, well this is your read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I never read a romance book until KMM's Highlander books, but I was hooked after reading just one. I bought Darkfever with a little hesitation since Ms. Monning stated that it was a departure from her other works.Here I am two days later and I can't wait to read the next installment. While there isn't a sexy romance in this book, there is indeed a love in this book that Karen captured with tendernous and sadness. The love that Mac has for her sister and the emotions associated with losing a loved one are captured and expressed beautifully in this book. Having never lost a sibling, I can't imagine what that loss would be like. I think KMM did an excellent job in describing the feelings and emotions one would go through after losing a sibling. It also helps the reader to understand what motivates or drives a person in the healing process.I'm glad KMM layed down a good foundation for complex characters and she spent time on the relationship that Mac had with her sister. I'm glad she included a glossary in the back with the pronunciation for all of the Fae terminology. Otherwise, I would still be calling it TOOTHA DAY DANNON."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The female character was beyond annoying and before I was half way through I had stop just to shut her down.

Something needed to happen and so I read and read and read and read some more going nowhere!! What the heck!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so excited about this series, because I've had people tell me how great it is. I finished the book last night and was left feeling like it never really got started. Sure things happened, but there was never a real climax and definitely not a satisfying ending. Eventhe action/scary parts wre dull, because they were all delivered in the first person of the very dull \\"Mac\\" who is more like a limp noodle with nail polish than anybody I wanted to know better.The premise was good, so I kept reading. And I kept hoping it would start to be a story instead on a continous roll of non-eventful events. It never happened. There are just too many good books out there to waste time on a snooze fest. darn. I really wanted this to be good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This novel grabbed me from the moment it said there was a mysterious murder in Ireland. The main character Ms. Mackayla Lane, is a very annoying little prissy girl that I believe dresses in too much pink. But I believe the author wanted us to get that feel for the character because of the constant reference to that color in her wardrobe and accessories made the idea stick. She was also very naive. Which added to her annoying characteristics. The author's depiction of this character gave the reader a visual that made it clear that Miss Pretty in Pink was traveling in unchartered waters with no idea where, what or how she was going to survive. Or who she could trust.The man in black, Mr. Jericho Barrons as the author depicts him has so much swagger that he is oozing with it as he floats through air, crawls through sewers and ravages on unsuspecting victims in the middle of the night. In this part of this 6 part series (make sure it's 6 and not 5) you are to believe that he is need of information and is unable to get it without the aid of this pretty in pink mystery woman who happens to stumble into his bookstore.As she stumbles through a land that isn't even on the map, he is moved by her aura that suggest that she may be just the thing he needs to find the missing piece to the puzzle to stop world domination by the dead.This story has very little romance but a ton of mystery and mythical creatures that can keep the solid sleeper half eyed open.I look forward to book 2 and so forth. I give this book 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm adding my one-star rating with the others just to counter all of the glowing reviews. I was baffled and disgusted by the inane heroine. I felt like my mind needed to be scrubbed and disinfected after reading this book - which I only finished because I kept thinking, \\"no, it couldn't possible get worse\\". If you took her out of the story it still wasn't difficult to miss the fact that in this fantasy it is clearly a man's world, and women are just there to serve, in any way, preferably in stilettos."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let me start out by saying I've been reading romance novels for ever 10 years now. I'm always on the the hunt for a new exciting story/author. I was delighted to to find both of these in darkfever. To say this story is simply a romance would be wrong. It's a mystery, thriller, suspense with a healthy dash of romance. All of this adds up to a wonderful story. Tried of reading romance novels with predictable endings? This is what you've been waiting for. Darkfever in a nutshell is the story of Mac and her journey to avenge her sister. This story does contain a lot of paranormal elements, however it does not overpower the plot. You find yourself caring for the characters and falling in love with them. Ms. Moning does such a good job, that you don't care if they're human/fae/devel, you root for them anyway. I loved them this book. There are five books in this series. There are cliffhangers at the end but it makes you actively think about the story and it only adds to the fun. Honestely what book have you read and you're still thinking about weeks/months later?? Trust me, challenge yourself if this is not your usual 'cup of tea'. Pick up this book, take a chance, you will NOT regret it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"...and then it stopped. Literally.I knew going in that this was a five book series, in her blog Ms. Moning warned us of that fact. I did not realize this would be a classic cliffhanger with a \\"tune in next time...\\" last page. If this is the kind of thing that bugs you, as much as it does me, I suggest you wait until all five books are published before you start. In the past the author has taken up to a year or more between books, so it could be a long wait.Back to our story - as much as was there, in any event. A young college student is murdered in Ireland. The local police are stumped, the family is devastated. A cryptic message from the victim is left on the voice mail of the younger sister's cell phone, and she comes to Ireland to try and find out what happened. The Dark Fae look to be responsible, and our characters need to deal with it. The story twists, turns, starts to come into focus - and then the cliffhanger.The characters are... okay, awful. The heroine, sister of the murder victim, is supposedly a twenty-two year old sidhe-seer, and most of the time comes across like a twelve year old Junior Miss Pageant winner. She uses the word \\"pretty\\" a lot (you will learn to hate the word). She has pretty little tanned legs, pretty blond hair, pretty skin, pretty clothes, pretty little shoes, and (my personal bugaboo) pretty Ice Princess Pink Blush nail polish on her pretty little fingers and toes. Nave and immature doesn't begin to describe MacKayla. We are expected to believe she is a product of her pretty little small town, and over protective background. Not buying it. If you are from a small town, and I am, you will be insulted by the inference. About the time MacKayla starts to mature to about a thirteen year old personality, here comes that cliffhanger.Our hero, Barron (I think he's the hero, the jury's still out), is dark, brooding, ultra masculine, handsome, rich, patronizing, and somewhat brutal. At first he tries to get rid of MacKayla by physical intimidation, then decides to use her untrained Sidhe-Seer talents to help him fight the Unseelie Sidhe and find their \\"Dark Book\\". After awhile, Barron starts to feel some gentler emotions toward MacKayla - and then the cliffhanger.There is no actual sex in the book, but, be warned, there are some rather brutal almost rape encounters with MacKayla and the Fae. Because MacKayla is so very young and immature mentally, these scenes seem even more horrific than usual.(Note to the author: If and when, sometime in the next four books, this turns into a romance between the two main characters, which I suspect it will, I sincerely hope you have MacKayla mature a whole lot, or Barron is going to come across as a rather creepy pedophile. At that point, you will lose me as a reader. Some lines can't be crossed.)Three stars because -Actually, I don't know why. Two are too few and I did finish the book in an evening. Four stars are too generous for a mere chapter in an incomplete story with characters that are less than stellar. I will be reading the next book in the series because...... oh, hell. because it's a cliffhanger, and I'm weak."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite Urban Fantasy series. I have a thing for faeries, whether they are good or bad faeries, I don't care bring them on! Moning, in her wonderful MacKayla Lane series, has created a world both entirely creepy and wonderfully compelling. She blends bare bones human emotion with fantastical and horrifying creatures. Her creations, Mac & Barrons are one of the most resonating characters that I have had the pleasure of reading. If you haven't partaken of this series...what is holding you back?REVIEW: MacKayla Lane's ordinary world is suddenly thrust into the extraordinary with one phone call. A cryptic voice mail left by her sister right before she dies changes Mac's life forever. Desperate to find answers to her sister's murder and figure out the odd message, Mac journeys to Ireland. Immediately she realizes that something is not quite what it seems.As her own life becomes threatened and creatures from her nightmares take shape into reality, Mac is thrust into the path of Jericho Barrons, another mystery. Not quite sure whether he is there to help or hinder, Mac must align herself with someone, because she can't do this on her own. The problem, Barrons has one focus and Mac seems like the ticket to that conclusion: Find the Sinsar Dubh - the object that will control both the mortal world and the world of the Fae. Just what will he use it for?A very intricate plot with twists and turns that left me breathless. I rooted for Mac every step of the way and as she got deeper and deeper the intrigue only worsened. The relationships Mac had with all her side characters were so in depth that I felt I knew them all personally. A well constructed novel, by far - with excellent dialogue that made me feel like I was a part of the conversation. The characters are so well structured and 4 dimensional that I would swear they are actually real. On top of the depth of the characters the range of human emotions and morality that is touched upon in the novel resonates as real real real. Moning has gift...and that gift is understanding human nature and weaving it into her stories. You aren't just entertained, you are schooled. Once again, a must read.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, has some R rated themes. This is an urban fantasy novel, with any romantic hinting, just that - a hint. Fans of Richelle Mead's Succubus or Eugenie series should enjoy."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, this book should come with a warning! Or maybe it's already out there and I just didn't pick it up. Have you ever read the previous books of Karen Moning and expect the same? Well, forget it! Longing for delicious dark Fae or Highlander as a hero? Dig up your magnifying glass. Do you want romance, passion and plundering bodies? Give the snooze button another hit! For Karen Moning turns into another direction and yet you read an original Moning all the way!!Mackayla is an average 22 year old with normal wants and needs, but with one phone call her life takes a dramatic turn. Her sister and best friend Alina was murdered in Ireland and she leaves Mackayla a message which doesn't make sense. It doesn't take long for Mac to decide to go to Ireland and figure out what her sister tried to tell her.In Ireland the police isn't helping her very much, friends and professors at the trinity college also don't remember much and what they do remember doesn't sound like Alina at all. At night she goes into a pub for dinner and she sees a gorgeous man enter, staring at him she suddenly sees a flash of something else. Then there's an weird old lady telling her not to reveal their kind. She must be tired for she just doesn't understand. The next day Mac wants to research the meaning of the word: Shi-Sadu, for Alina mentioned it in her message.If it's faith or something else Mac finds a bookstore and Jericho Barrons, who obviously knows something but isn't willing to reveal anything... two can play that game so Mac isn't answering his questions either. Mac isn't getting anywhere with her research and it's frustrating, but be careful what you wish for.....With this first book in the fever series Karen Moning takes us further into the realm of Unseelie, Seelie and the Tuath&eacute; de Danaan. From the very first page I wandered into Mackayla's world, feeling her emotions, despair, grief, but also her determination to find that what destroyed her sisters light. With every page the suspense is building up, question's rise with Mac as she enters a world and you hope that she finds her answers. V'Lane and Barrons make me want more. V'Lane as a death-by-sex Fae ( God I love that expression of Mac) makes a woman throb for everything a male body has to offer ( and how can Karen Moning do this to us!! I wanted plundering wild passion, hungry devouring bodies as only she can write it. She puts us on a diet and ladies, I'm starving!) and Barrons, he's so mysterious about who he is and Karen Moning gives us just a few hints of information, talk about torture!!!All my comments on this book is given with a wink because with her unique and rich writing style Karen Moning gives us a Fantasy/Suspense novel of world class and although I missed the romance aspect a little bit she fills it up with an amazing fast paced story, an incredible heroine and a quest of mega proportion's in a world that's just not the same anymore.I've closed the book that leaves me wanting for more as the ending seems like it's just the beginning.courtesy of realmsonourbookshelves"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Quick & Dirty: Suspense, intrigue, and danger make this a gripping page-turner.Opening Sentence: My philosophy is pretty simple - any day nobody's trying to kill me is a good day in my book.Excerpt: Chapter 1The Review:MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane lives a very carefree life. With seemingly no future, Mac cruises aimlessly through life focusing on her perfect manicure, pedicure and golden tan. Her self-absorbed world comes crashing down when her sister, Alina, is murdered in Dublin, Ireland. Hitting a dead end and having no clues to go on, the local authorities close Alina's murder case. Against her better judgment and her parents' advice, Mac heads to Ireland to get answers and follow the one lead that she does have - a voicemail from her sister hours before she is murdered.The danger begins from the moment Mac arrives in Dublin. Braving dark and derelict streets, Mac stumbles upon Barrons Books & Baubles. There, she meets the dangerous and mysterious Jericho Barrons. Eventually, they set out on a quest to find the Sinsar Dubh, the powerful Dark Book.It took me some time to warm up to Mac. I started out thinking that she would be a weak an ineffectual urban fantasy heroine. Having never left her small hometown of Ashford, Georgia, I didn't think she would realistically be able to survive the mean and supernatural streets of Dublin. While on her journey, Mac discovers a lot about herself. She's a Sidhe-seer, which gives her the ability to see through faerie glamours, and she has other talents as well. Mac turns out to be more than a hapless southern belle. Despite being out of her element and being exposed to things she never imagined could be real, Mac rises to the challenge. She's tough, smart and ultimately a very likable character.Jericho Barrons is still very much a mystery. He's powerful, dark, sexy, and very secretive. It's apparent that there's more to him than meets the eye, but it's hard to tell if this poses a real danger to Mac. Whatever the big reveal is, I'm sure it's going to be worth the wait. The attraction between him and Mac sizzles. I can't wait to see the dynamics of their relationship in the next installment.The world of Darkfever is atmospheric, chilling and seductive. I couldn't seem to escape that air of danger and evil always lurking in the shadows. The world-building is simply fantastic. I really like the mythology and Ms. Moning has certainly laid the foundation for what promises to be intriguing supernatural politics, and a deadly power struggle. The faeries in this book are completely terrifying. The Unseelie fey are essentially what Nosferatu are to vampires. Not-so-pretty and vicious killers. The Seelie fey are of the \\"beautiful people\\" variety. Still deadly in their own right, they're sensual and seductive.Overall, Darkfever is a wonderfully fulfilling read. This is a great beginning to what promises to be a thrilling series. The writing style is excellent. The characterization is outstanding. Its mythology is deftly woven with the supernatural, and has a delightfully deadly world that kept me captivated until the last page.Notable Scene:I opened my mouth to scream, but he clamped a hand over it. He banded an arm beneath my breasts so tightly that I couldn't inflate my lungs to breathe. His body was far more powerful beneath that fine suit than I ever would have guessed, like reinforced steel. In that instant, I understood that the open door had been nothing more than a mocking concession, a placebo he'd fed me that I'd swallowed whole. Anytime he wanted, he could have snapped my neck and I wouldn't have gotten off a single scream. Or he could simply have suffocated me, as he was doing now. His strength was astonishing, immense. And he was only using a small fraction of it. I could feel the restraint in his body; he was being very, very careful with me.The Fever Series:1. Darkfever2. Bloodfever3. Faefever4. Dreamfever5.

It doesn't. There is something engaging about this story that I can't quite put my finger on. It throbs with menace and mystery and is fraught with fae lore; yet, it retains a sense of reality that I have never before encountered in previous Urban Fantasy books/series. This book felt real. It's addictive and engaging, filled with grit, humor, lust, grief, mystery and mayhem.Darkfever tells the story of MacKayla Lane, a silly, 22 year old bartender/ part time student/ full time underachiever. Her reality doesn't extend beyond fashion, music, the color pink and her family. Mac lives a sheltered, small minded and simple existence in Ashford, GA where southern manners reign and fairies do not exist. All it takes is one fateful call to turn Mac's existence topsy turvy. Mac's sister, Alina, has been murdered while studying abroad in Dublin. With no leads and no suspects, the investigative team has closed the case. Reeling from the loss, Mac's parents become despondent, withdrawing into themselves. Mac can't begin to mend the shattered pieces of her life until Alina's murderer has been brought to justice. However, in order for Mac to fill the emotional void within her, she must travel to the abyss.While I enjoyed this story very much, I had to knock a star for the character that is Mac. She's shallow, incredibly girly, her manners are much too \\"nice\\" and she is WAY too perky. She and I would never be friends; nonetheless, I respected her. The girl's got grit, albeit that grit comes armed in pastel skirts, juicy couture purses, strappy sandals and ice berry pink nail polish. She also contains strong sense of self awareness in addition to the thoughts and motivations of others, leading me to think she isn't as obtuse as she initially appears. I grit my teeth a time or two in response to her reactions, although, I found them suiting to her character and realistic to the human condition. Thankfully, Mac developed throughout the story, and I expect that development will continue throughout the remainder of the series. She also has an intriguing co-star in Barron's. He remains shrouded in mystery, but like all good mysteries, you want to unwrap him, figuratively and literally.All in all, I was entranced by the world that Moning has created for these characters. Darkfever wrecked havoc on my mind. I woke up tangled in my sheets, as I dreamt of this bizarre world where fae roam the night and hotties like Jericho Barrons are on the prowl. Can't wait to start Bloodfever!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Review courtesy of [...]What do I want in an urban fantasy? A strong, likable protagonist with an as yet unrealized magical potential, a richly layered paranormal world, a well matched love interest who holds their own, and the promise of a multi-book meta-narrative. DARKFEVER has all that and more.Mackayla \\"Mac\\" Lane is a near perfect UF heroine, and she befriended me immediately. As is a Sidhe-seer, Mac is someone who can see past the disguises, or glamours, that the fey use to hide in our world. Tenacious in pursuit of her sister's killer, Mac is thorough and smart. Yes, she's a bit cocky, which she glosses over with more than a hint of old fashioned Southern charm, but she's also resilient and quick on her feet. The first time she truly spots a fey and is in danger of being discovered, it's her quick thinking and cool under pressure that save her life.Speaking of the fey, in DARKFEVER they are divided into two courts. The fey from the Unseelie court are the stuff of nightmares: grotesque hulking monsters who can suck the life out of humans with a touch. The fey from the Seelie court are the stuff of fantasies: breathtakingly beautiful beings whose very presence can send a human into an all-consuming erotic frenzy.And this is Karen Marie Moning, so you know to expect romance, but it's far from conventional. The enigmatic Barrons is Mac's unwilling teacher/protector. He is harsh and demanding, bordering on cruel through out DARKFEVER, and yet, there are flashes of something more, mere glimpses of a different man beneath the brusque demeanor. The slow, smoldering attraction that builds between these too was palpable.Overall, DARKFEVER is a near perfect urban fantasy (and yes, it is more urban fantasy than paranormal romance). A chilling mystery, a darkly seductive enigmatic love interest with questionable character, in a terrifying yet alluring world full of both scary and seductive fey. I am dying to devour the other books in the Fever series and be devoured in return.Sexual Content: References to sex. References to masturbation. Two scenes of graphic sensuality."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I basically picked up this book becasue all of my book resources recommend this series as a standout. I am not ready to agree to that yet but I did like this book and I will read the rest of the series.Our heroine Mac has received flack online for being 'too stupid to live' or too involved with make up and fashion. I didn't find her too stupid at all. Any mistakes she made could have been made by anyone thrust into this crazy new world. Mac goes to Dublin to investigate her sister's murder and learns what she believes led to her sister's death...both of the sisters can see the fae. Somehow the dark and evil fae are coming into our world in larger numbers. One of them, or something involved with them, has killed Mac's sister.Mac does go on sometimes about make up and such. Its not a lot compared to some paranormal chick lit on shelves now, but for this type of book it did stand out. maybe it will be toned down as the series progresses.I like the character of Barrons. The man is rude and mean but I was never sure if he was all good or all bad. That kept him entertaining. I also like Moning's writing. I wasn't fond of the idea of the relics and the quest for them. I personally usually find that type of story tedious. The plot could get old with this fast.Moning does a great job of ending the story in a way that isn't frusterating but still leaves things open and the reader wanting answers. As long as the rest of the books in this series are at least this good they should be worth reading."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},j={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,D)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-2b398cc8"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/19.md","filePath":"library/19.md"}'),L={name:"library/19.md"},O=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{N as __pageData,O as default};
