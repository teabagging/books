Windows XP is a LARGE operating system (OS). The notion behind the design is that anyone can have a computer installed with this OS, sit down and, after a five minute demonstration by the installer, be capable of doing several simple things. Many people will choose to do only this much. Unfortunately, once one goes beyond that first five minute introduction, things are not so obvious. Worse, Windows XP is not as hardy or as stable as Microsoft claims. After some months or years of relatively gentle use, Windows XP slows down and strange things start happening. This book will help the user to make the OS work better again. But, the user must learn how to use Windows XP properly and the instructions in this book are NOT as clear as they could be.In order to do all the things that Windows XP allows you to do; including running business applications, listening to music, optimizing and storing photos, playing computer games, surfing the internet, editing videos, downloading music, making CDs with various types of files, etcetera; the computer operator has a lot to learn about how to do those things. However, computers no longer come with guides on what to do. Thus, guides such as this one try to fill the gap.At first, things go well. However, by chapter 3, the instructions are getting hard to follow. Since there are 21 chapters, all I need to say is that the instructions do get harder to follow. I am not an expert with computers, but have used them for the usual home fun projects, since 1980. Working with this book, I often found myself puzzled by the instructions, but, after fumbling around, I usually figured it out. On the other hand, it is impossible to figure out how to do some of these things without a guide such as this book.This book helps. However, I think the book could be better. Of course, Windows XP could have been better, too. Well, perhaps the lacks in this book and in this OS are part of the cost of wanting to do so many different, complex, tasks with our computers."},{"Title":"How to Do Everything with Windows XP","review":"Truth is short.

He drew pictures for books like TS Eliot's famous \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\\" and was known as a humorist. In \\"The Dickens Index,\\" not one of his illustrations are shown. It is, instead, demonstrating his great breadth as a renaissance man.You won't buy the book because of Bentley's skill as an artist or sense of humor. It is a research tool.If you'd like to understand Charles Dickens' novels or his shorter fiction, this is it. If you want to understand the people and researchers surrounding Dickens as he lived, then this is it. If you are curious about the unusual words, now obselete but used by Dickens, you'll find it here. All of the characters in Dicken's writing. or alluded to by him are in here too.Each entry is no more than 200 words. Look up 'ensign', 'eggs-hot' and \\"evil... dies with the doer of it,\\" and learn what an ensign does, what eggs-hot tastes like and where you might read a quote from William Shakespeare. Where? It is in \\"Our Mutual Friend,\\" thre last novel Dickens finished.It reads easily, but there are some abbreviations to referenced to in an abbreviation found in front.Useful, instruction, and thorough, \\"The Dickens Index\\" as edited by Nicolas Bentley\\" should land in the library of any sdtudent of Dickens.I fully recommend \\"The Dickens Index.\\"Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Garden At Levens","review":"The Gardens at Levens are among the most beautiful and unique gardens in the world. For this visitor, they were a vast sea of magnificent towering topiary, dramatic, otherworldly. Awed, one strolls through a massive green tunnel or beneath a sheltering roof of yews only to catch a glimpse of another wonderful scene that must be explored.In this gloriously illustrated volume one is introduced to the Gardens with the best guide available - Chris Crowder who has been the head gardener at Levens since 1986. He enthusiastically relates how in 1694 in \\"one of the sweetest spots fancy can imagine, Guillaume Beaumont designed the parterre and gave the garden its quartered layout.\\" It is seen today very much as it was 300 years ago.Fortunately, the accounts of former owners, stewards, and gardeners have been preserved. Thus, Crowder can draw upon them to detail how the Gardens have been kept, true to their original design.While the Topiary Garden is probably the most visually arresting, there is so much more beauty to be discovered - the Rose Garden, the Fountain Garden. Not to be overlooked are the wall borders alive with color or the orchard borders decked out in tulips and wild flowers.Vivian Russell's photographs are, as always, a joy to behold.

In the fourth grade edition I was very dipleased to see evolution as a main source of study. We are homeschoolers and I teach not only from the three R's but from the very Word of God.

Because so many schools use the Core Knowledge guidelines, your child won't have big gaps in her education, if she has been taught a curriculum based on these guidelines.Each book in the series cover all the basic subjects: math, science, history, geography, language arts, art and music. The sections are broken down into small pieces, and one part can be taken up each day pretty easily.Additional references are included for every subject, so your child can more fully explore the areas that interest him.The language arts section includees excerpts from some great adventure classics, like \\"Treasure Island\\" and \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" It also covers poetry, grammar, and common sayings and phrases. The grammar is not in itself adequate, and I would recommend that homeschoolers use additional materials for grammar.World Civilization covers the Middle Ages. European history is extensive, but this also includes a very nice look at Asia during this period of time. This is much more extensive than what I was taught of the Middle Ages during my entire elementary education. The geography section corresponds with this study, but also looks at all parts of the world.American Civilization pretty much covers the period from the signing of the Constitution through the 1840's (Manifest Destiny and the Mexican War). Again, if your child has studied the previous books in the series, this will fit in nicely - the 3rd grade book covers the colonies through the signing of the Declaration of Independence. There are lots of pictures and other resources you can use to augment this study.The fine arts section covers music (hard to do with a book, but notes & reading sheet music is in there) and visual art, which largely discusses architecture during the Middle Ages.A very comprehensive overview of math is given. This is not to be used as the sole source of math work, but a basic overview of what your child should be learning during 4th grade.The science section covers paleontology, the cardiovascular system, rocks & the composition of the earth, weather and electricity. The best part about the science section, is that you can find out what really interests your child, and there are additional resources recommended for the various studies... ..."},{"Title":"What Your Fourth Grader Needs to Know Fu (Core Knowledge)","review":"We bought this to use with our daughter who just started fourth grade.

Maxine Hong Kingston has skillfully woven an epic of Chinese history in America in the most creative way. From the early Chinese immigration to the present day, the Chinese's dream, experience, suffering, and success in America is wonderfully told through many generations. Unlike many historical novels, this book is told from the Chinese perspective right down to the details from character to character. This book is written so impressively eloquent and truth to the bones that I dare say a native Chinese might not even know as much about his/her own culture. From Alaska to Hawaii, Kingston has covered every corner of the U.S. that Chinese immigrants have gone. The characters also added a little Chinese wisdom now and then in a day when working on the railroad or fighting in the Vietnam War.Aside from extremely in-depth in history and Chinese culture, the stories are especially fun to read. I can only describe them as totally fantastic, bizarre, and unbelievable.Do you know the Chinese had found a place called\\"Land of Women\\" ? There was also communist Uncle Bun who suspected the U.S. government was plotting to poison him by collecting garbage from every door and hiding them in his food. Yes, these interesting stories have significant meaning related to the actual history. Not all of them are funny though; there are also stories that are terrifyingly shocking such as the inhuman tortures the Japanese did to Chinese and the bias laws America had toward Chinese. There are also side stories and fairy tales of all kinds from Chinese ghost stories to a lesson by Li Fu-yen which added a savor to the book. Anyone who read China Men would view life different than before.I recommend China Men to people who have a desire to understand Chinese culture and learn how America culture affected them. However,the book is so abstract and arbitrary that it is hard to understand. Warning, it is not an easy book to read. If you feel you are confused, read several times more. There are many amazing truths of life in China Men, which are subtle but such a waste to miss."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"In China Men, Kingston took me on a ride all over the literary landscape. In general, I thought her book was an interesting tossed salad of memoir, fable, reporting, and poetry. As a reader, it reminded me of a scrapbook of family stories, newspaper articles, heritage legends -- all assembled in one place.Interestingly, Kingston begins the book with two distinctive chapters. Unlike the rest of the book, these two chapters are relatively homogenous, sticking with one form, voice, structure and tone throughout. The first chapter is the fable of the Land of Women. I didn?t understand this chapter until the last sentences, when it seemed as though Kingston was saying that coming to North America emasculated the Chinese men who made the journey to the Gold Mountain.If Kingston?s main theme is that the journey to North America emasculated the Chinese Men, then from a reader?s perspective I?m not sure if the book delivers on this promise. To put a fable with a very obvious moral at the beginning of the book seems to me to set up a contract with the reader about the subject or theme of the book. Although, Kingston explores many different aspects of the Chinese experience in North America, and even starts to explore the ways that China Men were oppressed, I?m not sure she completely proves her case in my mind. I could be wrong, however.Interestingly, the second chapter of the book is another short one, this time a nearly pure piece of memoir. Alone, this chapter seems to set up the author?s own relationship with Chinese men. By mistaking another man for her father, she seems to be saying from the beginning of the book that from her perspective Chinese men are nearly interchangeable. But interestingly, she isn?t the only one who makes the mistake. All the children in that scene mistake the strange man for their father. I like this chapter placed here because it contrasts nicely with the fable/story in the first chapter. The first chapter is told at a distance by a storyteller/narrator. The second chapter is told first person from our main narrator?s voice.Kingston returns to this theme several more times in the book. On page 217, she remarks that one of her Uncles looks just like her father. Interestingly, Uncle Bun is also completely forgotten, erased from her sister?s memory only a few years after he leaves. Kingston often hints at how distant and interchangeable the China Men were to her and to the women of her family. At other times she explores her narrator?s perceptions that China Men have no heart, no emotions.One of Kingston?s greatest strengths, in my opinion, is her ability to weave in all sorts of other stories into the narrative of her story -- presenting a mosaic of memoirs, possibilities, facts, essays, fables, legends, ghost stories, scenes and reporting -- that all add up to a complete picture of the lives of the China Men who came to the United States. On page 49, she starts one version of a trip to the US with, ?I think this is the journey you don?t tell me:? She then recounts the tale of the father?s arrival in the US as a stowaway. But like The French Lieutenant?s Woman, she (Kingston) also gives us another, more ordinary version of the father?s emigration. I don?t know which one is ?real? and which one is imagined and, frankly, I don?t care. The fact that some Chinese used each of these methods is credible enough to keep my disbelief suspended and keep me in the story."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"After reading Kingston's &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; I thought I'd read &quot;China Men.&quot; I am not disapointed at all. &quot;China Men&quot; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of Chinese men in America from the 1840s to the Vietnam War. Although Kingston uses as much Chinese myth in this book as she does in &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; she apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated. Even so, Kingston's stories and the way in which she recounts them is absolutely splendid."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"This is an amazing book, wrought with heartwrenching love and pain over the wiping out of Chinese Americans in American history. I disagree with people who say it can be confusing for a non-Chinese reader, because it is certainly accessible. The plot is made up of several stories from different eras of history, along with beautifully narrated myths that are symbolic of America's inhospitability. It made me reaccess my understanding of an America that is not covered in textbooks and really to see how it feels to not feel at home in one's own country."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"The China Men by Maxine Hong Kingston was a very interesting book. It contains stories of Chinese men traveling to America in the 1800's and working on the transcontinental railroads, in Sierra Nevada. The author shares a lot of details in the stories about her family traveling to America. She retold the story from a male's perspective of what hardships they've been through to get to America, in search for the Golden Mountains. A rich country that they about which is full of riches. As they reach to America what they thought was the Golden Mountains was just a land of hard labor and low paying jobs. Some of them regretted coming to America, but they couldn't go back to their country because they had no money.Some part of the story made me feel like I could relate my family to the characters that Kingston has written about. My family immigrated to the United States in 1984. Like the characters in Kingston's book they heard about the Golden Mountains that's why they came to America. All they found was low paying jobs which are similar to the characters in Kingston's book. Is this really what they thought of as the Golden Mountains? It was for sure not what they had thought of. Like many Chinese family my parents thought that the Golden Mountain was really a place to find gold, but all they found was their own blood, sweat, and tears that they shed of all the hard work that they did.This book is also very educating because in one of the chapters, Kingston listed a list of laws that were set against Chinese in the 1800's. It gives the reader more information of what the Chinese immigrants had went through to come to America and to work for the country. Overall, this book is very good and very detailed. I strongly recommended this book, if you're interested in learning more about the experiences of Chinese men traveling to America and their stories. This is also one of the best book that I've read."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"The book, China men, was an unveiling of the life-stories of Chinese men proceeding to the West in the early 20th century. It was a repulsive collision between the eastern worldviews with the West. The East's attempt to blend into the Western society was the main essence of the book. Maxine Hong Kingston revealed details of the men in her family who went to America, the so-called &quot;Golden Mountain.&quot;In the book China men, the book setting switched from time to time, and characters to characters. The book isn't in sequential order or chronological order; it was an attempt to seek order out of disorder. This type of arrangement enhances the reader's thinking to proceed to further complicate intellectual thoughts. The disconnected stories were very confusing but however, all the chapters that seem totally unrelated were interrelated in a sense.At the beginning of the book, the author, Maxine Hong Kingston gives specific descriptions of various aspects of life in China. It was a symbolism of the eastern worldview. The cultural background is an important part of the life-journey. Each individual has an identity, and the cultural background is a part of a person's search of their true identity. Further more into the story Maxine emphasizes on the Chinese culture and traditions.Later on in the book, Kingston continues to the call to adventure. This is a very important turning point of the book. Baba, the father, became bored of grading papers at school one night and went to attend a talk meeting with people from the village. People of the village were talking about stories on the &quot;Golden Mountain&quot; in the meeting. The more they talked, the more interested the people got. At the end, they all decided to go to the &quot;Golden Mountain&quot; and bring riches back to China. They viewed America as a land of gold, the country of opportunities. All the stories that the men brought back to China were exaggerations and it created a &quot;Golden Illusion&quot;. It gave the Chinese the wrong sense of what America really is. It is very normal to be tricked by the mask. The wrong interpretations of America were in a way a mask that disguised America. It made the Chinese believe in something that was not true. Anyway, the Chinese gave into it and went to America. Maxine then further emphasizes on how the Chinese traveled half the planet to get to America. There were rough times. The Chinese went through lots of trouble to get to America.The book progresses to a totally unrelated story. It began talking about characters called Ed, Woodrow, Roosevelt, and Worldster. I doubt the validity of this section of the book. In the book, these people were characterized as Americanized people. They were people that had American names. They drove cars, danced with American women, shop for hundred-dollar clothing, and flew an airplane. These are almost impossible things that could've happened for the early Chinese immigrants. I believe that this section of the book is strengthening the golden illusions of the Chinese. At the same time, it could also be providing a secondary illusion of America to the reader.Throughout the book, Kingston gives stories of the men of her family that went to America. Kingston emphasizes on the awkward feeling of Kau Goong (Grandfather's) burial. After the burial ceremony, mother burned Kau Goong's clothes and shoes. She gave the pallbearers red paper with money inside it to the kids. It was meant to end the death and begin the luck again. This is a type of Chinese tradition that Chinese still follow nowadays. But this is a significant act. It is a symbolism of the death and rebirth experience. This could be suggesting that the Chinese Americans, had spiritually been rebirth to become Americans. Although they may carry hope all the way from China, but there are Americans. That is when they were eating in the restaurant and everyone was behaving in a way as if there was no funeral a moment ago, which is the American way. While in China, the people would be crying and making religious offerings to the person whom pasted away.Is Kao Goong an American? What is his identity? The true identity of an individual doesn't necessary have to be determined by the place that they were born. For example, in Greek myths, often times the hero searches for the identity in his journey rather than that he was given the identity at birth. I believe that Kao Goong found his true identity in America and that he is truly a &quot;man of the golden mountain&quot;. This cemetery incident is a really symbolic part of the book that is rich in psychic energy. It integrated the historical content and the mentality of Chinese Americans and it was expressed in the form of fiction. This incident symbolized a very important part of the Chinese experience in America.At the end of the book, the heroes looks back at his journey and realizes that everything was just an illusion. All the hard work, all the sweat and heart that's been putted in were for nothing. Although they were Americans inside their heart, but they feel the sense of non-acceptance because of their Chinese descent and physical appearances. They realized that it was all a &quot;deterioration of the golden illusions&quot;. But the hero, unstoppable with his passionate heart, will continue in the divine cycle of the journey and keep walking down the path of life. That is just how the China Men from Kingston's family kept on coming and coming, thus they will never give up to whatever obstacles may stand in their way."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"I fell in love with this book, with the men in this book, and with the author. Most of all, with the simple, profound images that penetrated to my core. Such as: a children's song depicting joy with a mockingbird's \\"tails in the air, tails in the air.\\" An old man pounding the table with his ineffective penis that will not give him a girl child. And on and on. I love what this author does with language. I love this book! The author cares about these men in a way that is very real to me..."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"I have never read a book before or since, that has moved me so much. In writing a history and the mythology of her family in America, Maxine Hong Kingston has almost written the history of my old sojourning family in Australia. The names and the places are different-but the expericences and the emotions are the same. The author beautifully crafts together the elements of the Cantonese expericences in America with 'talk story',both of the old world and of the new, to describe the essential concept of the book; that is, what it means and what it feels to identify oneself as a Chinese-American (or Australian). The images of self-identity, of being a part of the new world from one's roots in the old, is an undercurrent which flows through and shapes this book as you read it. The only regret that I have with it, is that if the reader can't identify with the people and the experiences in the book, perhaps much of the magic and the sentiments that the author has described is lost. I have to say that it is THE finest book that I ever have read (and re-read many times over). Absolutely fabulous."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"The book China Men, written by Maxine Hong Kingston, is a book that is written to describing serious of historical events in Kingston's perspective. This book is consists of many short stories about Kingston's relatives that have had the experiences of struggling as new immigrants on the &quot;Gold Mountain&quot;. One interesting point about this book is that the incidents described in this book are purely collective information and stories heard and gathered by Kingston. She does not have the experiences of immigrating into America as her father, grandfather and great grandfather did. The stories that she had heard from her relatives are told from the perspectives of Chinese immigrants. Imagine how an event can be depicted through the eyes of a group of ethically raised Chinese, and then the event is then interpreted through the ears of a Chinese-American, and now written as a book for people with any backgrounds to interpret. Kingston has written a novel explaining the situations of Chinese immigrants that are not much different from a history text, and the only difference between them is that Chine Men views the history from a different perspective. The reason why I like this book is because I found this book very humane. In each of the stories with the father going to the Gold Mountain for the gold rush, the grandfather going to Sierra Nevada Mountain to construct the railroad, the great grandfather going to the Sandalwood Mountain to work in the fields and even the brother going to Vietnam during the Vietnam war, personal feelings and insights along with the descriptions of the situation that they had experienced. Each character in this book had to go through many different physical hardships as well as internal obstacles. This book showed how the Chinese immigrants had contributed to the development of the American industries. As grandfather had stated, &quot;No China Men, no railroad&quot;(140). Not only were the significance of the contributions were acknowledge, but the process of how America has shaped the Chinese immigrants as well. Another thing that made become fond of this book is because the terminology and Chinese ethics used do not easily confuse. Between each chapter, Kingston has wisely included additional information or side stories that would supplement to the moralities and ethics discussed in the stories. All in all, China Men is a historical novel that reflects the views and ethics of the Chinese immigrants."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"China Men, is a captivating autobiography that is more than a history book: as her second novel, Maxine Hong Kingston captures historical fact, Chinese mythology and ethics and her personal family story blending these ingredients to create a novel that makes the reader think. Storytelling the experiences that her father, grandfather and other male relatives encountered in their individual travels to America, Kingston's lyrical and distinct style looks into the true story of Chinese immigration. Written in a very patriarchal voice, China Men describes the four generations of Kingston's family, their adventures in playing their part in different stages of the Chinese American story. Beginning with the mystery of her father's journeys to the \\"Gold Mountain\\", through to the great grandfather who built railroads, one of the great Chinese experiences, and ending with the story of her brother who was to fight for America: Kingston takes us into her families soul and leaves us with a sense of knowledge of how important it is to listen, not to neglect our history and to pass our stories on. The experiences of Kingston's father, the open ended explanations of his becoming a citizen was especially interesting, as his story was never truly clarified. This did not leave me confused, but instead the tragic and entertaining stories let me understand the difficulty and curiosity that is involved in understanding your personal past. Throughout the novel, there is connection to the character of the father; the author's ambition to understand her father and her history better: to bring the past to life. The fact that Kingston is a woman does not stop the continuity of the man's story. China Men deals with her families ever-changing view of where home is: never quite letting the reader into her own mind, I hope that is a story yet to come"},{"Title":"China Men","review":"I loved this book, and I love how the author writes. She tells her stories not in a typical narrative, factual, journalistic way, but in a stylized, \\"storylike\\" way (does that make sense?!). All of the stories focused on the different men in her family, especially her father. They all center on the Chinese man's experience in America, from the railroad days onward, and tells of their struggles, triumphs and failures. As a whole the book is about how these experiences shaped the men in her family. She intersperses a few legends here and there, just like she does in Woman Warrior. I enjoy how she takes her family history and literally turns it into a work of art. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"I am writing this primarily to warn people from wasting their time with this book. I would write an exhaustive explanation of why this book is so bad, but I don't want to waste any more of my own time with this book.

Actually, read *both* of them!"},{"Title":"China Men","review":"China Men, written by Maxine Hong Kingston, is a novel that addresses the meaning of being Chinese American. Each chapter and section of the book is a separate story concerning Chinese history written from many different perspectives. The stories include old Chinese folktales, families in China that send their men to America and Hawaii, Chinese from the mainland living in Hong Kong, first generation Chinese families in America, the children of those families, and so on. The connection between each chapter is hard to grasp, although it is important to realize that it is based on many generations and relatives of one family. The complexity of Kingston's writing style not only is impressive, but also makes China Men a good book to read more then once."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"I have to both praise and criticize this book. First of all, China Men is a story book revolving around history and includes historical details on the Chinese Americans. It vividly depicts the experiences of the Chinese Americans from 1840s to the World War II. It is particularly helpful for those who study Chinese immigration into America, and who are interested in Chinese Americans. Not only is it more enjoyable to read than a history book, it also provides deep insights into the feelings of the Chinese Americans, which could not be seen in ordinary history books that are merely loaded with details and facts. Yet, the book is confusing in parts and Maxine Hong Kingston seems to have shown some lack of understanding about the Chinese culture.At the beginning, I had some trouble understanding the plot, because I did not realize that this book is divided into lots of short stories rather than one complete story. In the event, I thought it makes a lot more sense, and the book a lot more readable.This is also a humorous book, and there are parts where I literally laughed. An example would be the sugar story, where the policeman had mistaken the word Sook-ah, meaning old man, for sugar. However, foreigners might miss the catch of humor.It is easy to get mixed up with the different characters since many of the names were similar, such as Ah Goong, Say Goong, Kau Goong, Ngee Bak, Bak Sook Goong, Bak Goong and Sahm Goong. It would be a pity if some of the readers may get confused. Another thing is that the narrator seems to be the same person in every story, which adds to the confusion.Although this is a fascinating book, Kingston did not seem to truly understand the Chinese culture. For example, she said that \\"Hong Kong people are more refined than us (Chinese from China) and don't say old lady for wife or old rooster for husband.\\". However, this is certainly not true, Hong Kong people today still use these old sayings. At least my parents do so.Lastly, I would not recommend you to read this book, if you have no idea of what was going on in World War II, Korean War and the Vietnam War. This is because the last story The Brother in Vietnam would seem very confusing and might make you frustrated. Also, a communist might feel disturbed by the satirization of communists, and how the communists were degraded."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"Maxine Hong Kingston's book \\"China Men\\" is a book of many stories. She explains what life was like for the Chinese in America. There are many stories describing what her family (father, grandfather and great grandfather) went through. She talks about the Chinese emigrating to Hawaii and what their journeys were like. In her book, there are historical references and lists of laws to help her readers better understand how life was then for the Chinese.The book is very well written with the stories extremely detailed. Mrs. Kingston describes all the parts of the character's lives so clearly. In both the melancholy and the joyful sections she makes the reader feel that he or she is actually in the story themselves. Mrs. Kingston wants her readers to particularly understand what life was like back then.So that the reader has a better feeling for the two cultures Mrs.Kingston uses both English and Cantonese expressions in her book (Mrs.Kingston clarifies everything in English for her readers). The book is neither \\"Chinese\\" nor \\"American\\" but is balanced between the two cultures.One thing that I think she should have added was a map of the journeys. That would make it easier to visualize the travels. Besides that I would say that it is an excellent book for learning about Chinese American history and a pleasure to read.J. Berman"},{"Title":"China Men","review":"After having finished the book, I found that the middle part was really hard to get through for me. The multitude of characters involved made it difficult to be emotionally attached to any one character. It was interesting, however, to see Kingston's father transform from the \\"Father from China\\" to the \\"Father from America\\". I thought that was probably the most interesting journey of all the characters in the novel. There have been many criticisms on whether it is right for Kingston to interpret traditional Chinese stories in her own way and almost make whole new stories out of them. I don't agree with those criticism because I think she has the right to modernize those stories in order to help readers be able to understand the stories more. I actually like her personal tellings of the traditional stories. They definitely enhanced the reading experience of the book and made me think more about the longer stories of the novel."},{"Title":"China Men","review":"THE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK IS A LITTLE DRY...BUT AS HE STARTSHIS STORY FROM ANGEL ISLAND IS OUTSTANDING.

This book takes what critics said about Kingston being a man-hating nut in The Woman Warrior and sublimates it; now she can simply be accused of being a white-hating nut.The immigration process was very tough for the men in Kingston's family. Because they were foreigners that spoke little to no English, they were forced into low-paying, labor-intensive field work. The Chinese immigrants would often be called \\"chinamen.\\" What Kingston has very subtly done with the word is turned it into a positive. The title of the book is \\"China Men,\\" not \\"Chinamen.\\" When whites in the book use the word, it's derogatory; Kingston uses it differently - with respect. With what her relatives have been through, it's easy to understand why Kingston tends to hate white Californians.China Men is heavily mixed with amazing fantasy and heart-breaking reality.

Onward.Divorced private investigator John Halting is just ending a job, and having custody of his daughter Nina (Neen) for the day, he takes her to a parent/teacher meeting where he meets Grace Penny, Neen's teacher. Penny has been getting some threatening letters. The threats take the form of pictures of a melting green candle. The symbolism behind the green candle is that once the candle burns completely down, she will die.Eventually, since Penny knows John through his daughter, calls him, and asks for a consultation, during which she fills him in on the full story behind the green candles pictures. Through a therapist, Penny is recovering long lost memories of a human sacrifice performed by her neighbors and her parents. Her parents are long dead, but she is going to appear on a controversial tv show with Lawrence Spangler, one of the neighbors that she has accused of the ritual murder.Meanwhile, John is also working on a case for his long time friend, and now mayor and who wants John to find Tommy, his missing son. And Tommy isn't the only thing missing, Tommy also took sixty thousand of undeclared campaign funds that the mayor had squirreled away. From Tommy's viewpoint in this graphic novel we find out that he's traveling with the huge bully Sitcom and Sitcom's girlfriend Rima. Tommy doesn't want to be there, but Sitcom has something on Tommy, what is it? That's the mystery.In the first book of this serial novel De Haven creates a very real person in John Halting, who remembers his family's past quite differently than others, including his family, do, who is still pining for his wife, and just wants to put his family back together. His memories of the past will be a major counterpoint to Penny's \\"recovered\\" memories throughout this novel.De Haven seems to have quite a knack for dialogue, and creating identifiable characters, and the constant plot twists kept me turning the pages. As did the artwork . . .All graphic novels are fifty-fifty propositions; the art won't carry really bad writing and good writing won't carry bay artwork. Thankfully, both are solid this time around. Robin Smith's art reminds me somewhat of Al McWilliams artwork of the fifties, although Smith's art seems less stiff and less posed. And Smith's art is deceptively simple. It's good, clean, unflashy pen-and-ink linework that never gets in the way of the story. But Smith is versatile, and whenever De Haven deals with something dealing with anybody's memories, Smith uses charcoal illustrations instead of his pen-n-ink work, thus easily separating the present and the past so that even the most casual reader can tell the difference.My Dad loved comics, he read at least one newspaper a day, and several newszines, but he still loved comics. His favorites were war, western, and crime stories. When I saw the \\"Green Candles\\" crime trilogy at the stand of a used comic dealer I had to buy them for him.I wish I had asked him more details on what he though of this trilogy, but I didn't, and he's gone now, and I just know that he really liked them, that's where \\"George's Library\\" comes from. This is my second go with this novel, and I like it even more the second time around, and I can see why Dad liked it. It only gets four stars instead of five because it IS a continuation, and you really will need to read the second and third books in this graphic serial novel.The next books in this series areBlow Out, Green Candles (Paradox Mystery, Volume 2), andGreen Candles Volume 3: Don't Forget Me.

The book looks like nothing so much as a logical extension of that old Beatles movie, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. On its cover sita a bizarre rainbow colored fish with a mouth as wide as a cave and a ludicrously jutting jaw. Across from this fish leaps a little spotted fish with the face of a woman and rainbow colored water flowing from its tail. I stopped. I stared. And though I very rarely pick up picture books to read and review on a whim, I couldn't help it. I had to read through this book no matter what. The fact that it was written by Jane Yolen only clinched the deal.As the tale tells us, there was once a young fisherlad who lived all by himself on an island. He had everything he could want (as attested by his orange coveralls and black &amp; white suspenders) and he was well pleased with his fishing skills. One day, as he sat on the banks of a lake found deep in the woods, a mysterious boat called a coracle appeared out of nowhere. The lad hopped aboard and was immediately brought to a little spotted fish. After greeting him in a usual fishy matter (ala spitting water) the fish says to the boy:&quot;Dylan, Dylan, son of the wave,The spotted fish thy life shall save&quot;.Dylan (that's the lad's name, you see) doesn't quite know what to make of this, but he goes along with it just the same. Suddenly an uber-odd fish with a spectacularly jutting jaw approaches. At his feet, Dylan finds a magical rod. The rod defeats the fish and Dylan uses it afterwards to fish. However, the lad decides that it's too easy fishing with a magical fishing rod so he returns it to the spotted fish. Later, everything happens all over again. The coracle comes, the fish sings, and this time a magical net and two uber-odd fishies try to eat the boy. Again he defeats them, uses the net for a time, then decides to give it back to the spotted fish. Only the third time he jumps in the coracle the spotted fish spits out water &quot;as red as blood&quot; (yum!) and asked to be saved BY Dylan. Three fish appear and Dylan rescues the little one from the big nasties. They offer him wishes in exchange for her, but Dylan laughs and explains that he would wish for nothing, so they take off. Then the little fish sheds her silver scales (like the book &quot;Rainbow Fish&quot; but without the hokey message) and turns into a lovely girl. And they lived happily ever after.In her author's note at the end, Yolen explains that &quot;The Little Spotted Fish&quot; is a combination of several classic folktales, poems, and what have you. As an original story, it's fine. To be honest, I could take or leave it. It's Friso Henstra's bizarre trippy illustrations that bring this book to life and caught my eye in the first place. This book was originally published in 1975, and as such it's a crazy creation. You half expect Blue Meanies to come barreling through this tale for all its psychedelic glory. Henstra carefully balances his black and white (pen and ink) spreads with rainbow infused crazy creations. Details like the spotted fish having the face of a woman give the book an almost mythological feel and tone. And of course there are those insane monster fish that serve as the villains of the piece. They so immense and frightening (enough so that I suspect I'll be enjoying some mighty fine nightmares for a month or so) that they stick in one's brain long after reading the text. In short, the pictures in this book are inspired. I highly recommend them.What we have here is a formerly up and coming author pairing with a skilled artiste of a past age. The result is the frenzied and fantastical &quot;The Little Spotted Fish&quot;. Honestly, if you can get your hands on a copy of this puppy, you will NOT be disappointed. It's far more bizarre than anything I've seen in a long long time. Read it to your kids.

Merritt first published in the mid-1920s, offers a world in which the Gods of ancient Babylon are real and palpable, if not necessarily Divine, and in which marooned voyagers from many times and lands encounter each other in furtherance of an ancient curse. It is probably to be counted as a version of \\"The Flying Dutchman,\\" although no sailor on earthly seas ever caught a glimpse of the vessel of Ishtar on its unending voyage across a crystalline ocean. The this-worldly counterpart of the Ship is a relic of ancient Mesopotamia, sealed in a block with (long-unreadable) warnings since before the days of Hammurabi.And the novel itself is a relic of a \\"modern\\" world now slipping into the past.The King James Bible tells us that \\"There were giants in the earth in those days\\" (Genesis 6:4) -- the Hebrew can be understood differently, but the Dead Sea Scrolls show that it was once interpreted to explain Mesopotamian heroes like Gilgamesh (\\"Glgmsh\\"). And it sometimes seems that before radio dramas and movie serials, before adventure comic strips and science fiction magazines, and well before comic books, let alone television, Giants were roaming the Earth!Or, at least, Giants were contributing to magazines like \\"Argosy\\" (Frank Munsey's pioneer all-fiction pulp) and \\"All-Story,\\" \\"Adventure,\\" \\"Golden Fleece,\\" and the more general-interest \\"slicks\\" like \\"Colliers\\" and \\"The Saturday Evening Post.\\" And some of their characters were Giants too -- prototypes of the superheroes of a slightly later day.A few of these writers had star status, or at least their names had special drawing power (think of Lucas and Spielberg). A few of them are still widely remembered by name or by their creations, like Edgar Rice Burroughs and Tarzan. The westerns of \\"Max Brand\\" also have a following. (The name was the well-chosen pseudonym of Frederick Schiller Faust-- which looks even more like invention!)Others, like Homer Eon Flint, are mostly (and sometimes deservedly) forgotten by all but a few. Their prose styles ranged from the workman-like to the florid and baroque, and sometimes sank to the barely intelligible (which helped some of them paper over plot-holes as large as a mammoth.)Somewhere between still-famous and forgotten is the present author, Abraham Merritt (1884-1943), once instantly recognizable as A. Merritt, journalist and magazine editor, and, mainly in the period 1917-1934, occasional author of novels and short stories of suspense, the supernatural, and, above all, fantastic adventures in exotic places.In those years, whenever he chose to write fiction, he was a Giant among Giants, inspiring younger writers, and providing a model for those trying to make a living in the pulp markets by meeting the demand he had created. And he was often reprinted in magazines, a common practice before paperbacks dominated the newsstands. But fiction was a side-line, and Merritt produced little in the following decade, although an unfinished novel and various fragments turned up after his sudden death from a heart attack.His name still had enough selling power to be used for five issues of \\"A. Merritt's Fantasy Magazine\\" (1949-1950), just the market for fiction magazines was fading, but before the novels were picked up for mass-market paperback editions by Avon, which for years had a near-monopoly (although Collier Books did an edition of \\"Face in the Abyss\\" in 1961, and there were some earlier exceptions, including at least one edition of \\"Ship\\").Merritt has been in and out of favor with readers or publishers in the years since, due in part to whether his lush romanticism and slightly purple prose style seemed exciting or merely unfashionable. (There are those who suggest that the possibilities for enticing cover art were originally more influential with Avon than the books' other qualities, pointing out that Raymond Chandler was the only other author of real merit on their early list, If true, this changed over the years, as the emphasis on exposed skin decreased considerably, although never quite abandoned. Unhappily, more decorous covers did nothing to correct a debatable choice of base texts for some of the books.)He really didn't throw around adjectives and adverbs nearly as freely as both imitators and parodists would suggest, but he did prefer, for example, \\"emerald and vermillion\\" to \\"green and red\\" when describing jungle vegetation. He often used simple sentences, among the longer ones. Sometimes just one word. One! (He also liked exclamation marks! A lot!) Not to everyone's taste, but he was actually a skilled writer, and knew that a well-constructed story was more than a sequence of events.Another factor in the decline of his popularity, if it was more than an accident of publishing policy as corporations consolidated, may have been growing discomfort with the latent (and sometimes explicit) racial overtones of many of the stories. By the standards of the early twentieth century Merritt was far from a bigot, and it is usually possible to distinguish the opinions expressed by the characters from those endorsed by the author, but the casual assumption of white superiority can be jarring -- and prevent readers from continuing to see whether it is borne out by the events. (He sometimes played with readers' assumptions. Watch out for the Frog-People! Or, wait, are they the Good Guys?)Recognition of problems with his way of putting women on pedestals (they tend to be pagan priestesses, and often turn out to be actual goddesses or avatars of some sort anyway) probably came too late to make a difference.Whatever the case, Merrit's novels were in print, mainly in those Avon paperbacks, in the 1940s and 1950s, when Burroughs seemed to be vanishing, and again from the 1960s through the 1980s, then alongside not only Burroughs but Tolkien and Howard. Most of his titles then disappeared from publishers' lists at some point in the middle or late 1980s.He has been straggling back into print under such unfamiliar auspices as the University of Nebraska Press (the Bison Frontiers of Imagination Series) and the Wesleyan University Press (Early Classics of Science Fiction), with in one case an introduction by Jack Williamson, a now-venerable science fiction writer who as a teenager regarded Merritt as a literary god. (Merritt was impressed and flattered enough by Williamson's first published story, a transparent pastiche/homage, to ask for the manuscript.)Still, whenever you see a story about dolls which come to life and commit crimes (remember Chuckie?), or about ill-assorted explorers stumbling on a lost civilization of humans and non-humans menaced by both the outside world and its own ancient powers (say, \\"Atlantis -- The Lost Empire,\\" or \\"Dinotopia\\"), chances are that a Merritt story is lurking in the background. Even if the authors themselves never read \\"Burn Witch Burn\\" (1932) (filmed as \\"Devil Doll\\"), or \\"The Moon Pool\\" (as \\"The Moon Pool\\" and \\"The Conquest of the Moon Pool,\\" 1919; book version 1919), \\"Face in the Abyss\\" (1923, 1930, revised for book, 1931; author's ending restored in some later editions), and \\"Dwellers in the Mirage\\" (magazine and book versions, 1932). Not that Merritt invented the themes, but his versions of them dominated American imaginative literature for much of the twentieth century.And, partly by way of Williamson and other writers of his generation, any grotesque-looking alien life-form who wins your sympathy may owe something to Merritt as well. (As will be understood by those who have read \\"Face in the Abyss,\\" many are the progeny of the Snake Mother!)Merritt made his greatest reputation among lovers of fantastic adventure with slightly more archaeologically plausible and somewhat science-fictionalized versions of the \\"Lost Race\\" novel, made popular in the nineteenth century by Bulwer-Lytton and H. Rider Haggard. He added some creepy super-beings who may have contributed more than a little to H.P. Lovecraft's Old Ones, and, when editors allowed, a rather pessimistic view of human nature (its real gods being Greed and Folly).In 1924, however, Merritt had moved all the way into what would later be recognized as alternate-world heroic fantasy, with \\"The Ship of Ishtar,\\" originally published in \\"Argosy All-Story Weekly.\\" (A combined version of two older titles -- \\"Argosy\\" would survive the death of its rivals, only to spend its last years as a \\"Men's Magazine,\\" finally, mercifully, dying in 1978.)Instead of an archeologist or explorer stumbling into an underground world, or through a Veil of Illusion, this time the archeologist, John Kenton, examining an inscribed block from ancient Babylon, falls from his mundane twentieth-century New York penthouse right onto the deck of a model ship on a crystal ocean -- and finds himself in a world as material and dangerous as the one he has left. He finds that he is acting out (as mentioned) a sort of implied prototype of every Flying Dutchman yarn ever written, along with other castaways in time, such as Sigurd the Norseman, who recognizes the Irish-American Kenton as a Man of Eirinn.Kenton is caught up in a struggle between Ishtar, Goddess of Love and Beauty, and Nergal, the God of War and Death, as decreed by Bel-Marduk, King of the Gods. (Yes, Ishtar herself was an often-nasty war-goddess -- but Merritt was mostly dressing up his story with Assyriology, and taking a lot of material from Herodotus rather than cuneiform texts. And the interpretation of the gods wasn't implausible, circa-1920.) Of course, this being a Merritt novel, Good is represented by an incredibly beautiful woman, who takes a liking to the Mysterious Stranger who appears and disappears from the Ship she has sailed on since the days of Sargon of Akkad, believing him to be a messenger of Nabu, God of Wisdom. (Again, Nabu emerged later in history, as did the routine designation of his father Marduk as Bel [The Lord], but never mind.)Or possibly Kenton really isn't doing any such thing, and Sharane, Priestess of Ishtar, Klaneth, Priest of Nergal, Gigi, Sigurd, and all the others on the Ship, aren't really there -- and neither is the Ship.In the full text, as published in the magazine version, the reader was carefully informed that wealthy young John Kenton had passed up the excavation in Mesopotamia he had funded in order to join up in 1917, and had returned from the war a victim of \\"shell shock\\" -- close enough to post-traumatic stress disorder to make little difference.In this context, Kenton's initial reaction to his unexpected experiences, shifting from passive acceptance to violent action, and back, made perfectly good sense, and allowed the skeptical reader to wonder if Kenton really was finally cracking up completely, as he himself suspects, until persuaded otherwise.In the 1926 book version from Putnam, the text used by Avon in numerous reprintings, and by far the most widely-read version, the opening paragraphs were truncated, and Kenton's behavior can become rather a puzzle, as does the attitude of his servants back in New York to \\"the Master's\\" odd behavior. There are several discussions of the book, some available on-line, which stumble over just this incomprehension. (The reverse situation befell \\"Face in the Abyss,\\" in which the magazine tampered with the ending.)The full text of \\"Ishtar\\" (and the difference in wordage is not large) was restored after Merritt's death, in the undated \\"Memorial Edition\\" from Borden (1948, 1949, and 1951 are all given). It was beautifully illustrated by Virgil Finlay, one of the best of the many artists inspired by Merritt. This was reprinted in hardcover in 1990, and reproduced in the Collier Nucleus Fantasy & Science Fiction series paperback edition in 1991, apparently after the Avon option had finally lapsed.However, the Avon edition is perfectly satisfactory on most counts; and, with a couple of decades of reprintings, usually the easiest to find. It had various covers over the years; the 1960s-era Douglas Rosa portrayal of Kenton and Sharane, with a glimpse of one of the supernatural battles fought in and around the Ship, is particularly lovely.(Note: although presently unavailable new in English, \\"The Ship of Ishtar\\" has been translated into, among other languages, French and German, and these versions seem to be in print. -- see Amazon.fr and Amazon.de. The French editions appear as \\"La nef d'Ishtar,\\" a literal translation. The German translation for some reason is called \\"Insel der Zauberer.\\" Although Chapter Twenty-One is indeed entitled \\"The Isle of Sorcerers\\" [plural], this is a curious choice for the book title, and changes the focus away from the Goddess, and the Ship and its destiny, for no clear reason. To add to the confusion, the very attractive cover art of \\"Insel\\" suggests that someone either doesn't know the difference between Babylonia and Egypt, or Isis and Ishtar, or just doesn't care.)"},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"The Ship of Ishtar is one of the better 1930's Indiana Jones style pulp adventure novels. An archeologist unearths a miniature ship artifact that transports him to another dimension, where he becomes a macho hero, who, with the help of an interesting assortment of new friends, assists a lovely priestess in a battle against some evil warlocks. His adventures lead him through some wonderfully imaginative fantasy locales, and the book has a spectacular ending."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"&quot;The Ship of Ishtar,&quot; one of Abraham Merritt's finest fantasies, first appeared in the pages of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine in 1924. An altered version appeared in book form in 1926, and the world finally received the original work in book form in 1949, six years after Merritt's death. In this wonderful novel we meet John Kenton, an American archaeologist who has just come into possession of a miniature crystal ship recently excavated &quot;from the sand shrouds of ages-dead Babylon.&quot; Before too long, Kenton is whisked onto the actual ship, of which his relic is just a symbol. It turns out that the ship is sailing the seas of an otherdimensional limboland, and manned by the evil followers of the Babylonian god of the dead, Nergal, and by the priestesses of the Babylonian fertility goddess, Ishtar. A force barrier of sorts prevents the two parties from coming into contact with each other, and they have been sailing thus for...nobody knows how long. It seems that, centuries ago, a priest of Nergal and a priestess of Ishtar had been guilty of the sin of falling in love; this eternal cruise is the punishment that has been meted out by the gods. Kenton becomes embroiled in this ages-old strife; falls in love himself with Sharane, a Babylonian princess; eventually takes over the ship; and then goes in pursuit of the Black Priest of Nergal, after Sharane is kidnapped. He is aided in his quest by a sword-swinging Viking, a hugely strong and mace-wielding man of Nineveh, and by a scimitar expert from Persia. The quartet makes for one formidable team, lemme tell you! This is high fantasy done to a turn, and Merritt is at the peak of his game here. While &quot;Ship&quot; does not boast as much of the purple prose and hyperadjectival descriptions as his first two books, &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster,&quot; there is still quite a bit, and in places the descriptions of various isles and temples almost reads like prose poetry. The story moves along briskly and builds to a pair of splendid set pieces: Sharane's rescue from the Temple of Seven Zones, in which each floor is dedicated to another Babylonian god and is decked out with its own color scheme, shrines and so on; and a very tense sea battle between the Ship of Ishtar and the Black Priest's bireme. The novel really is a stunning feat of imagination. I wonder if Merritt was perhaps influenced or inspired by the excavations at Uruk (now in southern Iraq, and one of the original cities of Ishtar worship) that had commenced in 1912. He may have also been inspired here by H. Rider Haggard's seminal fantasy work &quot;She&quot; (1887), in which Ayesha, head priestess of Isis, is given an eternal punishment for her own love dalliances. Whatever the inspirations, though, Merritt makes it all work, with great detail, color, action and character.The book is a fantasy classic, but still, Merritt makes some small booboos. Thus, the gold bracelet on Kenton's left arm is on his right arm several pages later. Kenton is said to have disappeared from his NYC apartment at 8 PM, while later Merritt tells us that is was 9 PM. Sargon of Akkad (an ancient Mesopotamian ruler) is said to have ruled 6,000 years ago, whereas in actuality, it was more like 4,300. Merritt, in the course of the book, is also guilty of some fuzzy writing. But these little glitches should in no way interfere with anyone's enjoyment of this rousing tale. I should perhaps mention here that &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; has been included in Cawthorn &amp; Moorcock's overview volume &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,&quot; and that I personally have no problem with that inclusion. It really is a fantasy for the ages."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"One of the books that turned me on to heroic fantasy fiction back in the early Seventies.I've been a fan of Merritt's for a long time. He's little known outside a narrow field these days, but he knew how to drive a plot.Our protagonist is \\"sucked\\" into a sculpure of a boat, finding himself part of the crew and forced to man the oars in a fantasy \\"Arabian Nights\\" setting.That's just the start of a swashbuckling adventure worthy of a Douglas Fairbanks movie. There are sultry maidens, heroic rescues, and black magic, all you'd expect in a fantasy novel of the period.The writing style seems pulpy and dated these days, but it's a great fast read, and should be on every fantasy reader's bookshelf, just so they can understand the history of the genre."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"This review is of the Paizo \\"Planet Stories\\" reprint of The Ship of Ishtar, first published in the 1920's. The format is of a classic pulp magazine, with a two-column layout and 10 full-page pieces of Virgil Finlay artwork.The Finlay work is beautiful and atmospheric, and a fitting complement to the text.The story itself is well enough described in earlier reviews: a modern (1924) man, with more than a touch of Indiana Jones about him, is cast into an alternate world where gods do battle, only to be locked in stalemate. Our Hero, John Kenton, breaks the age-old impasse with the help of doughty companions, finds love (and sex!), only to have it all snatched away and require a quest to recover.The characters are well-rounded and developed, and the tale for the most part moves at a cracking pace. The language however may be a little difficult to overcome. For the modern reader, there seems to be an incredible surfeit of both dashes and exclamation marks. There is no doubt but that this is deliberate, and part of building a rhythm in the narrative, but it was jarring after several pages and did not cease to jar hundreds of pages later. Unfornately, I can't divorce the gripping tale from the telling, and while I enjoyed the book - and hope in a future re-reading it to enjoy it more - it was good but not great. It would make a wonderful movie, I think, without having to struggle under punctuation on the written page."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"I entirely agree with Mr. Slater's comments.There are literary authors and there are story tellers. On all-too rare occasions one writer combines both aspects in his or her work. If A. Merritt was not among that rarified class, he certainly ranked as a master story teller.\\"The Ship of Ishtar\\" is a charmingly old-fashioned, rip-roaring good read.I have and treasure the Borden Memorial edition with the excellent Virgil Finlay illustrations. The book is everything that Mr. Slater says it is, and more. By all means snatch it up if you ever stumble on a copy. You won't regret it.Five adventurous stars."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"Sam Moskowitz (1963) and James Blish (1970) agreed about very little, but they both held that _The Ship of Ishtar_ (_Argosy_, 1924; 1926) was A. Merritt's weakest novel. Algis Budrys (1985) later stated that \\"to my mind Merritt's _Ship of Ishtar_ has virtues as a story that are lost on Blish the classicist\\" (303). Certainly, _Ishtar_ was popular enough in the past. Fourteen years after its first puplication, the readers of _Argosy_ voted it the most popular novel serialized in that magazine (Moskowitz, 1963). I am with Budrys: _Ishtar_ does indeed have its virtues, and (who knows?) it just may lead to a mild resurgence in Merritt's popularity.Let us start with the entrance to Merritt's fantasy world. The hero strikes an ancient bar of metal (clothed with centuries) with a hammer. The bar turns into the model of a ship. Then doll-like figures appear on the ship. And finally, the model pulls the hero onto the real ship in a parallel world of gods, monsters, and magic.This harks back to the old \\"threshhold of adventure\\" in mythology that is frequently watched by a \\"threshhold guardian\\" (Campbell, 1949, 77-89): cerberus at the gates of Hades, the sirens on the rocks, the Great God Pan at the entrance to the dark forest. In Christian lore, St. Peter guards the Gates of Heaven. Sometimes the gate is in the form of a magic portal or door that the hero must leap through \\"in the twinkling of an eye\\" before it slams shut (Watts, 1963, 220). All heroes crossing these threshholds enter a world that is different from our bright, secure, everyday world. It is frequently dark, amorphous, magical, and dangerous: Hades, Heaven, a foreign country, the labyrinth, the Land of Faerie.In more recent times, Alice has her rabbit hole and her looking glass leading to her Wonderland and her chess world. C.S. Lewis's children have their wardrobe leading into Narnia. And Hannes Bok has a golden stairway guarded by a blue flamingo leading into his sky-world.In _The Metal Monster_ (_Argosy_, 1920; 1948), Merritt didn't give much attention to a magic threshhold or gate into his lost valley. The novel suffered a bit. _The Moon Pool_ (1919) and _Dwellers in the Mirage_ (1932) had great threshholds of adventure, and they still have a mythical resonance with readers. The same may be said of _The Ship of Ishtar_.But what about the novel after its grand opening? On the balance, Merritt does fairly well. It is true that the characters are fairly stock-- the rugged hero, the sensuous warrier priestess, the sneering villains-- but they aren't handled any worse than those of other American scientific romances. And I think that it is fair to say that Merritt doesn't use the usual plot formula. There are a number of unusual twists and turns that make it a bit different from many of his other novels. Not a perfect novel. But for my money, still good entertainment-- even after all these years.REFERENCES:Blish, James. \\"The Monstrosities of Merritt\\". In _More Issues at Hand_.

Fortunately for us, Paizo has seen to reprint Merritt's definitive edition here for us. All of Merritt's trademarks are here--the achingly beautiful woman, the lush prose, the dreamlike atmosphere, the diabolical villain, the darkness somewhat uncharacteristic of a pulp writer--and all are used to great effect. Strikingly for a pulp novel, Kenton and Sharane come across as somewhat more than just types. Although adhering somewhat to pulp archetypes, their romance is fairly fresh and well developed (predating as it does any number of imitations). In addition, Merritt provides us with a wealth of wonders in the alternate, sea-bound world the Ship exists in. In short, this is a fine book to spend an afternoon reading and savoring and an even better introduction to Merritt's work as a whole."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"This book reminded me much of the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It borrows heavily from the tradition set forth by Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and follows the tradition of Verne and especially Burroughs in conceiving a plot that moves inexorably forward. The primary characters feature some depth, some motive for their actions, and even the secondary characters are more than just flat extras. The dialogue is realistic, and the details paint a vivid picture of the characters and the action. It's a real page turner."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"The Ship of Ishtar certainly has an original premise: an unearthed artifact (a toy ship) transports a modern-day archaeologist onto an ancient, very real vessel that is cursed by the gods to sail until a wager between the god of love (Ishtar) and the god of death (Nergal) is resolved. The archaeologist, John Kenton, falls madly in love with a priestess of Ishtar named Sharane aboard ship, but prompts the bitter wrath of a priest of Nergal. Kenton has many adventures while on the ship, but keeps being pulled back to Earth at unpredictable moments. After one such trip, Kenton returns to the ship only to find that Sharane has been kidnapped; so with the aid of some friends, he sets off to rescue her.A bare description of the plot may not do the book justice, as the story is densely constructed with mythological layers and a very florid style of writing that is very evocative (though it is overdone at points and slows the story to a crawl). Characters are very one-dimensional, dialogue is decent, and there's some zesty description in the action scenes. Although perhaps overlong, The Ship of Ishtar has enough interesting features to recommend it. It's one of those books that fits into the fantasy genre, but is so different than most fantasy that it creates a memorable contrast."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and loved the myriad details that obviously spawned now classical elements of the fantasy genre.It took about a third of the book before I couldn't put it down, the shifting of the protagonist from the real world to that of the ship far too frequent for the adventure to grip me. But when it did, I was hooked, and finished the book in a single sitting from that point on.My only real criticism of The Ship of Ishtar is that it is built around an antiquated misogyny that was unrelentingly distracting from what would otherwise be an exciting adventure. I recognize that the book was written over eighty years ago, but I was nevertheless pulled repeatedly out of the story by the overwhelming portrayal of the few female characters as vengeful, but ultimately submissive objects to be possessed by the dominant men. Merritt may have been a master at weaving descriptive prose and an intricate world of eclectic real-world myths and his own imaginings, but he was far from enlightened when it comes to gender. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the Virgil Finaly illustrations this edition includes, bare breasts and all, so take the above for what it is.In all, I recommend The Ship of Ishtar and had a great time reading it, despite the problematic elements it contains, which are less the fault of Merritt than they are the time in which he wrote."},{"Title":"The Ship of Ishtar","review":"This exhilerating adventure story is jammed with as much true fantasy creation as the modern writer's ten book series. The Ship of Ishtar is all but forgotten, but deserves to be even more popular than Tolkien's novels.The story centers around a British man who is wisked into a fantasy world where evil and good are trapped together on a ship. Adrift. To delve too deeply into the plot now would cheat prospective readers, but this is a sexy, romantic, thrilling, brilliant, fantastic, adventure yarn.No one I've loaned my copy to have ever not loved it."},{"Title":"Getting Partnering Right: How Market Leaders Are Creating Long-Term Competitive Advantage","review":"I am in the process of establishing partnerships with our firm's suppliers and subcontractors so that we may improve the service that we provide to our customers.

Burroughs contines his wonderful fantasy stories with the Pellucidar series and this work is one of the best. As one reviewer has already pointed out, Burroughs' observation on the human conditon can be quite acute and down right funny. As a old man, I recently reread this one (along with several others by this author) and found they have lost none of thier charm. The are \\"page turners\\" in every way and simply fun to read. Granted, some of the author's writing can indeed be a bit predictable, but somehow that is comforting for me. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Tanar Of Pellucidar","review":"The third book in the Pellucidar series, 'Tanar of Pellucidar' concerns the exploits of of Tanar, and his adventures within the world lying under the \\"outer crust\\", Pellucidar.Burroughs doesn't deviate too far from his formula, nor would you want him to.Tanar is the honorable, fallible, romantically-driven hero, Stellara his love, and a whole host of bad guys interfere with them getting together. This time, they're from a place called Korsar, and look remarkably like pirates.Yup. Yo ho, yo ho pirates.Like the other books, there are set pieces aplenty, written in ERB's thrilling simple style. Jungles chases and oceanic clashes...dungeons, dinosaurs...oh it's all here as usual.This time, however, there is a bit more elegance and sophistication slipping in to his prose. First, Mr. Burroughs appears in the prologue/epilogue. The jarring anachronistic presence of the pirates is given a possible explanation, in a tantalizing fashion. He gives us enough information to put two and two together, but you still want to read more, and I think he's setting us up nicely for the subsequent novels.Which I now absolutely MUST read.One last humorous note: Some of the exotic locales, like Anoroc and Amiocap, I've just noticed to be cities in California spelled backwards..."},{"Title":"Tanar Of Pellucidar","review":"Although Edgar Rice Burrough's style can get predictable at times, he can come up with some literary gems such as the first few Tarzan novels and (if he had just foregone the \\"sequals\\") \\"the Land that Time Forgot\\". \\"Tanar of Pellucidar\\", along with \\"Escape on Venus\\" stand out for their simple, straightforward observations (often humorous) of human nature as expressed through the practices of various societies. Even if you aren't a Burroughs fan, these two titles I recommend for any lover of good fiction."},{"Title":"Tanar Of Pellucidar","review":"Two things amaze me about Burroughs's writing. The first is how he could keep telling the same story again and again, with just a few changes to names, places, and size of the monsters' teeth. The second is how he kept that repetitive sameness fresh and exciting, as he did here.This follows the usual pattern of ERBian storytelling: the mighty warrior (Tanar in this case), on the trail of the savaeable babe (Stellara in this case), as she gets captured by seemingly every mad horde and loathsome gang on (in, in this case) the planet. Even within this subterranean world, there are sub-subterranean troglodytes, prisons riddled with secret escape routes, and monsters that appear the moment after they come up in conversation. There's the usual chivalrous bafflement about a romantic interest, alternating hot and cold because of puerile jealousies and a nearly autistic inability to figure out what is so obviously going on in others' transparent minds. And, as usual, the romantic confusion resolves itself chastely in the end.Nearly 80 years old at this writing, this offers the same quaint charm as the Buck Rogers movies from around the same time - and the same improbable physics and manly questing to Do The Right Thing. If you want a relaxing read from before the age of irony, these Burroughs stories are sure to please, just as they have for most of a century now.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Tanar Of Pellucidar","review":"\\"Tanar of Pellucidar\\" was the third pulp fiction novel Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote in his Pellucidar series, which was his third longest after the Tarzan and Barsoom series. Burorughs wrote the story as a six-part serial in late 1928 and it was first published in \\"The Blue Book Magazine\\" from March to August of 1929. \\"Tanar\\" was written after \\"Tarzan and the Lost Empire,\\" and after completing it Burroughs wrote a sequel to both works when his next novel presented his only book to be in two different series, \\"Tarzan at the Earth's Core.\\"Although the title for the novel is taken from a character native to the inner world of Pellucidar, the most interesting character in Burroughs' novel is Jason Gridley, who is introduced in the prologue as a friend of the author. An orphan, Gridley has graduated from Stanford and built a lab at Tarzana (ERB's home). There he discovers the \\"Gridley Wave,\\" which is the means by which Burroughs will receive his \\"true\\" stories from the Earth's core and Mars. That is the case with this story, which is sent by Abner Perry from Pellucidar, where he and David Innes have been living for fifteen years. Perry reports that Innes is being held a captive in the north of Pellucidar. Althought the Mahas and their Sagoths have been driven beyond the border of the Empire of Pellucidar, the Kingdom of Thuria in the Land of the Awful Shadow is now under attack by a savage race of men led by Goork.Tanar, son of Ghak, is who Innes sends to deal with the situation, along with 10,000 warriors armed with the \\"modern\\" firearms created by Innes and Perry. Tanar is captured by Korsar pirates who want to learn the secret of the strange weapons that control the balance of power in Pellucidar. Innes heads off to rescue Tanar, ordering that a fleet of 50 ships be built to follow him as soon as possible. Meanwhile, back on the Kosar ship Tanar and the lovely Stellara are busy ignoring each other, so the romantic interest of the novel has been established. That means that we can get on with the standard ERB adventure yarn, which is that Tanar and Stellara escape, get recaptured, get separated, so on and so forth. But ERB keeps the action moving at a brisk place and I always liked the way that the Pellucidar novels involved interjecting \\"modern\\" technology into the equation. Besides, in conquering this inner \\"New\\" world, Innes is much more beneficent than the European who arrived in this particular hemisphere.Be forewarned that the novel ends with David Innes still being held in the prison of the Cid, covered by snakes no less, so there is a cliffhanger ending.. Jason Gridley promies to help, thereby setting up the rescue effort by Tarzan in the next book. I have to admit, that given how redundant and repetitive the Tarzan books became that having Tarzan actually be in a strange new world and not just another uncharted part of the African continent was a decent little twist. Of course, Tarzan is always going to be the lord of whatever jungle he ends up in, so some things remain constant."},{"Title":"Tanar Of Pellucidar","review":"45 years ago I read all ERB mars series books and the Pellucidar series. I bought Tanar of Pellucidar to read again and add to our family library.ERB was a master writer who wrote 70 novels and 100 adventure stories.Tanar of Pellucidar is an easy read. Lots of action,great descriptions of the different races on inner Earth prehistoric Pellucidar. Lots of prehistoric monsters and the descendants of pirates. Many races of cavemen. Lots of beautiful women.We see Jason Gridley a radio bug with the author Edgar rice Burroughs listening to a great adventure on the radio via \\"The Gridley wave\\" Abner Perry a scientist/inventor on inner earth Pellucidar is sending. Emperor 1 David I gets captured by the pirates. Also the main character in this book a strong Pellucidar man Tanar finds a beautiful woman Stellara ( believed to be the daughter of Cid the pirate king). NOT! They escape but another beautiful caveman woman Gura is helped to escape from her caveman torturous and evil clan. She falls in love with Tanar too. Eventually she realises Taner's love is for the mate of Tanar....Stellera.A love triangle with lots of escape action. We see Tanar battling and killing a Saber Tooth tiger and a gigantic wolf. Lots more action.The ending sets up another book. I won't ruin the ending for you. This book is good for young adults in jr. high school to develop their love of reading like I did 45 years ago.

Further, Dr. Dyer says to embrace the past and then get rid of it.Then Dr. Dyer goes on to explain the need for surrender in order to get closer to God. He says that most of our problems stem from the belief in two powers: Good vs. evil. There is only one power in the universe, and the only problem you have is the belief that you are separate from God.Dr. Dyer then teaches that emptying your mind through meditation (surrender) is the only way you can really come to know God.Then Dr. Dyer describes how to move to the higher frequencies (where one can be closest to God) He says that you must eliminate fear, shame, guilt (lowest frequencies) to joy, love and peace (highest frequencies) to be healed and have our problems solved.Finally, Dr. Dyer reiterates the teachings of St Francis and the benefits of thinking loving, positive thoughts, for this is how we become empowered. Here the focus is on applying love, where there is hate, light where there is darkness, and so on. Dr. Dyer suggests that by concentrating on power vs. force, we can earn respect, learn valuable life lessons, and move into a higher frequency.Those who are familiar with Dr. Dyers earlier works, like Erroneous Zones and Pulling Your Own Strings may not like this. I see this book along with Your Sacred Self as a positive move for Dr. Dyer. I also highly suggest the tape-Meditations For Manifesting for dramatic and rapid changes.Dr. Dyer, great book."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"What I got out of this book is that energy accompanies being in touch with the divine.

Dyer, known my many as the father of motovition has produced countless books, articles, recordings, lectures, and TV and radio appearances since the late '70's that have left his followers amazed with his mastery at articulating what most would think would be very difficult subjects.Dyer's work took a sharp shift a few years ago from psychological self help type work to spirutal and &quot;higher self&quot; guidance. Dyer's most recent work, There's a Spirutal Solution for Every Problem, is absolutely the crown jewel. I was left dumbfounded by his ability to make the reader understand deep philisophical concepts.This book will leave the reader seeing complex, so called &quot;problems&quot; in a whole new way. Dyer walks the reader through a path of seeing and knowing that problems are only illusions created in our minds and that any possible problem that a person can encounter will literally evaporate by following the principles taught in this, and other Wayne Dyer works.There's a Spiritual Solution for Every Problem is a necessity for anyone who believes that they have problems."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I read and loved Wayne Dyer's THERE'S A SPIRITUAL SOLUTION TOEVERY PROBLEM . . . one of the best books I have read in a longtime! . . . he shows how there's a spiritual force available to helpus, regardless of religion or whatever is bothering us (ill health,financial difficulties, etc.) . . . I liked the numerous examples,along with references to the Bible, Koran and many other similarworks . . . in reading this, I felt as if Dyer was talking directly tome . . . his insights into the human condition will certainlyget you thinking.There were many memorable passages . . . my problem is choosing just a few to highlight here . . . but try I must, so here goes:Coming to this awareness of being steadfast in abstaining from harmful thoughts is a potent tool for accessing a spiritual solution to problems involving relationships. When a person is talking to you and you are slipping into the mode of feeling angry about how you are being talked to, you can remind yourself in that instant to abstain from thinking harmful or angry thoughts. I find that it is quite effective to use the following words, first internally, and then I say them out loud. They are, &quot;You're right about that!&quot; Not sarcastically. Without rancor, I simply allow the other person to be right, which is all their ego really wants.Recently, my brother was telling me about all the people he was meeting who has prostate cancer. &quot;It's like an epidemic,&quot; he said. &quot;Three guys down the street, two at work, all in the past week or so.&quot; My immediate response to him was, &quot;I will not think thoughts of prostate cancer.&quot; When a friend who had recently had a hip replacement due to rheumatoid arthritis told me that with all my running I was a perfect candidate for a hip replacement, my immediate response was, &quot;I will not have a hip replacement. I don't do rheumatoid arthritis.&quot;Over the years I have had the experience on many occasions of people ordering products, sending me a check, and then a week or so later discovering that the person had insufficient funds to cover the costs of the materials I had purchased and mailed. There was a time when I reacted to this experience of being defrauded with complaints about how irresponsible and immoral this was. About five years ago I did an about-face. Every time this happened to me I mailed the person a free gift of an autographed book, and requested payment for the bounced check. The response was amazing. About ninety-eight percent of the people who received a free gift in response to their NSF check, not only returned the money, but took the time to write a lovely letter of apology as well. This was in contrast to the less then forty percent who made good on their bad checks previously. The old saying goes \\"Kill them with kindness.\\" I prefer \\"Connect to them with love and generosity,\\" or as Saint Francis would say, \\"Sow love.\\""},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I love Wayne Dyer books and have read many of them. But, this book just didn't do it for me. I love the premise of the book where he promotes positive thinking, higher energy levels, and not giving your energy to negative thoughts, since what you give out will come back to you. However, I had difficulty with 3 areas of the book: 1) Evil doesn't exist 2) The fact that Dyer never addresses the concept of free will, and 3) Illness is due to erroneous thinking.First, evil does exist and we see it every day...it's all around us. Denying it's existance is like sticking your head in the sand. Dyer says that evil cannot exist, since God created all things, and God is good, so why would a good God create evil? Well, I think the answer lies in free-will, which brings me to my second point. Although God is good, he also gave us free-will, which means that we are able to choose the path of God (good positive, energy) or something opposite of God, which would be evil. Dyer never addresses free-will in this book even though he continually quotes the bible and other spiritual/religious writings that do in fact address the concept of free-will in depth. How he can quote so many things from these books and yet deny the existance of free-will is beyond me.Finally, Dyer states that illness stems from erroneous thinking. While I do believe that many illness are brought on by negative thinking and stress (I do believe there is a mind/body connection), if you follow Dyer's theory on this than how is it that infants can get ill? Is an infant capable of thinking erroneously when he/she cannot even take care of him/herself? Dyer lightly brushes the surface of the issue regarding children and illnesses, but then totally dismisses the issue and moves on to the next topic without giving us a reason or answer. This proves to me that either Dyer is underminding the intelligence of the reader or doesn't know himself so he dismisses the issue.Finally, I do think that many things bad happen in our lives for a purpose, and that purpose is for our souls to grow and learn. Maybe this is why we get ill and the very reason why we have free-will. I have known a few people who were very positive about a terminal illness...did the whole imagery and positive visualization thing, and yet still passed away from their illness. Were these people just not thinking positively enough?? Instead, I believe their deaths were for a reason. Either for their soul to learn or for the souls of others to learn.Finally, there are many parts of this book that I enjoyed and will put into practice. I do like the whole concept of higher and lower energy frequencies. This concept did rang true with me. And, I do believe that what you give out in this world comes back to you. So, if you give out positive energy and thoughts, positive things will come back to you in some shape or form. In addition, I also do like the way he puts St. Francis's prayer into practice. It's always been one of my favorite prayers and the way that Dyer brings the prayer into real life scenarios is very uplifting.Overall, this book is good, but has a lot of holes in it, which left me with a lot of questions. I will continue to be a fan of Dyer, but I do think that some of his other books are more practical and even more spiritually uplifting."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"My cousin recently met Wayne Dyer and she asked him for a blessing. He replied, \\"You are a blessing.\\" My cousin has been continually struggling with cancer and certainly needed to hear this truth. She sent my dad an audio tape version of \\"There's a Spiritual Solution,\\" and I borrowed it. There is so much wisdom in these pages/audio tapes. (The tapes are from a PBS broadcast based on the book.) I was initially reluctant in believing that there are no just resentments...but he knows what he's talking about and helped me to see things differently.One of my favorite antidotes to discouragement in these tapes is Wayne's description of \\"the burning desire.\\" Wayne says, \\"the burning desire is like having an inner candle flame that never flickers. So the worst goes b/f you, this thing can't be put out. No one out there can tell you you can't do this or you can't have this. In fact, when other people do tell you you can't have it or you can't do it, all it does for those who have the burning desire is reinforce that this is something I am going to be able to accomplish. And I will use your skepticism and I will use the doubt that you provide to motivate me even further.\\" Talk about turning something on its head! (I remember Ted Turner likewise stated that he just loves when someone tells him he can't do something or someone will try to limit him in some way. He then just enjoys even more proving to himself that he can accomplish his goals and will use other people's doubt and lack of confidence in him as motivation. Those of us who have had our fair share of setbacks and naysayers really need to cling to this type of thinking!)The only problem with listening to these tapes is that I get choked up so easily, and there is a plethora of heartrending anecdotes that Wayne shares. Mr. Dyer has culled from many sources great wisdom and attitudes. I love the quote he included from \\"A Course in Miracles,\\" which states that you have no problems except in delusionally thinking that you are separate from your source."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I read many of the reviews here about this book with fascination. I have read just about every Dyer book out there, listened to every tape set and attended his seminars. I can say Dr. Dyer has gone through an evolutionary process and I have followed along with him, which is probably why I find his material seems to resonate with me. He first started with books that put forth \\"mind over matter\\" advice - you know \\"if you don't mind it doesn't matter\\" type of thinking. Dr. Dyer helped people to take control of their emotions and reactions in order to have better lives. This was a decidely more practical, psychological point of view. Over the years, Dr. Dyer became more spiritually aware and his work shifted toward tapping into our energy fields, higher self and God/Universe to tap into our potential. Some folks are at the stage where the earlier works will be of more value while others will find the newer material meets them where they are. This book met me where I was and I really value it. If you want concrete steps on how to work with your mind and emotions, read his earlier books. If you want a more \\"New Age\\" approach, for lack of a better term, then this book is excellent. All of his books have value, you just need to match them to where you are and where you are is exactly the place you need to be right now - there's no right or wrong place to be. It's also good to realize that no one author has \\"all the answers\\" and that all of Dyer's materials are another source of wisdom that you may or may not want to incorporate into your life right now."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"This book is so invigorating, so soul inspiring.I just can't say it all..this book has helped me many, many times.When a friend mentioned her mother being quite ill, I gave her the book. I was told her mother was exceptionally inspired by the book throughout her illness and recovery. .well she must love it as it was not returned.that's alright, I'll definitely buy another copy.I highly recommend this book to people who are happy and also people who are dealing with struggling, pain or any sufferings. It is hard to imagine, but a book CAN BRING COMFORT and wisdom in need."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I've enjoyed Dr. Dyer's work since the 1970s. Every one of his books has come to me at the perfect time, and the same is true here.My copy of There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem arrived shortly after September 11, 2001 (I had it on pre-order, and finalized the order on September 10).How I needed this wonderful book. . . especially in its wisdom in how to interpret tragedy, anger, fear, etc.Of course, There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem isn't only for those perplexed in how to deal with September 11, and the book was written much in advance of it, but I promise you: In the wake of disaster, this book will bring you what you need. You'll find answers, comfort, hope, and peace. The message is one we all need.Note: This book speaks to everyone, regardless of religion or religious background."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"This book is a great one by Wayne W. Dyer. It really hit home for me spiritually. I recommend this book to any one who is interested in spiritual growth. I have read this book over and over again and each time I get something new from it. I think it is really balanced. I like to flip through the pages at night and randomly pick a paragraph to read before going to sleep, then I meditate on it for a short while. I give the book 5 stars for being so positive. There is so much negativity out there, it is good to take a break from it and try and change MY view or judgement of it all. Thanks Wayne Dyer for this book! :-)"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I admit I am a Wayne Dyer fan. I saw him do a seminar in Denver based on this book which was a great intro. I bought the book, I highlighted tons of stuff in it.....I even got a couple of my adult children interested enough to read all or parts of it. That is saying a lot! The chapter on how you get what you really don't want is the best single chapter in a lot of spiritual self-help stuff I read in a long time! Read it and digest it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"After reading Dr. Dyer's book, you can easily see that we really have a great way to deal with life's conflicts...within ourselves. It was like a breath of fresh air and really helped me to understand that changing our perspective about what we think are &quot;problems&quot; in life can easily be resolved by &quot;going within&quot; and seeking the kind of divine spirituality that helps us realize that the same mind that created the problems can solve them too.A must read for anyone who would like to create peace in these stressful times."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I am now listening to the tapes for the second time. I think that they are absolutely wonderful and recommend them to everyone. I am a fan of Dr. Dyer and have purchased several of his tape selections--each set being better than the previous. I think that I will also buy the book (by the same name)."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I saw a part of Dr. Dyer's seminar on the Learning Channel one night and I knew that I had to get this book. It took me some time to read it, not because it was hard to read, but because it was so interesting that I had to take notes on the side and highlight certain sections. It is a great book if you are looking for peace in your life, a new direction and calmness. The priciples are nothing new but there are things that we take for granted for example the pricinple of positivity. We tend to concentrate our full energy on the negative aspects of life and our loved ones. When in reality what we are doing is attracting negativity and bringing it upon ourselves. How can we expect good things to happen to us if our thoughts and our aura are filled with negativity???This is a book that you need to read several times to grasp every time around different concepts and new meanings that can enlighten your life."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"What makes Wayne Dyer so lovable,( other than he was created that way,) is his use of personal experience and how it pertains to the material at hand. So many times in ordering tapes, I feel disappointed that the author/speaker seems to be talking at us instead of with us. Like Neal Donald Walsch, Dr. Dyer speaks of his humanness and how to incorporate the mundane life into a miraculous one with just the change of a thought. He addresses physical and emotional difficulties and how to begin to overcome them and well as constantly reiterating the value of acknowledging our Oneness. His truth is simple, but the truth is simple. The process of getting there is a different story, but in this set of tapes, I came away with one or two main thoughts and stories that will stay with me the rest of my life. And that's alot!"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I have read many books by Wayne Dyer and have had the good fortune to be at a number of his seminars. This book is a wonderful expression that provides the opportunity for learning how to apply and live with spiritual focus no matter what happens in life. One more time I got to move into the experience of a greater knowing of &quot;being the witness&quot; which he has mentioned in a number of his books.Thanks Wayne, God Bless."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I loved the book. And I believe that it really has life altering possibilities for those who honestly want to change. For me - well I think that I picked it up in my local bookshop at just the right moment in my life. That is when I brought it home and began to read it, it seemed that the &quot;let go and let God&quot; angle had great meaning in my life. I believe that the good doctor has a deep love for mankind and this love shines through every page of this wonderfull bedside book."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"DR. Dyer does it again with this wisdom packed, to the point, no nonsense approach to becoming a spiritual and loving human being. He truely puts all of himself and what he believes into this superbly structured and well written book. If one feels it may be time for a change back to what is really important in this thing called life, and wants a good place to start getting in touch with spiritual forces, buy this book today. There truly is a spiritual solution to every problem if one just opens one's mind."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I've been a fan of Wayne Dyer for many years and this is his finest work yet. A veritable goldmine of practical as well as timeless spiritual techniques that will assist anybody who is traveling the road to enlightenment. His spirit comes through on each tape and the wisdom cannot be found from any other spiritual teacher. Kudos to Wayne for another winner! I'm a fan for life!!!"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"It is almost impossible to not listen to this twice in a row in order to fully appreciate this wonderful presentation. Wayne gives his most recent view of the Universe and it's a very real and loving one. If you have never listened to Wayne Dyer, this one might be a bit much to handle as your first encounter with him, but for the seasoned fan, you will love it! I found myself not wanting to finish the tape set, hoping it would last longer. His only fault seems to be in rarely promoting others when what they offer is really too good to be true. He's great, but do your own thinking about what feels right."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I consider myself a spiritual person so when Dr. Dyer came out with this seminar on tape I just had to have it. As I listened to the tapes I felt as though he was talking to me, personally. I started looking at things in different ways. I could see how this program was having a positive effect on me.One day I was playing one of the tapes in the car. I thought for sure my husband, not the spiritual type, would ask me to turn it off. After about 5 minutes he said, &quot;turn it UP so that I can hear it better.&quot; He even wanted to discuss some of the key issues. I was shocked. Normally he hates all of the 'spiritual' stuff.Since then I have listed to these tapes with many of my friends and I have learned that There is a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem touches us all, where ever we are on our journey, and gives us a new perspective, a new way to see our world. In doing so we learn what it is to be at peace.I highly recommend this seminar on tape to everyone looking for peace and happiness. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I bought this book because it was supposed to tell an uplifting story. I've bought numerous Wayne Dyer books and tapes before, and always loved his message. This book intregued me, so I went ahead and read it. The only conclusion I came up with was, &quot;Why would such a positive man write such a negative book?&quot; Sure, this book tells an interesting story, but the story itself is the most depressing, and upsetting story I think I've ever read in my life. It's the kind of book you read, maybe cry, and will upset you to no end. It did for me. Actually, I couldn't even finish reading this book because it was just too painful to read. To anyone who was 'touched' by this book, bless you. All it did was make me sick to my stomach."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"With a title like \\"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem,\\" I wanted to agree with Wayne Dyer. I don't. While the title is true in and of itself, the application found here is not. He contradicts and misapplies Catholic theology, and his books loses its value.Confusing feeling good about oneself with spiritual wholeness, we are treated to a misdirection of what it takes to find inner peace and a successful life.Though favoring heavily St. Francis' teaching, Wayne Dyer seems to be missing what Francis' was talking about.\\"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace\\" is the oft-quoted phrase of Francis, but Dyer isn't directing his allegiance to the Lord like the famous Catholic was. We are told to find our allegiance and god is inner peace, not the Lord of St. Francis. Committed Christians and Catholics are probably offended by this book.In the same all-gods-are-one god flavor of the month ideology as Caroline Myss, Dyer's book loses its credibility by having nothing certain to assert. Instead, his book comes across as positive sounding as Norman Vincent Peale, but without the foundation beneath it.Strip away the self-promotional tone and garbled pop-theology, and \\"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem\\" is just another positive thinking book.Thinking objectively about problems is key. Any leadership book by authors from Carnegie to Maxwell will tell you that. And, not being emotionally taken in by failure is also important. That's why you are better off reading Maxwell or Carnegie. They say it better, with a better understanding of the pulse of problem resolution.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Wayne Dyer had many interesting observations and viewpoints in his early books (&quot;Pulling Your Own Strings&quot;, &quot;The Sky's The Limit&quot;, and &quot;Your Erroneous Zones&quot;) which makes it so sad that he milks his wonderful early legacy with some bland new release every couple of years. Like 1992's Dyer release &quot;Real Magic&quot;, this book is so politically correct and so careful not to insult anyone it is a waste of time. DO give his books originally published in 1980 and before careful consideration."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I have read almost everything that Dyer has written - even have a 10 cd pack of his lectures.I was pretty disappointed in this book. It was the first book that I read after graduating with my MBA and I was really excited. I ended up skimming it and reading the section titles...Try some of his other books instead."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"In the public library I noticed that there were a few books for sale on a table. There was a tourist's guild to Great Brittain, a romantic novel, and others. One book was a beautiful hardbound copy with nice dust jacket of \\"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem\\" by Dr. Wayne Dyer. I agree that there is a spiritual solution to every problem, but it took me less than five minutes to evaluate this book as New Age hokum and nonsense. Maybe my master's degree in library science helped me assess the book so quickly. On page 90 Dr. Dyer places Jesus and Buddha on equal footing. One has long since turned to dust after misleading millions, while the other sits at the right hand of God, alive forever after showing the true path to millions or billions. The truth of the Bible is objectively proved by all fields of human knowledge--something no one can claim about Buddhism.I asked the three ladies at the desk how much the books cost, and one of them told me, \\"Fifty cents.\\" I handed her two quarters, then ripped the book to pieces and threw it into the waste basket. All three ladies stared with open mouths. I said, \\"People need Jesus Christ, not New Age nonsense. If I can prevent one person being led astray, it is worth much more than fifty cents.\\""},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"...

He is not talking garbage, but neither are his views anything like justified. They are, nevertheless, interesting and I am sure anyone can find value in some of the ideas.I was powerfully struck by the poem \\"I am\\" from one of his readers. So much so, I copied it and keep it in my own personal library. \\"I am. The 'I' that is me - you cannot see. You see only the form that you think is me. This form that you see, will not always be. The 'I' that is me - lives eternally.\\" -- Mary Lou Van Atta.The idea of my ego getting in the way of my peace also hit home with me. After considering this, when some driver cuts me off, or when the weather doesn't cooperate with my plans, I now ask myself, \\"WHO are YOU? Do you really expect the world to conform to YOU?\\" It helps."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I just bought this book and felt a real freedom from skimming through it's pages.

When you apply his words to your life with full honesty and stay on purpose, your problems seem to melt away. More and more I am realizing the true meaning of \\"be still and know that I am God\\". Being silent and connecting with God for just a few minutes a day being totally aware of his existence, helps you to be calm and loving towards the pitfalls of life.

I found this valuable because I did not know about these other people.But I found myself thinking that Dyer had done a mediocre job of interpreting their work.Chapter 6 contains some very useful advice which, once again, draws from a number of other authors. If you read only one chapter in this book, this is the one to read.In Part Two, Dyer attempts to show practical ways to implement the prayer of Saint Francis and provides anecdotal evidence to show that these methods are effective. I found this valuable because it had never occurred to me to put The prayer of St. Francis into practice. It had been a source of inspiration, but I never thought of it as an action plan. Since it so obviously IS an action plan, I'm wondering now how I could have missed that.Although Dyer's efforts to implement the prayer are well worth reading, I suspect that the average person could do much better for himself/herself by contemplating their own plan for implementing the prayer of St. Francis.Throughout the book, I often got the impression that Dyer has only a superficial understanding of some of the concepts he attempts to convey here. And I occasionally found some of his ideas foolish, nave, and even foolhardy. The incident where he believes he disbursed a kegger party by sending love to the revellers is an example of questionable judgement.Nonetheless, I think just about anybody would benefit from studying this book."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I have read several of Dr Dyer's books in the past and have found them often to be exactly what I need to 'put it all in perspective'. And Spiritual Solution... is another sterling example. While I am listening to these tapes, I am taken to a place which I know is the truth of my God-essense. For me his words eloquently, gracefully, and often humoroursly assist me in this 'remembering'. He incorporates inspiring words from many other teachers (poets, philosphers, and people he has encountered on this path) which are very effective in bringing home his messages on many levels. I will listen to these tapes over and over."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Dr. Dyer did a fantastic job with this presentation concerning problem solving from a spiritual perspective. He covered many of the more difficult lessons with ease and simplicity. His examples fully demonstrate the spiritual lessons, and his sense of comedy keeps everything interesting. The basis of the subject matter is that everything begins from spirit and manifests itself into the material world. This is not &quot;new agey&quot; or flighty, but a study of what reality actually consists of. Thank you Dr. Dyer for putting into words what I've felt spritually all these years, but was unable to fully express."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"This is without a doubt, the crowning achievement to an impressive career. In a word, unbelievable. Wayne has a way of delivering a message that is often &quot;out there&quot; - always a step ahead of his contemporaries, and always creating those &quot;ah-ha&quot; moments. He is entertaining, informative and literally awe inspiring. Wayne breaks new ground here and he cautions you to listen with an open mind, not with attachment. You will be delighted with this powerful and provocative message. I have been a loyal follower of Dr. Dyer's tape series since I first purchased &quot;Secrets of the Universe&quot; more than ten years ago. I own all successive releases and each continues to surpass its forerunner. Wayne always surprises and amazes, but most of all he always opens new doors. A real gem!"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Dr. Dyres' wit and wisdom has delivered another important program.

This one I believe was put out in 2000. He reveals in the beginning of this CD that he had already written this book when he experienced a heart attack. Which was a piece of information that despite all the information that I have listened to and read from him he had never mentioned. The first part of the CD is dedicated to Pata&ntilde;jali who was some kind of yoga master, I am not sure I get that but this portion of the CD but is deep and spiritual.Yet my favorite part of this program is the second. It explains the prayer of Saint Francis, Could not nothing be better?let me be an instrument of your peace............."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I bought this as a gift knowing that it will enhance the life of my friend tremendously.

It is easy to read and understand.The book gave me tools to survive in difficult times. Wayne Dyer's writing gives personal data that widens our abilityto understand spirit and allowing it to impact our every action. Dyer's writing falls back to fundamental yet important advice for navigating through problems with family, friends, and work relationships. This book also lifts you to a higher more spiritual plane. A beautiful book that belongs in every libraryand would be a beautiful book to give as a gift."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"This is a wonderful book. I particularly love the story of Dr. Dyer carrying the man up the stairs at Assis. He is a very profound spiritual master. I can't wait for his next effort."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"The tape would have been much more effective if Dr. Dyer would refrain from the useless sidebar commentaries. He will begin to discuss a topic and then digress and tell 2-3 stories before coming back to the original topic. After a while, you totally forgot what his original intent was. The material is very thought provoking, Dyer just needs to stay focused on the points he wishes to make."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Wayne Dyer is truly a mystical beacon for our world today. He reveals many possibilities for those on the spiritual path and for those wanting to learn more about spirituality without conventional dogma and sectarianism.Mr. Dyer has become more spiritually advanced with each passing book and lecture. He combines the spiritual wisdom of all sagesand mystics of all countries and all ages to enlighten those willing to learn and grow spiritually.His extensive and inclusive mystical knowledge is a definite indication of his advanced stage on the spiritual path, and his helping service of humanity to advance and become spiritually aware is another.For people dedicated to the inclusive love and wisdom of the spiritual path and the furthering of their soul growth, I whole heartedly recommend the Rosicrucian organization AMORC (800-88-AMORC). Call for a free brochure, and discover how you can learn and ascend spiritually."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I tried very hard to like this book but was quickly turned off by Dr. Dyer's protrayal of &quot;low level&quot; and &quot;high level&quot; frequencies that supposedly mirror different qualitative levels of thought. From these essentially unsupported constructs, he provides advice for living as if the entire structure is an a priori given. The commentary is very shallow bordering upon new age pop psychology. I found very little depth in the first one hundred and twenty pages and finally gave up on the book. If you are interested in something much more substantial and helpful, study more well thought out Zen or Buddhist texts that provide much more substance but do a much better job of conveying the ideas that I believe Dr. Dyer is trying to share."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Despite the basic premise of this book, there is a spiritual solution to every problem, this self-help book flops. Dyer has taken the Prayer of Saint Frances and turned it into a big money maker for him. Save your cash and just read the prayer! What I found particularly insulting about this book is Dyer's message to depressed people to &quot;just get over it&quot;, as if depression were not a chemical imbalance or a serious medical condition. Dyer makes some good points in this books: instead of expecting to BE loved, GIVE love. But the endless repitition and the drivel about &quot;faster and slower vibrations of energy&quot; make this book a must miss."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I really wasn't a fan of Dr. Wayne Dyer until I read this book and used his Meditation tape-Meditation for Manifesting.In There Is A Siritual Solution For Every Problem, Dr. Dyer starts off by telling us that the numer 1 thing to do in order t reach spiritual consciouness is to let the past go. Further, Dr. Dyer says to embrace the past and then get rid of it.Then Dr. Dyer goes on to explain the need for surrender in order to get closer to God. He says that most of our problems stem from the belief in two powers: Good vs. evil. There is only one power in the universe, and the only problem you have is the belief that you are separate from God.Dr. Dyer then teaches that emptying your mind through meditation (surrender) is the only way you can really come to know God.Then Dr. Dyer describes how to move to the higher frequencies (where one can be closest to God) He says that you must eliminate fear, shame, guilt (lowest frequencies) to joy, love and peace (highest frequencies) to be healed and have our problems solved.Finally, Dr. Dyer reiterates the teachings of St Francis and the benefits of thinking, loving, positive thoughts, for this is how we become empowered. Here the focus is on applying love, where there is hate, light where there is darkness, and so on. Dr. Dyer suggests that by concentrating on power vs. force, we can earn respect, learn valuable life lessons, and move into a higher frequency.Those who are familiar with Dr. Dyers earlier works, like Erroneous Zones and Pulling Your Own Strings may not like this. I see this book alog with Your Sacred Self as a positive move for Dr. Dyer. I also highly suggest the tape-Meditations For Manifesting for dramatic and rapid changes.Dr. Dyer, great book."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I have read the book, watched the DVD and have been able to put ego in it's place and within the silence, hear what matters most. Ego is something that needs to be worked on everyday, as there are always challenging moments that can easily bring that ego or need to be right into play and thus, in a moment, we disconnect from Source. Trusting in the Source is truly an awakening. Letting go and letting God, needs to be a daily discipline until it becomes a natural path without thought.My daughter said to me when she was only 7 .. \\"Dad, I don't want to grow up ... why don't you grow down\\" .. here was a child in a happier spiritual place than I was. At age 7 she became one of my mastermind teachers and I the student.The Power of Intention is a book that should be reread many times, it's just that good.

He is genuine in every way."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Wayne wows me again! Excellent tape set, I've listened to it many times through. These tapes bring showering and scrubbing the toilet to a new spiritual level. I find Buddha in the bathtub, Shiva in the shower, quotes from the Tao while making the tacos. Wayne is da man, he shows us dat we can....find a spiritual solution to every problem. Know what I'm sayin?!"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"While I enjoyed the entire book, the exquisite second section-- his meditation on the prayer by St. Francis--gave me a wonderful rush of love and optimism as I read and savored it. I'm a Baha'i, this book helped me to more firmly and joyfully grasp the teachings of my faith, even though Dr. Dyer is not promoting any particular religion. He is promoting spiritual truth, which is the same in all faiths, when one looks closely and dispassionately to see it. His quotes from many faiths and inspiring thinkers, offered with his illuminating, lovely commentary, create a potent effect. Thank you again, Wayne Dyer."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I listened to the CD recording of &quot;There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem&quot;. My first reaction was that Dyer's voice was often as helpful as the words of his book! You can sense his genuine peace and positive, hopeful nature, and that is contagious. Dyer's central message that we are always connected to God, and that we should approach life with compassion and a positive nature, is far more profound than it sounds. The only drawback to Dyer's writings is that they are occasionaly not completely realistic and he does tend to simplify. This is why I couldn't quite give the book 4 stars, but I still think it is a great and uplifting message and definitely worth a read (or listen)."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"I have purchased and listened to all of Wayne's Tape series and this is the best. He does not repeated himself which he sometimes does and every word is GREAT.

I have already listened to all the tapes twice and on my weekend roadtrip will listen again! It is worth twice the price!"},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Wayne Dyer has written a gem. This book is especially recommended for people who are somewhat dissatisfied with their current living situation. Let it be weight, health, social situations, financial, or whatever. Like the bible says, the sick need a doctor. I have had a negative perception toward the majority of people for the bulk of my 31 years of existence. I had always wondered, &quot;is this the best there is?&quot; What this book teaches the reader is that all problems that you have are merely perceptions. What we think about the situation reflects on how our situation really works out to.There are many important lessons one can learn from reading this book. Perhaps the most important idea the book manifests is how people should become an instrument of peace. We come across many situations in life where we are able to choose between a peaceful resolve or a negative one. Too often we choose the negative one.Read this book with an open mind. I doubt you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Been a follower of Wayne Dyer for many years and have read most all his works.

Just can't put this book down."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"Take what you need and throw the rest out. Say what you want about Dyer. He has some good insights. The spiritual side cannot be ignored, even though the scientists have a heck of a time trying to define it. I like the quotes from writers and philosophers he interjects into his talks.You may be a bit taken aback when he talks about the \\"vibrations\\" ... low vibrations represent spiritual atmosphere's we should try to avoid, sort along the lowest common denominator of Maslow's hierarchy, and higher vibrations are a pseudo-scientific way to grasp what the scientific definition of high level spirituality might be. Kind of hard to understand, but I know what he is grasping at, trying to define spirituality in a scientific way when there are simply not the words.Dyer is one of a kind and his basic message is that the spiritual world should not be lost in such a materialistic, science based. Dyer is not afraid to talk about this stuff even though some may think he sounds very crazy, flightly if you will, in his attempts to articulate all these heady thoughts."},{"Title":"There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem","review":"This is a great series of tapes put out by Wayne Dyer. In this program he covers all areas of life, health, enlightenment, prosperity, love, happiness and many other areas.If you live with doubt and feel disconnected spiritually, this is the program for you!Wayne has always had a gift of making spirituality very, very accessable and even fun. These tapes are a great example of that.As usual, he also directs you to a vast array of resources that even go beyond his teachings and directs you to other great books and teachers out there to continue your spiritual practices. Also, some of the current scientific proof for understanding the power of Spirit.You will find many upbeat stories and explanations of manifesting your destiny in these cassettes."},{"Title":"Lost and Found","review":"Attention grabbing from the first page, and just keeps getting better.

After reading it I came away with an appreciation of a well run British division in WWII.The book focuses on the period of Normandy to the end of the war. As such the brief details of the campaign in Norway, and service in Iceland should be viewed as bonuses.The good points of the book include the attention to the overall picture. This is not about glory, but men at the &quot;sharp end&quot; of war. As such, there are failures of high ranking officers who are sent home, of soldiers forced at gunpoint back to the front by their officers, of hero's, and normal people. The constant drain of casualties over 11 months of combat and the effect on the men. The importance of little things, like baths, and hot food and the joy of liberated people are all here.As such I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the effect of war on people and soldiers.The book contains numerous maps, and these are of reasonable quality.There is only one thing I would add to the book and that is a list of acronyms would make it more accessable to those without a working knowledge of the British army, although I believe that most of these can be puzzled out, there really isn't an excuse for making the book less accessable."},{"Title":"INVENTORS","review":"Have you ever had the desire to become an inventor, but felt discouraged and too inferior to excel in something that you felt was over your head? Don't be. If you were to look into the lives of inventors, both great and small, you would probably be encouraged. Why? Because you would see that they did not walk on flower strewn roads to success, that their lives were riddled with challenge and difficulty (Robert Kearns, anyone?) and were not an instant success, but usually were of humble beginning. The success stories of inventors today only exist because of the perseverance, determination, ingenuity, diligence, God's blessing, and plain old hard work of all them. By looking back on their lives and example, we have a good head start.Allow me to start off by saying that this book is an introduction into the subject of inventors, so it's rather simple. That is not to say that it wasn't good, because it was a good book, but if you're looking for something that is of great depth, you should look elsewhere.The illustrations, photos, and paintings in the book are very good in helping to set an intriguing atmosphere of learning and getting a feel for the past. The book was written well and accompanies the illustrations well.One of the biggest complaints I have is not with the book, per say, but with publishers. This book, which mainly centers on American inventors, was not printed in this land that we live in, but was outsourced and printed in Mexico! I don't know what your reactions and thoughts about this are, but I was angered and slightly disgusted. To me, it shows at least an indifferent and uncaring attitude toward working Americans and the welfare of our nation.With all this being said, I wouldn't really recommend to you to buy it (unless you really want it), but instead if you can, I recommend you take it out of your local library.And with that, this review comes to an end.-Jake SmithersP.S.: Oh, and by the way. The invention that Mr. Crapper was responsible for inventing was the early version of the toilet. Thank the Lord for him!"},{"Title":"Medjugorje: The Untold Story","review":"Perhaps the earliest English language account disputing the claim that the Blessed Virgin Mary is appearing at Medjugorje. Jones visits Medjugorje and concludes she isn't appearing, then chronicles the problems with the apparition and its adherents. His account is not dry and may infuriate those who are unequivocally committed to Medjugorje. Anyone interested in Medjugorje would be fortunate to locate a copy. For another treatment of the Medjugorje phenomenon and associated claims of other apparitions by the same author ten years after this early work, try his The Medjugorje Deception."},{"Title":"Medjugorje: The Untold Story","review":"First of all the term \\"easily enthused\\" is judgmental so anything the reviewer said after that is dismissed by me. I was not easily enthused in 1987 when I discerned Medjugorje's truth or falseness. Thanks to the Oprah Winfrey show on the Power of Prayer in which all the guests on her show were Medjugorje related including Wayne Weible, who was a Protestant journalist looking for a story. He has committed his life to Medjugorje, meaning Mary and her messages. It took me much time and from 6 months to a year to discern. I am naturally skeptical. I agree the local Bishop who is now dead has a convincing argument. BUT, so do the seers. The oft quoted \\"a tree is known by its fruits\\" came from the Virgin Mary so I would be careful in maligning it. Its also in the bible of course. Mary is a bible person BIGTIME, asking us to read from it daily. The purported pregnancies, even if they be proven as real events, have nothing to do with Mary and much to do with Satans appearances in the world. Satan didn't die when Mary began to appear in Medjugorje, in fact she warned us of his extreme obstinate aggression in these times when he is losing the power overheard by Pope Leo XIII (google that for more info). Question- how do 6 people look at the same point in space? This is impossible if you think about it. Try it with 2 people. 2 people can't do it. How does the pupil not contract when light is shined in it? These things were tested and proven at Medjugorje. The devil you say can do such things. Does the devil say to read the bible daily and love God and your neighbor and pray to God 3 hours a day? A house divided will fall says Jesus. It \\"ain't\\" the devil and that's obvious so drop that easily used argument in favor of the facts. Why did Pope John Paul II tell the then local Bishop Zanic to \\"do it over\\" when he came up with a negative stance on Medjugorje. Not once but 3 times. Do you trust Pope John Paul II or Bishop Zanic? No answer needed here of course. Medjugorje is real and those who find it false lose the value of Mother Mary's advice and guidance. If you find Medjugorje false I say to you what Pope John Paul said. Do it over and come back when you get it right. Then try to do what she says. That's really the crux of the matter. \\"Living the messages\\" which include 3 hours of daily prayer including Mass and the rosary, DAILY, is difficult. If a priest gets a nun pregnant it fits in well with our SEX is God, Viagra crazy (why aren't we at least embarrassed by these commercials) society. But it doesn't mean Mary concurred with their sin. Just as the Jesus selected apostle Judas' love of money doesn't prove Jesus wasn't really the son of God. I am grateful to have discerned the truth of Medjugorje, and not easily, (as it takes much time and effort) especially with books around like this one that are sincere but in error.A lady at church told me to Google Jones and Medjugorje as she is a disbelieve of Medjugorje. I came up with Michael K. Jones and E. Michael Jones. One Jones is pro and the other con. Thank God and Our Lady I KNOW she is appearing. Thanks to the Holy Spirit. Ask the Holy Spirit. the Spirit of Truth, if she is appearing and pray diligently before the Blessed Sacrament (exposed or not) and then as you read and search anddiscern, possibly many hours, you will find the TRUTH. Examine both sides of the story though. Remember as you read and discern!!! Zanic rhymes with Panic and Weible rhymes with Bible. Would that it were that easy. Makes as much sense as priests getting nuns pregnant affecting ones discernment."},{"Title":"Medjugorje: The Untold Story","review":"Medjugorje is the biggest farce in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, and its easily-enthused devotees get hysterical if you even DARE suggest that the \\"apparitions\\" are not really from the Blessed Virgin Mary. The widespread disobedience to the calm and sound reason of the local bishops is the greatest proof that these events are not inspired by God. Advocates are always crying out about the \\"fruits\\" of Medjugorje... They conveniently ignore, however, the fruits of the wombs of 3 nuns impregnated by Medjugorje priests, and other pedophile priests who use Medjugorje as their sanctuary for themselves and their teenage lovers, for starters. Medjugorje will be squashed when the events of Garabandal will achieve their finality in the promised Warning and the Miracle."},{"Title":"African Ice","review":"4.5 stars!A smart, savvy thriller that will keep you up at night until the last page has turned, Jeff Buick's African Ice is an adventurous tale of conspiracies, murder and the search for treasure.

The foreshadowing was solid, the plot twists kept me on my toes and the ending had a quiet justice about it.If you're looking for a fast-paced adventure through the jungles in search of the motherlode of diamonds while the characters are being hunted by aborigines, hitmen and a deceitful employer, pick up African Ice.

When they're met by their military escort at the Congo border, they find all their weapons and equipment have been tampered with. When this \`escort' service tries to kill everyone in the expedition, there's no question that Kerrigan has set them up. Trying to get out of Cairo is no picnic either since Kerrigan has another attack force of killers ready to do what the Congolese force couldn't do. And that's just the first half of the story; problems and surprises continue as they try to take Kerrigan down.This is a fast-paced book filled with non-stop action and tension.

Diamonds give untold power and wealth to those who possess them. In \\"African Ice,\\" the author has pitted his protagonists against nature and man in a game of survival riddled with betrayal and greed. Through the adventure the reader comes away with a better understanding of the diamond business and the true exploiters of Africa: mining corporations, political opportunists and mercenaries.Samantha Carlson represents the modern woman who believes she can do anything she chooses to do while retaining her feminity. She does not act like a man to compete in a man's world. She follows her own compass in an engineering profession few women care to embrace--geology. This makes her no less fearless than the first women aviators or astronauts, just confident in her abilities, knowledge and potential. And she has reached the pinnacles of success because her intuitiveness has kept her alive. She finds a soul mate in Travis McNeil, a former Navy Seal who now provides security for \\"at-risk\\" mining executives, and together they outsmart and outmaneuvre the nastiest of villains with wit, candor and courage.Jeff Buick is a remarkable story teller, who is equally at home behind the points of view of a man or woman. He's a sponge for authentic details that meld character and setting into a lifelike experience for the reader as well as a marathon master of pacing, action and suspense, which delivers blood-curdling twists. By his own admission, he loves what he does, and this reader was thoroughly entertained. I look forward to reading all of his books."},{"Title":"African Ice","review":"Sorry to all the folks who liked this one, but it fails with me...Reasons:1) As one reviewer pointed out, the author seems to have limited knowledge of weapons (as any ex-military spec-ops type guy will confirm). For example, at one point (in Cairo, I beleive) McNeil and his remaining SEAL partner are armed with \\"GLock A-17's\\" and McNeil at one point \\"flips the safety off\\" or some such. Well, the Glock family of pistols have what Glock calls a Safe Action, in the trigger assembly. There is no 'safety' lever or button to switch off per se, as in a Beretta 92F or a 1911 .45...I've heard there IS a safety that can be special-ordered from Glock in Austria, but from what I've heard, it's a key type safety, not a lever, button or switch on the gun...Also, the 5.56 is NOT an optimal jungle weapon, as has been demonstrated many times. It IS a highly accurate round (in a well-designed rifle), but is designed for medium range to long range combat, not close-in work...A much better choice - and one well known to the SEALs of Team Six - would be the H&K; family of submachine guns in 9mm...2) On entry into Rwanda or the Congo (I can't recall which right off), the team and Dr. Samantha Carlson pass thru customs and passport control, and one of the SEALs seems not to understand why he has to give up one of his nice shirts from his overnight bag to the passport guy, despite the thinly veiled hint from the official, and Samantha 'rescues' him. Well, anyone who's been to those places (and an anti-terrorist expert from SEAL Team 6 would know this) understands the \\"tax\\" you pay in those situations. A bit of money, some cigarettes perhaps, a nice bit of clothing...SOMETHING to grease the palms of 'bureacracy' is what gets you though in the Third World...that part of the story was just plain silly. That SEAL operator would have known that from past experience (as the book indicated he had plenty of).3) The last fight scene between SEAL McNeil and \\"Delta Force\\" man Garret-whatever was so short as to be almost anti-climatical in my opinion. Almost as though the author just wanted to get the book done and over with (and in truth, any discerning reader knows from the beginning who would win. There's this beautiful, accomplished, independently-wealthy PhD lady, the tough SEAL leader, the bad guy billionaire with alll the resources the CIA would envy, etc etc etc)...it's just too pat.4) The book appears to be loosely based in plot (at the least the big picture) on Frederick Forsyth's novel \\"The Dogs of War\\", and related to the 1970's film \\"The Wild Geese\\". Author Buick clearly borrowed that theme !Don't waste money on this.

How a loosely-bound population of farmers, tradesmen, shopkeepers, merchants, religious freedom-seekers, and just plain misfits from the European sphere, barely out of its own Enlightenment, collectively realized their future free from the bonds of King and Parliament is the core of \\"The Glorious Cause.\\" Their path to independence was far from sure on the face of it; doubt plagued them at every turn; loyalties not just to Crown and Country, but generational affection for their British heritage, burdened their hearts; and parochial and regional differences -- often fundamental to their core economic and social beliefs -- threatened to cleave communities and states one from the other. It was, in the end, 'reflection and choice' that bound the colonies into one nation, though 'accident and force' had their roles. Middlekauf has captured, gloriously, the ascent of America's Glorious Cause. More than history, it is a story of triumph, and well worth your attention."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauff's contribution to the Oxford History of the United States series focuses on the Revolutionary War period, 1763-1789. Its strength in storytelling is offset by the apparent absence of a unifying interpretation. If Middlekauff has an organizing argument, it's that the struggle for independence was nurtured by Americans' puritan heritage. The connection between American discontent and the values of hard work and earnestness handed down from the early New England settlers is brought up repeatedly though never sufficiently elaborated.The book's biggest strength, its solid presentation of the political and military history of the period, can also be considered its biggest weakness. Middlekauff just doesn't include enough social, economic, and cultural history to supplement his high political narrative. An unfortunate side-effect of this is the book's tendency to become bogged down in details at the expense of the bigger picture. Pages and pages in describing how anti-stamp mobs assailed various politicians, but not one mention of republican motherhood or changing notions of citizenship? That's a problem and one that Middlekauff fails to correct in his revised edition.For those looking for an excellently detailed narrative of high politics during the period, look no further. Just remember you're getting only a slice of the story of Revolutionary America."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This book is an excellent way to begin study of the Revolutionary era. While it covers the entire period (from the end of the French and Indian War in 1763 to the Ratification of the Constitution of 1787, its primary focus is on the war and the events leading up to the war. Coverage of the events leading up to the war is solid, with excellent character sketches of the British ministers who attempted to resolve the conflict favorably, and a terrific narrative of revolutionary events which unfolded during the Stamp Act crisis. The writing on these subjects is exceptionally lucid and the narrative is gripping.The book is not as strong, however, in its coverage of events after 1776. Without a doubt, Middlekauff's explication of battle tactics and strategies is exceptional, and military historians will appreciate the detail and care, but it does come at the expense of better coverage of political and social events of the late 1770s and 1780s, which are covered in a few sections, leaving some to be desired for those interested in governance and social events during the war. In fairness, the Revised and Expanded edition adds several new perspectives (such as medicine in the Revolutionary War), but still leaves the reader needing more. Middlekauff's coverage of the Convention and its ratification is also a bit lacking, understandable as the book has already covered many pages by that point.The bottom line: an excellent introduction that I highly recommend. For those new to the era, it lays the issues out clearly in an excellent narrative. It will give ample coverage of the War and its causes, but it needs to be supplemented by a firm understanding of the era's political theory. Bailyn's Ideological Origins, or Wood's Creation of the American Republic will serve you well in supplementing this text."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Enthralling, but probably not the book for someone who's read extensively on the subject already. And since the title describes, without irony, Middlekauff's overall attitude toward the American Revolution, not for someone seeking a radical or revisionist history of the events.Nor is it an exhaustive social, political, or military study. (The text runs under 700 pages.) Yet as it shifts between those disciplines, Middlekauff adapts his vocabulary to the task. Descriptions of military actions employ the terms of the battlefield and I doubt that Stephen Ambrose or Max Hastings could bring the actions more to life than Middlekauff. Larger-than life men are described in human terms that also inspire. I felt perfectly confident with his expertise, whether describing the demographics of the colonies, the debates in the Continental Congress or the bloodshed on the battlefields.To get a flavor for Middlekauff's style, read the section on George Washington's early life, or von Steuben's role in training the army at Valley Forge. This is writing with red blood in its veins. Not the complete story, but what a great place to start!"},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I am reviewing the Kindle Edition, so if there are changes from the print edition I apologize. I thought the book was a well written overview of the time period, but there were certain events, such as Benedict Arnold's plot that were completely skipped, while others, like much of the war to tell the truth, seemed to be glossed over quickly. I know that in any book covering such a long time period choices have to be made on what to discuss and what not to discuss, but this book seems to make some of the wrong choices. It seems to follow a general trend in history books over the past fifty years or so to de-emphasize the military events and to try to give us a snapshot of how groups who weren't directly fighting were involved with the war. While this is nice, I think the author went too far with the homefront snapshots during the war period. All in all a well written and informative book however."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Professor Middlekauf is a superlative writer; and this text reads more like a novel than anything akin to the dry, pedantic tomes normally attributed to academic historians. There are several notable features of this book which outstand it: (1) The writing is narrative and therefore is presented as a continuous plot-line in motion; (2) The unfolding of events in England prior to the outbreak of hostilities is presented, nearly in parallel, with the reactions (and counter-reactions) in the American colonies, thus telescoping the cause-effect relationship into a seamless synthesis; (3) There are interesting, but quite relative, asides from the main narrative of the events leading to the Revolutionary War, and the War itself, such as the discussion on the perennial problem with colonial militia deserters, such as the fractiousness of the Continental Congress in balancing Northern and Southern colonial interests, such as the quite intriguing fact that the British Royal Army not only had black soldiers as regular enlisteds, but also used them to 'discipline' white army regulars, usually by beatings.Professor Middlekauf is a refreshing wit, which is on light display throughout the work. This text is amply footnoted (much more convenient for reference than endnotes). The author strikes a fine balance (not always an easy task) between providing his interpretations of events and leaving the reader to develop her own thoughts.This is the first text in a series upon American History by Oxford University Press, and as such, it takes into account a wide range of scholarship. This emphasis makes the book entirely suitable for the layreader who is searching for a single-volume text upon the major (and many of the minor) historical themes. Moreover, Oxford University Press, the publisher, uses an easy-to-read typeset with generous margins, so that this text, though lengthy, is eminently readable.I would also heartily recommend two other texts in the series, the ones immediately following this one in the historical chronology--that is, the book by Gordon S. Wood, treating of the early Republic (1789-1815), and the book by Daniel Walker Howe, treating of the period from 1815 to 1848."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is one of my favorite books on the Revolutionary war. Its long, again one of those books you might read every night for a while (or if you're lucky on vacation). But it gives you a great view into the decisions our nation's made and a view of events before things seemed inevitable. It's priced well enough that it's definitely worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I finished reading The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution 1763 - 1789 by Robert Middlekauff. It is a well-written book and is quite fair to both sides. I found interesting the place the author gives religion in the reasons for the Revolution:\\"Religion, especially after 1740, displayed similar contradictions. In nine colonies, an established church - one that received public taxes - held forth. But the most fervent believers remained outside its doors with no intention of applying for admission. They followed the call of the Spirit and despised the formality and the rationalism - they called it sin - in the established bodies. Even these enthusiasts differed among themselves on many matters. The sacraments aroused disagreements, as did the qualifications of their clergy, the education of their children, and the order of worship.Congregationalists with a desire for purity had settled New England in the seventeenth century, and they continued to insist on their version of it for themselves, though not for others, in the eighteenth. After the turn of the century they had to contend with increasingly powerful groups of Anglicans, Quakers, and Baptists who fought for exemptions from paying taxes to the Congregational establishment and thereby demonstrated an aversion in common. But these groups agreed on little else. . . .\\" (pages 46 - 47)\\"Although Americans entered the revolt against Britain in several ways, their religion proved important in all of them, important even to the lukewarm and the indifferent. It did because, more than anything else in America, religion shaped culture. And as different as the colonies were, they possessed a common culture - values, ideals, a way of looking at and responding to the world - which held them together in the crisis of upheaval and war. To be sure the churches in the colonies differed from one another. But beneath the surface their similarities were even more striking - a governance so dominated by laymen as to constitute a congregational democracy, a clergy much weaker than its European analogue, and a religious life marked by attenuated liturgies and an emphasis on individual experience. This last characteristic was not prominent in the Anglican Church, but worship even in Anglican establishments partook considerably of low-church practice.\\" (pages 49 - 50)"},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The author spends a great deal of time exploring major players on both side of the conflict giving great understanding of its causes and results. This book gives a thorough understanding of the revolution not just a battle-by-battle synopsis. This book is about why and how it happened and does a good job in this area.A large amount of the book is devoted to pre-revolutionary events and a similarly large portion is devoted to coming to a compromise on the constitution."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This standard work provides a good general read on the events surrounding the Rev War. The author writes well, which makes reading the sometimes detailed narrative a joy. Like most American works on the subject it is very patriotic, and more than a little biased in its views.The core of the book centers on the war itself, and while the author omits some details, he does provide good background information. The constant references to the Glorious Cause the rebels were involved in became a bit annoying after a while, and such sentiments do reveal the very strong bias of the author in telling his story. Basically you're not going to find many works that give a balanced perspective of both sides in this conflict. So for a starting place this book does provide a comprehensive background and a good narrative of the war. Some chapters do go behind the scenes to try and examine the sinews of the war and these do make for good reading.Over all a classic and quite extensive work that provides a good read on the events leading up to and including the Revolution, with some good emphisas on the military campaigns. Those readers just wanting to learn about the Founding Fathers and the political reasons of the conflict might find the book strays from those points, but for a comprehensive albeit pro-rebel account this is a classic. The story is carried through the conclusion of the war up to the internal bickerings that result in the framming of the Constitution. Cogent arguments concerning why the colonies opted to surrender their powers in favor of a more centralized government make for instructional reading. Discussions about Virginia and the status of slaves and why these issues were not included in the Constitution make for interesting discussion. The author is not a revisionist, so his views try to examine these issues within the context of their time. While the great men of events get their due, much is still left from the perspective of the commoner. This book makes for a very good starting place for any study of the Rev War period."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The Glorious Cause is a terrific account of the American Revolutionary era, covering the period from the Seven Years' War to the ratification of the American Constitution. It should be considered the standard text in this regard. It can double as either an introduction to the subject or as a valuable resource for well-read students."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I have yet to finish the book - I'm almost to its midpoint. In addition, I'm not particularly well-read in history, especially of the narrative sort. Notwithstanding, I must say that this book is well-written as far as style and clarity are concerned. It flows very well and the author injects several subjective insights that enhance and enliven the purely historical info. Overall, I highly recommend this work to those who are new to narrative history, and to those who are seeking to reinforce their historical understanding of this country's past. Also, the reviewer below who lamented the preponderant attention to military topics is quite wrong in his observation - There is a significant amount of attention paid to political history and theory in the chapters leading up to the actual outbreak of the war, so don't let the review deter you. Rewarding to say the least."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I have read a few books on the American Revolution, but they always leave me somewhat underwhelmed. This book, despite having good reviews (generally) is no exception. To be sure, there are many very good points to the book - it's extremely readable, covers both economic and military issues, gives good background, includes adequate maps, etc. However, it also contains the same problems that other Revolution books have.I think these problems stem from a root cause, and that is that they are written by Americans. There is some weird blind spot that Americans have when writing about their own early history, that they seem don't have when writing about WWII, the Civil War, etc. I believe it stems from the same three underlying assumptions that permeate Revolution-era books:1. Armed rebellion was inevitable.2. Colonial victory and Independence was inevitable3. The Colonies were Right and the British were Wrong.The first two assumptions are especially annoying to those of us in other former colonial countries that did not achieve independence through military action. Of just the former British colonies, a small sampling of non-revolutionary countries includes Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. Middlekauff falls squarely into this trap. If North American revolution was so inevitable, why didn't Nova Scotia join the rebellion? Why not Canada (modern Quebec and Ontario) - especially since the French Quebecoise had long enjoyed virtual independence from France and were not reconciled to more regulatory British rule. What about Florida, newly captured from Spain? What about the British Caribbean possesions, sugarcane growers having the same trade issues as tobacco growers? No, Middlekauff allows the 13 colonies to float virtually alone (to be sure, Benedict Arnold's invasion of Canada is reported, as is the British counter-invasion from Canada, but no discussion is made of why the French Quebecoise didn't aid the Americans).The third assumption is similarly hard for modern-day descendants of American slaves to accept. As an institution, slavery survived in the United States long after it had disappeared from the British Empire (although African colonies suffered various versions of Apartheid). The revolution was fought for the benefit of wealthy merchants and landowners. I doubt that the average tenant or laborer saw any real economic or political benefit to independence in their lifetimes.To be fair to Middlekauff, he does not make the second assumption. Much time and effort (I would argue a little too much!) in spent discussing deliberations in the British Parliament and to the responses of the States and of Congress. This part of the story is necessarily dry, but at least it explains legitimate grievances and how the resentment in the Colonies was allowed to build (but, as I mentioned, does not explain why such a resentment did not build up in Canada, Nova Scotia, the Caribbean colonies, etc.). But Middlekauff is at his best when describing the military activities that led to American victory. Not just the battles, but the manoeuvers, supply problems, the nature of armies in the late 18th century, etc. When described in such accurate and vivid detail, it's hard not to conclude that British military power was predestined to fail in the absence of real (British) political will to make significant concessions to the Colonies.Or, maybe this book was unsatisfactory because the American Revolution is just not as inherently interesting as the Civil War or WWII. Whatever the case, this book is readable, certainly, but I didn't enjoy it a lot, especially when compared to McPherson's entry in this History of the United States series (Battle Cry of Freedom)."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is probably the best one-volume work on the American Revolution which exists today. I am not a professional historian, but this book is a veritable treasure trove of information and any history student who takes the time to read the entire book will inevitably come away will a considerable understanding of the period. Really, very little is lacking in this book; it gives you a detailed and very sufficient account of the military actions of the conflict, but even more, it grants you a great deal of insight into Parliament and the British collective political mind in the time leading up to the Revolution. The major personalities here--some which you might not expect to learn about--French ambassadors, William Pitt the Elder, Thomas Hutchinson and others--are introduced with some real depth and detail. Middlekauff gives a formidable presentation of the reasonings and psychology of the Americans which prompted them to rise up against the Crown, and he does so on many different levels, of culture, religion, economics, and more. As I said, I am not a professional historian, I cannot give you an adequately informed evaluation of the analysis provided by Middlekauff into the War itself, but there is a tremendous amount of vital information here to learn. If one is a beginning or mid-range student of the Revolution, one could not do better than to buy and read this book. A masterful work."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is an excellent book if you want a good picture of the events involved in America's war for independence. It does not dwell on flowery subjects nor go astray. It tells in practical terms how the war started and how it was one and won. It is the book that most people need."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is an excellent account of how and (most importantly) why we won our war of independence from the British and their churlish despotism. On its own I would rate it with five stars; however as a volume in the excellent series of \\"The Oxford History of The United States,\\" I rank in the middle.Middlekauff provides a concise presentation of the road to independence: the insensitive imposition of recessive and punitive taxes upon the economies of the colonies, the common sense reaction and subsequent response to these taxes, and the British government's blundering missteps which led the colonies from protest to rebellion to war and then eventually to secession.He provides a tight and interesting chronology of the combatants' strategies and battle tactics during the war, and there is much value in his account of the lesser known war in the southern part of the colonies. Also outlined is a recognition of the strategic role played by the opposing naval forces (including that of the French) in the final victory.Toward the end of the book, the author provides two enlightening chapters on his assessment of the impact of the \\"ins and outs\\" of the military campaigns. Oddly, this assessment is provided not at the end of the book but right before the depiction of the final Battle of Yorktown.In \\"The Glorious Cause\\" the British Government displays a churlish posture expressing its belief of the superiority of their culture and country over the colonies.Middlekauff shows how the American \\"children\\" won and most importantly why the British \\"parent\\" lost."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The author's treatment of the social, political and economic forces which shaped the Revolution are very thought-provoking and expansive. His treatment of the War itself is not nearly as well done as some of the output from the History Channel. His \\"damning by faint praise\\" of the Battle of Kings Mountain lacked any depth and, although he cited Draper's \\"Heroes of Kings Mountain\\", I question whether he read it. The author mentions Sevier, Shelby and Campbell but omits any referance to Williams, Lacey, Cleveland, Hambright, Winston or McDowell and disparages the participants as an uncontrolled mob on a killing spree. He also gives only a cursory reference to Major Patrick Ferguson who was one of the better British officers alongside Cornwallis and Simon Fraser. Ferguson had a clear shot at George Washington at Brandywine and passed it up because he felt it not gentlemanly.The author also omits the disgraceful performance of \\"Light Horse\\" Harry Lee at Guilford Courthouse. In the midst of battle, Lee takes his troops out of action...no explanation given.. and emperils the American left and the Virginians are left to fend off the British by themselves. In the after-action discussions Nathaniel Green is told by William Campbell that he refuses to serve in an army that has such officers in it as Lee and resigns...loudly and not pleasantly. Lee may have been a favorite of Washington but he was considered unreliable and untrustworthy by his peers. (Campbell was later commissioned a General in the Virginia Militia by the Governor but died in Williamsburg of Camp Fever at age 37 shortly before the siege at Yorktown.)There is more complete and accurate information on the War at revolutionarywararchives.com"},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This book didn't keep me on the edge of my seat like Battle Cry of Freedom, John Adams or Stephen Ambrose's works, but it does extremely well what it purports to do--weave together the events preceding, during and following the revolutionary period into a coherent whole, allowing the reader to see the big picture, as well as learning about the component parts. That is a big job and this book does it very well.It only gets 4 stars since it is a bit more dry than the others in this series, but it was well worth my time to read it.I would rank the series as follows thus far: 1. Battle Cry of Freedom (easily #1), 2. Freedom from Fear (interchangeable with #3), 3. Grand Expectations, 4. Glorious Cause (barely behind the others) and 5. Restless Giant (distant last).

His book reads as though it were written in a time when historians were interested in writing about real decision makers and significant figures that actually shaped events, rather than about \\"women's\\" and other dubious \\"studies\\" of subjects that hardly impacted the course of events and explain nothing about the American Revolution. This book is therefore a wonderfully refreshing break from banal political correctness that won't waste one's time talking about side issues that have more to do with modern-day fashionable hang-ups than the actual events that dictated the course of the American Revolution. The fact that Middlekauf doesn't snear at \\"dead white men,\\" but rather actually acknowledges the debt all of us owe to the genius of the Founding Fathers, is just added icing on the cake."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"many good reviews of this book here.

The author is quite detailed in his writing and the book appears to have been very well researched. I did enjoy the footnoting and found the notes most helpful. Unlike other reviewers, I did find this not to be the easiest of reads. I suppose much of that was due to my lack of knowledge of English law. I also found it quite difficult, at times, to follow the numerous characters. I did find it easier one I finally caught on to the author's style. The book addresses the cause of the revolution quite well and the author is quite detailed. This work would perhaps be more appreciated by those quite interested in the politics of the situation, examined from both the American and British point of view. I did find this interesting, if somewhat boring at times. The author does repeat himself a lot. The author does assume that the reader does know something of the subject and this leads to some mad dashes for reference books, anyway it certainly did on my part. (This of course is my defect, not necessarily the authors). All in all I would highly recommend this one.

The detail that Mr. Middlekauff uses in his decriptions of the protests and rioting gives a new perspective into the feelings that were dominating in the Colonies at the time, but if you are looking for a more military oriented book, you might want to look elsewhere. This book totally ignores Conway's Cabal, Arnold's Treason and the decriptions of the battles leaves something to be desired at times."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Unfortunately, the Kindle version seems to be the first edition of the book. The book was recently updated with additional pages and it would have been better to offer the newer edition as a Kindle book."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"As a Canadian, I was not that exposed to the American Revolution in school. I recall us covering Washington on the Potomac, Bunker Hill, and Benedict Arnold but only basic, propaganda-like content (weird that there was so much on Arnold). Most American histories take a good versus evil stance but this effort does a fantastic job of conveying the complexities and fateful aspects of the revolution. Many talk of the battles but glance over the fact that this was an extraordinary effort because while fighting the British, the early leaders of America were also building a central government, struggling with daunting economic issues, experiencing social change, and muddling through foreign relations. All the time harnessing the power of a growing union of fledgling states. This strips away a great deal of the vacuous myths that have surrounded the period.It is a history of citizen soldiers that the nation would call on time and again during its Civil War and the World Wars. I was struck by how independent the 'nation' already was by 1775 given the bungling governance of the Brits since 1764. In fact, America's greatest strength is still its greatest weakness, that is the tension that exists between liberty and nationalism. In essence, America had demonstrated their independence long before having to formally declare it.The author's writing style is both authoritative and approachable. He takes us from strategy to tactics with ease and speed. The book covers an incredible amount of information which provides a tremendously holistic view of the conflict, its origins, and its impact. Starting with the key events that precipitated the war, from the Stamp Act to the Tea Act, the Boston Tea Party and \\"the shot heard 'round the world.\\" The main part the book features a terrific description of the eight-year-long war, with awesome accounts of the conflicts, ranging from Bunker Hill to the win at Hannah's Cowpens and then Yorktown. The challenges faced by the troops on both sides is mind boggling. America's natural grasp of irregular warfare was a huge asset. I also enjoyed the summary towards the end which convincingly demonstrates that the British lost the war perhaps more than America won it.The book concludes with the Constitution in the 1787 Philadelphia Convention and the struggle over ratification. This was very enlightening for me having been under the impression that everything was smooth following the conflict. Two aspects here are especially interesting; the machinations of Virginia and the lost opportunity to initiate a gradual emancipation of slaves. One thing the book maintains is the critical role Washington played in the conflict and as first leader of the new republic. He led with increasing confidence, consulted experts but made the final decisions, and he surrounded himself with good people (the truest sign of a great leader).America like my country of Canada are living experiments and there is much to be learned from their histories. One small complaint unrelated to the book itself comes as a result of reading this on my Kindle, as the maps and other illustrations were very difficult to make out."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauf's book is the best single treatment of the American Revolution in print. He is fair and equitable in his treatment of all sides in this conflict. In fact, he might have gone too far in these efforts. One puts the book down feeling the British officials were often wronged by the American colonialists. Middlekauf devotes about half the book to the coming of the war, forty percent to the military conflict itself and about ten percent to the post-war years, including the writing of the U.S. Constitution. He gives everyone their moment in the story, including loyalists, sailors, and militiamen, but the core of his account is the battle between the two conventional armies. He breaks the mold and gives enough attention to actions in the South to inform his readers that the war was not one by New England alone. Perhaps the best thing about this book is how Middlekauf integrates political and military issues together. He shows that this conflict was political in nature and how military operations affected sentiment in both America and the United Kingdom and how that sentiment often determined what a commander could or had to do. This integration is one of the reasons the U.S. Naval War College uses this book as a required reading despite its limited discussion of naval operations."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This book gives a broad overview of the American Revolution. It gives a very detailed account of the events that lead up to the Revolutionary War. The book uses personal jorunals of the common man and those from the actual decision makers. Book does pass over some events like Valley Forge, the War in the southern colonies without complete explanation. Very well written with a wide overview of the war. Also talks about life at home during the war and life in the camps of the soliders.One thing I did not enjoy about this book is that it inculded several chapters on the development of the constitution and government after the War. In my mind these are events are seperate.I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"\\"The Glorious Cause\\" is a wide-ranging look at the founding of the United States that is severely compromised by its author's inability to see the forest for the trees. To be sure, Middlekauff's scholarship is beyond reproach. However, taken as a whole the book reads like a 700-page selection of bullet points stripped of their formatting and delivered in paragraph form. There is precious little in the way of contextual analysis or 'big picture' overview - Middlekauff has events proceed in an ineluctable progression from A to B to C that overwhelms the reader in an endless stream of dates and proper nouns.More aggravating are the omissions in Middlekauff's narrative - nothing on the treason of Benedict Arnold, nothing on the impetus behind the First Contintental Congress (it materializes out of thin air in his account), and nothing on the Articles of Confederation aside from an after-the-fact blurb about the agreement's flaws.Instead, he often dives in to lengthy summations of personnel intrigues in obscure sub-committees of the British government, and devotes countless pages to the arcana of military strategy.I can't figure who the intended audience for this book is. It's scope is far too wide-reaching to be of use to the professional historian, and yet it concerns itself primarily with minutiae of little interest to the average educated reader. Nor does it have the overarching analytic backbone necessary to draw all the facets of the time period together in a sensible format for the average reader.In short, Middlekauff earns himself three stars for his outstanding scholarship; but he misses out on the other two for his suffocating pedantry."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"If you are goign to read one book on the American Revolutionary War, this one is an excellent candidate. It starts in 1763, during the years leading up to the actual conflict. It ends in 1789 with Washington as president and the ratification of the constitution.Covering this many years, the book has to be big, and it is. And by including so much material, a lot of material may not be of interest to all readers. For instance, as you would expect, a major part of the book is taken up with the battles fought between the Americans and the British. But there is also a lot of material on the earlier battles with the French and Indians, and a lot on the various debates among the colonists on very fundamental issues such as reconcile their troubles with England or fight the strongest army in the world over what they would consider to be treason; and on the basic question of slave holding.An area I particularly enjoyed was the discussion of the writing of the constitution. Starting from scratch how would you set up a government of checks and balances? Hou would you define something that would still be around more than 200 years later with relatively few changes?Today the two parties seem to be at each others throat even more than in the past. But this is probably not true. Adams called Jefferson 'a howling atheist' in the 1800 campaign, and the articles and letters about Lincoln as vicious as Michael Moore talking about Bush. Still what was done between 1763 and 1789 remains. As much as people complain about the current president, we still consider ourselves Americans and we hold to the constitution - even though we argue a lot about what it says."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Given the quality of the other volumes I have read in this outstanding series, I had high expectations for this one: I wanted context, succinct bios, story, and analysis. Unfortunately, this volume fails to deliver enough on every single count, and yet it is full of extraneous detail. Rather than surrendering to a rich narrative, I had to struggle to follow the author's logical jumps, to fill in the many crucial details he seemed to assume the reader would know, and to sort through the oddly incomplete (yet overly long) descriptions of military maneuvers or political machinations.The book begins well, with an explanation of the political context in both the US and Britain. In the wake of the French-Indian War, the young king (George III) had decided to station a permanent military garrison in the colonies, which his subjects were supposed to finance. This added a presence and level of control over the colonists' economic affairs, who while loyal subjects were accustomed to independence and a wide latitude to manage their lives in the way they saw fit. Given the flawed personality of GIII, the British attitude remained paternal, condescending as to children, and arrogantly impenetrable to contrary points of view. This led not just to a clash, but to a comedy of errors. GIII imposed a number of unpopular taxes and acts, provoking increasingly provocative protests in the colonies and heavy-handed responses from Britain that only made things worse. Violence led to violence, some fiery American radicals expressed their ideals in fabulously articulated polemics that gave life to ideals and a plan for action, and events moved in ways no one expected.Unfortunately, I simply did not get a feel for when and why things happened the way they did. For me, this is a very basic failure of narrative. Perhaps even worse, while it was easy to get lost in the details, the cause-and-effect reasons behind certain fundamental issues (e.g. opposition to the Stamp Act) do not clearly emerge. It was frustrating, even boring after a while. The analysis is too sparse, especially in the beginning.Once independence is declared, the core of the book is a military story. For me, this section was far too long and mired in excessive details of minor engagements, to the point that I began to skip them. Once again, the narrative failed to keep my interest and I constantly found my mind wandering. After the war is won, the book shifts into a kind of summary of events, oddly lacking in detail, even rushed. There is one chapter on the failure of the confederated period, one on the constitutional convention that refers to all the issues as if pre-ordained, and a very brief one on the ratification fight. It makes for a lopsided reading experience, to say the least. Finally, very few of the personalities come through. Most of the biggies like Washington and Adams are covered, but Hamilton is a mere shadow, Burr is barely mentioned - the list of the neglected goes on.At the very end, there is a good section of analysis that sums up much of the author's perspective. It is well worth the work to get there, but it is nonetheless a long slog. That being said, I found the tone to be overly sentimental, referring to ideals that were supposed to serve as beacons to humanity in spite of the fact that most of them came from slave owners who recognized their own hypocrisy, such as Jefferson but also the fascinating Patrick Henry. It serves up a triumphalist story that implies a direct link to the present yet fails to add any critical perspective whatsoever. This too, in my eyes, is a significant failure for such a massive and ambitious narrative.I was hoping that this book would serve as a kind of capstone to a long period of reading I have been doing on this period. I expected the book to recapitulate what I already knew, add new layers of detail and interpretation, and offer an intimate dialogue with a great academic. Both Battle Cry of Freedom and What Hath God Wrought (other volumes in the series) did this for me to complete satisfaction, but this volume did not. I can barely bring myself to give this 3 stars and frankly cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This book is a vast resource.

Despite its length, the book reads quickly and is interesting!"},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is a thorough study of the American Revolution. It would not be appropriate to say that it was a page turner but it covered the field very well. It took my many months to finish it and I will keep it nearby as I begin to read more about the revolution. (One of the best parts of retirement is the luxury or reading about a period of history over a relatively short period of time and when one is not tired)There are a few points that are made that made me stop to think. First, the emphasis that Mr Middlekauff places on ideals. There are many explanations of the causes of the revolution he emphasis is on the lack of freedom the colonies felt. Mostly it seems that the feeling that the colonists were not given full rights of Englishmen was the catalyst for the revolution. Also it shows that liberty comes from inside the country. Democracy has to be home grown to be effective.Second, I enjoyed the discussion of what we would call today guerrilla warfare. The colonists were able to win by changing the method of combat. I could not help but thinking about Iraq when I read this section.I recommend to read the Great Upheaval in putting the revolution in context."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The book is easy to read, and hard to put down. The author's voice is effective in both conveying the information and keeping the reader interested. The pre-1776 coverage is extremely detailed and gripping. One will enjoy seeing the war through the eyes of people on both sides of the Atlantic from this book, but the Glorious Cause does emphasize Boston's role at the expense of others, but not enough to deter the books overall value. Both military historians and enthusiasts will appreciate greatly the detailed descriptions of battle strategy in the book, but sadly, the maps are not up to par. The added chapters of social history add a lot of meat to an already juicy topic, and will appeal nicely to those readers who desire to read about more than just military victory. The events of the post war and of the 1780s are not covered in as great of detail as some history students may like, but there is enough to please the casual reader; however, given the length of the book, it is understandable. Overall, if one is looking for a good one volume book on the American Revolution, look no farther than this one."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"As I continue my march through the ages, where I explore all the historical eras of the United States of America, I finally arrive at the age and event that would create the nation itself. Having finished Fred Anderson Crucible of War, I had already arrived at that generation of Americans, which we would describe as the Founding generation, and they were living under the man they would call tyrant, King George III. As I stated in an earlier post the biggest challenge in this little project is to find books whose authors try their best to explore from multiple perspectives to avoid just one narrow view, without at the same time surrendering a general narrative that is both readable and enjoyable. I found this book to meet those qualifications.Robert Middelkauff's brings the conflict that gave birth to the United States of America to life in his classic work, The Glorious Cause. This book tells the story of thirteen colonies who revolted against the mother country of Great Britain to form their own nation. The story begins on the close of the French and Indian War (or Seven Years War) where the British Empire was triumphant,the greatest power of North America, and undisputed ruler of the sea. The story ends with George Washington taking office as the first President of the United States.We tend to think of the American Revolution as happening from 1774-1783 but Middelkauff believes that it began in the 1760s. He argues this even though the American disagreement with the mother country during the late 1760s and early 1770s was about their rights as British subjects in the Empire, not trying to break loose from it. He also points out that the Revolution does not end at Yorktown or the Treaty of Paris but with the Constitutional Convention, the Constitution's ratification, and the inauguration of President George Washington.One of the main sources of disagreement with Great Britain and her colonies was two very different views that were held on the unwritten constitution of the British Empire. One view, held by Americans, was that all British subjects could not be governed and taxed without their consent; and the other, held by many in Britain, was the British Parliament was the supreme legislature of all the inhabitants of the Empire whether or not that community was had representation in the House of Commons. With the insistence of the various ministers of King George III, with His Majesty's full support, Parliament attempted to level taxes on the colonies. The response from the colonies was resistance from all levels of colonial society.\\"A single act of Parliament led by an evil ministry would not immediately fasten chains on colonial wrists, of course. As far as the American writers were concerned, the Stamp Act was simply the visible edge of the dared conspiracy. If the Act were accepted, they asked, what guarantee did the colonists have that their lands, houses, indeed the very windows in their houses, and the air breathed in America would not be taxed? A people virtually represented in Parliament would have no choice once they swallowed that pernicious doctrine which was in reality shackles for the enslaved. And there would be many hungry men in England eager to do the work of the enslavers. Colonial accounts of the conspiracy lingered over long and horrified descriptions of the officeholders, placemen, taskmasters, and pensioners who would descend upon the colonists ostensibly to serve His Majesty but in reality to eat out of the colonial substance. The corruption they would bring would complete the ruin of the colonies.\\"p.132This common cause of liberty was able to unite the colonies as nothing had ever had before; colonial legislatures sent representatives to a Continental Congress that would try to negotiate with Parliament. When negotiations failed and the war came at Lexington and Concord, this Congress would raise and Army and appoint a commander-in-chief. The next Continental Congress, when the time came, would go forth and declare their independence and form a new nation.\\"What Americans thought and felt about the declaration's 'truths' which are presented as 'self-evident'--that all men 'are endowed by their creator with inalienable rights,' among them 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'--is not clear. There was no immediate discussion in public of these claims; nor was there of the contention that all men were 'created equal.' Thomas Jefferson wrote these words and though at the time, and since, no great originality was attributed to them and to the substance of the declaration, the declaration may in fact have possessed more originality than anyone suspected.\\"p.335One of the great elements of this book is the way it tries to cover all aspects of society, from the court of King George III to the farmers of Massachusetts. The stars of history still get there well-earned due, George Washington makes the most appearances, but also covered are Patrick Henry, Samuel and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, John Paul Jones, Thomas Paine, Nathanael Greene and, of course, Benjamin Franklin.\\"Washington's judgment improved each year, as he assimilated the experience of the war. His confidence in himself also grew as he learned. When the war began he as full of concern that he would fail because his abilities were not of the first order. This belief persisted even though he also felt that he had been called by providence to lead the American army in the Revolution. By the end of 1776 with a year and a half of the war under his belt, and with the success of Trenton and Princeton, he was a much more confident commander. He was not arrogant, and he continued to consult his general officers before he made important decisions, but he no longer took advice against his better judgment, as he had, for example, in the autumn of 1776 on the Hudson.\\"p.600After the Revolutionary War comes to an end, the Revolution was still unfinished for a Revolution cannot be complete until something lasting has been built up to replace the old regime. The Articles of Confederation were not up to task and ultimately the Constitutional Convention would have to be held to create a lasting Republic in which the Federal Government was supreme and not the various state governments.I would also like to point out a technical detail that I like about this book. All the footnotes are located at the bottom of the page they are on as opposed to either at the end of the book or the end of each chapter. I find this makes reading the book more enjoyable because that way I do not have to flip though pages to find the source of any particular fact or argument. I wish this method was mandatory.The Glorious Cause is an incredible book and I would recommend it to the novice and the experienced historian alike."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"It's all here. In great detail. Agonizing detail. For a book that covers only 26 years in American history, it takes almost that long to read it! I can't argue with the facts. There are just too many for my tastes.

So much of the history that I have read seems to start in Boston around 1770 and mover forward from there. It was fascinating for me to learn about how each of the Colonies responded to the moves of Great Britain during the turbulent years form 1763-1770.After the war began, I did not find this volume to be as informative as others I have read. Perhaps the very scope of this book did not permit Middlekauf to delve into many of my favorite stories in detail the way I hoped. But at 742 pages, I guess you can't relate every detail of every scene!As part of the Oxford series, I highly recommend this be a part of history lovers library. It is a book that I will turn to again and again in order to gain insights into what brought about the birth of this country."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauff's book is a great narrative history of the American war for independence.

I bought the book below cost and it was so well taken care of that it didnt even look used."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Robert Middlekauff's \\"The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789\\" is an extensive and excellent one-volume history of the American Revolution. Middlekauff covers all bases in this large (700-page) work: the diplomatic, political, social, and of course military history of the Revolution.Middlekauff focuses much of the book, probably too much, on the political crises that led to the war and the Declaration of Independence. His treatment of the military campaigns and battles is very well-done, and the book has sufficient maps to describe both the individual battles and the larger campaigns. Finally, Middlekauff traces the steps that led from the unworkable Articles of Confederation to the ratification of our Constitution. And Middlekauff ties all of the stories in with the \\"glorious cause\\" that ultimately the soldiers, militiamen, and Founding Fathers were all fighting for.Although this is an excellent book, it has some weaknesses. One is that it is an uneven treatment of the revolutionary period: sometimes he does an excellent job explaining some subjects that the modern general reader does not understand, while at other times he glosses right over similar subjects without adequately explaining them. He also sometimes fails to place some events in their proper historical context, nor does he link these events to the modern legends and folklore of the American Revolution. For example, he never mentions Prescott's order \\"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes\\" at Bunker Hill; nor does he explain the significance of the Fourth of July as Independence Day; nor does he spend much time explaining the legends that have grown around the South Carolina partisans like Francis \\"Swamp Fox\\" Marion. While these matters may singularly not be important enough to warrant coverage, a complete history of the American Revolution should tie in the events of those years with their modern perceptions and historiography.Despite this, \\"The Glorious Cause\\" is an excellent history of the American Revolution. Pardon the clich&eacute;, but if you read only one history of the American Revolution, this should be the one."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This book gives you a lot of respect for the genius of the founding fathers and how it was not just that as a group they were even more brilliant than individually, but that each faction won their way when in hindsight, they were the ones with the best approach. It gives a lot of credence to the saying \\"God looks over fools and the United States of America\\".I think this is simply the best book for a wide view of how the United States became a country (and almost didn't many many times) and how it's structure was set then to become what it is today.For the best second book about this period, the new Alexander Hamilton biography."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Glorious Cause does an excellent job of proposing a theory about the early years of the republic. America's struggle for independence was seen in the eyes of many as a cause to be one. It was pure and idealistic. Its values were entrenched in our battles and fighting spirit. While this book does focus quite a bit on the military content as others have pointed out it lives up to the series expectations. Overall this book conveys a sense of American history that is lost in most books talking about the revolution. We seem to want to study the revolution via biography and in doing so we lose sight of the big picture. This book serves to remind us of that picture and does so in a clear and direct way. Like almost every Oxford book it is clearly written and well researched. The bibliography here is a little more disappointing than the others in the series but is still thorough. The analysis of the revolution and the surrounding time period is as always top notch and deserves accolades for the masterful way in which it is presented. I would highly recommend this book for those who want to understand the American Revolution."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Just to start out with, one example of how the author introduces informationPage 437:\\"...Sullivan was to come down from Providence, ferry to the ISLAND OF RHODE ISLAND from Tiverton, and attack Pigot on the northeast side OF THE ISLAND.\\"Page 438:\\"...What Sullivan did not know was that Clinton had loaded 4000 regulars on transports and was on the way with the intention of trapping him ON RHODE ISLAND\\"Now folks, what I'm saying here is... ON Rhode Island. To a local or someone who has gone to the trouble of reading a history of the smallest state in the union, the above quotes would make sense. But still. One of the first things they teach you in grade school in the US when learning about the 50 states is that Rhode Island Is Not An Island.Therefore a smoother way to write about this would be something like:\\"...Sullivan was to come down from Providence, ferry to Aquidneck Island - commonly referred to as the Island of Rhode Island - from Tiverton, and attack Pigot on the northeast side of the island.\\"...or some such. It's just kind of weird to have someone telling you all about the history of the revolutionary war and say something that sounds to most of the English-speaking world like you're saying something dumb. FYI for anyone who doesn't live around there, there's an island within the state of Rhode Island called \\"the island of Rhode Island.\\" Does the author seriously want to leave this bit of geography open to confusion? Describing the battle for the reader, specifically how it played out, that's like, the point of military history, I think? Like, does he make it a little play on words and leave the thing unexplained and open to confusion so people can sidle up to him at book readings and stuff to say \\"you know, Rhode Island isn't an island\\" so he can respond \\"oh-ho-ho, you, an American, do not know of the island OF rhode island?\\" ...'cause that's the only utility I see here. Authors writing about, for instance, the history of Macedonia seem to think taking a moment to distinguish one Alexander from another is worth the trouble.I've read a fair bit of history so I'm not averse to a big detailed book. For instance, I found Peter Green's gibberingly large Alexander to ActiumAlexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age (Hellenistic Culture and Society)fascinating and it ranges all over from art to philosophy to military history. Generally I like a cracking good thick history book and don't mind if it turns aside a bit to give detail to give a feel for the times. The prose of this book is awkward, has no flow. I found myself stopping and saying things like \\"what?\\" and \\"huh?\\" and reading sections again in a way I didn't with well-written history like Battle Cry FreedomBattle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States), A Short History of ByzantiumA Short History of Byzantium, Ottoman CenturiesOttoman Centuriesor Massie's book on Peter the GreatPeter the Great. I really don't mind wordy detail but his prose slides off you like teflon.To echo another review, his understanding of the military side seems sketchy. For instance, in one battle description he repeatedly refers to, in addition to an army's right and left wings...its CENTER \\"wing\\". Repeatedly. Riiiight. I mean, maybe he's a foriegner and this is just a weird accidental expression of his but I've read Liddel HartScipio Africanus: Greater Than Napoleon, KeeganA History of Warfare, KaganThe Peloponnesian War, also plenty of Germans like GuderianPanzer Leader, ManstienLost Victories: The War Memoirs of Hitler's Most Brilliant General, and Mellenthin Panzer Battles: A Study of the Employment of Armor in the Second World War not to mention Clauzwitz On War and they never called their centre a \\"wing\\" so it doesn't appear to be a British or German thing anyway. Like, if you were going to read a book on American football and the author keeps referring to the linemen as wide recievers, tight ends or something, do you think this will change your impression of the level of expertise involved at all?He makes reference to the Great Awakening as having some influence on the Revolution... ok, want to tell me what the Great Awakening was about, HOW it was an influence? No? Alright.Perhaps you'll be impressed with this book if you don't read history, haven't read any other American history, and especially don't read any military history. A diagram of the Momouth Courth House battle shows the AMERICANS being led BY CORNWALLIS. Page 431. For all that the author cites the Great Awakening, you can learn more about it from Strauss and Howe's 4th Turning than you can from this book. For me, weird and at times bad grammar/word use, unengaging prose, and the occasional WTF moment left me wanting to do what I'm doing now... giving it 2 stars.If I hear my mechanic saying the exhaust feeds into the cylinders or referring to the distributor as a radiator, I might feel a little doubtful about the things he makes reference to with the confidence of expert knowledge that I don't specifically know about. I'm going to go find some other book on the Revolutionary War period to corroborate what I read here.And in case you're wondering, glancing at the first few pages, I see the original copyright is dated 1982 and the date for my copy listed as 2005 so this wasn't a badly-edited first edition or anything. There were seriously parts where simply the wrong word is being used for something, just some normal thing in English as opposed to something involving expert knowledge. You could say that's bad writing or just bad editing but it's in the book 23 years later and after he went to the trouble to revise it. I might actually take some sick pleasure in rereading the book just to quote all the distracting mistakes but amazon allows only so much quoting so I won't push my luck here. Just... I'm not sure I was really getting good information or whether it was given to me badly. Might come back and bump it up a star if I read some other books on the time period and as a result see it in a different light.Anyway, to sum up, I do not recommend this book. It isn't difficult to read because of how super-smart it is. It's difficult due to distracting bad grammar/spelling, references to previously or never mentioned things, badly tied together narrative, obsession over minutia, and the occasional fumble. Looking at other reviews of 3 stars or less, the pattern I'm noticing is that everybody is willing to give the author some credit in those areas outside their normal area of expertise, which I think tells you something."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I took up this book after reading an excellent treatise on thecivil war by McPherson which is also published in the Oxford Historyseries. Pardon my being a bit harsh, but I have just finished the bookand my disgust is still fresh. With all the regalia of the author, itis amazing how boring, muddled, and occasionally just borderlinebigoted this book is. Middlekauff seems to have little feel forhistorical process or circumstance and to top it off does not seem tobe particularly good at describing any of the aspects of therevolution.The trouble starts right from the introduction. It is filled withminute and unimportant facts. Yet M. fails to give the historical oreconomic context for the revolution. The triangular trade between thecolonies and England and America's role in it is barely mentioned.French and Indian war is not covered. Yet, the minor frictions andcharacter traits of British MPs are given a lot of space. M. almostmakes it appear that the revolution happened due to inattention orlack of judgment of a British prime minister or two. The wholecolonial system set up to enrich the metropoly has apparently little todo with America's discontent.The next several chapters tediously describe the local politicspre-revolutionary politics of nearly each individual colony. Thisdescription bears as much excitement as plodding through periodnewspapers. Yet M. description of individual battles of therevolutionary war are sketchy at best, he states the opposing forces,casualties, outcome and moves on. He does not describe the weaponryof the Revolutionary war. He does not describe the customs of theAmericans of that day, how they dressed, what their daily run waslike. He describes the composition of medieval armies as rabble(sic!)(i.e. urban and rural underclass) officered by the nobles. M. repeatsa common misconception that the hessian troops were mercenaries (theyweren't, they were rented by the German princes to George III). Therewas a long discussion on the lack of strategic vision among Britishgenerals. M. sounds apologetic for them.The conclusion seem to ramble on and on. On page 637 there is abigoted discussion that the revolution is somehow made better becauseit was made by the people who had more than their life to lose.

However, I did not find the synthesis of material original or the narrative style compelling. He opens arguments which are quite debateable, such as implying that the Revolution's impetus was spurred by the energy of the Great Awakening, and then provides no further elaboration or evidence to support his assertion. In one paragraph he refers to European soldiers as scum and dregs and then bemoans the fate of the aristocratic officer corp who have to rely on beatings and hangings to keep the kidnapped soldiery in line. This makes Middlekauff sound incredibly dated, prejudiced and unsophisticated. For a military history read Christopher Ward instead."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I found this book to be painfully slow and uninteresting.

The typos don't help much either. That said, there's some really good information here especially about the many battles and fumbles and stumbles made by Washington and yet he somehow still kept his army intact through all the many setbacks.There's nothing in here about Benedict Arnold's treachery nor his somewhat understandable reasons for backstabbing the future America. The last 100 pages or so are all on the Constitutional Convention with actual speeches within. The earliest part of this book is all about the politics in the colonies leading up to the American Revolution. I suspect this ponderous tome would have been better served if it had been broken up into a trilogy with certain points expanded rather than crammed into one tome. I took a course on the American Revolution with the author, expecting some focus on the military aspects and surprisingly got almost nothing. Middlekauf's views of the Founding Fathers tended to be black and white. He tried to convince me that Aaron Burr was a wicked man and failed.

The best books in this Oxford series are \\"What has God wrought\\" and \\"Freedom from Fear.\\""},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The Glorious Cause could have been great but it is marred by poor editing and inexcusably poor proofreading. Middlekauff does many things marvelously well. He avoids the hagiography so many historians are prone to and gives a wonderfully balanced portrayal of an adversarial relationship that blossomed into full scale rebellion. The British fail not so much because they are bad or evil but because they misread the fundamental political shifts and changes that have occurred in the Colonies since the 7 Year's War. Failing to adapt, they repeatedly exacerbate the situation with the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, and finally (America's coinage) the Intolerable Acts. Later, Britain's military campaign is equally inept, alienating rather rallying Americans to the Loyalist cause. There are excellent chapters delineating Britain's lack of perception, a ministry in the thrall of its own power, and a ruling class that never forms a coherent political or military response to the Crisis that has any chance of success.American excesses and failures are given equal consideration--chapters on the coercive power of the mob are chilling and belie the notion that the population spontaneously rose as one in response to tyranny. There was plenty of intimidation and tyranny on both sides and Middlekauff manages to be even-handed and informative. A particularly apt query from a Loyalist wondering about the difference between a coercive mob and a coercive Parliament is a powerful perspective. Happily there is none of the Band of Brothers, Team of Rivals, Founding Brothers nonsense that seems to be in vogue today. Just plenty of discourse and historical details clearly and cogently presented. The depiction of George Washington is especially fine. The author portrays a man whose qualities early on might not be equal to the task ahead. GW's ability to basically \\"grow in the job\\", as we would say today, is what seals not only his preeminent place in the Revolution but also a military victory that was, in 1775-1778 far from assured.Equally balanced is the portrayal Congress. Middlekauff discusses all of the familiar failures--the inability to raise and provide for the army, the freehanded printing of specie and so forth. The author balances this against the often ignored truth that the 50 or so men who participated in Congress created a civilian authority, diplomatic corps, political system where none had existed before, while managing to finance (barely) the needs of a nascent military. Their failures were great but so too were their accomplishments, if only in that they built a government, sometimes literally \\"on the fly\\" that neutralized an empire with century's old institutions.Some reviews have complained about too little information about military campaigns (for me there was too much) or treatment of Indians (have to agree with that one), woman, ordinary folks, etc. If those are particular interests, I can see the point, but this is an introduction, and overview. Middlekauff touches upon all and provides invaluable footnotes and a bibliography to guide readers to further study.The inglorious aspect of the The Glorious Cause is appallingly bad editing and proofreading. Others have noted areas of confusion I would attribute to bad editing, if only because the proofreading is even more sloppy and deleterious. Misspellings and grammatical errors are rife and seriously detract from what should have been an outstanding scholarly work. Shame on Oxford Press."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I was very interested in Robert Middlekauff's THE GLORIOUS CAUSE: THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION because I was interested in that period, and had also been very much impressed by two other volumes in the Oxford US history series -- McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, an excellent study of the US Civil War, and Kennedy's FREEDOM FROM FEAR, a superb description of the prewar and World War II years in America.However, having set myself up with high expectations, I found myself disappointed by THE GLORIOUS CAUSE. Although this volume is just as detailed as the other two I read in the Oxford USA history series, it is nowhere near as focused, coming across less as fascinatingly informative as overstuffed and wordy, with the author demonstrating a real inability to get to the point or sometimes to make it clear what the point really is.This is not a terrible or useless book, and a reader determined to slog through it will find it useful. Unfortunately, \\"slog\\" is the operative word, and while this is a thorough book, it is hard to believe that there are not much more readable surveys of the American revolution."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I read this as an undergraduate decades ago.

I now relish its length and attention to detail. So . . . a good book for anyone already interested in the subject, but an intimidating choice for the casual reader."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is a good book to introduce you to a detailed study of the American Revolution. That being said, it did not provide me with any great insight or information that I did not already obtain in high school US history. I would recommend reading it, but do not expect that it will transform you into an expert on the era.Pros:- Extensive detail on lead up to the Revolution, along with the actual campaigns- Author stays on track and does not digress into his own bias/opinions- Eloquent writing- I applaud the author for brilliant writing with respect to John Paul Jones- Solid component of the Oxford seriesCons:- A bit skimpy on post-Yorktown history, although not totally lacking- Author sometimes mentions people/things without proper introduction (e.g., Great Awakening and Second Great Awakening)- Does not address treason of Benedict Arnold (I was really looking forward to reading about that)- Certainly Anglocentric (with obvious bias towards the American side); fails to adequetly address role of Natives, African Slaves, and women; does not mention American - Spanish, Dutch, or Canadian relations at all- Does not delve deep enough into economic and monetary issues- Typos become more excessive towards the endFour Stars; 1 and 1/2 thumbs up. Hopefully future editions will be better.Also, it would be great if Oxford could add a pre-Revolution volume to the US history series - I would definitely buy it. In order to fill the gap, I am currently reading Volume 1 of the Penguin History of the United States. The book is good so far, but a bit modern/revisionist. The traditional approach of Oxford would also be nice to have."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauff's \\"The Glorious Cause\\" is a great book on the Revolutionary War period. However, to avoid frustration and failure due to the book's depth, one must first have studied pre-Revolutionary America and a summary of the Revolutionary period. The best example of the former is Taylor's \\"American Colonies.\\" There are many short summaries out there of the latter. Do the primer-work and you'll love \\"The Glorious Cause.\\" Don't do the primer-work and you'll get lost in the details."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I read this book years ago for a class. The author is hardly a Cornelius Ryan, but he does an adequate job of describing the battles' blood and thunder. The beginning is a little slow, but detailed and important. He glazes over the importance of religion to the colonial sense of liberty. You will certainly know the key events of the American Revolution when you are finished."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Thorough. Fine one-book overview of theories and events of the American Revolution. There are much better books that focus on specific events and theories, but this covers most of the basics well. It's supposedly a re-release of an older book, but there isn't too much new scholarship included in it. Perhaps a shame as there have been some great books published over the past 10+ years on the Revolution."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is a good, comprehensive overview of the American Revolution by an American historian. Middlekauff covers the key events that provoked the colonists to rebel against England, describing the various taxes and punitive measures that Parliament tried to impose on the colonists in order to pay off debts incurred during the Seven Years' War that ended in 1763. He then covers the military and political highlights of the war itself including the major battles in both the northern and southern states. Finally, he discusses the aftermath of the war including the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the ratification process that followed it. Middlekauff also provides some social history background to give his readers a feeling for what life was like for various groups of people during the revolution, including soldiers, women, loyalists, and native Americans. Middlekauff's coverage of the American Revolution is thus comprehensive, giving enough pre-Revolution history to set the stage and enough post-Revolution history to avoid leaving the reader stuck in mid-stream.One thing that did bother me was the author's choice of chapter titles which were somewhat murky and unclarified by the text. For instance, Chapter 1, \\"The Obstructed Giant\\", apparently refers to the obstruction of the (large) British Empire by the American colonists; but \\"Giant\\" here could also refer to King George III or the British Parliament. Chapter 2, \\"The Children of the Twice-Born\\" is even murkier; while Middlekauff does refer to this phrase in the chapter's last paragraph, his reference does not really clarify in what sense the Revolutionary generation were \\"twice-born\\". He's probably referring to Puritan beliefs that each person had to experience a personal religious awakening or rebirth in order to become a full member of the Christian church; but he doesn't make this clear.I also felt that some interpretive statements made my Middlekauff might not really be backed up by evidence. For instance, on page 402, he states that the British government \\"decided almost without thought to attack the French in the West Indies.\\" He provides a footnote referring to pages 181-186 of \\"The War for America 1775-1783\\" by Piers Mackesy; but Mackesy in those pages details various cabinet meetings that the British ministry held to plan these attacks and explains why a good offense in the West Indies was the best defense for the British. Mackesy even states on page 186 that \\"the St. Lucia expedition had been considered with care, and was far from being the senseless diversion of effort which it has sometimes been called.\\" So, in this case, it appears that Middlekauff had his own preconceptions about England's military strategy and referenced Mackesy's authoritative account of British military strategy without fully reading what he wrote. In fairness, British military strategy is not Middlekauff's focus. I expect he is much more reliable on events that took place in the 13 colonies themselves.Despite the above criticisms, I think Middlekauff's book is well organized and very educational for those looking for a deeper understanding of the American Revolution. It is certainly a good starting point and a good choice for those who might only have enough time or interest to read a single book about the American Revolution.The Oxford History of the United States, which this revised edition of 2005 is part of, appears to have several good books. I have previously read James McPherson's \\"Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era\\" and have just received Daniel Walker Howe's \\"What has God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848\\". I read McPherson's book several years ago after watching Ken Burns' Civil War documentary and thought it was very good. The Howe book has generally received very positive reviews by Amazon readers. I'm currently in the middle of it and think it is also very good.Note: Oxford has added another book to this series to fill in the gap between the Middlekauff and Howe books: \\"Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789 - 1815\\" by famed historian, Gordon S. Wood. It will be available in October, 2009. I've read Wood's \\"Creation of the American Republic\\" and \\"Radicalism of the American Revolution\\" and thought they were both excellent; so I'm sure his new book will also be worth reading."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is a fantastic book. The insight into the intricate affairs which brought the United States into existence is unparalleled. Middlekauff paves the path from colony to Constitution in a manner which is unassuming and understandable to the layperson. I am comforted that today's politicians grapple in much the same way as the Founding Fathers.I disagree with the a previous reviewer that the battle descriptions are too lengthy. They are detailed and appropriate in that the war was as important as the political process, and perhaps more.I plan to visit Boston soon and plan to carry along this book for historical reference."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The inaugural volume of the highly honored but still unfinished \\"Oxford History Of The United States\\" series is \\"The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789,\\" a superbly written, scholarly, and highly literate account of the America's War for Independence. Written by Robert L. Middlekauff, Professor of History... this is the finest account of the Revolutionary War I've found to date... even better than Benson Bobrick's \\"Angel in the Whirlwind,\\" which I've already reviewed.\\"The Glorious Cause\\" is a comprehensive account of the American Revolution designed to give readers a well rounded overview of not only the causes of the war, but also of how the war was fought. The book succeeds admirably at its task. After finishing \\"The Glorious Cause,\\" I felt a much greater appreciation for the men and women whose struggle for freedom brought forth on the North American continent a new and independent nation - the United States of America.\\"The Glorious Cause\\" begins by examining the causes of the American Revolution. In one of the book's earliest chapters, entitled \\"The Children of the Twice Born,\\" Middlekauff carefully lays out his closely reasoned and well argued thesis: that the seeds of revolution were planted long before the war was actually fought. Those seeds, embodied in the economic, social, political, and religious fabric of American society, made the evolution to democracy on the North American continent almost inevitable.The earliest settlers came to the New World because of their disenchantment with authoritarian English laws and what they viewed as centralized, overly ritualistic, dogmatic Anglican religion. When the settlers arrived with their ideals of political and congregationalist religious democracy, they found land cheap and plentiful. Whereas only about 20 percent of all Englishmen were landowners, and hence were eligible to participate in England's parliamentary democracy, over 50 percent of American colonists owned land and therefore could take part in colonial parliamentary government. The result: provincial representative assemblies tended to do the bidding of their constituents rather than the royal governors. After the Seven Years' War, tension between American political and economic interests and the interests of the British government was exacerbated by Parliament's intent to restore Britsh prerogatives in America.Tension was bound to lead to conflict, and that conflict wasn't long in coming. The American colonies were left pretty much to their own economic and political devices during the Seven Years' War, so long as they provided support for Britain's war against the French. The colonists bore the brunt of the fighting during the war against the French in North America; at war's end, they expected to be permitted to return to some semblance of self-government. It was not to be, however. Under Britain's new King and a Parliament with a new-found awareness of the American colonies' potential to enrich their colonial masters, Parliament began enacting a series of laws (Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Sugar Act, etc.) designed to bring the colonies to heel. The colonists, thoroughly imbued with the ideals of democracy and liberty, rebelled, first through political means, and finally, inevitably, through violence.Once \\"The Glorious Cause\\" completes its assessment of the causes of the war, it takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the war itself. The way the American Revolution was fought is frequently shrouded in the mists of legend, with great American heroes standing tall against the overwhelming might of the British and Hessian armies. There are strong elements of historical truth to that legend, but Middlekauff does an excellent job of portraying the war exactly as it was: a very closely contested fight between colonial masters and those who wished to throw off the yoke of colonialism.There's really almost nothing to criticize in \\"The Glorious Cause.\\" It is, in nearly every respect, an outstanding work of history. It's comprehensive in its scope; thorough in its approach; obviously very well researched; and imbued with careful, thoughtful, and incisive historical analysis. Middlekauff's descriptions of Revolutionary War battles are first-rate. The author completely captures the flavor of eighteenth century warfare in general, and of the battles of the American Revolution in particular. When I finished reading \\"The Glorious Cause,\\" I felt as if I had actually been there at some of the great battles of the war.One very minor caveat: because \\"The Glorious Cause\\" takes a fairly academic approach to studying the American Revolution, the book's somewhat lofty and scholarly sounding language may not appeal to readers with only a passing interest in history in general, and the American Revolution in particular. That's not to say the book has only a narrow appeal to academics and history scholars, however; it is definitely written for the general reader with a love of American history. It will, in my view, prove a most satisfying experience for the vast majority of history lovers who decide to read it.\\"The Glorious Cause\\" is a winner of a book in every respect. With a dearth of excellent books about the American Revolution currently in print, this volume fills a crucial need for those who wish to learn about America's struggle for independence. As the inaugural volume of the \\"Oxford History Of The United States,\\" \\"The Glorious Cause\\" also sets the tone for the whole series... highly readable, thoroughly imbued with first-rate scholarship and a polished, eloquent writing style; and simply a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauff has read deeply in the history of the American revolution and the early republic. Moreover, he is interested in more than just a simple narrative; he is interested in causes and motives, as he shows in chaps. 20 and 21 of this book, which discusses why soldiers fought instead of ran.Unfortunately, the narrative in this book has holes, and Middlekauff often fails to put people and personalities into context, making the reading less interesting than it should be. He also makes high demands on readers' attention; this, plus the holes, made the book heavy going at times.Here are some examples of holes: 1) In his discussion of the Intolerable Acts, Middlekauff fails to say what the Quebec Act was, yet on pp. 239 and 280 he assumes you know. 2) 471: \\"They all knew what happened to Buford's men at Waxhaws when they tried to run away.\\" This is the only time \\"Buford\\" and \\"Waxhaws\\" are mentioned in the book. 3) 340: \\"June also brought William Howe back to New York.\\" I can't find where it says Howe had been in New York before. 4) 462: \\"Some hint of what was coming was given ...when the victors, shouting 'Tarleton's Quarter,' shot and stabbed the wounded...\\" There is no explanation of this anywhere in the book. 478: \\"... Lee's Legion rode in. Greene once more had his army in one piece.\\" This is the first time that \\"Lee's Legion\\" is mentioned. I had to look in the index to find out that \\"Lee\\" was Henry Lee. It never explains how he got a legion. The last time we saw him, on 417, he was foraging in Delaware.No context for people and personalities: Isaac Barre gives a speech supporting the colonies in parliament (74-75), but Middlekauf never tells us who he is or why he speaks so strongly.Directly below, the American who thinks Barre's speech is \\"noble\\" is never identified. Apparently it was Jared Ingersoll, who appears in a very different light in other parts of the book.Demands on reader's attention: 406-7 \\"Amherst told the king...\\" This is Jeffrey Amherst. The last time we met him, also identified only as \\"Amherst\\", was page 276, where he was fighting Montcalm in Quebec for all of one sentence. Look up Amherst in the index, see where he appears, and see how easy it is to connect these references. This is very tough, demanding writing.Middlekauff knows the period, is a very intelligent writer, has interesting views and judgments which he backs up effectively. However, if you want to understand what is going on, you will have to go to other books in addition to this one, and you will have to pay very close attention to Middlekauff, with pencil in hand and constant reference to the index.As an example of a book which brings people and personalities strongly into context, I recommend Barbara Tuchman's \\"March of Folly\\" which has an outstanding chapter on \\"The British Lose America.\\" This will tell you who Barre was, why they were drinking toasts to John Wilkes in South Carolina in 1768, and what the Quebec Act was. It's only a tiny fragment of the history Middlekauff tries to cover, and occasionally falls down as well (Tuchman mangles the text of Barre's speech), but is a great example of fascinating historical writing which historians would do well to study."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The Glorious Cause is comprehensive and complete, extremely ambitious in its scope. It is painstakingly footnoted, documenting a wealth of sources of both primary and secondary research. It is a military history as well as a political history, and wanders into social commentary as well. Middlekauff does a masterful job of explaining how pivotal the French and Indian War was in American History as it forced England to re-examine her relationship to her American colonies. Prior to that war the colonies had not provided England with the wealth that imperial nations desire from their colonies, but they had not really cost her anything either. But that war caused England to realize that money would have to be spent to defend her stronghold in the New World if she intended to keep it. That looked to be an expensive proposition, making it necessary to find a way to make the colonies produce revenue to offset the expense. Attempts at taxation without representation, a fundamental right of Englishmen, caused colonists to examine their status as citizens of their mother country, leading them to decide that they were not Englishmen at all. Middlekauff also gives us a glimpse of heroes of the pre-revolutionary period and shows our &quot;patriots&quot; as radicals and &quot;revolutionaries,&quot; a far more accurate depiction of the men who were able to bring about so monumental a change in the course of history. It also shows the human side of the American army, and how Washington wrestled with the fact that many were unwilling to fight. Due to the length of the book and the abundance of detail, it can be tedious. Middlekauff does his readers no favor in trying to impress them with his personal observations such as: &quot;Soldiers of all nationalities usually have a special fondness for profanity, and many have a special proficiency in its use&quot; (p. 419). In a less lengthy book, such intimacy with the reader might be appreciated, but in a book of 665 pages, it is simply wasted words. Yet, upon reading the book with an eye toward shortening it, one realizes that not much could, or should, be left out. Just be prepared for the most thorough, complete, and detailed account of this period of American history that you will ever find in one book."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"After hearing the Schoolhouse Rock favorite, \\"The Shot Heard Round the World\\" about 500 times on a trip recently (I have young kids), I just had to get a good book on the American Revolution. I chose this book, the first in the Oxford History of America Series, \\"The Glorious Cause\\" by Robert Middlekauff from several at my local bookstore (don't worry Amazon, I buy a lot of books from you, too). I chose it in large part because the publisher was Oxford, who generally puts out great books and series. Overall, the book did not disappoint, but it was not quite as good as the dust jacket led me to believe.First, the good: the language and flow is excellent. In the sense of just sitting back and reading - it's a good one. The vocabulary level is pretty high, but you won't need to reach for the dictionary often. The book seems incredibly-well researched. It was clear that Middlekauff is VERY well read on this subject and period, and the footnoting is well-done. I really like being able to follow up on the sources he used and he is generous and thorough in sharing them. Also, he spends a lot of time on the events leading up to the war. Although one reviewer feels that four chapters on the Stamp Act is too much, it actually almost wasn't enough for me! I say that because if you believe what Middlekauf first states (and seems to be true from other readings), that the American people had NO desire to secede from Britain early on, then you must wonder how they got so quickly (relatively speaking) to a course of action as radical as a fight for independence! So I believe the time spent on that period is critical and interesting. The details of the battles are excellent, and generally, any material he provides is thoughtful and interesting. Basically everything he chooses to write about is done well.One of the negatives, though, is that the book feels like so much is missing. I can appreciate the desire to keep the book from becoming 3,000 pages; however, there is something about its structure or style that makes it feel like he tried to cram 3 volumes into one - and didn't succeed very well. One chapter, for example, near the end of the book covers such diverse topics as the Tories, the Indians, Slaves and Slavery, American social classes, the Navy, etc., etc. The section on Indians is only two or three pages. I understand that you can only cover so much, but I think Middlekauf would have been better served by either narrowing his focus and writing a coherent narrative, or expanding the book.I admit to much ignorance of the subject, which has been somewhat repaired by reading this book, but there seemed to be some important items left out: there was nothing about Benedict Arnold's betrayal, virtually nothing about British popular reaction to the war, very little to explain French movements and personalities, and in general, the coverage of the last few years is scantier than the first. Upon reflection, I think the criticism here is related to the first - it simply reads as if the book is a collection of really great bits and pieces of the history of the revolution without a clear plan as to what was going to be covered in detail and what was going to be left out. One of the things that contributes to this is covered by another review in detail: Middlekauf's tendency to mention key figures without any introduction or even hint that they have never been mentioned before (you find yourself thinking, \\"oh, I must have forgotten that paragraph that explained who this person is...\\", but then you go back and realize - there is no such paragraph!).My single biggest complaint, though, is reserved for the editor - the typos!!! There were misspelled words, bad grammar, and other obvious typographical errors every three or four pages. It was really, really annoying and there is really no excuse for a publisher like Oxford to let something out in this state.If I appear to be more negative than positive, then the negative came off too strong (I wish I could give it 3.5 stars). It IS a good book. I enjoyed reading it and actually found it quite hard to put down. I just wanted it to be better. I think it fell short of its potential and didn't do justice to the writer's obvious command of the subject. Maybe I'll feel differently after reading other histories of the same period - this was my first. I still recommend it, though, despite the flaws, and would read other works by Middlekauf."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I was candidly overwhelmed by the military nature of this historical work. I was hoping for a great deal more in the political, social and economic areas than Profesor Middlekauff was able to deliver. If this well researched historical text were to be part of the Oxford MILITARY History of the United States one would be less surprised at the laborious details the author gets into on the various battlefields. I have previously read two voumes of the Oxford History of the United States: James McPhearson's \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" and David Kennedy's \\"Freedom from Fear\\" dealing with the Civil War and World War II, respectively. Both of these authors deliverd strongly where Middlekauff fell far short, namely away from strictly military matters. I would strongly urge those interested in military history to read this book. Those less interested should search out some other work with a broader analytical framework such as The Radicalism of the American Revolution where its author, Gordon Wood, addresses the political theory and thought that went into the Revolution.Oxford History of the United States - Update (March 2007)After a long silence there has been some news this terrific series, as reported in the Boston Globe (December 24, 2006).It appears as if readers are in for a treat over the next 12- 24 months with the \\"missing\\" volumes at least having manuscripts into David Kennedy (Freedom from Fear) and the series' new editor with the passing of C. Vann Woodward.Volumes 1 and 2, covering the Colonial Period (1672-1763) have been assigned, in some order, yet to be made public (that I am aware of) to Fred Anderson (University of Colorado) and Andrew Cayton (Miami University of Ohio).Volume 3 - The Glorious Cause 1763-89, Robert Middlekauf PUBLISHEDVolume 4 - The U.S. from 1789-1815, Gordon Wood (Brown University)Volume 5- What Hath God Wrought 1815-48, Daniel Walker Howe (UCLA)Volume 6- Battle Cry of Freedom, 1848-65, James McPherson PUBLISHEDVolume 7- Leviathan: America Comes of Age, 1865-1900, H.W.

What will take its place is not yet known. I would speculate that Brands will be writing on this same period, just not for this series as the work was largely done. A similar event happened some time ago with Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick writing \\"The Age of Federalism, 1788-1800\\". This was originally to be part of the series but the two apparently did not go far enough chromatically for the publishers. Also John Gaddis Lewis has written extensively and was also, somehow, dropped by Oxford. All of this makes for great reading one way or another."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This second volume of &quot;The Oxford History of the United States&quot; provides an objective, sober look at the American Revolution without denying its role in world history as a truly &quot;glorious cause&quot;. In demythologizing the war as we saw it through grade-school eyes, author Robert Middlekauff profiles our Revolutionary forebears as they really were: men of courage and vision who were not without their flaws. Likewise, the British redcoats we loved to hate may not have been entirely hostile or unsympathetic to the legitimate grievances of the Americans, yet their often condescending view of the colonists and an incompetent colonial policy gave America no option but to rebel in the end. The book's well-written accounts of the Revolution's major battles will increase the reader's understanding of political, logistical, and strategic problems on both sides which contributed to the conflict's drawn-out, six-year duration. Unlike other histories of the war which end with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Mr. Middlekauff offers an absorbing narrative of the drafting of the Constitution in 1787 and its subsequent ratification by the states. After reading &quot;The Glorious Cause&quot;, I can better appreciate the sacrifices made over 200 years ago by a determined people who, in defending divinely-established rights and liberties for themselves and their posterity, defended virtue and morality as well."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauf's book starts off with a far more detailed account of the roots of the American Revolution than are offered by most books; I especially enjoyed the explanation of the Townsend Acts and Pitt's strange withdrawal from running the government. The middle part of the book was a bit unsatisfying and disjointed; he never, for example discusses Benedict Arnold's treason, and the surrender at Yorktown seemed almost anticlimatic. And those looking for a revisionist or even slightly ironic description of the main characters of the tale are going to be disappointed. Middlekauf gets back on form with the tale of how the Constitution came into being; he seems most comfortable dealing with drawing-room politics. All in all, not bad, but not the classic that others of the series have become."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is a very good book on the Revolution, or The Glorious Cause. Right from the beginning you get a sense of what Middlekauff is attempting to portray as he describes in detail the major factors that led to the Declaration: debt from the Seven Years War and the taxes that were meant to help recoup that debt. His recursive style - of starting a new chapter by backtracking in order to fill the gaps that are needed in order get back to the timeframe of the previous chapter - is an amazing way to write. I haven't seen much of this style of writing in nonfiction, only in fiction by authors such as Faulkner and Morrison, and it does well in furthering the story along. The additional chapters scattered throughout that explain some of the non war aspects are very helpful and interesting to read.This is a long read, though, so prepare yourself. It doesn't help that the last 80 or so pages is about the debates at the Constitutional Convention, which is an extremely dry read that should not have been included in the first place. Additionally, there is a focus on the battles fought, so if you prefer not to read about battles than this book would not be for you. All in all, Middlekauff did exactly as he set out to do - even with the Constitutional Convention chapters, since this does fall into the premise of his book - and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the time period. For those who are also interested in the French and Indian War read Anderson's Crucible of War, which is a perfect lead in to the The Glorious Cause."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"\\"The Glorious Cause\\" is an excellent secondary source on the Revolutionary Era. However, in this review I will focus on the presentation of the Kindle edition rather than the book's contents. The Kindle edition has some problems.The biggest issue is that in two places, large chunks of text appear out of order (e.g., toward the end of Chapter 21 there's a sudden break mid-sentence, followed by several pages of text that belongs at the start of Chapter 22).The other issues are ones that seem to be shared by many non-fiction Kindle books. The maps and the index are illegible. Also, while the notes are linked (a good thing), you can't page through the notes themselves. Thus, if you click on a particular note and find that it reads \\"ibid.,\\" there's no easy way to access the preceding notes and find out what source \\"ibid.\\" is referring to.Notwithstanding these problems, I'm delighted that Oxford has made \\"The Glorious Cause\\" available as a Kindle book. Oxford has been one of the most active Kindle publishers and should be praised for jumping in."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"To get a little background out of the way first, let me state that the highest credentials I possess in historical studies are a minor in History and a love of the genre. I read books very quickly and usually read three to five at a time. This book took me over three weeks and was the only one I could read during that time. It is an absolute slog. If you plan on reading this book, be sure to keep a notebook from the beginning so you can keep up with the various characters and locations, because keeping a thread going throughout the book is definitely not one of Middlekauff's strong suits.Now for the actual review. Because the cover says \\"The American Revolution,\\" I mistakenly geared myself up to read about that. This is not a shortcoming of the author, but a misstep on my part. Let me just tell you before you begin that the first shot is not fired until page 276. For a huge part of the first fourth of the book, Middlekauff describes local politics in the colonies. I do not wish to criticize the choice of subjects, because some of it is very interesting, but be prepared for pages and pages of description of two feuding families in Rhode Island's early political scene.Finally, once battle begins, the book moves along fairly quickly. This (I think of it as the middle portion, but that is not based on physical distance in the book) was my personal favorite part. The only drawback is an odd disconnect as he repeatedly breaks from battle in America to go back and give half-hearted attempts to explain the politicking in England at the time. That did interest me, and I would like to have learned more about the politics there at the time, but I did not because he stayed on the topic only long enough to describe changes in Cabinet positions, the general mood of the King, then swerved back to a battle in America. As I read about the battle, I began to look forward to the story of Benedict Arnold. He is mentioned on page 390, but still leading American troops. Although everyone knows the name and that he was a traitor, I had never heard the specifics. Where did he defect? Was there a battle? Did he take men or equipment with him? My hopes were dashed, however, for the next mention of him comes on page 476. \\"It had none, and the dispositions of British troops seemed favorable to a new expedition to the north - Benedict Arnold, who had defected to the British the preceding September, had led a raiding expedition to Virginia...\\" Curious to ignore that part of the Revolution, which obviously interests many people.On to the back third of the book. This is where I began noticing the editing errors others have commented on. It almost seems as though the editor got tired of reading it and some mistakes slipped through the cracks. I am very forgiving of these, however, because I was only pulled away from the story six or seven times throughout this massive book, and given its size, I believe a few mistakes are understandable. The last portion of the books suffers from what I think of as \\"junk drawer writing.\\" I kind of got the feeling that Middlekauff had many threads he wanted to expound upon, but either did not allocate room or time, or did not feel it was enough to constitute a large chapter, so many things get pushed into a small space. The political and social atmosphere after the British surrendered was not described in nearly enough detail for my taste. The Constitutional Convention, while getting its own chapter, could have been told in much more detail. That last few chapters, covering the mood of the country, the Convention, and ratification, seemed much shorter than all the previous chapters. This last third of the book was where Middlekauff lost me. Reading it became a chore and I frequently flipped to see how many pages I had left. It is very disheartening to invest so much time in a book then feel as though you cannot wait for it to end.In case you are reading this trying to decide whether or not to buy it, I will attempt to offer the fairest review I can. If you have not read much on the Revolution, I would start elsewhere. If you have read a moderate amount on it, as I had in my collegiate studies and my time since graduating two years ago, I would not read this yet. As I alluded to in the Benedict Arnold comment earlier, Middlekauff sometimes skips over what many would deem to be the most interesting stories of the era. Instead he focuses on obscure political battles and minor characters of the time. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it supports my advice of reading other histories first. I would recommend this book only for true students of the period. If you are not intricately familiar with the major characters and events of the time, I am afraid you will feel this book is a waste of your time. Then again, if you have studied it that much, I do not know that there will be much new material for you here. Unfortunately, in my previous historical studies, I had focused mainly on other subjects and had hoped to find an in-depth introductory general history of the Revolutionary era. That is not this book. Again I want to point out that this is my mistake, not the author's.Aside from his sometimes curious subject choice, this is a well-researched, lengthy history of an amazing era. Although I came away unsatisfied, I do not wish that I had never read it. I just wish I had not read it yet."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This is the best account of the American Revolution that I have read. I was particularly impressed with the detail of events leading up to the war. If there is a quibble, it is that the book contains too few maps."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"\\"Robert Middlekauff has presented us the first volume in the Oxford History of the United States, \\"The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789\\". The presentation, while demonstrative of Middlekauff's reading and knowledge on the subject, is not without its faults.The best way to describe this read: I was happy to start it, and I was happy to finish it.Wanting to read the series in order, \\"The Glorious Cause\\" was the first Oxford volume that I read. At 700+ pages, it is more than what might be typically read by one with only a casual interest in the American Revolution. It is my belief, misplaced though it might be, that this book will appeal mostly to readers who have a deep and developed interest in the subject matter. And this is exactly where the book fails to deliver. The admirable footnoting throughout the book reflect materials used primarily form the 20th century. For a truly academic work in such a prestigious series as the Oxford History of The United States, I would have expected the author to employ a much greater number of original source documents to develop his own hypotheses and suppositions, relying less on the inferences of others.Another issue that I have is one outside of the control of the author. Such a massive undertaking as this, covering 26 of the most important and pivotal years that our country and perhaps human history have ever experienced, can't help but lead to some events getting the short shrift. What IS in control of the author, however, is exactly which of these events gets covered in greater detail, and which get less attention. That the author devotes four chapters to the Stamp Act, and only two chapters to the writing and ratification of the constitution, is troubling to this reviewer. These final two chapters addressing the Constitutional convention and the ratification process seem to be post scripted.If one wishes to read a single volume covering the history of the American Revolution, one will be depriving oneself of the detail that may encourage further thought and discovery, and in so doing will be exposed to abridged versions of monumental events. Constricted by length, an author is left presenting pared down history. The process of paring down, and the remnant that remains, can too often reflect an author's personal bias. When the author, through the heavy use of secondary sources for research, is beginning this process with biases formed by others, the end product suffers.For my money, more stands to be gained through reading books which, through wonderful detail afforded by the amount able to be written, focus on segments of the American Revolution. \\"Defiance of The Patriots\\" by Benjamin L. Carp is a very good source for the circumstances and events leading to the Boston Tea Party. \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" by David Hackett Fischer is a nice biography, but also takes an in depth look at the initial battles of the American Revolution. \\"1776\\" by David McCullough tells the story of George Washington's first full year in command of the Continental Army, culminating with the 1776 Christmas Day Battle of Trenton. These only cover the era through the end of 1776, but are fantastic reads to stoke the interest of this era in ways that \\"The Glorious Cause\\" falls far short."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"A lengthy read, but well worth it. Middlekauff and McPhereson, who wrote the Civil War Era history \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" for this Oxford series, took similar approaches in striking an appropriate balance between describing the military campaigns and discussing the broader political and civil forces at work. At times he can provide a bit too much detail for the casual reader, but for the most part only when covering topics given shorter shrift in the conventional narrative. Most useful to me were the first few chapters, as he describes politics on both sides of the Atlantic, and how various people and interests affected the eventual but not inevitable march toward revolution, and the final chapters, where he does a brilliant job making the connections between the radical revolutionary ideas that got things kicked off and the more pragmatic Constitution that resulted.A great reminder of how much our grand, continuing experiment in constitutional republicanism could have failed at many contigent points in its early phases. There is much to keep in mind here as we watch democracy slowly take hold in places like Iraq and Afghanistan."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Glorious Cause was my introduction to the Oxford History series.While I had purchased others, this was the first of the series I read.I was somewhat disappointed because I expected much more.While I found the passages on key battles and the Revolutionary War in the South excellent, I felt coverage on other key events on the period lacking.Volumes of books on the Declaration of Independence,Franklin,Adams,etc have been written but I felt were barely covered here.Especially frustrating - Middlekaupf covered the courageousnees, ability and leadership of Benedict Arnold yet only mentioned his treachery of Washington and the colonists in a time reference to another event.Glorious cause was a fair read with much overview information with very little insight.I do look forward to the other books of the Oxford series."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"The good and bad of this book can really be summed up that easily in my opinion. The book is very detailed in its history, however, the amount of detail the book provides also gets in the way of the story. The first 5 or so chapters talks about tax collectors and stories of individuals. While it is interestng, for me, the amount and detail of individual stories takes away from the story of the revolution and all the events which lead up to it."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"On balance this is a good, but a not great, book. I expected more from the first book in the Oxford History of the US series. This is not to say that the book is bad or not worth reading, it is just that it is, in my opinion, somewhat flawed, especially the first third of the book. After completing the early sections I was tempted to stop and go on to something else. Fortunately I did not, because, from my perspective, the book got better.First the good points - This book covers the period from before the revolutionary war (starting in1763) - to the adoption of the Constitution in 1789. It is a well-written and scholarly work. It gives a reasonably good picture of the specific events leading up to the conflict and the positions of the Americans and the British. It discusses the history of the war and the reasons why it became international in scope. There were some very interesting sections concerning various aspects of the conflict that are often not covered in general treatments, such as: the medical crops, the wives left behind, financial and organizational difficulties, and many others. I learned a lot. For example, I got a much better appreciation for George Washington and his better generals and the handicaps that they labored under. I now understand that his genius (and those of his most successful subordinates) lay in making the most of the meager resources at their disposal and in never allowing the British the complete victory that would have won them the war. This book also corrected a misconception that I had concerning the numerical strength of the loyalists supporting the British crown. Contrary to the view stated in most books on the American Revolution Professor Middlekauff cites statistics showing that the loyalists only comprised about 1/5 of the non-slave population, not 1/3 as I had always believed and that they were almost everywhere a harassed minority. One reason for the failure of the British was that relatively few colonists flocked to their cause. There were loyalists and loyalist militia, but they were not as numerous as had been expected. The very interesting analysis of the difficulties that the British had in fighting a limited war against an enemy that could be defeated in battle, but never really subdued, has great resonance for current readers.Before discussing what I feel are some of the flaws that prevent me from giving this book a five star recommendation, I would like to make a general comment. No single book, even one with almost 700 pages of text, can cover in detail the scope of the events leading up to the American Revolutionary war, the war itself, the development of a constitution and the ratification of that constitution. As such, the best that an author can hope for is that they provide a reasonable framework from which the reader can search for more detailed information. I believe that Professor Middlekauff has done this, although with the flaws that are described below.Now the flaws:1) In my opinion, this book does not sufficiently focus on the needs of the more casual reader who may require more background information. For instance, several chapters are devoted to the Stamp act, but there is no mention of what documents required stamps (or even that these stamps were to go on documents rather than on letters). Washington's service in the French and Indian war is mentioned in passing, but never really discussed. This was a pivotal event in Washington's life and the reason why he was appointed as the head of the Continental army. Surely this was worth more than just a brief passing reference. This is especially surprising since the book discusses the lives of English leaders, who were only briefly involved with the events leading up to the war. Likewise, insufficient background information is provided for all of the other important American political and military leaders. In my opinion, the book needs a brief overview of the founding of the various colonies, their various systems of government and the Americans involved in the war. There is little or no background concerning the British parliamentary system and British politics before and during the war. That there was British opposition to the war is hardly mentioned. There is a lack of a comprehensive review of the Articles of Confederation. They are referred to and there is a very brief mention of their development, but no systematic review of their most important features. Some deficiencies are discussed in the context of the need for their replacement by a new constitution. In contrast, there is a lengthy discussion of the development of the Virginia Constitution. It appears as if the author assumes that the reader is completely familiar with the Articles of Confederation, so no review of their most salient features is required. The book could have been greatly improved with short chapters rectifying all these and other omissions.2) This is not primarily a military history book and those who want more about the fighting can find better choices. Pivotal battles, such as that at Bunker/Breed hill, Saratoga and Long Island/New York are discussed, but only in the most minimal way. Only one sentence is devoted to the important American victory at Bennington. The savage fighting at Oriskany NY is not even mentioned, nor is the massacre of American troops at Paoli PA. The author does a much better job of describing the fighting in the Carolinas, Georgia and finally at Yorktown.3) The book contains 20 maps, but they are murky at best. The land mass is shown in gray with black lettering for the town and rivers and with black arrows denoting troop movements. In contrast, the water (which generally contained almost no further detail) is shown nicely in white. Single maps are used for a whole campaign or battle, instead of multiple maps denoting different stages of that aspect of the war. The result of these deficiencies is to reduce the usefulness of the few maps that are provided.The addition of perhaps 20 additional maps and about 30 pages of additional text aimed at the more casual reader, could have gone far to correct these flaws. Given that book is 736 pages long (including the index and bibliographical notes), an additional 50 pages would not have seriously increased the size or cost of the book. If necessary, some judicious editing could eliminate some extraneous details, enabling the addition of these 50 pages without increasing the final size of the book. It is hoped that these flaws will be corrected in a subsequent revision. Then, in my opinion, it would be the 5 star book that I had expected it to be."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Great book.

It was a little hard to follow at time but i got right back on track. This book was required material for my class and it covers alot!"},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Robert Middlekauff wrote a very good overview of the American Revolution. He did a nice job of explaining the immediate and long-term causes of the drive for independence. He also showed that the nation had some real growing pains in the Articles of Confederation era. He related the process of the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and the development of a national government in America.Middlekauff is an effective communicator and he covered all the bases in writing this quality historical work. There were few glaring errors in the book. Some have magnified minor omissions and errors, but this seems to be nitpicking to me. The book is written at a general collegiate level, so there is some assumption on the part of the author that the reader will have a basic understanding of the people and events discussed.The book is fairly interesting, but it can get tedious in spots. The quality of the writing is good and not great. The interest of the reader may wane in spots and there is some redundancy. However, the book is very informative and is a good academic resource. I enjoyed reading the book, although it doesn't quite reach the level of a classic."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I am not a history major, but enjoy reading about it. As such I can not vouch for the accuracy of the information presented.I did feel that nearing the end of the book much was left unsaid or not covered at all. I would have been very interested in the author's take on the defection of Benedict Arnold. Arnold is mentioned quite prominently up until his defection to the British with only a single mention that he was now on the British side.I have yet to find the volume of books that I would like on the American Revolution. Something that would be similar to Shelby Footes Civil War three book set.An excellent companion book to The Glorious Cause is \\"The Rise of American Democracy.\\" While I anticipated a very dry book it ended up being quite engrossing.The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to LincolnI purchased it from elsewhere as a single volume."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"After watching a TV mini-series on the revolution I wanted to learn more, so I turned to this book to fill in the blanks. It was very disappointing to find that the TV series was more informative than this lengthy book. For example, the documentary describes how a vicious British cavalry officer named Tarleton kills surrendering American soldiers on the battlefield. Though the book describes the battle where this occurred, author Middlekauf makes no mention of Tarleton's brutality or the fact that Tarleton was later reprimanded by his superiors. Later in the book, Middlekauf describes in a subsequent battle won by Americans how some of our troops killed surrendering British troops in reprisal while yelling \\"Tarleton's quarter!\\" This would have made absolutely no sense had I not seen the TV documentary first.I feel compelled to lower my rating even further because Middlekauf devotes the first and last quarters of the book (meaning only half of the book actually describes the revolution) to \\"what people on each side were thinking\\" (first quarter) and \\"why did American soldiers fight?\\" (last quarter). Since I was am not writing a thesis on these topics, I found myself flipping page after page without feeling like I missed anything important.Most telling to me is that I feel like I'm going to have to buy a different book to find out what I didn't learn from the TV documentary."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"This was a weak effort, esp. considering that the book is part of the Oxford History of the US. It offers no new insights, has very little arguement in it, and as such, there are far better single-volume works out there to be read. The book starts out very well in describing life in the 18th century on the eve of the war; it quickly goes down hill from there. Middlekauf does not seem to understand the British Army of the time either, as he frequently refers to British regiments by their Victorian-era names. I recommend John Alden's book instead."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"Middlekauff's book aims to be an in-depth overview of the Revolutionary War period but falls short in many areas. The Oxford series seem to be written for the average reader who wants to get an introduction into the time period and events. Middlekauff's book, although not difficult to understand, will probably only be best understood by those who have studied the American Revolution before (besides in your eigth-grade history class). Some key figures are given fairly good descriptions, but others simply appear without any sort of introduction. The events are not presented in the chronological narrative structure that newcomers to the subject will be able to follow easily. In an attempt to surround events to understand them fully, Middlekauff jumps around a lot. This leads to not only gaps of information that other reviewers have detailed, but repetition of information. The book is uneven in its studies - some events are detailed with extreme clarity and others are muddled through or skipped over. The most well-written parts of the book involve the Stamp Act crisis and the details of the major conflicts. Middlekauff's attempts to explain what was happening in Britain during the time period are mixtures of insightful analysis and huge gaps. Because he does not consistently follow events in Britain, the passages concerning them usually begin with a short, confusing explanation that the political scene changed a lot since the last time it was discussed.The thesis revolves around the spread, fight over, and the eventual embodiment of the revolutionary ideals in American government. Overall, Middlekauff succeeds in his descriptions of how a varied political landscape of separate colonies evolved into a confederation and then nation, without making the process seem the obvious and only path available. It was a difficult and uncertain adventure, which Middlekauff excels at capturing. The biggest problem with the book is that it is reminiscent of a time when history was the study of white men and their wars. Almost no time is spent discussing the role of women, blacks, or Native Americans in the Revolution. The homefront is generally only discussed in terms of how they supplied (or failed to) the American soldiers, and this is mostly about the men. Slaves are given only a few paragraphs and Native Americans are reduced to the shadowy evil-threat to civilization that was far too common in old history. Almost nothing is mentioned of Native American allies, but much is said about the threat they presented to Geogian settlers. This treatment is almost unheard of in modern historiography, and was out of date when Middlekauff published the book. You cannot get a complete overview of the time without addressing these people and the issues that effect them. How they are involved in the Revolution's ideals is never discussed, despite the fact that this is the thesis. This failure makes the astounding amount of research that went into the book look incomplete and should be taken into account by anyone interested in reading about the period."},{"Title":"The Glorious Cause The American Revolution, 1763-1789","review":"I cannot bring myself to give this book more than one star...you may be asking why ? well I'll explain why....as an overview of the causes of the American Revolution, the author leaves out one important factor concerning early Anglo-settlement. Sure, the founding colonists found religious freedom, and easy access to an abundance of land, but at the expense of who ? At the expense of another culture, that's who !!! The white anglos came over here and stole the land from the native Americans....the only real Americans in my book. They did this by spreading disease and murder just to establish themselves as a nation !!! When one studys the history of this country, one must evaluate the positive as well as the negative. Here, the author fails by not explaining this !!

Even though I was well aware of our planet's problems (which include global warming, loss of forest and farmland, loss of fresh water, ongoing and threatened epidemic diseases, exhaustion of our fossil fuel resources, increasing pollution, etc.), I found Brown's fact-filled cataloguing of these problems to be scarier and more alarming than any description I had previously encountered. The gut-wrenching impact of Brown's description of our planet's ills stems partly from the thoroughness with which he backs up his claims and partly from the fact that, unlike most analysts, he forces us to consider ALL of our global problems simultaneously. One is left with the impression--after reading the first half of the book--that it will take super-human efforts to prevent ecological, economic, political and social catastrophe within this century. But then, in the second half of the book, Brown describes strategies by which all of these problems can be solved. Like his description of the earth's problems, Brown's descriptions of ways to solve those problems are well-researched and convincing. In most cases, aspects of his recommended strategies have already been tried in one country or another, in one place or another, and have been shown to work. The strategies do not require tremendous expenditure (an annual outlay of 1/6 of the world's military budget will be sufficient), nor do they require departures from standard market capitalism. One strategy, of which economists would approve (I believe) involves shifting taxes from income to ecologically destructive activities (thus reflecting the true cost of such activities). Such tax-shifting would not increase the average person's tax burden, but it would create tremendous incentives to reduce environmental destruction. In fact, the strategies outlined by Brown are so feasible (so easy to carry out) and promise to accomplish so much that I found the second half of the book to be exhilarating. In my view, it should be required reading for every inhabitant of our planet. Perhaps the word \\"required\\" is too strong. No threat of punishment will be needed to make any of us who start reading this book continue to the end. Brown's writing is forceful and clear, the book is fun to read, and one feels much better after reading it. There _is_ hope for this planet!"},{"Title":"Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble","review":"It's a real shame that the publisher did not take the trouble to load the table of contents into the product information section provided by Amazon, because that alone should persuade anyone that gets to this page that the book is a MUST BUY MUST READ MUST SHARE.Each of the following section titles has six sub-titles that I will not repeat here:1.

Eradicating Poverty, Stabilizing Populations8. Restoring the Earth9. Feeding Seven Billion Well10. Stabilizing Climate11. Designing Sustainable Cities12. Building a New Economy13. Plan B: Building a New Future.Although an updated version of the first edition published in 2003, this version can be said to be both completely new, and finally ready for public consumption now that Al Gore has put Global Warming on the public mind.I still prefer J. F. Rischard'sHigh Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Themfor the general reader, and I still think E. O. Wilson'sThe Future of Lifeis one of the top three in this area, but this book by Lester Brown has the merit of consolidating and structuring detail in a manner I have not seen elsewhere.I recommend the book be ready in conjunction with books by Herman Daly'sValuing the Earth: Economics, Ecology, Ethicsand Paul Hawken'sNatural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, in part because everyone is now starting to realize that green sustainability is in fact the non-negotiable first step for any business to survive into the next decade--natural capitalism.Most intriguing to me, and the heart of the book on page 257, is the consolidated Plan B budget totallying $161 billion a year needed to meet all of the goals the author postulates.BASIC SOCIAL GOALS12B Universal primary education04B Adult literacy06B School lunch in 44 poorest countries04B Assistant to pregnant women and preschool childen in 44 poorest07B Reproductive health and family planning33B Universal health care02B Closing the condom gap (Bill & Melinda Gates can have this one)EARTH RESTORATION GOALS06B Reforesting the earth24B Protecting topsoil on cropland09B Restoring rangelands10B Stabilizing water tables13B Restoring fisheries31B Protecting biological diversityAs the author points out on the next page, world military expenditures total $975B a year, with the US alone responsible for $492B (this was published before we all knew of the half trillion dollar cost of the Iraq invasion and occupation). Hence, the $161B a year total is a fraction of the total spent on out-dated military systems, and could be funded by the US alone if we had the right leadership and public consensus.Personally, and based on other readings, I believe that the author is under-estimating the costs, and avoiding a focus on many other factors including the urgent need to eradicate transnational crime and end inter-state and civil war. This is, however, a superb start and ideally suited as a primer for any level of learning.Readers interested in seeing a broader perspective that places the ten high-level threats (poverty, infectuous disease, environmental degradation, inter-state conflict, civil war, genocide, other atrocities, proliferation, terrorism and transnational crime) in the context of the twelve policies that must be managed as a whole by all nations (agriculture, debt, diplomacy, economy, education, energy, family, immigration, justice, security, society, and water), and that in turn oriented toward the urgency of keeping the eight challengers (Brazil, China, Indonesia, India, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Wild Cards) from repeating our mistakes, can check in at Earth Intelligence Network.Rescuing are planet and our civilization is going to be a great deal harder than the author suggests, and is going to need a massive awakening by the public as to the \\"true cost\\" of all that we are doing wrong. I expect that we will succeed, in part from top down efforts by Al Gore and this author among others, and in part by bottom up efforts where individuals can get from the Internet the \\"true cost\\" of any good or service in terms of water content, fuel content, sweatshop labor content, and tax avoidance status. Noami Klein's books,No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No JobsandThe Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalismare recommended in this regard.Over-all an absolutely superb piece of work that caps the author's decades of advocacy on behalf of the planet. There is no other person that has been focused on this topic with due diligence year after year.I believe this author should be recognized, along with Herman Daly and Paul Hawken and Anthony Lovins and others, for their total commitment over decades."},{"Title":"Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble","review":"Our world is changing quickly. The media and our government are so focused on what is happening today that we are getting very little information about what is going to happen next. Thank goodness we have Lester Brown to fill us in on the near future and unfortunately, it is not a pretty picture. Over- population, the oil peak, world hunger, global warming, growing poverty and other calamities are knocking on our door. We need to make broad, deep, and serious changes in the way we live and work. First we need a dialogue about the problems and the solutions, and this book is a great primer on all of this and more. I highly recommend it and while your at it, read The Long Emergency by James Howard Kunstler, another book about the same issues but with a very different take on the subject."},{"Title":"Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble","review":"Plan B 2.0 is a timely and hopeful discussion of human survival.In Plan B, Lester Brown provided a much-needed wake-up call for global action. Plan B 2.0 is a well written update with further information about continuing environmental degradation, as well as potential solutions.The first half of the book, titled \\"A Civilization in Trouble,\\" reviews the environmental impacts we humans have had on our planet. The author discusses upcoming decline of global oil supplies, falling water tables, rising global temperatures, shrinking forests, and the enormous potential for environmental refugees. The writing style is clear and accessible. I was especially pleased with the lack of hyperbole. These sections are well researched and documented with good endnotes.The second half of the book, titled \\"The Response, Plan B,\\" reviews what we can do. The author discusses human population, biological diversity, food resources, climate stabilization, energy productivity, and sustainable living.

The first half of the book, filled with many little known but interesting and important facts lets us know how a declining resource base at a time of rapidly increasing human population is taking us toward a very unstable and potentially dangerous world. In the second half of the book he spells out what needs to be done worldwide and how it can be accomplished with about 1/3rd of our annual US Defense Dept. expenditures if we wake up to the facts and act immediately.The book was so factual and encouraging that I bought a dozen to share with my congregation in the hope of spreading the facts, stimulating concern, and seeing some personal action."},{"Title":"Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble","review":"I'll just add my 5-stars vote.

There is nothing that I can imagine reading that could provide as honest a vision of current status in the world and the possibilities of the future.The thing that makes Brown's work most amazing is that it is not solely a book of gloom and doom like so many others. Oh the picture he paints in the first half is stark. In a lot of ways it is even more terrifying than the books that set out to scare you simply because he doesn't resort to theatrics or trickery. It's all just plain spoken terrifying truthfulness.However, unlike any other book I've read, Plan B 2.0 focuses as much or more on the solutions as on the problems. Brown spends so much effort to describe in detail the multitude of strategies that can be implemented and are being implemented across the world that will preserve the human race, that you just can't help but actually come to believe that it really is possible for us to survive. We have everything we need. The knowledge and the tools are at our fingertips if we just have the will to use them. You feel hope and indeed pride in our species when you read about how astoundingly capable we are of adapting to trials of epic proportions.Yet at the same time he doesn't delude you into thinking that it is easy or a sure thing. Rather he makes it clear that the future of the world depends on all of us having the courage to step up and rise to the challenge."},{"Title":"The Narrow Way","review":"A testimony to this book's increasing usefulness is that in its short life in print(it was first published in 1993,though some seperate chapters were printed in tract a few years earlier),it has already been translated into Spanish,Korean,Russian and Chinese. It is uncompromising in setting forth the Biblical way of salvation and treats the duties of self-examination and self denial in an exceedingly searching manner. On page 35 Mr. Nichols gives us one of the reasons it is so important to have our thinking clear on matters of eternal weight and consequence: \\"Most people create a god to their own liking and who exists only in their own imaginations. The consequences of creating a god to our own liking are nothing short of eternity in hell. We can be wrong about some things,but to be wrong about salvation is the greatest error we can make. It is fatal to our eternal souls\\" It is also a mistake that if made the person will forever experience sorrow and torment for such a fatal mistake. One aspect regarding the nature of saving faith which is missing in many pulpits in our day, and even where it is not completely absent nor given sufficient emphasis ,is the teaching of our Lord on the necessity of self denial. It is at the threshold of someone entering into the kingdom of God that this Biblical truth is set forth in the Scriptures. This truth is presicely and powerfully given to us in \\"The Narrow Way\\" by William C.Nichols. I will give a brief quote from p.55 to illustrate this \\"When self is denied, Christ becomes the chief object of love,trust,faith and dependence.Christ becomes master in place of self... For Biblical self-denial as described here is the essence of repentance.\\" We live in a day that if anything is characterized by self indulgence,thus the desperate need to emphasize this aspect of Biblical light and truth.I believe that anybody who reads this book will not be able to say on the day of judgement that he or she did not know the way to obtain eternal life. That person will only realize that they knew 'the way' and rejected it, resulting in everlasting woe and misery. The author quotes and was obviously influenced by great evangelistic sermons and books from previous centuries but has written one of the greatest evangelistic books of the 20th century in my judgement. If anyone is uncertain as to whether he or she is on the narrow way that leads to life,this is THE book that will help point them to that way that leads to eternal life. May the Lord be pleased to give an ever increasing hearing for this book in our nation and amongst the inhabitants of the whole world for the everlasting good of the souls of many."},{"Title":"Rim of the Pit","review":"A snowbound group of people in the north woods must deal with a supernatural killer unleashed by a seance they hold. Locked rooms and impossible murders seem to be explainable only by believing that the dead can come back to take revenge on the living. Footprints that begin and end in the middle of unbroken snowfields, the appearance of a Wendigo that can swoop down on its victims, someone killed by someone possessed by a dead man -- these are some of the puzzles adventurer Rogan Kinkaid is faced with in this classic whodunit/howwasitdun. (Also worth seeking is Talbot's first novel with Kinkaid, \\"The Hangman's Handyman.\\" Not as atmospheric as \\"Rim,\\" it features a nice puzzle concerning an ancient curse.)"},{"Title":"Rim of the Pit","review":"This book is one of my favourite mysteries.There is great density,the plot is always moving and I found more than twelve impossibilites,most of them having ingenuous solutions.The absence of the fingerprints in the snow ( a recurent theme in the detective novel )is exploited in a very inventive way.About the theme of spiritism and fake mediums,only two books reach the level of this one to my opinion:&quot;the plague court&quot; (JD Carr) and &quot;la quatri&egrave;me porte&quot; (Paul Halter).

Enjoy."},{"Title":"Rim of the Pit","review":"Oh, my...this mystery is hard to describe. If you are a fan of John Dickson Carr you should enjoy this. At the same time, this book is so over-the-top \\"Carr'ian\\" that it almost reads like a loving pastiche.This novel is probably the ultimate form of a type of mystery that is pretty much not being written nowadays. The crime is a puzzle, where mysterious events can be given both rational and supernatural explanations. The entire novel is written as a challenge to the reader...not just a \\"whodunit\\", but also a \\"how could it possibly have happened?\\"Like Carr's writing, the events described in this book are so inexplicably weird that their 'rational' explanations, when the veil is finally lifted by the protagonist, tend to stretch a modern reader's credulity quite a bit. But to call that a fault is to do a disservice to this unusual type of mystery.Locked room tales like \\"Rim of the Pit\\" exist almost within an alternate reality. They are not meant to be realistic depictions of commonplace crime or normal police procedure. Rather, these are fantastic imaginings of what *might* happen under the most bizarre sets of circumstances. If you are prepared to accept that basic 'rule' then you will thoroughly enjoy this tour de force of mystery and detection.The only down-side to this novel, which is a flaw in some books written even by the master of this genre himself (JD Carr), is that sometimes the author gets so carried away with the mechanics of the impossible crime that he neglects to develop the characters as much as they might have been.Overall, this is absolutely not to be missed if you are a fan of 1930s-1940s impossible crime novels."},{"Title":"Abstract of systematic theology","review":"This systematic theology by the first president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, now in Louisville, KY, puts the lie to the theory that Baptists are not adept in the finer points of theology. Well-written and easy to follow, this work is great for those who love solid, Reformed (Calvinistic) theology but may have trouble following Calvin or Turretin. Boyce readily admits that he learned his trade at Old Princeton and indeed the spirit of Jonathan Edwards, A. A. Archibald and Charles Hodge are immediately seen. This is, however, far from being a derivative work. Along with Dagg's \\"Manual of Theology,\\" it constitutes one of the two great works by Southern Baptist theologians in the Nineteenth Century. Today's Southern Baptists who often have a weak, decisionalistic, Arminian theology would do well to heed the learned wisdom of their founders. This is an eminently Biblical and sound volume answering almost any query a Sunday School teacher, deacon or even pastor might have. I have given it four, as opposed to five, stars merely because there is no discussion of the sacraments or ordinances as Baptists are prone to refer to them. This may reflect the lesser importance of these facets of the Christian Faith to Baptists or it may be that there was a desire to avoid bringing divisive confessional differences into his masterwork. Whatever the reason, it is only a mild distraction and the rest of the work is so beneficial that owning it becomes a great joy and privilege to any Christian, whether Southern Baptist or not."},{"Title":"Abstract of systematic theology","review":"This is the premier handbook for Southern Baptist Theological views.

The emphasis on this first volume is the study of differential forms and de Rham Cohomology Theory. Spivak also considers two 'bonus' topics: integral manifolds & foliations and Lie groups.You'll need some prerequisites to get started. For the differential topology material (including Sard's Theorem and Whitney's 2n+1 Embedding Theorem), I recommend Hirsch'sDifferential Topology. For results on determinants and symmetric groups, I use Hungerford'sAlgebra, now in its 12th printing. For the general topology material (Hausdorff spaces, Urysohn metrization, etc.), I recommend Munkres'Topology (2nd Edition).Spivak begins this volume with a review of topological manifolds in Chapter 1. The author provides the basic definitions and gives lots of examples of surfaces and other manifolds. The discussion of manifolds and surfaces continues in the Chapter 1 Exercises. (The author routinely used the exercise set to continue the thread of discussion.) Quick mention of the surface classification theorem is made, although for the proof of this, you'll need to look in Hirsch or Munkres. The reader gets to have fun gluing topological handles onto and cutting disks out of the 2-sphere.Chapter 2 reviews some of the basic concepts from differential topology, including the fundamental Whitney Embedding Theorem and Sard Critical Point Theorem. Basic properties of smooth maps are also studied.Chapter 3 studies the general vector bundle and specializes to the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. The author is keen on the idea that the reader 'grok' (i.e. understand intuitively) the tangent bundle and the associated induced maps and commutative diagrams. The notion of orientability is also introduced.Multilinear forms and their tensor product are studied in Chapter 4. This is a key building block in the construction of de Rham cohomology. The author gets side tracked a bit with a discussion of differences in classical/modern notion.Chapter 5 is a very nice chapter on vector fields. Instead of just appealing to results from differential equations (as is usually done) to build integral curves and the flow of a vector field, Spivak establishes these needed results from differential equations using a very accessible integral equations/fixed point argument. Once the flow of a vector field is show to exist (locally), Lie derivatives and Lie brackets are then studied.Following the integral curves & vector fields material in the previous chapter, the author detours a bit and studies the problem of integral manifolds of dimensions other than 1 along with applications to foliations in Chapter 6. Spivak establishes a basic version of the Frobenius Integrability Theorem and uses examples to motivate the result before diving into the proof.The basics of de Rham cohomology are established in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8. Alternating and skew-symmetric forms are discussed, although is may be easiest to establish some of the needed results on the symmetric group of permutations after reviewing Hungerford'sAlgebra. Differential forms and their wedge product are defined, and Frobenius' Theorem can now be restated in terms of differential forms. Two versions of Stokes Theorem are established and this result is applied to integrating forms on manifolds and studying properties of the degree of a proper map of between manifolds. The formal definition of the de Rham cohomology groups is given and some basic calculations are carried out.The author does something curious with one of the main results of de Rham cohomology, namely the homotopy-invariance property. He starts this with a discussion section in Chapter 7 (not a called out theorem) in which contractible manifolds are show to have zero cohomology in all dimension by an explicit calculation showing all closed k-forms are exact. The results that the author establishes in Chapter 7 for this \`one-off' calculation are precisely what are needed to show the more general result that homotopic maps induce equivalent homomorphisms of de Rham cohomology later in Chapter 8.Chapter 9 is a very nice chapter covering several foundational topics of Riemannian geometry; include the Riemannian metric, geodesics, the exponential map, geodesic completeness and tubular neighborhoods.Chapter 10 is a short chapter on Lie groups and is something of a detour from the main thread. The author uses the material as a source of application of the material from the first nine chapters.Returning to de Rham cohomology in Chapter 11, more foundational results from algebraic topology are studied, including exact sequences, Poincare Duality, the Thom class and the index of a vector field.The book contains many wonderful geometric diagrams which help motivate the material. In most cases, the author is very careful to highlight theorems, propositions and lemmas. Occasionally key results will be 'buried' in a series of discussion paragraphs, which makes referring to these results later on somewhat difficult. The author never, ever calls out or highlights any of his definitions. This can be somewhat frustrating, especially when trying to track down one of these definitions. Fortunately the index to the book is reasonably good."},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol. 1, 3rd Edition","review":"Spivak's text gets a lot of good reviews, and it is a fine text. In fact, it's one of the best I've ever seen. Read a few other books on the subject, and you'll agree that this is a massive improvement on them. So why only 3 stars? Because there's a much better text on the subject: John Lee's \\"An Introduction to Smooth Manifolds\\". This book outshines Spivak's in so many ways. Sure, Spivak is great at motivating major developments in the theory (for instance, he really helps you understand why we need to define a tangent space and why it is the way it is), but he fails pretty bad when it comes to developing some actual theory.Reading Spivak's text is like taking a stroll, a fresh break from the usual mathematics textbook style. But you also hit a bunch of brick walls on this stroll. It'll be a great discussion, and then you'll come to a theorem. You'll have no idea what its for (some of the time) and you'll struggle to work through its proof (most of the time). Furthermore, the organization is... well, there is no organization! As a result, Spivak can seem to droll on. Lee isn't as good at giving the overall big picture as well as Spivak, but he does everything else exceptionally. Leave Spivak for bed time reading, but do your real studying out of Lee."},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol. 1, 3rd Edition","review":"Michael Spivak begins these five volumes stating his modest aim to write the &quot;Great American Differential Geometry book.&quot; He surely has. Instead of listing the numerous subjects Spivak treats clearly and beautifully in these volumes, I'd like to call out the delightful travelogue style in which they are written, using history, anecdotes, and opinion to explain, illuminate, and, when possible, motivate the gleaming modern edifice. Spivak's opinions are sprinkled lightly here and there like easter eggs. How could you not love a math book that uses the subtitle &quot;The Debauch of Indices,&quot; or dismisses Eric Temple Bell's history as &quot;supercilious remarks of questionable taste&quot;? Also, don't miss the annotated bibliography in volume 5. The fact that legions of professionals refer to these books in their original *typewritten* format [1st &amp; 2d editions] is a further testament to their quality. The third edition is typeset using TeX and, though beautiful, still manages to retain a little of the quirky typewritten appearance. One quibble: I was disappointed to see that this edition did not use Richard Bassein's bizarre artwork [think 70s psychedelic] for the covers; I admit that this stuff weirded me out originally, but have grown to love it -- where else could I see fuzzy trolls in crowns made from Enneper's minimal surface?Let Spivak take you &quot;All the Way With Gauss-Bonnet.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol. 1, 3rd Edition","review":"If you want a book that is rich with examples then this is it.

In the book's preface, Foner points out that history has been and always will be rewritten by different generations of people to answer questions posed by the issues of their times. This is especially true when present problems closely resemble those of a past era. During the Civil Rights struggle in the 1950s and 60s for example, new historical interpretations of the Reconstruction era began to emerge, largely because the political and ethical issues practically mirrored each other. Foner launches into the book by stating that History is simultaneously owned by everyone and by no one. But while the chapters that follow are interesting and worth reading in their own right, they never really examine the ideological struggle between various interests to control historical discourse. Some of the more interesting essays are described in the sections below.SOCIALISMIn his essay entitled \\"Why Is There No Socialism\\", Foner examines issues such as the diverse background of the working class that ostensibly contributed to racial, social, and political conflicts, the narrowness of the American electoral system, government oppression. Foner concludes that while all of these factors played an important role in preventing the rise of socialism in America, none of them were the deciding factor. In comparing the development of class consciousness in Europe and America, Foner argues that the comparative basis of the question itself may be flawed since it is possible after all, that socialism has been on the decline in Europe. Foner concludes that time will tell whether the United States is behind Europe in the development of socialism or ahead of Europe in recognizing its decline.AMERICAN CITIZENSHIPIn his essay, \\"Who Is An American\\", Foner examines how the definition of American citizenship has evolved throughout the nation's history. American citizenship wasn't clearly delineated, according to Foner, until shortly after the Civil War. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 granted citizenship to all people born in the United States (except native Americans) and defined the rights of citizenship regardless of ethnicity. The subsequent failure of Reconstruction, however, reinforce the racial concept of citizenship among White leaders, particularly in the South who successfully overturned many of the rights spelled out in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. During the great migrations at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the power elite came to identify citizenship with wages. Those who made money were Americans, and those who were willing to work for slave wages (Eastern Europeans, Irish, Italians, and other \\"undesirables\\" according to the attitude of the times) were not. Subsequent historical events including the Cold War, the expanding economy, and the Civil Rights Movement added a civic definition to what constituted American citizenship. An American was defined as any freedom loving individual willing to work and to defend democracy. Foner concludes that citizenship is not a Whiggish progress toward greater and greater freedom, but a more complex and dynamic one in which gains are made and lost depending on historical circumstances.BLACKS AND THE US CONSTITUTIONFoner's essay \\"Blacks and the US Constitution details how an increasingly conservative Supreme Court has gradually rolled back many of the civil rights gains made by blacks particularly in areas like equal treatment in the workplace. Ironically, many of the conservative Supreme Court justices do this for the sake of preserving the \\"original intent\\" of the founding fathers with respect to the Constitution, while ignoring the fact that they deliberately structured the language of the sacred parchment to enable modification as unforeseen critical circumstances arose. Foner indicates that to restrict civil rights and other forms of egalitarian legislation in fact has little to do with the \\"original intent\\" of the founding fathers so much as the ideological intent of conservative judges.\\"Who Owns History\\" will appeal to anyone who is interested in how historical interpretations change according to the requirements of different generations. It will also interest anyone with an interest in progressive issues such as labor, race relations, and the development of different ideologies. This book will probably not appeal to those who believe that history should be taught as a uniform and immutable set of ideas used to guide students to a \\"correct\\" understanding of their country and its values."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"This is another book that I bought thinking I would enjoy a lot more than I actually did. I suppose, in point of fact, that I have enjoyed it in the sense that it's been fun arguing points with the author as I read the book, but the author's point of view, overall, is so far from mine that I can't really say I enjoyed the finished product as much as I'd hoped.To start, it's important to not that this is an essay collection, something I was unaware of when I bought the book. The cover and the opening of the book don't really say anything about this. Followers of my reviews will know that essay collections are almost always problematic for me, because you almost inevitably get something you like, and something you don't. The results are almost always uneven at best, contradictory at worst. The essays in this book were written by one person--historian Eric Foner--and since he's a professional he at least does us the service of not disagreeing with himself. Foner wrote these essays during the 80s and 90s, and introduces each of them with several paragraphs which provide context and background.The supposed theme of the book is the place of history in the world, and by extrapolation of the historian in society. As a result, the first two essays are essentially biographical. The first is an autobiography, the second recounts briefly the career of the author's mentor and teacher, Richard Hofstadter. The autobiographical piece sets the tone for the whole book when, in the early going, the author recounts a conversation he had with fellow 19th-century historian Gabor Boritt. Boritt grew up in Communist Hungary, and came to the U.S. as a polital refugee while a teenager. In Foner's recounting of their conversation, Boritt tells Foner that he grew up in a country where you couldn't trust anything the government told you. Foner replies that he grew up in the same place--though he grew up in New York City. This is by way of explaining that he mistrusted the government because both is father and uncle lost their jobs teaching at Columbia University during a Red Scare just after World War II (but prior to McCarthy). In spite of this, the autobiographical piece is probably the best in the book, and the Hofstadter bio is interesting also, if only for its focus on this man and his work in an obscure portion of American history.Part Two of the book attempts to discuss freedom in various parts of the world. There are four essays here, two dealing with the United States, and one each with Russia and South Africa. The first essay is one of the American ones, and tries to survey the course of American freedom. Its essentially forgetable. The second essay, the Russian one, has some interesting observations about life in contemporary Russia, and their view of history, both Soviet and American. The third essay, the South African one, has a similar focus except of course that it's interested in events in that country rather than Russia. These two essays, tracing the attitudes of people in these countries to their history, and to the governments that ruled there a generation ago, are the most historically informative of the whole collection, and you could almost wish the whole book had been built around them. The fourth essay, easily the worst in the book, dwells way too long on the fascinating (to the author, anyway) question of why there's no true Socialist party in the United States. The author takes for granted, as a matter of course, the concept that socialism would be a significant benefit to \\"workers\\" in the United States, and is merely preoccupied with how they could have been tricked into not supporting it.The last part of the book is titled \\"The Enduring Civil War\\", so of course it has almost nothing to do with that conflict. The first essay in it deals with the concept of how being an American has been defined during our nation's history. Of course, at various times blacks, Asians, Indians, and others weren't considered Americans, and therefore weren't citizens. The author makes much of this, and is careful to let you know how racist white Americans were at various times in our history. In one passage, he speaks with a straight face first of whites stealing land from Indians, and then (in the same sentence) condemns whites for \\"stealing\\" land from Mexicans, as if that were equally a crime. Apparently the Mexicans devised a way to get the land from the Indians without violating their rights, something the whites didn't bother with. Either that, or it's wrong to steal from a thief, just like it's wrong to steal from a victim. The next essay is a brief survey of the Constitution, amendments, and court decisions that deal with race. By now we're clear that the author is very radically liberal, so he's predictably negative about the Rehnquist court (the essay was written in the late 80s) and denounces several decisions for not supporting Affirmative Action and other, like-minded programs. When he swiftly runs out of coherent arguments in favor of his position, he resorts to guilt by association, taking quotes out of context, focusing on particular phrases, so that he can equate Robert Bork with Roger Taney (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at the time of the Dred Scott Decision, one of the worst rulings the high court ever handed down) and Sandra Day O'Connor with Andrew Johnston, who he portrays as an unrecontstructed racist. The last essay was originally part of a book criticising Ken Burns' documentary on the Civil War. Various academics thought that a documentary on the Civil War shouldn't have had anything to say about the war itself, but instead should have focused on women, blacks, the poor, the causes, and the aftermath, to the exclusion of everything else. Foner, who built his reputation writing a history of the Reconstruction era (his bibliography actually includes three books dealing with the subject) spends most of the essay criticising Burns for focusing in the war, and not spending enough time talking about its aftermath. Foner in some ways has a point: the aftermath of the war does have something to do with it, and should have been/be included in a documentary about it. Burns, however, is more concerned with the veterans and the way they dealt with each other after the war, discussing the reunions at Gettysburg and elsewhere. Foner is palpably hostile to this, feeling that reconciliation among whites after the war is secondary to the plight of blacks. What he of course misses is that the plight of blacks after the war wasn't on the same level as when they were slaves, and Jim Crow aside, without the Civil War there wouldn't have been a Civil Rights movement in the 60s.Foner's openly a socialist, tells you in his autobiographical essay that he flirted with Communism, and at one point mentions the Soviet Union as a \\"true Socialist state\\". His view of American history is openly hostile to capitalism, and views the American version of democracy very suspiciously, to say the least. Within that context, the book does perform a service: it provides a reasonably well-written survey of liberal academic thought regarding freedom, rights, and race relations in the United States, and the history thereof. If you didn't know anything about history before you picked up this book, you'd get a pretty distorted, negative view of the United States. If you understand enough about history to be able to disagree with the author, then this isn't a bad book."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"The thoughts are there but it's so poorly written that one might have to re-read many parts to fully understand."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"To take just one example of the dilemma that Mr. Foner must confront as the Left loses control of history and of our institutions, let's look briefly at his essay&quot;Blacks and the U.S. Constitution&quot;. Here he argues against the idea that judges should be bound by the text of the Constitution, arguing instead that it shouldbe an &quot;active advocate for the rights of disadvantaged Americans&quot; as it basically was in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Unfortunately, he contradicts himself so baldly asto render his point incoherent. Here he is rejecting adherence to the text :In an age of semiotics and deconstruction, not to mention intense debate among historians about the prevailing ideas of the revolutionary era,there is something refreshingly naive, almost quaint, in the idea that any text, including the Constitution, possesses a single, easily ascertainable,objective meaning.On its face this is fairly unobjectionable. Were we still in an age when deconstruction and other Leftist philosophies, that seek to deny the plain meaning oflanguage and to expose the secret oppressive messages that straight white Christian males placed there, and were there a significant national debate over whatthe ideas of the Revolution were, then it would indeed be possible to say that the meaning of the Constitution is unknowable. It is, of course, a considerableimpediment to Mr. Foner's argument that the basic concept of deconstruction is practically unknown outside of the humanities departments of elite universitiesand that average Americans seem to feel that they pretty well understand the ideas of the Revolution, chief among which was that the laws that govern usshould be made by our elected representatives. But even more troublesome for Mr. Foner is his own admission a few pages later that :To those who came of age during the era of the Warren Court, it is easy to forget that the Supreme Court, expected by the founding fathersto be the most conservative branch of the government, has amply fulfilled that role throughout most of our history. And today the Courtappears poised to revert to its traditional function.Lo and behold, here's the good professor himself informing us that, far from being quaint or naive, the Right's belief that the judiciary was intended to be afundamentally conservative institution is consistent with both the expectations of the founding fathers and with long-standing tradition. In fact, as thesecontradictory statements reveal, the problem is not that history can't reveal to us the purposes of the drafters of the Constitution but that those purposes are atodds with Mr. Foner's purposes and at odds with the liberal departure from tradition that characterized the past several decades.The question on the cover of the book may ask &quot;Who Owns History?&quot;, but the question that drives these essays is much more &quot;why don't we (The Left) own itanymore?&quot;. But Mr. Foner doesn't really make an honest attempt to answer either question and so the utility of the book is fairly limited. What we get insteadis a rather disconnected series of essays which in sum seem to argue merely that those who are now retaking ownership of history shouldn't be allowedto--whether they be non-communist historians in the former Soviet Union, black South Africans who are more interested in making social progress than inrehashing the past, PBS filmmakers seeking to honor the nation's bloody struggle to end slavery, or judges who think they should be bound by theConstitution. Ultimately, Mr. Foner's argument appears to be with American people themselves who &quot;often 'forget' that our history is not a Whiggishprogress toward greater and greater freedom and equality but a far more complex story...&quot; Or it may be that since so many Americans (and I) believe it to bethe case that our history does in fact demonstrate just such Whiggish progress, that Mr. Foner's argument is with history itself.GRADE : F"},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"Then again, this is Eric Foner and bait and switching should be expected. If you expect a study on how history changes and reinvents us, something that would have been useful in understanding the shared collective memory of -- let's say -- September 11, you'd best look elsewhere. Who Owns History is simply a collection of essays that promote Foner's leftist politics."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"What constitutes history and how it should be told has become an increasingly significant question over the years. How events are portrayed in history texts often is more the result of the social climate at the time or the purpose of the writer than actual fact.Part of the problem with history is that as new facts are discovered and new perspectives proposed history is rewritten. Different groups offer a different perspective to the traditional perspective. So, we now have black history, women's history, etc. However, these same historians must deal with a fickle public whose primary interest in history has traditionally been that it be told with a particular purpose in mind. When the Constitution states that everyone has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness we are taught that it means literally everyone. However, history has at times excluded American Indians, Black Americans and others. Particular areas of the United States have excluded the Irish, the Catholic, the Polish, the Japanese or any number of other groups.This book contains nine essays by Eric Foner, a professor of history at Columbia University, that were prepared for various conferences and book introductions. In these essays Foner examines how the historian interacts with the history and their surroundings and how that interaction determines their perspective on history. It includes essay on Mr. Foner's personal life as a historian and the things that influence his perspective. Others include essays on modern Russia and post-apartheid South Africa and how they are rethinking their past in view of the current changes. Probably the most interesting essays are in Mr. Foner's area of specialization - slavery, the Civil War and post-Reconstruction America.An especially interesting read for those who are not familiar with the controversies of traditional history, it is a good read, logically argued and recommended for early college level students or higher. For most of the essays the writing is slightly above the level of the average high school student."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"There may be those who simplistically view history as no more than gathering and presenting \\"facts\\" about the past, but noted historian Eric Foner would respond that history involves the interpretation of facts and is subject to change. But history is not pure subjectivity; historical truth is a \\"reasonable approximation of the past.\\" Despite the title of the book, the author does not directly address the issue of \\"ownership\\" of history. There is the question of who produces history. Is history mainly produced by academic historians, which slowly filters into the public's consciousness? Or is historical understanding dominated by large institutions such as the mass media, think tanks, and the education industry, many of whom are inclined to promote an historical agenda? The author acknowledges that \\"for years historians have been aware that historical traditions are invented and manipulated. In addition, \\"forgetting some aspects of the past is as much a part of historical understanding as remembering others.\\" This may be due simply to ignorance or poor scholarship. Or more disturbingly, historical distortion may be a sinister effort by various social and economic elites to dominate and manipulate social understandings.The United States is a nation founded on the ideals of liberty, political equality and democracy. We are not a traditional society where unquestioned myths passed down from generation to generation are the glue of society. Openness and informed debate about all matters, including those historical, are essential in a society based on rational decision making. Not understanding our principles, how we have lived up to them, and where we need to go is not an option. Yet, it is clear that the injection of bogus historical views into our national understandings has plagued our society in the past and continues to do so today.Three essays deal with the legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction. A determined Southern elite and a complicit Supreme Court essentially negated the citizenship rights that blacks had achieved in landmark legislation after the Civil War. But that history is often buried or distorted. Prominent Northern historians of the times validated the Jim Crow era by suggesting that blacks lacked the capacity for self-government. The focus on nationalism, or the right of white Anglo-Saxon America to become an imperial power at the end of the 19th century, further obscured the suppression of rights for some American citizens.It is this decades-long willful amnesia of the Reconstruction era that has permitted the Supreme Court in the modern era to see unfairness in racial preferences while ignoring the history of racial injustice. Conveniently, judicial decisions are now supposedly rendered on the basis of \\"original intent\\" or \\"strict construction.\\" However, the author notes that the language of the Fourteenth Amendment was purposely \\"broad and indeterminate\\" to give maximum leeway to the judiciary in the implementation of the amendment. The narrow legal judgments of today in this area actually ignore original intent in their rush to yield to political exigencies.In one of these essays, the author critically examines Ken Burns' nine-part PBS series on the Civil War. The author finds that \\"Burns recapitulates the very historical understanding of the war \`invented' in the 1890s as part of the glorification of the national state and the nationwide triumph of white supremacy.\\" For Burns the Civil War was a \\"family quarrel among whites, whose fundamental accomplishment was the preservation of the Union.\\" The abolition of slavery is scarcely mentioned, not to mention the failure of Reconstruction to secure civil rights for former slaves. In the final segment Burns focuses on the friendly reunion in 1913 of white veterans of Gettysburg. In a devastating comment, the author notes that in that same year President Wilson segregated federal office buildings in Washington D.C. As the author says, \\"Accurately remembered, the events of Reconstruction place the issue of racial justice on the agenda of modern life - but not if the history of that era and the costs paid on the road to reunion are ignored, misrepresented, or wished away.\\"In another essay, the author examines the impact that globalization is having on the definition of the long-cherished American ideal of freedom. Transnational institutions and corporations through their think tanks and control of the media have redefined freedom as participation in a global free-marketplace. Gone are the \\"elements of freedom such as self-government, economic autonomy, and social justice\\" that were a part of the republican tradition in America. Strong national governments attempting to regulate economic matters are portrayed as impediments in a global economy. The author admits that freedom is constantly subject to redefinition, but freedom defined as merely competing in global production ignores American traditions of freedom. It may not be an overstatement to contend that \\"the relationship between globalization and freedom may be the most pressing political and social problem of the 21st century.\\"In other interesting essays, the career of historian Richard Hofstadter is examined and the oft-asked question concerning the absence of socialism in American is reviewed. Hofstadter gets tagged as a \\"consensus\\" historian because he noted that the \\"virtues of individual liberty, private property, and capitalist enterprise\\" were broadly agreed upon by most Americans. The author notes that Hofstadter did not celebrate this uniformity, finding it to be a \\"form of intellectual and political bankruptcy,\\" which echoes the findings of Tocqueville one hundred years earlier. Yet consensus theories do have resiliency. The absence of class-based activism and turns to socialism are partly answered by the existence in varying degrees of republicanism or \\"producerism,\\" the absorption or cooptation of protest, the substitution of consumption as empowerment, the divisions and stratifications of the working class, and winner-take-all elections.Clearly the concept of history is hardly as straightforward as may be thought at first glance. \\"Who Owns History?\\" is an excellent attempt at getting a handle on historical interpretation and the ramifications thereof."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"Foner is not one to beat around the bush. He tackles pressing social and political issues head on. In this remarkable collection of essays, he has taken aim at several key issues which define contemporary society. The most compelling essay is probably &quot;Blacks and the U.S. Constitution,&quot; in which he examines the motivations behind the conservative desire to read the Constitution in terms of its &quot;original intent.&quot;As Foner notes, this is more a political than a historical argument. By narrowing the interpretation of the Constitution to its &quot;original intent,&quot; conservatives hope to avoid addressing the more thorny issues which the later amendments attempt to address. He views the current decisions by the Supreme Court as part of an overall drive toward &quot;Redemption,&quot; similar to the period of readjustment, in which states nullified much of the Civil Rights legislation which was enacted by the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction. This eventually led to the notorious era of Jim Crow.Foner views history as a continuum, not a set of isolated events, which can be referred to to bolster one's political arguments, whether they be conservative or liberal. Like his mentor, Richard Hofstadter, Foner rebels against consensus opinion, asking readers to form minds of their own. The essays are gritty and compelling and serve as a reminder of the intellectual prowess of one of the foremost historians of our time."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"This is an insightful and thought-provoking collection of essays on the study of history by the eminent American historian, Eric Foner. Foner's best known works focus on the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, and that is a major focus for this book. In addition, Foner writes about how his own life shaped his interest in history, and his attitudes towards it. The key message of the book is that history is necessarily interpretive, and that interpretation of the past is shaped by current political realities. This is vividly demonstrated when one compares (as Foner does) the Ken Burns version of the Civil War (a battle between brothers that led to reconciliation) to Foner's own interpretation (a struggle over slavery that still has not be completely resolved). 'Who owns history?' is an important subtext in current American political debate, and \\"Who Owns History?\\" is a great help in thinking about the problem."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"How we document and memorialize the past receives attention in a survey that questions the nature of historical scholarship in modern times.

American history has even more complexities. Eric Foner examines history under a microscope with WHO OWNS HISTORY? RETHINKING THE PAST IN A CHANGING WORLD by presenting nine essays that present issues and subject matters that have had a professional and personal affect on his life. The first section of the book presents a short vignette of his life as well as the life of one of his mentor's, Richard Hofstadter. The second section takes on a global perspective by reassessing the aftermath of the Cold War in Russia and post-Apartheid South Africa, the culture wars in the US, and the concluding chapters reflect on what has been near and dear to his heart in terms of scholarly work - Reconstruction era and Slavery. He includes a compelling essay on the significance of Blacks and the US Constitution, which ties in with his critique on Ken Burn's incomplete adaptation of the Civil War.Foner tells it like it is while at the same time allowing the reader to ponder and question his criticism. He leaves the door open for further discussion without sounding too preachy. As the subtitle reiterates, Rethinking the Past in a Changing World, is about digging much deeper beyond the surface and asking questions that go beyond well told stories of the past, and asking, what about? Of course history cannot be without the well told stories, but he turns another notch to the historical narrative by including histories that simply haven't been given their due, such as contributions African-Americans have had during Reconstruction or recent histories, such as what impact or little impact did the ending of the Cold War have on Russians.Foner does not answer the question to WHO OWNS HISTORY, but it is indeed up to the historian or the avid reader of history to go on a scavenger hunt to research and understand a particular event in history. He suggests, in similar terms, that no one person or people have possession of the subject matter, but rather it is a collective and shared entity."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"I had the pleasure of reading Foner's 'Reconstruction' almost contemporaneously with this book, although this is a much more delightful read. Foner's history of Reconstruction is the best on the subject I have read, and the most authoritive. And this book looks at the role that politics and society have not just in making history, but in reshaping it, burying it, reviving it, reliving it, and oftimes ignoring it or running from it. Certainly Foner's expertise on the Reconstruction period provides a crucible for him to look at how historical events can be interpreted, misinterpreted, and twisted from various political and ideological perspectives.We are watching the Civil War reopen again with the rebel flag wagging in the South again, and the title of Foner's book hits that situation right between the eyes.&quot;Who Owns History?&quot; is a great question, and the book provides a thought provoking answer.Of course, in true professorial style, the answer is just more questions, and different perspectives. But interesting ones."},{"Title":"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World","review":"The viewpoint on this book is very uneven and the author's political bias is apparent in most of the chapters. I also thought the language and wording was somewhat difficult. However, this is also a very thought provoking book. I have to say that even though I am not from the same political spectrum as Foner, I agreed with him on many things, especially his thoughts on globalization.Who owns history. The people who decide history, the winners in political contests, etc. This is not always fair, but because history goes through constant re-evaluation, this will change over time. Good thing, since some things do ultimately change for the better.This is an OK read.

A dull Frenchman discovers one day the unexpected presence of a pigeon in front of the small roomm he inhabits. This minuscule and seemingly irrelevant event adopts terrifying proportions in the mind of the man, becoming a grotesque nightmare.As a master of allusion and obsession, Suskind reveals once more, in this parable of everyday life, his gift for building a metaphor of the existential background of humans. It shows that our life usually holds to rutines so fragile, that a simple disturbance may force us to rethink everything from the start. It is a short book, but an intriguing and absurd tale. The absurd, seems to say Suskind, is present in the most simple things that happen every day."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"I really like Patrick Suskind's books, espically Purfume, but the only thing I don't like about this book is that it doesn't really have a climax.

Comparable to say The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles to give a more distant point of reference. Short which makes it great for a book club or something like that if that's your cup of tea. It contains a unifying narrative idea of a person undone by a disruption to their very ordered existence that is a great rumination on some very deep stuff: how obsessing over trivialities and \\"seven habits of highly effective ...\\" type of bullshit in order to ignore existential problems such as our impending and inevitable mortality is a natural feature of how our brains deal (or are unable to best deal, by their biological lowest common denominator states/traps) with the modern memescape, or really just with the universe in our current increasing depth of understanding it. Also, how all security or stability is cognitively exaggerated (possibly in part as a defense mechanism against future shock, or general despair or panic?), making any decision to trade something for security or stability a fool's bargain, as famously noted by Ben Franklin and deeply understood at least since Heraclitus or maybe only since Simplicius. We all live in prisons of our own devising, and the protagonist of the novella does not respond well to being reintroduced into a non-captive state after his prison is closed off to him (imagine your own Shawshank Redemption reference here). The idea that for many people their carefully crafted set of consoling illusions could be undone by a single \\"want of a nail\\" type of event is a powerful one and very well woven into this narrative, so much so that I find myself saying \\"that was his (or her) Pigeon\\" when hearing from time to time of a true story in which a seemingly small event triggered this kind of outcome.Summary: Read this. If someone makes you join a book club, suggest this, or another short masterpiece: Chronicle of a Death Foretold, or Wise Blood (side note yes these are both AWESOME). If anyone in the gang fails to see the genius of one of these three short works you've had your fair warning that their next selection could easily be \\"Men are from Mars...\\" or Eat Pray Love- GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! You'll only have invested a couple hundred pages and gotten to read something unbelievably good in the bargain."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"After a rocky childhood as a result of World War II, Jonathan Noel had a good two decades of plain existence. He has been renting a room for that time and even though he does not even have a private bathroom he has decided to buy it. He works as doorman at a bank and day after day he follows the exact same schedule. But now that he is in his fifties, things are about to change.One Friday morning in the month of August 1984, while he was on his way to the bathroom, Jonathan sees a pigeon outside the door of his room and goes into panic. He is afraid that pigeons will overtake the apartment and he does not dare kill it. The pigeon causes a revolution in the main character's life that is baffling, but the metaphor is hard to miss. Jonathan embarks in a series of crazy plans to evade the object that causes his strain, going as far as moving into a hotel, even though he cannot afford it.Once more Suskind shows his ability for delving into the psyche of his characters and providing his readers with awesome insight. When we add to this author's writing ability to the mix, the result is more than satisfactory. This book in particular reminded me of the works of my favorite writer, Dostoevsky, since the Russian's main characters often enter a vicious circle in which they thinking something bad will happen and this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, which can only be prevented through great determination and effort. For those that have not read Suskind before, this is a good a place to start as any, and of course, make sure to not disregard his masterpiece \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\".

Well, Suskind presents this story in a very careful, controlled fashion. He effectively, and tersely, describes how someone who is &quot;living on the edge&quot; psychologically can simply unravel. I thought the story was most compelling, not silly. Readers of Suskind's more famous work, Perfume, will enjoy The Pigeon.My only gripe with The Pigeon is its packaging.

Then one day a living creature, a pigeon, appears unexpectedly on your doorstep, and it shouldn't be there--it is out of place. And this frightens you like nothing has in many years. You flee your apartment (for good, you think). Because of your agitated state you break your own routines; you begin acting strangely, and your perceptions alter. This sets off a chain reaction of encounters in which you, despite your lifelong precautions to the contrary, begin interacting with a world that seems determined to drive you over the edge.Suskind's \\"The Pigeon\\" is subtly meticulous in depicting its protagonist's complex psychological journey. The story is at once free of sentimentality, raw, honest, and yet life-affirming in the most vital sense. While it is reminiscent of Kafka and--most notably--of Knut Hamson's \\"Hunger,\\" Suskind's novella also manages to glimpse something just around the corner, something almost out of sight, beyond the valley of despair."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"I had to get a copy of The Pigeon used after reading Perfume. I read it in one sitting. It's such a gem. I don't know how many pages go by where the main character is just standing in front of this bank thinking, not doing anything. It's riveting. He eats a meal towards the end of the book and I've never read such tasty descriptions of food. And rain, and peeing in the tub, and ripping your pants in public.I'm going to have to do some searching to get my Patrick Suskind fix. This is one of the most satisfying books I've ever read. It left me on a high for a couple weeks. It's since worked it's way somewhere deep in me, I won't forget it."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"The central achievement of S&uuml;skind's novella is the way it articulates the social anxiety of a man whose childhood fear of abandonment has played out as a lifetime of limited scope, controlling routines and self-imposed isolation. That might sound heavy but it isn't - mainly because S&uuml;skind wisely chooses the \\"free indirect\\" narrative style (mastered by Henry James). The story is told in the third person, but is nevertheless filtered through Jonathan Noel's gaze and consciousness so that external reality exists only as refracted in his mind. The result is that we see the world as he sees it, but without the unreliability that such a point of view entails. S&uuml;skind is thereby able to show us precisely what he wants us to see - both the horror and humour of Noel's experience - and to deliver a climax which remains somewhat objective and thereby inspires hope. Other reviewers seem to have found the ending cloying and unrealistic, but I think they're assuming more than S&uuml;skind suggests. Noel and his life are not utterly transformed at the end - he has an epiphany, he loses his fear, but it may or may not last."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"Reminded me of Edgar Allen Poe's &quot;The Raven&quot;, but this grim tale had a more optimistic resolution. Suskind is no Poe, but he does describe nicely how self imposed isolation can warp one's outlook and reactions to life. Not a pleasant story, but instructive, original, and well written."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"If this tour de force were a short story, part of a collection, I'd have liked it better. It's too light-weight to take seriously as a separate publication. Jonathan Noel, the main character, is a timid and tidy man who has lived in the same 11 x 7 room for thirty years. One morning he opens the door to his room and finds a pigeon sitting there. This leads to total disruption in his predictable life, his personal unraveling, and his decision to live elsewhere for a few days. If you can identify with this, you are a better person than I!"},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"Mes excuses &agrave; la gente anglaise, je ne puis m'empcher de faire la critique du Pigeon dans ma langue maternelle. Comme je vais tenter de l'exposer dans la prochaine ligne, j'affirme avec une conviction f&eacute;roce, ma foi rehauss&eacute;e d'un amour inou pour la litt&eacute;rature suskindienne, que ce livre est un chef-d'oeuvre pur et simple. Cette tche que je m'applique &agrave; accomplir est des plus ardues. Il me faut en fait faire preuve d'une objectivit&eacute; sans faille, et je crois bien devoir m'excuser derechef car je ne suis pas certain d'tre &agrave; la hauteur.Je me propose d'expliquer non pas l'histoire du Pigeon, ni sa mise en sc&egrave;ne, mais plutt comment le g&eacute;nie de Patrick Suskind se manifeste &agrave; travers cette oeuvre qui peut sembler banale &agrave; premi&egrave;re vue. En fait, lorsqu'on ne s'y attarde pas trop profond&eacute;ment, l'histoire de Jonathan Noel et de sa rencontre avec un pigeon devant la porte de sa petite chambrette peut nous sembler particuli&egrave;rement ennuyante et vide. Mais si l'on prend la peine d'analyser la perfection des d&eacute;tails, et le fait que chaque action, chaque description ou chaque &eacute;v&eacute;nement d&eacute;coule directement de l'&Eacute;V&Eacute;NEMENT principal qui bouleverse totalement la vie du peronnage, c'est l&agrave; qu'on commence &agrave; prendre conscience du g&eacute;nie sensationnel de l'auteur. Il y a &eacute;galement cette fascinante facilit&eacute; avec laquelle Suskind parvient &agrave; nous aspirer dans son d&eacute;cor comme un trou noir aspire la lumi&egrave;re. En un instant, nous devenons Jonathan Noel, nous compatissons avec lui. L'auteur parvient admirablement bien &agrave; fournir l'arch&eacute;type parfait du monsieur ordinaire. Nom ordinaire. Chambre ordinaire. Vie ordinaire et taciturne. M&eacute;tier de vigile dans une banque, quoi de plus ordinaire et taciturne. Aucune vie sentimentale, donc pas moyen de sortir de l'ordinarie sur un plan plus affectif ou artistique. D&egrave;s les premi&egrave;res pages qui suivent la venue du pigeon, nous sentons le besoin fulgurant de compatir avec Noel, et nous sentons sa crainte. Quoi qu'on en dise, nous devenons l'espace d'un instant ce petit bonhomme anodin et d&eacute;sabus&eacute; de sa routine. Voil&agrave; un autre aspect du g&eacute;nie de Suskind! Il nous fait litt&eacute;ralement devenir son personnage, et prend bien son temps pour le d&eacute;crire de long en large, d&eacute;crire sa platitude. Il pousse l'arch&eacute;type &agrave; l'extrme.Et donc, comme je le disais, &agrave; premi&egrave;re vue c'est un r&eacute;cit fastidieux. Ne vous laissez pas tenter par ce pi&egrave;ge que Suskind vous tend, car en v&eacute;rit&eacute; l'auteur &agrave; un certain moment vous pose la question suivante : &quot;tes-vous un vrai lecteur?&quot; Si &agrave; cet instant pr&eacute;cis vous fermez le livre avec une exclamation de d&eacute;got, c'est que vous venez de r&eacute;pondre n&eacute;gativement &agrave; son interrogation. Par contre, si vous poursuivez un tant soit peu votre lecture, c'est un oui cat&eacute;gorique que vous venez de lancer, et bien fait pour vous, car vous p&eacute;n&eacute;trez dans l'insondable bonheur que vous r&eacute;serve l'histoire de la d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rescence d'un homme tout petit, tout simple, tout frle, et presque aussi fragile que la vie en elle-mme.Le caract&egrave;re symbolique des oeuvres de Suskind est ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nal. Qu'y a-t-il de plus anodin qu'un pigeon? Qu'y a-t-il de plus anodin qu'un monsieur anodin? &Agrave; pr&eacute;sent, m&eacute;langez le pigeon anodin et le personnage anodin, dans ce qu'on pourrait appeler une esp&egrave;ce d'exp&eacute;rience de chimie &eacute;v&eacute;nementielle. Paradoxe pur. L'anodin s'embourbe, se perd dans un vortex infini cr&eacute;&eacute; par le bris de la routine. Tout &agrave; coup, le pigeon n'est plus anodin du tout : il est d&eacute;clencheur de bouleversements inconcevables. Tout &agrave; coup, le personnage n'est plus anodin du tout : il est victime du pigeon. Il peut vous sembler &eacute;trange qu'un oiseau puisse d&eacute;velopper un pouvoir aussi &eacute;norme sur un tre humain. Pourtant, lorsque cet tre est suffisamment hypnotis&eacute; par une routine terre-&agrave;-terre et sans fin, et qu'en somme il n'a pas de vie - si l'on consid&egrave;re la vie comme &eacute;tant constitu&eacute;e d'&eacute;v&eacute;nements - l'homme ne devient qu'un ver, que le pigeon peut dominer.Si fragile, la vie d'un ver... Mais &agrave; bien y penser, dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; actuelle, chaque pion ayant sa place sur l'&eacute;chiquier du capitalisme, chaque num&eacute;ro ayant son train-train imperturbable, ne sommes-nous pas tous des vers? Je vous souhaite, &agrave; tous, de trouver votre pigeon. Car bien qu'il puisse bouleverser votre vie, il ne peut que la rendre meilleure."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"\`At the time the pigeon affair overtook him, unhinging his life from one day to the next, Jonathan Noel, already past fifty, could look back over a good twenty-year period of total uneventfulness and would never have expected anything of importance could ever overtake him again - other than death some day.'\`The Pigeon' is an incredibly short story detailing a day (albeit a rather momentous day) in the life of Jonathan Noel. Jonathan leads a secluded and private life as a bank security guard in Paris. He enjoys the life he has made for himself and is perfectly content with it continuing as such for his remaining years; however, on his way to work one morning this all comes collapsing down around him as he discovers a pigeon on his front porch. As soon as the pigeon entered his life, his life literally came crumbling apart in his mind. All of his carefully made plans became as fragile as a snowflake.\`...but he suddenly no longer saw himself - that is, he no longer saw himself as a part of the world surrounding him. It was rather, as if for a few seconds he were standing far away, outside it, and were regarding this world through the wrong end of a telescope.'I became an instant fan of Patrick S&uuml;skind after stumbling upon his novel \`Pefume'. It left such a permanent imprint on me and is still one of my favorite books to date. I'm not sure why I never looked into whether or not he had any additional works, but after embarking on my \`1001 Books to Read Before I Die' reading challenge I discovered \`The Pigeon' as one of those 1001. Overjoyed, I knew I had to have it.Patrick S&uuml;skind's writing is so thoroughly impressionable that earlier this afternoon I saw a pigeon on the side of the road and had to suppress a shiver as Jonathan's fears flooded my mind. Mildly amusing, but, I'm not sure I'll be able to look at a pigeon the same again. His descriptions of the pigeon and Jonathan's instant anxiety over the pigeon were immediately understandable even though, looking at the bigger picture, it seemed as if he made a fuss over nothing. I'll admit, I laughed at first because it seemed quite absurd, but as the story progressed you can see now it's not just the pigeon that affected poor Jonathan in that manner; it was just the catalyst to a series of events that disrupted his painstakingly normal existence.I'm giving \`The Pigeon' 5 stars for one reason and one reason only (and it's not because it's as great a story as Perfume because it isn't): because he's a truly amazing writer. I will read anything written by Patrick S&uuml;skind. It's just such a shame that there aren't more novels of his in existence to read."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"The Pigeon of Patrick S&uuml;skind, is a Pocket book that I had to read in college.

This banal meeting will change its life.Patrick S&uuml;skind will make you feel the fear and the confusion of the main character. The life of this character is very banal, but the author make us feel this banal life and even appreciate it which is absolutely incredible. When, for example, the main character eats for supper, a simple bread with some sardines, the reader appreciate the simplicity of this security guard's life. The reader appreciate the simplicity simply because Patrick S&uuml;skind managed to make it interesting with a banal life and banal adventures.

I waited so long for an end of a suspense, only to find out there is actually not too much suspense after all. Very ordinary life of a very ordinary man, bit by bit--swimming through his daily stream of mundane concerns, his habits, and for some reasons, the whole story seems to me to be a black and white film. Give it a go. Words are well written."},{"Title":"The Pigeon","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out it is less than a fully developed novel but a bit more than a short story. For one thing there is only a single character--Jonathan Noel. There is hardly any dialogue, and almost no interaction between Jonathan and any other human. Even the pigeon of the title makes only a cameo appearance. This is a tale of Jonathan's mind, spirit, emotions, and imagination. Jonathan, a committed recluse, goes through a kind of nervous breakdown one morning due to the presence of a pigeon sitting in the hall outside his meager room. Although we are drawn into Jonathan's world and his psychological distress is real for the reader, I find it odd and unbelievable that his nervous breakdown occurs and runs its course in the span of little more than twenty-four hours.My sense is that The Pigeon is a novel about more than just a lonely man's mind. It is about the Holocaust and the damage that it did and is doing as it's effects ripple down the decades. The story begins, in a flashback, where Jonathan suddenly loses first his mother then his father to the Gestapo, and is then shipped off with his sister to strange relatives. His desolate life is a result of the psychological damage from these childhood events. Seeing the story as metaphor for the damage to Germany and Europe in general engendered by the Holocaust is not too far-fetched. Another deep and disturbing (and lengthy, truly a novel) about the personal damage done to Holocaust survivors is The Gravedigger's Daughter by Joyce Carol Oates. Damage to minds and hearts ripples from the center of such cataclysmic events and continues to ripple. This is the underlying text of The Pigeon.I read the original German edition. I only checked the translation by John E. Woods sporadically, but it appears to be excellent. S&uuml;skind writes simple, clear, direct German. For those who enjoy reading German, or want to tune-up their German, I recommend reading Die Taube."},{"Title":"The Richest Caveman: The Doug Batchelor Story","review":"book was in very good condition except halfway through the story the print was upside down till the end of the story."},{"Title":"The Christian year: Thoughts in verse for the Sundays and Holydays throughout the year","review":"Having spent 3 years researching John Keble's \\"The Christian Year\\" for my Ph.D. dissertation, I feel qualified to make some comments on this extraordinary work of literature.Essentially, \\"The Christian Year\\" is early 19th century devotional poetry written in a Romantic vein. Keble, who was born in 1792 and is credited for having started the Oxford Movement with his Assize Sermon in 1833, was an Anglican priest, poet, and professor. \\"The Christian Year\\" is his book of poetry in which he wrote a poem for each week of the Christian year, as well as a poem for each of the services from The Book of Common Prayer. It's a work that is not much read today but that was wildly successful in the 19th century. While the aesthetic level of the poetry is second-rate compared to Keble's contemporary Romantic poets (at least the more famous ones), when read as devotional poetry that connects one to God through the Church, the Bible, the Prayer Book, and nature, the poetry still has the power to move.While the poetry of \\"The Christian Year\\" will seem outdated to most, if not actually inferior, a proper reading of it in its context will benefit not only students of history and literature but also the patient Christian reader in search of a profound devotional literary work.The full title of the work is: The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and Holydays throughout the Year. The volume begins with a \\"Morning\\" and \\"Evening\\" hymn, corresponding to Morning and Evening Prayer services, followed by a poem for every week in the Church year. These are followed by poems for the various saints' days, Holy Communion, Holy Baptism, and the occasional services. In 1828 poems for the State services were added as well.Keble's poetic life originated in his undergraduate days when he relieved his emotions by composing poetry, often on any scrap of paper he could find. When Keble began around 1819 to compose the poems that would eventually be included in The Christian Year, he had no intention of crafting his poetry into a unified companion to the Prayer Book. He apparently began while a tutor at Oriel College, inspired by his tours back and forth between Oxford and his home in Fairford. Keble's own theory of poetry illuminates the personal and individual aspect of poetry from which his own poetry originally flowed: \\"Let us therefore deem the glorious art of Poetry a kind of medicine divinely bestowed upon man: which gives healing relief to secret mental emotion, yet without detriment to modest reserve: and, while giving scope to enthusiasm, yet rules it with order and due control.\\" Keble's poetry, in keeping with his theory, was written first and foremost for the comfort of his own soul. Its most immediate impression was on that of his close circle family and friends, who universally found something new and powerful in the poems. The comfort for the individual soul that the poems brought appears frequently in the correspondence and remains of Keble's family and friends prior to its publication.Keble continued writing poetry for his own benefit in the 1820s, and, at some point not apparently recorded in Keble's correspondence or in the memoirs of those who knew him, he decided to arrange the poetry so that a poem would be provided for each holy day in the Church year. By 1825 Keble wrote a friend, \\"I have got a few attempts at hymns by me, which I have from time to time written, principally for my own relief . . . . My plan was to have one, if I could, for every Sunday & holiday in the year: taking the hint for the subject of each from something or other in the proper Psalms or Lessons for the day.When he did publish the work in 1827, he added to it his own Advertisement, in which he admirably sets out his aims: \\"The object of the present publication will be attained, if any person find assistance from it in bringing his own thoughts and feelings into more entire unison with those recommended and exemplified in the Prayer Book.\\" Keble makes clear that his goal in publishing his poetry was to have his readers use The Christian Year as a companion to the Prayer Book. A better summary of the purpose and effect of The Christian Year could not be found than what Keble himself wrote in his Advertisement. Keble also expected that his poetry, along with the Prayer Book, would provide a \\"sober standard of feeling in matters of practical religion.\\" The Liturgy, he said, disciplined the tempers which need disciplining in such an age of excitement.There is, therefore, a dual origin and dual purpose of The Christian Year. The original poetic impulse for the poetry came from Keble's own desire to express himself as an individual soul addressing His God, often out of a need for comfort. This original source for the poetry was then fitted for use as an Anglican devotional manual which had specific reference to the Prayer Book. This dual origin and purpose of the poetry is highly significant for explaining the astounding success of the poetry in the nineteenth century and its continuing value.A work of High Church devotional poetry, at a time when interest in poetry in general was beginning to wane, was not expected by many to succeed. Keble himself thought that nothing would come of it. \\"I remember, when it was first in the press,\\" Isaac Williams wrote, \\"coming with Keble out of Baxter's printing-office, when Keble said, \`It will be still-born, I know very well; but it is only in obedience to my father's wishes that I publish it, and that is some comfort.'\\" Keble's perpetual embarrassment by his success provides further evidence that he was never prepared for, and thus never expected, the success he achieved.The Christian Year enjoyed an immediate, lasting, and enormous success. The 1827 first edition of 500 needed little time to sell out and persuade Parker of the need for a second edition. The second edition of 750 also sold out within a few months, and a third edition of 1250 was published around March of 1828. The total number of copies sold in the first year alone, combining the sales of the first three editions, was at least 2500 copies, while the total sold for the first ten years was 26,500. By 1873 when the copyright had expired, 158 editions had been published by Parker, the original publisher, and 379,000 copies had been sold by the same date. My research indicates that approximately 1,000,000 copies of \\"The Christian Year\\" were sold in the 19th century, and many used volumes are available, as well as a plethora of modern reprints.Christians from many different denominations read The Christian Year. One writer said that the spiritual life and feeling of Keble's poetry \\"exist in Christian hearts, whether reared under Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Nonconformist influences.\\" My research indicates that a great number of major figures in the 19th century had read \\"The Christian Year,\\" and many people had virtually memorized it. Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Christina Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, William Gladstone, and many other have left testimony to having read \\"The Christian Year.\\"Those who read The Christian Year most faithfully, however, were likely to be Anglicans due to its connection with the Prayer Book. Many people read Keble's poetry week by week for years: the vast majority of these were Anglicans. This is what one would expect, since the contents of the book were based on an Anglican Church year, a specifically Anglican lectionary, and services which were often specifically Anglican.Finally, many readers of the 19th century wrote that \\"The Christian Year\\" did more to promote High Church and Catholic principles than the Tracts for the Times because Keble wrote through the vehicle of poetry and a poetry that appealed to all Christians, even while it subtly expressed Catholic ideals of the Church and a sacramental worldview."},{"Title":"Murder, My Dear Watson: New Tales of Sherlock Holmes","review":"I went ahead and invested in this follow-up to last year's \\"Murder in Baker Street\\", hoping that the stories would be better.

Fortunately, this particular collection scores significant points in terms of stories that involve Holmes' (albeit apocryphal) singular tales with certain \`matters of interest'. Now for a very brief description of these tales:1. \\"The Adventure of the Dying Doctor\\" by Colin Bruce is a very humane story where Watson (surprise!) is the main character, with a cameo by James Moriarty and Mycroft Holmes.2. \\"The Adventure of the Young British Soldier\\" by Bill Crider is another story where Watson and his erstwhile orderly Murray take centre-stage. Of course Holmes is there, sharp as ever, poetic as well.3. \\"The Vale of the White Horse\\" by Sharyn McCrumb is a complex tale with hints of bizarre hereditary traits and the consequences. It was a brilliant story with depths that are rarely aimed at.4. \\"The Adventure of the Mooning Sentry\\" by Jon L. Breen is a mediocre story about one of Holmes' post-retirement \`missions'.5. \\"The Adventure of the Rara Avis\\" by Carolyn Wheat is a rather sensationalistic attempt to develop the tantalizing hints left by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle regarding the affair of the Addleton-Barrow' into a story about the Maltese Falcon.6. \\"The Adventure of the Agitated Actress\\" by Daniel Stashower is a brilliant story about white might have happened on the stage before William Gillette's play \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" opened in London.7. \\"The Case of the Highland Hoax\\" by Anne Perry and Malachi Saxon is an improbable, wild and poor story set in the Scottish Highlands.8. \\"\\"The Case of the Golden Monkeys\\" by Loren D. Estleman is an almost Wold-Newton story involving Sax Rohmer and his Fu-Manchu model.9. \\"The Adventure of the Curious Canary\\" by Barry Day is a good retelling of \\"The Speckled Band\\".10. \\"Before the Adventures\\" by Lenore Carroll is a brilliant story about what could have happened to Watson before the entry of Holmes in his life.The non-fiction writings included in this book contain a plethora of information about the world of Sherlock Holmes and how a Sherlockian may enrich his knowledge in these matters.

There is no in-between in such cases.P. 69: Swamp gas can only explain so much, sir, so much and no more.P. 154-55: I saw the small twitch of irony catch the corner of his mouth.

I was intrigued by this one, because I've read other anthologies and works by Stashower and Greenberg, so I thought I'd give this one a look too.Wish I hadn't wasted my time. Very, very bad stories. They just weren't good. Slim plots that were easy to bust; poorly written and not in the Victorian style at all (I like pastiches that at least ATTEMPT to sound like Watson; 90 percent of these weren't even close); and Holmes and Watson were somewhat out of character (or not even in the piece, such as Stashower's short). One of the most annoying stories used exclamation points at the end of half the sentences. That drove me freakin' insane. Exclamation points are just uncalled for, and I don't imagine Holmes and Watson shouting constantly. Very bad. The only story I liked was Estleman's, but I knew I would because I've liked his other work.I was also annoyed because most of these are not murder stories. They involve stolen brooches, riddles and, at its most boring, insurance swindles. Silly of me to think a book entitled \\"Murder, My Dear Watson,\\" would kill off a few people.The essays at the back don't offer much either. The one on \\"the head and the heart\\" is a decent read but is available in other collections. \\"Sherlock on the Internet\\" is woefully out of date; it's a 9-year-old essay, and the Internet has changed so much that nothing in the essay is really applicable.

I'm not saying I believed all of it (I didn't, especially the conversation at the end that made Watson and Holmes sound quite disloyal to their royalty), but I had fun reading it.\\"The Adventure of the Curious Canary\\" caused me some quibbles. I have owned canaries and I know they do not tame easily, or frequently fly to people's shoulders, or allow you to stroke them. This figured heavily in the story, and drew me out of it with a jerk and a \\"huh?\\"\\"Before the Adventures\\" was a lot of fun, introducing \\"Budger,\\" a lower-class prototype for Holmes. I really enjoyed how he arranged a seminal meeting in the story. The essays at the end were also enjoyable.Overall, this book was a fun read, and well-done.

It was very spell binding making it very difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Murder, My Dear Watson: New Tales of Sherlock Holmes","review":"Ranging from the earliest days of Sherlock Holmes's career as a consulting detective (1882) to his retirement to beekeeping in Sussex (1917), these 10 original stories by mystery writers well known (Sharyn McCrumb, Loren D. Estleman, Anne Perry) and not so much (Carolyn Wheat, Lenore Carroll) have one thing in common: a careful faithfulness to the tone of Arthur Conan Doyle's Canon. Mostly narrated (as they should be) by Dr. Watson, they introduce characters ranging from a not-yet-notorious Prof. Moriarty to such historic figures as pioneer film director D. W. Griffith, actor William Gillette (who first enacted Holmes on the stage), and Sax Rohmer, creator of the villainous Dr. Fu Manchu. There's even a tale focusing on the Maltese Falcon which will, forty-odd years later, form the centerpiece of a bewildering case for yet another private detective. Despite the title, murder isn't always a feature of the cases here enumerated, and even when it is, it's handled tastefully, with proper late-Victorian discretion and delicacy. The book might have done just as well without the three factual essays that occupy the last quarter of it, but for those who enjoy well-done pastiches of The Great Detective, this collection should be quite satisfactory."},{"Title":"Murder, My Dear Watson: New Tales of Sherlock Holmes","review":"A treasure chest of short stories and interesting knowledge about Sherlock Holmes.

He concluded that Stonehenge was a sophisticated astronomical observatory designed to predict eclipses. The positioning of the stones provides a wealth of information, as does the choice of the site itself. If you can see the alignment, general relationship, and the use of these stones then you will know the reason for the construction. The author, and other astronomers, discovered the 56-year cycle of eclipses by decoding Stonehenge!Stonehenge was constructed from about 1900BC to 1600BC. Appendix B tells how the movement of stones once each year from an initial fixed position will predict accurately every important lunar event for hundreds of years. This computer would need resetting about once every 300 years by advancing the stones by one space. Mankind generally used the cycle of the moon as a unit of timekeeping.The most significant Stonehenge positions line up to point to some unique sun of moon position (Figure 12). Chapter 7 tell how they used an IBM 704 computer in 1961 to plot the Stonehenge positions (120 pairs of points) and calculated where the lines would hit the sky (p.105). Chapter 9 asks if the Aubrey holes can be proved to have been used as a computer? No, but it is the most reasonable solution proposed so far.This entertaining and educational book tells about the author's investigations and conclusions. It is a classic science book for the general reader."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"Where have I been, that I did not know this?I have been to Stonehenge; the highlight of my2 weeks in England, bought a good little bookas a momento; sat and stared at my photos, andlistened intently as documentaries describedit as an alien landing site, etc.I'd go &quot;hmm...aligns with the sun...constructed by aliens...prehistory peoplecouldn't do that...magically formed byDruids...hmmmmm.&quot; But never gave it seriousthought.

Here I go....backto the future."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"For 3000 years men have pondered this brooding monument to the past and groped to understand the purpose. The Stonehenge object demands this sort of wonder.The humans who looked and wondered encompassed every phase of human history from the stone/early-bronze age until today. They built legends and myths about the builders based upon themselves, their own abilities as societies and their assumptions about the men who preceded them. Those who couldn't conceive of a technology capable of moving 50 ton boulders from many miles away explained what they saw with Gods and magic. Those who lived in the bloody ages of warfare and vain royalties explained what they saw in those terms. Always they assumed the men of the past were at least as ignorant and savage as themselves.The men who built Stonehenge during the centuries between 1750 and 1500 BC might have been bloody. But they were not ignorant. The subsequent centuries of men could never conceive of the purpose of Stonehenge until computers were invented. Stonehenge is, itself, a massive computer. Hawkins, an astronomer at the dawn of the recent computer age, applied an IBM computer and finally solved the mystery of purpose in the huge stones in 1963.The monument required millions of man-hours to build and an understanding of astronomy not repeated for tens of centuries. At least a major part of the Stonehenge purpose involved predicting celestial events on a scale almost as grandiose as Stonehenge itself.Hawkins wrote this book four decades ago. Until his discoveries and publication hundreds of theories surrounded the monument. Today, because of Hawkins, any conflicting new theory on any aspect of Stonehenge has to be weighed against his findings and proven. This is the Hawkins accomplishment. Men finally have a clearer view, not only of the massive stones, but of the complex intellects and shocking accomplishments of stone age and bronze age man. Stonehenge finally demonstrates the intellect of the creators more than the unbelievable technological project of itself those later men could always see.This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"When an astronomer looks at Stonehenge, he has to find alignments with the moon and the sun. It is all the easier since this civilization that built Stonehenge (Neolithic men around 1900-1500 BC) was based on a religion centered on the sun and the moon because these two entities were dictating their rhythms onto man's activities : agriculture first of all, but also their whole planning of all their resources to be able to face the hard season, the winter. But what Hawkins finds is a lot more disquieting. First Stnehenge is on the only latitude where the main alignments with the sun and those with the moon are perpendicular, hence project a rectangle on the ground which is one of the basic forms of the first design of Stonehenge. What's more the 56 Aubrey holes are the exact number of solar years necessary to calculate the moon cycles (19 + 19 + 18), still in the first Stonehenge. All the subsequent phases (two main building phases) will keep these basic alignments, multiply them and emphasize them. Howkins further shows that, well-used, the 56 Aubrey holes are a computing device to predict the moon eclipses. That is amazing. It can't be proved that it was used like that at the time, but the power is in the structure. Difficult to think it's only a coincidence. How could they have come to the number 56 in any other different way (7x8, 14x4, 28x2 are not significant) ? But the book raises a question in my mind that Hawkins never examines. The geographical (5113 latitude north) position, the long building period (300 to 400 years) over 30 to 40 life expectancy generations or 60 to 80 active life generations, imply that the knowledge of the design was transmitted after having been invented and set : the place needed a vast coordination in space, and the time needed a transmission device. This implies a common language among the neolithic men in the whole of Europe, and this implies some kind of a transcribing device to keep and transmit the basic parameters. This means reckoning (this is no problem since even illiterate people can count) and a symbolic writing procedure. We could imagine pure oral transmission, though it sounds eefy for technical and numerical elements. And after all we had believed the Celts had no writing system, till we discovered the Ogham alphabet that was used by the druids in their time, projecting thus the Celts from prehistory into history itself. The designing and the managing of the building of Stonehenge also imply that this neolithic society had an elite both in intelligence and in social position. Priests ? Maybe, but intellectuals for sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"To be quite honest, at first I expected this book to be \\"trash,\\" to be merely entertaining but not contain any other useful information. I was set to rebuke whatever Hawkins claimed. To my surprise, I found a well-written scientific book that contained some very convincing ideas. Yes, the book is now 40 years old and technology has advanced (it was rather amusing to read what he wrote about computers and hopes for the future), but I think we'd come up with these same findings today."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"Put away all your wild theories and the inept investigations of amateurs. Hawkins has put the record straight for anyone bold enough to keep an open mind. The case is closed, the mystery of Stonehenge has indeed been decoded."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"The author used a computer (in the early 1960's) to calculate high and low rising points for the sun &amp; moon for different eras. He found many precise alignments among the stones for the era of apparent construction. Among other purposes, the ediface shows &quot;that an eclipse of the sun or moon always occurred when the winter moon - that is the full moon nearest the winter solstice - rose over the heel stone.&quot;Hawkins presents an excellent overview of the history of Stonehenge lore and then goes into a very detailed account on the development of Stonehenges I, II &amp; III. He seems to have worked out the quarrying / transportation &amp; construction problems quite well. Stonehengers(NOT Druids) left quite a calculator behind."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"The article that the author originally published appears as an appendix in this book reprinted in 1988. Although the author is to be lauded for his breakthrough in the field, the book itself is mostly light fluff about the history of the area with the meat of the text in the appendices with the original articles.Most of what is in this book can be found on the Internet in about 10 seconds with a good search engine looking for stonehenge astronomical alignments."},{"Title":"Stonehenge Decoded","review":"The book is informative. However, it is a matter of debate whether the book exhibits decoding of Stonehenge. Through my intense private literature reviews of the published media I have come to formulate my own opinion and with good reason. I will share with you that opinion for the function at a later time, but in review of the book this is my suggestions why I am on the fence about this publication:**First and foremost, the builders knew the design and the function before the first stone was ever moved towards Salisbury plains. This is evident through the fact that they aligned them to 'welcome' and commence the Summer Solstice morning, not as an alarm indicator or a predictor of which. So the function of the henge is not one of prediction of when that was, like a calendar, but a function when it happened and as it happened. Also, with simple alignments, wood would serve for a marker and much better since the Sarsen dressing and standing would be overkill had the function been \\"Astro Ruler\\" utensils. Archeolgy has uncovered that wooden domains represented the living and Stone was ancestral/or Deity of Gods-oriented. So this was part of a grand vision/one these people believed jeopardized their very next-year breath of air should this feat not have seen fruition. Mapping the sky was not on that list of priorities, and they had no writing (not invented yet) and to 'map' you would need to record. Sorry, that avenue is pointless.**Secondly, these people were Ancestral and life and death was important alongside cropping and fertility. Alignment with the Summer Solstice served a belief-cast oriented solution not an Astrological or study of the heavens. Astrology is a wide field, and one-day alignments (two-per-year maximum Summer and winter Solstices) do not fall under Astrology/-omy. In other words, Astrology is \\"too strong of word\\". A different word would have to be used.**Furthermore, I never believed the Astronomy/celestial calendar or computer scenario. These were farmers and naked-eye would have to do. Plus, unlike a telescope no dimension of the Stonehenge magnifies or enables better vision. So Telescope and observatory are ZERO possibilities for solution. In other words, you see the same thing with the naked eye as you do with theStonering or without just plain stainding in the middle of the grass. Visualize what immense amount of work went into making this monument, so unlikely.**lastly, the one key point NO ONE touches on in any research from any field is the simplest debunker of Astro-oriented theories to begin with. Studying the Salisbury plains weather patterns closely and I mean Almanac type of backup style, it is evident that for most (300 on ave of the 365 days) there are vast cloud patterns and overcast skies. Any farmer depending on alignments from such a poor tracker would not be a good farmer at all. THERE IS NO VISIBILITY for most of the year. :) And to conclude, a computing machinery was used by Dr. Hawkins to pint out the alignments. Let's be diplomatic and say that if one invokes machinery, you are sure to find alignments aand hence have a trial-bias and false (+). But let's say the alignments are valid and let in. These people had no way of computing other than the naked eye and the vast knowledge of all this Solstices. No computer means that they would have to chart out inconceivable (to then and now) equations and not only I can assure you this didn't take place but they had no means of records to accomplish this.Hint for the correct answer: Tomb to womb; cycle of life on a wide god-like scale.

Buy the book, a bottle of good wine, and settle back for a great adventure...........Dj"},{"Title":"Conquistador","review":"TITLE: \\"Conquistador\\"AUTHOR: David T. HorsleyPUBLISHER: XlibrisThe Texas Panhandle is in the eye of the beholder. Some see it as empty and ugly and yearn to escape it; others are held in thrall by its lonely, haunting splendor. The latter often are people from elsewhere, like Wisconsin-born artist Georgia O'Keeffe, who spent years filling watercolor canvasses with its \\"wideness and wonder,\\" and essayist David Horsley, born in Missouri, who fills the pages of his first novel with his own easy, unobtrusive vision, deftly woven into an absorbing blend of fact and fiction.\\"Conquistador\\" concerns itself with people whose eyes behold this vast flatland, gashed by the 120-mile-long Palo Duro Canyon, and see dollar signs. One is Francisco Coronado, traversing the Texas plains with his army in 1541, seeking fabled riches beyond imagination. The story of Coronado's expedition into this land \\"magnificent in its austerity\\" unfolds through young soldier Jose Felipe's letters to his family in Spain.Jose's letters provide historic snapshots that parallel a present-day tale in which Luis Vargas, a modern Spanish \\"explorer,\\" arrives in Amarillo and joins forces with native movers and shakers in an unlikely scheme: appropriate a section of the Palo Duro and build a massive themepark therein.They soon hit the inevitable snag: Eleanor Grissom, co-owner of a 10-square-mile canyon ranch and an attractive divorcee \\"somewhere between an old 28 and a young 42.\\" Though raised on the land, in a ranching family with an O'Hara-Tara outlook, Eleanor hates cattle, regarding them as \\"four-legged black holes, sucking in every ounce of energy humans gave and demanding more,\\" and even fears horses. She wears not cowboy boots but sneakers.She has tried to escape her ill-fitting heritage through myriad means but eventually is pulled back into the canyon for good by the illness and subsequent death of her widowed mother. Now she is trapped and weary, living with her brother, Frank, a Persian Gulf veteran who suffers from Gulf War Syndrome and is too physically and emotionally ill to help carry in groceries, much less help run the ranch he owns with his sister. While Eleanor was trying to escape, Frank, before his military service, was at home actually learning how to run the outfit, but with his nebulous disability, Eleanor is alone with only two ranch hands, constantly struggling to keep the place afloat.One morning while retrieving some stranded cattle, Eleanor discovers some bones, digs into the soil and finds other artifacts. Enter archaeology professor Reuben Mendoza, who enlists some students to help give the site the proper treatment. Several items are uncovered which Mendoza suspects may provide the first solid evidence that Coronado's 16th-century expedition passed through Palo Duro Canyon.Vargas and his minions are interested in the artifacts as well. They begin to seem a bit sinister as they clandestinely observe the dig site, even more sinister when the artifacts disappear from Mendoza's lab, and absolutely sinister later on.Of course, it's the Grissom Ranch, and the nearby land of Wiley Henderson (who lives up to his given name), that is of interest to Vargas. The Grissoms' blustery, greedy neighbor is an easy conquest for Vargas; the fragile, heartbreaking Frank a vulnerable but uncertain target. The uncertainty lies with Eleanor. The siblings' mother left each with a half of the ranch that can't function without the other half in an effort to make the kids work together and keep the place in one piece. Guess which kid refuses to sell her half.Fortunately for Vargas, the half he needs belongs to Frank -- if he can keep Frank away from the strong-willed sister for a while. We soon discover that Vargas is not just a businessman but a dangerous man.\\"Conquistador,\\" winner of First Place in Mainstream Fiction with the Southwest Writers Workshop and First Place in Western Fiction with the Austin Writers' League, captures the reader's interest from almost the first page, maintaining a near-perfect tempo throughout. But what begins as an effortless, engaging jog segues into a suspenseful full run with some surprising hairpin turns. Some of Horsley's villains are a little sketchy and one-dimensional, but the good guys are fully and subtly drawn -- particularly Eleanor and Frank, who draw us into their hearts and let us look through their eyes.The most important character of \\"Conquistador\\" is omnipresent yet even more subtle. The orange-yellow dust on human skin. The birds keeping their indifferent, avian watch. The wind, alternately \\"like the accidental brush of a lover's skin\\" and \\"a shrieking fiend . . . which gnaws at our resolve.\\" A writer could devote chapters to bringing to life this land that some call hostile and some call home and never touch the effectiveness of Horsley's matter-of-fact, built-in elegance. He's not a Panhandle native, but he should be.(An edited version of this review was originally published in the Amarillo Globe-News on Nov. 30.)"},{"Title":"Conquistador","review":"For mostly being a history lesson written in first person spanish exploration through the Texas plains this story manages to be a lively and fun read.

That's too bad because there is nothing wrong with using cultural clich&eacute;s as a starting point if you are eventually going to show us the richer and fuller culture (and persons) that surely exists.If you strip away the cultural clich&eacute;s and recipes, you have a very thin novel that reads like a weak stage play. However, if you are interested in understanding Filipino culture, then there is enough to satisfy the curious.Personally, I had a hard time finishing this book because the plot fell apart in the latter half. One exception was the short vampire story - a true delight if not a familiar one.Overall, B+ for recipes, C- for plot, C for characterization, B+ for cultural insights, and F for the extensive rehash of cultural clich&eacute;s (yuk).

Peace is the result of spending quiet time with God each day in prayer and reading His Word, being teachable and obedient by abiding in Christ.Throughout \\"Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World,\\" Joanna Weaver draws from resources that she has found helpful, including Navigators 2:7 material. I thought it was interesting that both the author and I were impacted by the same quote from the Navigators 2:7 material which was that \\"Christ is waiting for me to come spend time with Him.\\"The main point of \\"Having a Mary Heart in Martha World\\" is to have a balance between our worship and service. We should be a combination of both Mary and Martha! Much of this book was already familiar to me but served as a good reminder to keep abiding in Christ and guarding my quiet time with Him. Something that jumped out at me was about hospitality and being willing to help the less fortunate because I pass by beggars all the time going to or from work. Joanna said, \\"As Christians, as a church, we are called to be hospitable, the very root of hospitality. Our lives should be a refuge for the hurting, not a country club for the comfortable.\\" That really spoke to my heart.This is not a book that goes fast. There is a lot of \\"meat\\" in it and things to think through and apply to your life. It gives you a lot to \\"chew\\" on.

I love fiction and very rarely read non-fiction.2. It took me about 5 months to read this book.Now that the confession is over with I must tell you that this is a fantastic book!!! The reason it took me so long to read it had nothing to do with the author or the book, but me...it just seemed like there was always a great fiction book calling my name. But I should have stuck this one out and finished it in record time.I am truly a &#8220;Martha&#8221;, but I&#8217;m also &#8220;lazy&#8221;, so that makes me a &#8220;lazy Martha&#8221;. But I want so much to be a &#8220;Mary&#8221;. Sitting in the living room with Jesus and listening to His every word. Being so devoted to Him I would pour out my entire life at His feet as a love offering. But I also want to be a &#8220;non-lazy Martha&#8221; and be out delivering food to the shut-ins, the grieving, the poor & volunteering for every activity at church. But neither personality comes easy to me. And Joanna Weaver does not make me feel guilty about this. Neither does Jesus!Joanna says in the first chapter, &#8220;Just mention the names Mary and Martha around a group of Christian women and you&#8217;ll get knowing looks and nervous giggles. We&#8217;ve all felt the struggle. We want to worship like Mary, but the Martha inside keeps bossing us around.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t that true?Throughout this book, Joanna takes us on a journey, her journey, our journey, from being in a kitchen surrounded by menus, grocery lists, dishes, and all the junk that seems to accumulate on the counters and the kitchen table, to the living room, sitting calmly at the foot of Jesus, soaking in every word and not feeling guilty about our &#8220;to do lists&#8221;.She finally ends this book with a revelation that you can do both, it doesn&#8217;t have to be one or the other, so long as we put Jesus first then &#8220;both of us&#8221; can become one. Surrendering all to Jesus. The struggle doesn&#8217;t end, we are after all humans and we constantly fail, but we have Jesus to pick us up, dust us off, and say &#8220;Follow me&#8221;.You&#8217;ll love this book, just like I did.

I suspeact we all align ourselves with one woman or the other. We see Martha as the Do-er and Mary as the Seeker. We contrast Martha's busy-ness with Mary's attentiveness. Sometimes we see Martha as overbearing and Mary as flat-out-lazy. But I suspect Mrs. Weaver's book will change some of those preconceived ideas and open up new and liberating truths of both Mary's Heart and Martha's World. I was fortunate enough to be part of a ladies group that did this study together, and I treasured the moments of discussion and the sharing of personal stories that both challenged and encouraged me to grow.

Quizon (Firecracker)Period: 1A young boy named Eddie Dickens was forced to go to America because his mom wanted him to. Of course, he certainly did not want to go there. Then one unpleasant day, Eddie found himself sailing on a ship, on the way to America. He was so worried. He did not even know if he would make it through the ship ride. Eddie was so scared sailing on a ship alone, with strangers all around him. He was in one of those leaky ships, not the real fancy, cruise looking ships. Anyways, Eddie thought he would never make it. This ship ride took forever. Eddie was sailing with some of the most dangerous people in which of course made him extremely frightened. On this leaky ship, there was a mysterious stowaway and some faces he knew of from his own past which was not very good. With the familiar faces he knew of, they tied him up and set adrift a leaky rowboat. He hated this and surely wanted to go back home. There was absolutely no doubt about that! He was waiting to reach America, and it seems like it is taking years to get there. Every time Eddie thought of this, he was thinking \\"Unbelievable!\\" because he was on a ship with many bad guys who had the world-famous Dog's Bone Diamond along with a cargo hold full of left shoes. Then in conclusion, Eddie's most dangerous companions got caught, and Eddie happily got sent back home to England, and went to trial.What I like about this book is that Eddie did not go to America, and the most dangerous companions of his got caught! This ending was one of the best endings I have ever read. This ending was so unexpected, which I loved about this. \\"Once the cargo of left shoes was unloaded and the Dog's Bone Diamond delivered, there were brought back to England and ended up on trial. I also love the fact that he got back home, and went to trial. This keeps him safer, and more away from these bad guys because they probably got sent to a jail for what they did. Now Eddie wouldn't have to worry about dying because of his horrible companions. It makes me happy in the end because no one really got hurt in this story.What I dislike about this book is that Eddie was forced to go to America in the first place. Then, on the day he found himself on the ship, sailing to America, he started freaking out. I did not really like that part because if someone imagined if that was them, they would have a very unpleasant time on the ship. I also disliked the ship. I don't like those nasty, creepy-looking, leaking ships. Those ships looks like it sunk a long time ago and many people died on it. Then, people found the boat, took it out of the water, and cleaned it a little bit. It is scary, imagining people who died on it, and thinking that the ship would be haunted. Those kinds of ships give me the creeps. I feel very sorry for Eddie because it was bad enough that he had to stay on that nasty old ship, sailing to a place that he didn't want to go to. But there's more: \\"The poor Eddie Dickens finds himself sailing to America with some of the most dangerous traveling companions anyone might have the misfortune to share a ship with.\\" Of course I certainly would not want to share a ship with those kinds of people.My favorite part of this book is the ending (obviously). This is because the ending was so unexpected. What I thought was going to happen was that Eddie would not even make it on the ship ride. By the time that ship reaches America, he would probably already be dead by then because some of the familiar faces he knew and the other most dangerous companions would probably kill Eddie. That is certainly not a pleasant idea to think of. I was so wrong once I read the ending because the ending ended up as something good happening. I love it when Eddie goes back home because everything is back to normal and he feels safe again, and not like on the ship. He felt very unsafe, worried, and as if someone would kill him. I love the feeling whenever a person feels so safe. That was how Eddie felt when he went back home to England. My least favorite part of this book was in the beginning. This was when Eddie's mother wanted him to go to America. This is when the whole thing started. I thought that it was sad that he got sent on a ship with a bunch of strangers who were very dangerous. Other than that, this book was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Terrible Times: Book 3, The Eddie Dickens Trilogy","review":"Philip Ardagh is one author who knows precisely how to grab the attention of young readers and never let it go.

Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what &quot;up&quot; can mean in different contexts. The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings.&quot;Up! Up! The sun is getting up.The sun gets upso UP with you!&quot;Thus, this book begins. You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed. The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise. These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes.Once he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects).Then, Dr. Seuss returns to &quot;up&quot; and gives new meanings. These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel).Then, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed:&quot;Wake ever person,pig and pup,till EVERYONEon Earth is up!&quot;Then comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years.At first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying &quot;up&quot; means in terms of cause and effect.The book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader. The language is simple. There is a limited vocabulary of short words. The illustrations tie in clearly to the words. The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat. A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings.After your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for &quot;up&quot; which will extend the value of the book. For example, you can use &quot;arise&quot; or &quot;rise&quot; in many of the contexts. Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use.May all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!"},{"Title":"Great Day for Up (Bright & Early Books(R))","review":"An understated, masterful progression building steadily from the simple to the complex, finally culimating in a classic punch-line.

Though almost fifteen years have past since I last read this book to a toddler, so lingering and delightful is the text that I find I can still recite the story verbatim; when requested by my cool teenagers!

That is because while the book is written by Dr. Seuss it features the jolly drawings of the English artist Quentin Blake. Until this point every time I have read a book written by Dr. Seuss it was also illustrated by Dr. Seuss and when somebody else did the drawings Dr. Seuss used the name Theo. LeSieg (which is &quot;Geisel&quot; backwards). So the fact that this is a real &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot; book drawn by somebody else is pretty special.This Bright and Early Book provides rhymed text and illustrations introducing the many meanings of the word &quot;up&quot; as Seuss and Blake show beginning readers that this is a &quot;Great day for up!&quot; You get the point half way through the book but little kids should be able to hand on longer, especially when they are reading the book for themselves. Besides, by the end of &quot;Great Day for Up&quot; we get to the point where &quot;EVERYONE on Earth is up!&quot; (with one very important and rather ironic exception).As with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text. These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed &quot;The Cat in the Hat,&quot; which was the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.

Obviously, that time has long since faded, as today's soaps tend to have more in common with th works of Jerry Bruckheimer than Tennessee Williams.Harding Leman helmed Another World during a period which many considered its heyday. And this memoir provides readers with not only a fascinating peek behind the scenes of a once popular, now defunct soap, but also into the life and mind of the person responsible for bringing an entire fictional town to life on a daily basis. For eight years, Lemay was responsible for who did what to whom in the town of Bay City. He took a soap which for far too long had relied on melodramatic plot twists and infused it with a sensibility more akin to the parlor dramas of Tennessee Williams. It was under Lemay that typical bitch-Goddess Rachel evolved into a character whose actions and motivations the audience could understand, paving the way for her to eventually become one of daytime's most beloved heroines.Lemay's story will prove fascinating to anyone who loved Another World, soaps in general or that much more specific audience of people who watch their daytime dramas and think, \\"I could do that!\\" They'll find that not only is it not as easy as one might believe, but that it can often become all-consuming.Anyone with an interest in daytime will surely find this to be a fascinating read, although those who are familiar with Another World and it's history will, obviously, get much more out of it than the casual reader."},{"Title":"Eight years in Another world","review":"This book details the years during the 1970's in which the author wrote for a popular, long-running television program. His uncertain beginning, learning by the seat of his pants, immersion into the rigors of the work, and ultimate obsession with the writing are interesting. Read after the author's first memoir, one can appreciate why Lemay behaved as he did during the 70's. Although he had reconciled some of the past conflicts about his childhood by this time, ghosts of his demons and unresolved issues sprang up in the hothouse of daytime TV writing.Lemay provides an interesting depiction of the struggles anyone would face in the fast-paced, pressure cooker environment of soap operas-- creating 5 one hour dramas each week with no time off for reruns-- and gives us some hints about his own particular reaction to the stresses. &quot;Eight Years&quot; does not, however, contain the depth of insight and self revelation that the preceding memoir did. A reader who had not read the first volume would not realize the desires, experiences, and unfulfilled hopes that drove Lemay to throw himself into a cauldron of obsessive writing, quest for quality, self imposed isolation, and acceptance of inane corporate superiors. The costs of such compulsive self discipline are outlined but not as completely detailed as in his first book. Implied in the book is the incredible convergence of fate that brought a man who had been so long striving to enter another, better world through sometimes dramatic means to a television show that needed a theme about longing and the lengths to which people will go to find satisfaction of their dreams.Much of the book is devoted to the plots Lemay created for the show. This hints at the role of fantasy in the mind of a damaged child, creative adult, and questing person, but the author refrains from exploring at length the links between addiction to writing the ongoing lives of imagined characters and the deprivations of his actual history. The continuing drama of his show's characters do propel the book the way they do a soap, which is fun. The pain of Lemay's decisions, however, seem underplayed. Nevertheless, as a two volume memoir, &quot;Inside, Looking Out&quot; and &quot;Eight Years&quot; make for a compelling portrait of a man one might like to know better. The books raise curiosity about the plays he also wrote and the teleplays of &quot;Another World&quot; of the 1970's that may be lost forever except in the memories of fans lucky enough to have seen them in their single airing."},{"Title":"Eight years in Another world","review":"Harding Lemay was a playwright when he was hired as the headwriter for NBC's top-rated daytime drama \\"Another World\\" in 1971.

Although \\"Another World's\\" ratings were quite good when Lemay took over as writer (the serial was a solid #4 in the Nielsen's), the ratings took a nosedive after Agnes Nixon left as headwriter in 1968 to go to ABC. What Lemay found on \\"Another World\\" was a show filled with melodramtic storylines consisting of secret burglaries, poisoinings, and illigetimate children. Lemay wanted to change the face of the show, and of daytime for that matter by writing stories that dealt with human emotions and interractions, without a ton of hospital and courtroom scenes.Harding Lemay went on to be the greatest serial writer ever, even surpassing William Bell, Agnes Nixon, and even Irna Phillips herself, as Lemay wrote daring stories and brought \\"Another World\\" to the top of the daytime ratings. The show continuously held a number 2 position in the Nielsens, and it was under his helm the show hit #1. \\"Eight Years In Another World\\" is Lemay's account of what he went throught to make the show a hit, how he kept it there, the problems he had with certain cast members and producers, and ultimately how he got burned out from constantly writing for a daytime serial for eight years. Lemay is very open about his distaste for certain actors on the show like Val Dufour, Virginia Dywer, Geroge Reinholt, and Jacqueline Courtney, and he writes about how he tried to get these actors to act the way he wanted them to, unfortunately to no avail. He writes how he wrote out these popular actors, yet he writes favourably about Douglas Watson, Susan Sullivan, Victoria Wyndham, and Beverlee Mckinsey, and how they all were a pleasure to write for. Lemay also acknowledges how hard it is to write for a soap opera, with the time constraints and deadlines in putting a daily 30 minutes serial on the air. This is a book all should read if you want to be a soap opera writer, as Harding details the problems too with a longer format for a daytime series, as \\"Another World\\" would be the first soap to expand to sixty minutes a day in 1975, then ninety minutes in 1979. That 90 minute expansion would be the death nell for both the serial and Lemay, as the ratings took a nosedive and Harding started having severe health problems brought on by the stress of too much overwork. If you are a fan of soap opera or was a fan of \\"Another World\\" during its Golden Years, this is a must read as many of the 1970's top stories are documented here on its pages. \\"Eight Years In Another World\\" is long out of print, but the price that sellers are asking for it is worth every dime, because not only is it the best book on serials, but the best book on how soap operas are created, made every day, and written. Lemay is also credited with helping Douglas Marland for getting his start in serial writing, as Marland was a dialogue writer for \\"Another World\\" under Lemay. Marland would go on to make \\"General Hospital\\" a hit and would create characters like Tracy Quatrermaine and Luke Spencer, still mainstays of \\"GH\\" to this day."},{"Title":"Eight years in Another world","review":"I was a fan of Another World and was immeditaly intrigued by the fact a former writer on the show decided to publish a book about his work.

Every page is a joy to read!!"},{"Title":"Eight years in Another world","review":"Unfortunately, Another World has passed on in 1999. Harding Lemay wrote for the serial in the 1970s. I was interested in his relationship with Irna Phillips, the Goddess of daytime soaps who never even got an obituary in the New York despite being the reason that she was prominent in developing shows set in the Midwest but filmed in Brooklyn like Another World and in Manhattan like As the World Turns and Guiding Light. Unlike Another World, the world is still turning and Guiding Light is still shining bright with a more realistic outdoors and on location settings now. Regardless, I missed out on the Another World of the 1970s with Harding Lemay at the writing helm. He writes and explains his motivations for lot of the storylines. I was fascinated by Beverlee McKinsey who was later on Guiding Light and who passed away only three months ago. Harding Lemay was an aspiring writer, teacher, and former publisher who started off broke or in modest beginnings. He writes about his relationships with his wife, Dorothy, and children-Susan and Stephen and their life between New York City and their summer home in Fire Island. For the most part, Harding Lemay's book reminds me of what Another World was and in it's prominent heyday. Unfortunately, Another World is gone as is Beverlee McKinsey, Irna Phillips who created the show, Constance Ford, and Douglass Watson. Regardless, soaps appear to get no respect in either America or even in Britain where they have their own soaps. Sadly, American soaps are a dying breed. Harding actually admits it's backbreaking work in developing storylines and rarely taking a break except for a week in London with his wife. I just hope that the audiences out there today realize how valuable are our American soaps. They have been the foundation of so many careers whether writers or actors or directors. Soaps just don't get the respect or the outrage when it gets canceled. None of the New York City mayors ever showed interest in preservation of Another World or others. Soaps today have been geared toward the youth market and there are those soap veteran actors who have spent years on the soap only to get an occasional appearance much less storyline. I was interested in when Harding wanted to introduce a gay character on soaps but the network killed the idea because it was too controversial. He doesn't out anybody but he is quite honest about his feelings towards Irna Phillips, his mentor and teacher, Paul Rauch who was executive producer of Another World and Bob Short, the liaison for Procter & Gamble. I still wished that he wrote more about Beverlee McKinsey in this book."},{"Title":"Lectures on the Arithmetic Riemann-Roch Theorem (Annals of Mathematics Studies)","review":"The Riemann-Roch theorem has come a long way since its origins in the work of Bernhard Riemann 154 years ago. Riemann was attempting to establish the existence of complex functions on multiply-connected surfaces with no boundary. A surface that is (2p + 1)-connected for a positive integer p can be represented as a 4p-sided polygon after making 2p cuts. Riemann showed using the Dirichlet principle that there are p linearly-independent functions defined inside this polygon that are everywhere holomorphic. The differentials of these functions are also holomorphic integrands. By specifying D points at which a function can have simple poles, and by constraining the functions to change only by a constant amount at the cuts, then Riemann showed that one can obtain functions with only simple poles and constant \\"jumps\\" by taking a sum of p linearly independent functions with no poles with functions of the form 1/z at one of the specified points and a constant term. Non-constant meromorphic functions thus exist when p + D + 1 - 2p >= 2, or D > p, which is now called the Riemann inequality. Hence there is a linear space of complex functions of dimension >= D + 1 - p, which contains non-constant functions when D + 1 - p > 1. Roch was Riemann's student and interpreted the quantity D + 1 - p as the dimension of the space of holomorphic integrands. If a function has D simple poles, and if there are Q linearly independent integrands that vanish at these poles, then the function depends on D - p + q + 1 arbitrary constants.The work of Riemann and Roch is readily seen to be related to the genus of the surface, if viewed in the light of the polygon of 4p sides. The modern view of the Riemann-Roch theorem in fact is naturally viewed as a generalization of a formula for the Euler characteristic, the latter of which involves the genus of a Riemann surface. The \\"classical\\" Riemann-Roch theorem is stated in terms of divisors on a Riemann surface X of genus g and reads as r(-D) - i(D) = d(D) - g + 1, where D is a fixed divisor on the surface, r(-D) is the dimension of meromorphic functions of divisors >= -D on X, and i(D) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic 1-forms of divisors >= D on X. Many other statements have been given, one being in terms of holomorphic bundles defined by D over X, where one computes the Euler characteristic of the sheaf of germs of holomorphic sections of the bundle. Another is in the context of holomorphic bundles over nonsingular complex projective varieties, where the Euler characteristic of the sheaf of holomorphic sections of the bundle is given in terms of a formula involving the first Chern class of the variety. The Euler characteristic has of course also been computed in terms of the index of Dirac operators, and so it is not surprising to find that the Riemann-Roch theorem has an analytical formulation also.This book proves a Riemann-Roch theorem for arithmetic varieties, and the author does so via the formalism of Dirac operators and consequently that of heat kernels. In the first lecture the reader will see the \\"classical\\" Riemann-Roch theorem in an even more general context then that mentioned above: that of smooth morphisms of regular schemes. Using familiar constructions involving the K-groups and Chow groups to make the calculations more manageable, the author proves the Riemann-Roch theorem for regular schemes by reducing it to the case for projective bundles. Flag schemes are used in the proof, and the strategy used here repeats itself in the proof of the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem. Throughout the book the author outlines the necessary background for the eventual proof of the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem. This includes a discussion of how to define Chern classes for arithmetic vector bundles, as well as the background in analysis via a discussion of heat kernels and Laplacians on Riemannian manifolds. The detailed discussion of analysis was done, according to the author, so as to avoid the methods of stochastic integration, which he felt might not be familiar to the average reader with a background in algebraic geometry."},{"Title":"Emergency Childbirth - A Manual","review":"The only thing in this book I suspect was WRONG is the part where it ways that the baby's birth must be registered--though it's possible that a DOCTOR who attends a birth is required, by law, to register it...I, too, found this book enormously reassuring, an antidote to all the fear-mongering which beclouds the subject of childbirth in the U.S."},{"Title":"Emergency Childbirth - A Manual","review":"I am interested in purchasing this book, but it says it's unavailable.

Rose's journey begins in 1911 with her arrival at Ellis Island. Her first job, working in a sweat shop making paper flowers, marks her first step towards self-reliance, but she soon encounters trouble. The owner takes advantage of her innocence and of her need for money, and late one evening physically assaults her. Rose escapes without her pay and only winter coat. The daughter of the Jewish man she rents a tenement room from, Gussie, is a union worker that gives Rose the courage to go back to the sweatshop the next day, get her coat, and demand her pay. Gussie is then able to get Rose a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, which pays better. Rose is able to worry a little less and enjoy her youth. She makes friends at the factory, sees a nickelodeon for the first time, and reads her first dime novel. But the real-life tragedy of the factory fire painfully jars her back to the harsh reality of the immigrant's life. (Of the 146 people that die in the fire, many of them are young girls who either jump to their deaths or are trapped in the burning building because of locked doors) Still, Rose finds within herself the strength to hope once again that she'd find America's streets paved with gold, and make a life for herself. \\"...I was a grown woman now, not somebody's little girl. The fire had changed me. Like a piece of iron in a blacksmith's forge, I had come out reshaped, stronger.\\" Ashes of Roses tackles tough issues of the period like child labor, women's rights, worker's rights, discrimination, racial diversity, and class distinction. But never does one feel like she is reading a history book. Rather, the reader comes to care deeply for Rose, struggling along with her, and wanting desperately for her to succeed. The reader, and Rose, learn much along the way. This book stands alone as a compelling story, as does the author's other highly-praised works of historical fiction, i.e. her pioneer trilogy, Journey to Nowhere, Frozen Summer, and The Road to Home. Ashes of Roses is also a boon to history teachers wanting the past to come alive for their students. Furthermore, the author details the research that went into the making of Rose's story in the Author's Note, so teachers, librarians, and parents alike can feel secure in the knowledge that the people, places, events, and lifestyles portrayed in the novel are historically accurate. This book deserves a place on every library's shelf."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"Sixteen-year-old Margaret Rose Nolan learns about life in America the hard way. As an Irish immigrant to the U.S. in 1911, she doesn't expect the series of complications that leaves her and her sister alone and fending for themselves in New York City. But little by little, \\"Rose\\" (as she calls herself in America) finds that she is managing in this new life. She has a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory and is beginning to find friends. Yet will she feel that she still wants to be in America after the tragedy that is soon to befall her?Auch generally handled her topic and her character with skill. Although I am an avid historical fiction reader who has definitely heard similar stories of immigration and settling in America, good writing and pacing kept this one from seeming \\"deja vu.\\" Rose and her sister will prove interesting especially to girls who read this novel, since it is fascinating to put yourself in the spirited Rose's \\"shoes\\" and see history though her eyes.And indeed, Rose's spirit carries the novel as well. The first person narrative showcases her steely intelligence and resourcefulness, and her quick thinking and determination make her a suitable heroine. Although I found the author's habit of dropping Gs on words like \\"walking\\" (to imitate the Irish accent) a bit annoying, little can detract from the strength of this main character.Finally, the development of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in the story line was excellent. The author had obviously researched the topic thoroughly, since she described it (of course through Rose's eyes) with a breathtakingly complete but natural narrative. Also fascinating were the many \\"hard to find\\" facts about this fire that were seamlessly revealed throughout the book's final chapters.My only real complaint with this novel was the fact that it seemed to end a little too abruptly. Following the fire, I would have really liked to seem more of what happened to Rose, instead of just finding the end of the novel! Did she become successful in America? Marry? Have children? I felt disappointed to \\"meet\\" this strong character and see such a small portion of her life.In short, \\"Ashes of Roses\\" is a skillfully done book with interesting history and a well-drawn character.

The characters come alive and when many are lost in the Triangle shirtwaist company fire you grieve for them along with Rose. Ashes of Roses is a poignant book that will move the reader to a new, deeper understanding of the struggle for rights and the horror of the fire that took the lives of over 150 people in the Triangle Company fire in New York."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"This is not your typical preachy Young Adult historical piece. The writing is just first rate, and this older adult could not put it down. Even though 1911 New York is evoked well, it is not overwrought with tedious description. The first person voice is entirely believeable. Enough complications ensue for the heroine to mature quickly - and yet one does not know who will die and who will be spared in the devastating fire that awaits these gallant young women, each wonderfully unique.The author's timing has been uncanny. She turned in her manuscript the day the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire died at 107, a triumphant figure who lived her subsequent life to the hilt. And, in a line within the story, there is embedded a comment about the span of survivors' lives and a sort of reference to the event which not one of them would have to witness on 9/11. Some merciful providence had spared the last survivor. This is truly a graceful yet gritty tale, full of hope and of bitter realism. We are the same stuff of which those girls were made.

Having heard prosperous tales of life in America, the Nolan family sets off from Ireland, the homeland they have come to know and love, in search of exciting new experiences. Immediately after arriving in America, however, Rose is faced with harsh realities as her little brother Joseph is denied access into the country, and her father has no choice but to accompany him back to Ireland. Before long, doubts of living in a strange land surface in Rose's mother's mind, and she decides to escape the unknown and return to the familiarities of home in Ireland. Left to fend for herself and her younger sister Maureen, Rose remains determined to make a life for them in America, and matures while struggling to overcome unexpected obstacles, such as the terrible Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. This convincing story, told in first person, succeeds in portraying the perspective of a young woman immigrant in the early 1900s. Mary Jane Auch's realistic storytelling does a good job in embracing the hardships of the time, although her writing style could be improved by more in-depth information and more detailed descriptions. Overall, Ashes of Roses is a nice story of independence posing some interesting situations, but it's an easy read not invoking much thought that falls into the category of a typical immigration book.What exactly does it mean to be a true American? Is an American anyone who calls America home? Or does it have more to do with a person's beliefs? Does being American come with an established set of moral ideals? In Ashes of Roses, Rose Nolan strives to settle in America and become just like the other girls. To Rose, being an American means living in the same way as the other \\"American\\" girls and believing what they believe. For instance, Rose was always known as Margaret Rose in Ireland, but upon stepping foot in America, she wished to be called Rose, hoping to present herself in a new way for a fresh start. She also notices the \\"fashionable new Gibson Girl shirtwaists\\" worn by the girls and feels self-conscious about her own homely dresses, while longing to fit in. The strong personalities of women in labor unions also make an impact on Rose. She admires their boldness and is inspired by their courage to stand up for their rights. As Rose only tries to imitate the ways of her so-called Americans (in reality, fellow immigrants), the question remains unanswered.

It showed how many families were torn apart by the testing of Ellis Island and that countless people who were very hopeful to live in the U.S. and start a new life were sent back to their old countries. Rose is the main character of the story. She comes from Ireland and her uncle first moved to the United States of their family. She came 3rd-class with her Father, Mother, older brother and two younger sisters. She is the oldest child in her family. In Ellis Island she passed the test, but her younger brother had an eye disease and the opfficials said he couldn't enter the United States until it was cleared up and he had to go back to his homeland. Rose and her mother and two sisters go to live with her Uncle, Aunt, and step-counsins. Her two step-cousins are her age and look down on her and call her a \\"greenhorn\\" and treat her unkindly. They didn't want them to bring their belongings into their spacious apartment in fear it would dirty everything, draw bugs, and have lice inside. Rose decided to get a job to earn money so someday they would have lodgings of their own. She went to a flower place and quickly quit after some harassment from the boss. After her mother decided to leave after having enough from her sister-in-law and neices, she decided to go home. Rose wanted to stay so badly and yearned to have a life in the United States. She knew if she went back to Ireland the only life ahead of her would be marrying, having children, and taking care of the house. Her mother agreed and her younger sister decided she wanted to stay too. They went to their uncle and got some money and moved into their own place. They looked for a place to rent and they decided to stay with a Russian man. He was skeptical about letting them stay. When they met his daughter, Gussie, she decided that they would and befriended Rose. Gussie worked at the Triangle Shirt Waist company. She brought a sewing machine home one day and taught Rose how to make the shirts. Rose soon started and make many friends. Two of her closest friends names were Rose. She continued to enjoy her life. Her sister didn't want to go to school and she rebelled and worked. Finally Rose gave in and let her work at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory too. She was very happy until the fire that occurred at the factory. From then on her life changed.I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it to anyone. It also had a lot of history in the book along with how the fire affected people and the pooor working conditions in the factories. It also showed how many immigrants were looking for the country with \\"gold paved on the street\\" when all they found were slums with hundreds living in them and not the country they wanted to be in. It showed how people had to work hard to get ahead and some people acutally did. A lot of the people were prejudice about the new immigrants because they felt their jobs would be taken away and that they didn't belong there. Most of the immigrants were together and didn't separate. Back then it was very dangerous. I loved how this book showed history and how a girl coped with one of the most horrible fires in history."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"I've been meaning to read Ashes of Roses for a long time, and I was not disappointed. Auch writes well and makes both her characters and setting believable. 16-year-old Rose, an immigrant from Ireland, is left to care for herself and her sister in early twentieth-century New York, and quickly finds work and friends at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Tragedy befalls her when a fire breaks out at the factory, and Rose is faced with the difficult task of rebuilding her life.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I have a few quibbles. Rose's mother makes a flash decision to leave her and her sister behind in New York while boarding a boat headed back to Ireland, and I thought this was too unrealistic. Women in early twentieth-century America were not safe on their own, and I just can't believe that a mother would leave her children alone in an unfamiliar place and trust that they would find their way back home.

It has lots of historical reference to the Ellis Island immigration period, and is very well written.The main character, Rose Nolan, makes the long voyage with her family to New York City from Ireland. It is a terrible, harsh voyage, and when they finally arrive, are forsed to make a horrible descision. The baby boy of the family is examined, and found to have a minor disease called Trachoma. Her father must take him back to Ireland, and Rose and her sister and mother are left to fend for themselves in the city.When they arrive at their uncle's house, it is made very clear that they are unwelcome. His two daughters act snooty and spoilt, and I can feel Rose's anger and pain as if I were actually there with her.

Traits that I share with her are I have a lot of determination. Also I like to be independent when I have to be. How I am different from her is I didn't live back when she did and I don't know how it is to be an immigrant. These are some ways I am different and alike from her.Yes, I did like this book very much because it showed someone young with courage and someone independent. My favorite part was when Rose's building where she worked burned. The reason why is because she had lots of courage. She also took it very well and got on with her life.

I hadn't even kissed my poor brother goodbye.\\" Sixteen-year-old Rose Nolan and her family come to America looking for a better life. An eye infection on baby Joseph splits the family leaving Rose and twelve-year-old Maureen alone in a new country. Struggling to survive, they work at a shirtwaist factory, and finally are settled. Then, a devastating fire takes everything that they worked for away. \\"Surrounded by pain, tragedy, and ashes, Rose wonders what is left for them in the great land of America\\". Ashes of Roses is overall a good book, though there are some parts that you have to reread to get the thought into your head. It is always entertaining, and very hard to put down. Though there are some sad parts, there is always a happy part to balance everything out. There are some bad people in this story, but that is just life. Mary Jane Auch puts a vivid image into your head of what life was like back then, and how hard it was simply to survive.There are some sad parts in Ashes of Roses, such as when Rose had to leave her baby brother and her Dad at Ellis Island, because baby Joseph had an eye disease and ended up going back home to Ireland. Another sad part was when Mama and Bridget chose to go back to Ireland, because of grief. Rose and Maureen were supposed to go with them, but they both said they wanted to stay in \\"the great land of America.\\" Finally, the last sad part was at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire because so many young girls died trying to escape from the burning building. Most died trying to land on the nets, but when you are nine stories up, nets do not work too well.Though there is sadness, there is always a happy part to balance everything out. One example was when the Nolan family finally got off the ship and entered America. They were so happy to leave the gross, nauseating ship that they did not care about anything else. Another time was when Rose and Maureen finally found a place to stay. Though they had a tiny room in another person's apartment, it felt like the greatest thing in the world to those two. One of the best happy parts in the story was when Rose found Maureen alive after the Triangle Fire, and both were very relieved to know the other was alive. Although they lost several people close to them, Rose and Maureen were thankful to have each other.Lastly, some bad people would be like Mr. Moscovitz. Mr. Moscovitz was Rose's first employer when she worked at a Paper-Rose sweatshop. Mr. Moscovitz mistreated the girls that worked in his shop, and he kissed Rose against her will. Another bad person was Elsa, Rose's aunt. Elsa was very rude when Mama, Bridget, Maureen, and Rose stayed in their family's apartment. Elsa would talk bad things about them behind the Nolan family's back, and one time Rose even listened in on what she was saying. That was the time when Elsa said that they smell like goats, and that the Nolans had not seen a bar of soap in their lives. The last bad person was Trudy, one of Elsa's daughters. Trudy was the person that Elsa would talk to about how bad the Nolans looked, and so on and Trudy would always agree with her mother, no matter what.Ashes of Roses was a great book, hard to put down, and never failed to entertain. As with any other book, there are sad and happy parts. However, in this story, they even each other out. The author, Mary Jane Auch, has created a perfect image of what life was like back then. Therefore, if you are looking for a good read, Ashes of Roses is your best choice.-E.

A must read for all."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"\\"Ashes of Roses\\" was written for teens, and although I am several decades beyond that, I immensely enjoyed this novel. Written in first-person narration, the main character, Rose Nolan, is not only someone through whose eyes we see and experience the tragedy of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, but also tbe reader gains a complete insight into what America's true immigrants of the early 20th century were like. They were very different from today's immigrants, or actually from today's people overall. They didn't wait for their new life to adjust around them, but rather they attempted everything in their power to adjust to their new life - the immigrants of Rose Nolan's day were the true pioneers who helped shape our country. Many didn't give up in the face of adversity, as young Rose Nolan shows us, and that is the foundation upon which true Americanism was built. \\"Ashes of Roses\\" gives readers a look at working conditions of those days, what people were willing to do in order to survive and gain the better life they knew they could have, the immigrants' desire to blend with American ways and people, and also something very important that sorely lacks today - the respect of the young toward their family members as well as individuals of authority in general. In many ways, that in itself is what helped the young immigrants get through what they needed to in order to survive. Their moral upbringing, respect and sensitivity to family is what held them together - a strength we might consider revisiting today.Therefore, as an adult, I enjoyed this book very much. It provides history and a look back at a very different time, which is very worthwhile revisiting because it reminds us, especially amongst our difficult times of today, how it all had started and how far we have really come on so many levels. I recommend this book highly to anyone wishing to discover life of the early 1900s in America, revisit the atrocities of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, and connect with the characters of this book that seem very realistic and alive as though they were in our lives today. The story, as well as the characters, will certainly remain with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"The Nolan family set off from their native Ireland with great hopes for their new life in America.

The alleys are filled with hatred towards immigrants, and nobody recognizes you as an American, just an Irish maggot. From morning to night, you spend your whole day working in a factory for low payments, and then you come home late only to eat a bit of food and get a few hours of sleep before going back to work. Does it seem possible for someone to live like this, as young as age 16?This horrible setting was very common for immigrants coming to America in the nineteenth century. Rose Nolan, the main character of Ashes of Roses, and her sister Maureen have a little, cramped room to sleep, limited amounts of food, a family across the ocean who they haven't written to, and no friends except their friend, Gussela, when they are in America, while many of us take for granted how we have access to lots of food, a good-sized house, a loving family and friends who care about you.The setting takes place in New York, where Rose, Maureen and their whole family had originally lived Limerick, Ireland and decided to come to America to seek a better life. While in the customs line, the youngest child of age 3, Joseph, was told that he couldn't make the voyage to America due to trachoma, an ear infection that was real common back then. Roses father, who is referred to as \\"Da\\", decides to stay in Ireland with Joseph while Rose, her mom and two sisters, Bridget and Maureen go to America. They stayed with their Uncle Patrick and his family for a couple of months, only to find trouble with Patrick's wife and kids. After moving out of Patrick's house, the Nolan family faces a tough decision, which is leaving America, or staying. In the end, Roses mom and sister Bridget voyage back to Limerick.The story provides the reader with many twists and turns when Rose meets a Jewish girl named Gussela and her father. Gussela takes Rose and Maureen in and provides them with a job. The story throws another curve in when tragedy strikes Rose and Gussela, and Rose is faced with another decision.This story has many morals, one of them being to stay strong with your heritage and to hold on to your beliefs even if you are being persecuted or made fun of because your heritage. Rose remains loyal to faith and church despite numerous comments, including people calling her \\"greenie\\" and \\"maggot\\". Another moral is that even though times are tough, you should be fortunate to be alive because accidents happen, and you should be prepared for the worse. I'm not going to tell an accident in the story because I don't want to give the ending away.All in all, Rose overcomes many challenges in America and meets a good friend to help her realize her destiny and teach her how to prosper in America. Ashes of Roses is a book on courage, love, friendship, religion and loyalty, which are all important aspects of life. Even though this story is set in an early timeframe, religious hatred and other themes of this book still exist in today's society. This book is a great story, and an insightful way to understand how religion and courage can lead a person to happiness and success, despite all odds."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"America was the land of opportunity.

This book really changed my perspective on what the world was really like for immigrants coming to this country. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a book that would make them think, enjoys the history of this country, or enjoys reading about courage that was in the heart of every immigrant who came to the United States the way the Nollans did.

Rose Nolan, a teenage girl, had to face this problem. With a horrid uncle and cousins, no place to stay, and work limited, life got very challenging, very quickly. The city is an alien to the girls, along with being in a new country. The people are very different and the way of life is overwhelming. The sisters try to live their lives the way they would if they were back home, in Ireland. Ashes of Roses, by Mary J. Auch, is an exciting story with a vivid setting, courageous characters and a mysterious plot. Every little detail about this book drags you in and brings you back to New York City, 1911.It was the early 1900s in the huge New York City, and immigrants were moving to the United States from countries all over the world! Mary J. Auch, the author, chose the perfect place to host such a breathtaking story. The city is busy and bustling, the wind howls through the streets and the towering sky scrapers watch all sorts of people, rich and poor go by. With opportunities around every corner, the characters never knew what would be ahead of them, providing a great mystery for the reader. Questions such as \\"What will she do next?\\" or \\"Oh no! How is she going to cope?\\" were flooding through my mind throughout the whole story, which is what every audience wants in a good story.The Nolan Family, brave and risky, decided to make the long trip from their hometown in Ireland to the United States. Rose Nolan who is headstrong, courageous and independent, tries to provide a good life for herself, and little sister, Maureen. Maureen is timid but curious, and always stays by her sister's side. Mr. Moscovitz, evil and cruel, frightens Rose beyond belief. Gussie is a friend, a co-worker, and a noble, heroic citizen of New York who always does her best to help others. All of the outgoing and heart-warming characters of Ashes of Roses create a cutting edge story that leaves you at the rim of your seat.The family, who is as strong as an ox, leaves their home and crosses the deep Atlantic Ocean, that could either be a friend or an enemy, and could easily swallow you up whole, to find out that their new country isn't everything they wanted it to be. From trouble in customs, to an awful housing situation, to a dreadful time trying to find work, this family put up with it all, making this novel a fascinating adventure that gives you a taste of what it must have been like for the immigrants 100 years ago! While for the most part, the book was touching and inspirational, the ending wasn't. Auch talked about so many things for the duration of the story that I was dying to know how they would turn out in the end. I finished the book longing for more! I had many unanswered questions and, quite frankly, I was disappointed.Ashes of Roses is a book with a blood curdling, realistic, exciting setting that describes the way the city truly was back then. It contains original characters that display amazing personalities that suit them well, and will most definitely touch your heart. The book also holds a fantastic plot like no other, with problems popping up on every page! This novel is a perfect read for those in middle school. The story is very easy to interpret, with the moral of never giving up on what you believe on, which is inspirational for children to see and understand during the prime time of their lives. Ashes of Roses is a beautiful story that any person would thoroughly enjoy and be very lucky to read.

TESOL students may recognize parts of the story that are familiar even to modern-day immigrants and therefore this novel may also work well for high-level TESOL students."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"I thought this book was heart touching! I came across it and checked it out kind of as a joke. I read it for a class project and found myself not wanting to stop. I found it very interesting to read about the life of a foriegner coming into another country. It's about an irish family who struggles on a journey coming into New York. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I was never bored when reading it. I think if you read this book you would be very fascinated."},{"Title":"Ashes of Roses","review":"I bought this book as a gift.

You will learn a lot about immigration in the early 1900's, the Triangle Shirt Waist Fire, sweat shops, life in New York. The story doesn't have much of the ring of emotional authenticity. I don't doubt that the author's facts are true and her topic is well-researched, but I don't get much of a deeper understanding of who these characters are and why they behave the way they do. I have the sense of the author behind the scene pulling the strings to make the story turn out the way it does. The parallels drawn to 9/11 are eerie, but the fire was a very different event."},{"Title":"Play Quilts: Creative Activity Quilts for Kids","review":"This book is an absolute &quot;must have&quot; for anyone who knows and cares for a little one! The author Kristin Kolstad Addison has designed five fabulous quilts with a a lot of accessories for children to play with. The guidelines in the book are easy to understand, the patterns easy to follow. The author has included quite a few tips to make it even easier.A few weeks ago I was able to see two of the quilts &quot;live&quot;, and they were even more charming than in the pictures. These quilts are suitable for the floor as well as the wall, but are not meant as interior decorations: Do not expect that your little one will leave these quilts alone! Before you know what happened, the gift you made from one of the projects in this book will generate a lot of new adventures. Or even better - make the quilt together with the recipient. Then you'll have more fun, too! The quilts are equally suitable for boys and girls."},{"Title":"Play Quilts: Creative Activity Quilts for Kids","review":"This book is quite simply fantastic! I am currently half-way through making the Pirate Ship quilt, and my daughters (ages 5 + 3) are having so much fun picking out the fabric, buttons, embellishments, and watching me at the sewing machine. The patterns in this book are fabulous -- I plan on making the Lunar Landing quilt next, especially since I've found some perfect fabric for it and have enjoyed making the Pirate Quilt thus far. I'm an intermediate-level quiltmaker in a local quilt guild, but this book explains everything so even a beginner can have excellent results. I cannot say enough good things about these patterns. Ingenious, really: the patterns incorporate movable/ removable items as well as permanent items, so the child can truly play with the quilt. Imagination and creativity at its finest! Hats off to the author and designer! Well done!"},{"Title":"Play Quilts: Creative Activity Quilts for Kids","review":"Making quilts for babies and children is of course one of the most satisfying ways quilters can show their love of family and friends.

A young boy, Tal, journeys with a wise, old collector of stories, Noom-Zor-Noom, who must succeed in finding a story that would delight a young child. Noom-Zor-Noom must tell his story to a King who has lost his only son. The magical golden door conceals the secret of the king's lost son. Only a story that would delight a child, like Tal, will open the door and return the king's son. This marvelous book contains the story of their journey to the kingdom as well as all the stories Noom-Zor-Noom has collected. A talking, white donkey with bells in her ears, Millitinkle, accompanies the boy and the old man. This trio and their unforgettable story has enchanted every elementary school class I have taught, as well as my own children. If you teach or have children in grades 2-5, read this story to them at least twice, and you will have given them a wonderful gift."},{"Title":"Tal, his marvelous adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom","review":"My mother introduced this book to me when I was in third grade, only about 7 years ago, she would read a chapter to me and my sister every night, one night she let me read a chapter by myself while she went to sleep. 3 o'clock in the morning, I finished the book. I hadn't been able to put it down. This book is a wonderful whirlwind of fantasy and magic that even me and my sister, 74 years after it was originally published, absolutly adore.

Even my youngest, age 5 at the time we read it, begged for me to continue. The chapters are long for a bedtime story but there are good stopping places to make it possible to read part of a chapter at a time. The kids still talk about the characters in the story a year or more later! It is a bit predictable as to how it will turn out. My children loved that their predictions were correct and that only added to their enjoyment."},{"Title":"Tal, his marvelous adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom","review":"My children loved this book - ages 9,8, and 5 all couldn't wait until we could sit and read the next chapter.

His mother had read it to him. As I grew up, I re-read it from time to time just to be absorbed yet again in the fantastic world Paul Fenimore Cooper created for a new rendition of \\"The Lost Prince\\" plot. Interwoven through their magical travels are these incredible vignettes, as Noom-Zor-Noom tells Tal stories he has collected over the years, looking for one that might please the lost prince of Troom.The baby prince was kidnapped from his cradle by a great bird when he was an infant, and hasn't been seen since. But a magical oracle the king has instructed him to create the storytelling contest, and his son would be returned to him. Noom-Zor-Noom has traveled the world finding the best stories he can, and is bringing them back written in tiny golden ink on a black crystal carried on the back of his beautiful, white donkey, Millitinkle. When Tal asks for his story, he finds out how she came to be all white and able to talk, a wonderful tale in itself.The vignettes throughout the book are fairy tales in the classic sense, but are not derivative of those we're familiar with from Grimm and others. Instead, Cooper weaves an entirely new tapestry of rich authenticity that is at once familiar, and also fantastically alien.The book is illustrated throughout with marvelous woodcuts, an illustration style popular in the early part of the 20th century, but not seen much today. They are rich and beautiful additions to the words of the story.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with a child who enjoys wonder, even if that child is fully grown in body. It is a beautiful book, and I cannot understand why it has so long been out of print. Maybe, someday, it will be re-released to the joy of future generations."},{"Title":"Tal, his marvelous adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom","review":"My second grade teacher, Ms. Garretz, read this to the class and then we performed it as a play.

After grabbing them (for MY children... seriously... why do you doubt me?) I began to try out other books from their catalog. This book, which I'd never heard of before, was my first Purple House Press disappointment.As my review title indicates, this book uses the familiar Arabian Nights or 1001 Nights structure: a frame story justifies the telling of a number of otherwise unrelated and unconnected stories. However, while the Arabian Nights contain stories of widely varying origin, widely varying length, widely varying styles, widely varying quality, and widely varying (though unknown) authorship, all the stories in \\"Tal\\" are the work of one man and are mostly of about the same length, which results in a certain overall \\"sameness\\" that grows irritating. In addition the magic in Mr. Cooper's stories is of the \\"Anything Can Happen For Any Reason Or No Reason And Usually Does\\" variety. Plus it doesn't help that Mr. Cooper's stories for the most part not only lack anything resembling a \\"moral\\", which is quite forgivable, but also for the most part lack anything resembling a \\"point\\", which really is not. That I was able to guess correctly the \\"surprise ending\\" immediately I heard the premise without even trying was another negative. In short my reaction at the end of each chapter was something on the order of, \\"That's it?\\" I kept waiting to be enchanted, but I never was. Maybe small children will be able to get more out of it; I shall try it on my own at some point; but I'm not a great believer in the idea that something that bores an adult will fascinate a small child. In my experience what fascinates my children also fascinates me, at least the first dozen or so times!Ruth Reeves' striking illustrations cannot save it, and frankly IMHO the best part of the book is Henry Cooper's new introduction, which among other things recounts the from today's point of view utterly silly attack on fairy tales by child psychologists after WWII, which lasted into the '70s. If you disagree with my opinion and own an older edition, this informative new introduction is reason enough to purchase the Purple House reprint ofTal: His Marvelous Adventures With Noom-Zor-Noom."},{"Title":"Thunder on the Right (Coronet Books)","review":"Perhaps because this is Mary Stewart's only narrative written in the third person, I thought &quot;Thunder on the Right&quot; ranked in the lower third when compared to the author's twenty other novels of romantic suspense. Upon re-reading it --actually listening to the Chiver's Unabridged audio, I realize it is just as well-crafted albeit sprinkled too liberally with adjectives as any of the other more well known Stewart titles.In particular, without the compelling tell-all 1st person narrative usually facilitated by Stewart, the heroine of the tale, one Jennifer Silver, comes across as exactly what she is--a 22 year old with the scant experience of any young girl coming straight out of the sheltered privledged environment of upper class Briton--instead of the usual intrepid/curious/resourceful traveler of the other stories.Here, Jennifer has traveled to the wild southwestern portion of France, where the Pyrenees form the country's natural boundary from Spain. Excited to meet up with her half-French cousin, Gillian, she is utterly shocked to encounter Stephen, a music student acquaintance of her father with whom she had a brief but platonic flirtation years prior to coming to France. As with the other Stewart novels, romance comes secondary, if not thirdly in importance when weighed against the circumstances of the mystery within the plotline. And here,it tends to be a little melodramatic--Stephen, the brooding musician reining in his feelings of passion for Jennie, and Jennie, herself, not even realizing what passion is.Far better is the novel's main thrust--for when Jennie attempts to contact her cousin at the local convent where the half-French girl is deciding upon a religious vocation, Jennie discovers rather abruptly from the convent's bursar that her cousin has died and has been buried within the convent walls. Shocked but by no means mentally incapacitated, Jennie realizes that Dona Francisca's story does not make sense, as Jennie knows one or two things about her cousin that renders the explanation totally invalid. Here Jennifer takes the initiative as do all the Stewart heroines--hell bent to discover the truth with no thought to her own safety. The path she follows is a treacherous one, involving the bursar, her plans for the convent and illegal doings that make the locale's proximity to Spain extremely convenient.If you have the opportunity, listen to the audio book, Harriet Walker's command of voices help convey the characters of each of the novel's persona with startling reality. This novel, I believe to be overlooked, but don't make that mistake, do read it and savor its passionate story--just undermine the romance."},{"Title":"Thunder on the Right (Coronet Books)","review":"\\"A highly charged romantic thriller\\" - New York Herald TribuneThe sheltered Oxford-raised, quiet and reserved young Jennifer Silver journeys to the High Pyrenees in search of her half-French cousin who has been recuperating in a convent. A WWII-wounded former student of her professor father and brilliant musician follows her there for his own personal reasons. Just as they are rejoined, they become caught up in intricate webs of danger and criminal intrigue.From the back cover- \\"She had come to the convent - a brooding cluster of ancient buildings nestled deep in the wild upper reaches of the French Pyrenees - to find her young cousin, Gillian. But the Convent of Our Lady of the Storms was not like others.

Searching for the truth meant trouble. She did not know, until too late, it also meant ...murder.\\"As always, Mary Stewart's settings are so spectacular and described in such detail that I can see, smell and touch as clearly as if I were there as well.

She looks forward to a nice holiday, but she is also there to visit her cousin Gillian, a woman who is about to take her religious vows at a convent. Of course, everything goes wrong. For one thing, Jennifer is told that Gillian is dead, buried within the convent's grounds. This strange and unexpected news doesn't feel right in more ways than one. Things just don't add up. Is Gillian even dead? She will not leave the haunting convent until she uncovers the truth. In the meantime, there's Stephen, a brooding former student of her father's, a brilliant musician with some unresolved issues of his own...At first, I had my doubts about Thunder on the Right. After all, it is Stewart's first romantic suspense novel I read with a third-person narrative. Her first-person novels are very well written and it took me a while to get used to this new and unexpected format. To be honest, it had a somewhat slow beginning. However, the more I read, the more I couldn't put it down. Mary Stewart is a great writer, regardless of the narrative style, period. There are many surprises, many twists, and Stewart adds her signature flavor to it all. As with the other novels, there is some romance in this, but, like all other novels I've read, it is not the central storyline. Romance takes a back seat every time in her stories in favor of the suspense and gothic atmosphere, something I love about this author. I very much enjoyed Thunder on the Right. This is one of Stewart's more underrated efforts, a sad thing, for I found it just as intriguing as her other books. Well, maybe not as good as The Ivy Tree or Madam, Will You Talk?, but definitely worth getting into. If you're a fan of this author, do not make the mistake of overlooking this one. She is quickly becoming a must-read-all-of-her-backlist author, replacing the wonderful Daphne du Maurier, whose books I have devoured for the past couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Thunder on the Right (Coronet Books)","review":"Another winner in her long list of published books.

Stewart rarely writes in the third person, so in this way the book was an interesting departure. She also describes not only suspense and romance but she has a clear love of landscape as well as flora and fauna. I could almost picture the French countryside and visualize the Pyrenees mountains. It's a romantic suspense novel, meant for entertainment and enjoyment, and that's exactly what it offers. Of course, if you're not used to very descriptive writers you may find her books hard to get into, but believe me, they are worth it. Jennifer Silver is a young, naive but not unappealing heroine and Stephen Masefield is an adequate hero. And the mystery of what happened to Jenny's cousin Gillian is quite intriguing. Not the best Mary Stewart book but still a good one."},{"Title":"Thunder on the Right (Coronet Books)","review":"Like Mary Stewart books .. this one is a great book ... quick delivery ... no problems with the quality of the book ...

It is hard to find the Good News Translation for sale so I am glad to have found these."},{"Title":"Good News Bible With Deuterocanonicals/apocrypha-GNT","review":"I specifically wanted the (TEV) Today's English Version and you sent me the (GNT) Good New's Translation. I find that disturbing."},{"Title":"Good News Bible With Deuterocanonicals/apocrypha-GNT","review":"This is probably one of the best up to date beginners Bible of its day, even though it still lacks major explanations of verses all over and has serious errors. The New Testament used for this is also very bad, but for a one time through first level understanding, it is going to increase faith big time and hopefully prompt you to study for yourself each word as it was translated and finding better translations of certain verses to go along side this one in your collection. Unfortunately, scholarship is lacking heavily so you cannot have just one bible that has every meaning with insights of God and who HE is and have it understandable and complete. The Septuagint text is talked about in this but not actually used much at all. There is also two manuscripts to the Septuagint that is needed as well. I have many bibles I carry around to have access to essentials. Everyone's Bible needs more left out books to be included, as in the Original Septuagint (NETS) plus Apostolic Bible Polyglot and The Dead Sea Scrolls and Masoretic text of modern Hebrew properly translated into English and the Targumim. All of our Bibles are not translated as deeply or correctly as they could and should be. This version with the so called title of \\"Deutero-canonical/Apocrypha\\" is excellent since it has these in here but don't be fooled by the title which is man made to try to dim down it's authority! This bible should be given out in this modern age of 2008 as people's 1st Bible. I am aware though that like every Bible version in the originals and English, it compromises on several verses not making them all fully accurate or even there at all!This Bible will get your feet wet so you can drop down into the living waters fully immersed later! Remember this version is so useful even though it is flawed a lot too; but is clear and has the most books that I have ever seen in one published book known as \\"The Holy Scriptures\\". It still lacks about 7 more books I include in my canon. After all, everyone really should study to see that sinful men made up different rules of how many books should be contained as divine and why we have the books in scripture that we do. It is amazing to find out that God in HIS sovereignty let corrupt men make different collections of what they each consider truth. So we each have the authority through the Holy Spirit to use discernment for ourselves as to what God said was divine. Ezra the prophet wrote in 2nd Esdras 14 that God gave 94 books as divine but to only make public 24, which is the same books we have today as the Old Testament. We don't even know if this collection total of 94 even includes the New Testament. It might since scholars say that the final product with all 16 chapters was not complete until 100 A.D., 600 years or so after Ezra's lifetime! Either way we still have not found all 94!!! So we need to collect all we can and not neglect any pieces of the puzzle HE made for us!This is an excellent starter Bible for children on up to everyone else growing in their faith as is the Catholic Reference Bible NLT. And if anyone did any true research themselves, with the understanding of History, archeology and the discernment of the Holy Spirit, they would come to the same conclusion that Dr. Andy Tryon and I and many others did, which is that there are so many more promises we need from HIM that evil used inside of men's brains, have taken away from us, robbing us of more abundance in life. I was hesitant also at first to accept more books to our mainstream protestant Canon of 66 books until I found out that the 1st protestants and puritans had them and during the reformation, people paid with their lives to get all of these into the hands and souls of as many others as they could! Followers of truth don't die for lies, only false religions murder others and themselves in the name of some pagan, false non existent god, like Islam on 9-11-01! The difference is that these men acted selfishly while Christian martyrs died selflessly! The Reformation and history farther back with its archeology prove all of this! Look it up! After I prayed and deeply studied all of the 1st English Bibles, I learned that there should be many more chapters and books and even verses in our Old Testament and even a few more books and chapters and verses in the New Covenant! Write me and I'd be glad to share them with you for free by email!!! Sadly no other scholar does this or even tells you about this except a rare few! I warn you all that it will be painful and shocking to your nicely packaged mental box of the 66 canon we have today! It is not for everyone, but one day will be when Christ returns and gives us the WORD in its Final flawless form of Ancient original Hebrew! This will all be so eye opening and worth all of the opposition and persecution from the rest of the ignorant hypocritical churches that oppress this.(See How We got Our Bible By chuck Missler-DVD for more info on how the Bible really did evolve by gaining and losing information!... Just don't accept his research that he tells you all on the canon only being 66 books with the Apocrypha and Pseudopigrapha being completely false. He made major errors on that which is obviously what this whole article is about! If the Good News Bible did not have the apocrypha or notes in the back, it would be very poor and hardly worth getting. I usually recommend the NLT for new beginners but this is very close too, in its being simple English for modern Americans to understand thoroughly. Back to Missler's dvd and his presentation, he has no backings of history or archeology or internal scriptural evidence to prove these books are false or not divine! I have much evidence for every book I consider canon and will continue to do so if I find more books to be back in the canon. Don't listen to this part of his dvd because the books I use for my canon have been researched well and legitimately and have not been proven false, using quality info! The Apocrypha especially, i find to be 100% true and consider as scripture along with 1 Enoch, 2nd Esdras(4th Esdras in Latin Vulgate) and the book of Jasher. I have much more evidence that proves that these other books and chapters and verses should be in there, but time constrains me on here. So if you want specific info, email me anytime! OR (See www.Drandytryon.com then click on \\"The Teaching\\" look for Apocrypha studies and Enoch) Anyways, this Good News Bible should be everyone's 1st Bible along with the NLT Catholic reference edition, along with a copy of 1 Enoch, Jasher, 1st and 2nd Clement, the Epistle of Barnabas, Epistle to the Laodiceans, Acts 29 and Mark 16:14 bonus extended verse in the New Revised Standard Version for you to be much, much closer to the entire and original canon that thorough research shows us the 1st century and 2nd century churches would have had!! *Note on the Catholic Reference edition; it is wonderful but lacks 2nd Esdras, and the other books left out mentioned above and should not be interpreted through the lenses of the Catholic glasses of doctrines that have been proven false by history and scripture itself, hurting those precious people who go to those places seeking truth and are being deceived, like most to all of my family! I care too much about people to see anyone fall into heresy. The text, from what I have studied so far, is not influenced by the corrupt teachings in the Latin Vulgate. There is an older Latin text that is closer to the Greek Septuagint but it is difficult to find. The Catholic reference edition just reads clearly and has more content getting you closer to the total and original canon that God has for all of us who are truly wise and seeking knowledge with HIS understanding. Don't worry, I would never try to teach false doctrines or advocate the Catholic church either. It is one of the Most Satanic churches out there that leads people into idolatry and religion instead of a relationship with a living spirit who heals and regenerates us to the abundant life! (See Jacob Prasch, Dave Hunt or any Calvary chapel pastors for exposing lies in Catholocism, I recommend \\"Catholicism verses Christianity\\" DVD set conference at Calvary Chapel Tri-city in Tempe Arizona. But again, even they error on the canon and pre trib rapture doctrine. Just ignore the part on the Apocrypha question and answer dvd in it, because they give wrong, unvalidated info on the canon and they just disreguard any other book as being divine!) One thing I have learned in all my studies of the faith and all of the Pastors, churches and bibles, I observe and visit, is that everyone misses some truth somewhere, even me, but I desperately try to stay lies free and especially what I teach, knowing that teachers have stricter judgment as James 3:1 says. So please let me know if you are convinced that I am wrong somewhere, if you have legitimate info and canon history along with textual evidence itself. If people really want more of God, then they are going to have to get the knowledge of God from many sources and reconstruct what other men destructed, as I am doing! One must use real historians and theologians, Hebrew writings, archeology and scripture itself for true examination. It will bear witness to your spirit of truth if you have found more truth as scripture. Stay open to all of God and remember: faith is the conviction of things not seen, when you act in the right direction on HIS promises, for every different situation which is confirmed by the Holy Spirit's presence causing more true love and freedom to exist! Unfortunately there isn't one pastor or scholar or bible or church that I have found yet, that has all of this. My wife and I feel the spiritual urgency though, to start our own ministry to share this with as many as are willing and want it so we can all bear good and much fruit! We have to wait though, for God's Spirit to send us. Everyone is welcome now though, to receive and share what we have learned up to this point, either by email or meeting up in person. I am also making a one year chronological bible reading schedule and will have that ready to email out for free by the end of 2009!! All of my research is free. I long for everyone to have truth without charge, with anything I can afford to. I will probably have to charge though, for my version of the Bible when it comes out for publishing costs and ink and paper. You don't want to miss out on any of this! This schedule will be the most complete one in the world, I guarantee it! Until we start our church, we always offer our home for any true \\"Koinonia\\" (Fellowship) now, also. Feel free to contact me anytime at Answersingenesis@live.com or google Patrick Ramsdell in Columbus Ohio or Phoenix Arizona if my email changes or something..."},{"Title":"Good News Bible With Deuterocanonicals/apocrypha-GNT","review":"I do like the Good News Bible but there definitely needs to be something in the description of this item that indicates it is a 'travel size' edition.

Very lovely and cherished, but ultimately not read much. My next Bible, given to me at age 14 at confirmation, was a Revised Standard version, read a little more often, and used for bible study later on.But, when I found Christ at 16, I was given a Good News new testament, and that is what I read and what grounded me in my understanding of what being a Christian was all about.The difference? It was readable.For in-depth study, certainly use the (loftier?) deeper translations to hone your understanding. But remember, Martin Luther's first translation of the Latin texts into German was not into the Hoch Deutche of the day, but into the common language, so the everyday person (the Delberts, if you will) could understand God's word first-hand. And thus the Reformation grew.The best Bible is a read Bible, in whatever version works best for you.

Although in some respects the author sacrifices depth for brevity the points that the Rabbi makes are still poignant. Structurally, Adler takes us through the byzantine world of the Talmud by illustrating how this encylopedic work is divided. The first division is between the Gemara and Mishna.To put it concisely the Mishna is a commentary on the Torah and the Gemara is a commentary on the Mishna.The second division is between Halacha and Agada. Halacha is jewish law similar to that of Sharia in Islam and Agada is about the mystical folklore that has come to define the spiritual realm of the Talmud.One of the most important points Elder brings up, that maybe of interest to those engaged in Christian-Jewish Dialouge, is on Rabbinical teaching differs largely from Church Teaching.1. Credo Quia Absurdum Est. Translated is \\"I believe that which is unreasonable,\\" However in Judaism the learned Gentile is to be honored above that of an ignorant high priest. Furthermore the empasis on the study of Scripture has \\"helped keep judaism intellectually vigorous and alert.\\"2 Extra Eccleasiaam Nulla Salus, (No salvation outside of the church) Alder contends that the attempt to translate this into Hebrew is not feasible because words such as \\"Salvation\\" and \\"church\\" are epistemolgically rooted in Church theology. Instead the concept of Salvation isnt limited to an institution nor a paticular religion. In fact the inclusvity and appreciation of followers of other faiths is expressed in the Rabbinical phrase Hasideri Urmot Ha-Olam. Tanna D bei Eliyahu p. 48 testifys to this sense of religious pluralism.3. Another intersting point of religious intersection between Christian theology and Rabbinical teaching brought up by the author is amplified in Romans 13:1 where the biblical proscriptions seemingly suggest that Kings and all forms of Government are from God. Although the Jewish concept Dina D'amalchuta dina might seem to be in agreement with Paul it isnt. The laws of the land are to be obeyed only inso far as their teaching does not harm their religion or is not constiutionally constructed.Lastly Alder argues that The Talmud is not only subjected to reason nor Passion but is a harmonization of the two. This is the meaning behind the Deutronimic verse you must worship God with all your Mind and Heart which is physically symbolized by the Tefilin."},{"Title":"The Color of the Snow","review":"Unlike the editorial review from Kirkus, I found humor this book and did not consider it &quot;intellectual&quot;. It does require effort to see the relationships between the 21 semi-independent chapters which constitute the narrative. The story can be summarized very simply: boy born mishappen wins heart of grandfather; father returns from war shell-shocked; father dies; years later mother dies; 30 year old boy move in with distant relative; questions of intelligence, language and identity arise; story ends with suggestion boy is perhaps also author.Along with way the story is told with variable success and with items of symbolic meanings reappearing with limited success at providing continuity. An example of discontinuity: we leave a young child who speaks a private language with his grandfather. We jump to a thirty year old who needs a guardian and an assisted care living arrangement ...Whose guardian successfully gets him a job in a movie theater. While many of the juxtapositions around Jakob are specially intended to force the reader to rethink Jakob's identity, this particular jump feels as if the author himself does not understand the transition.An occasional chapter, such as the story of the young glazier, set up symbols - in this case mirrors - that add little to the scenes in which mirrors become crucial elements of the story. In a story as tightly written with regards to ambigious identity, this struck me as a flaw.So why four stars? The book succeeds at simultaneously presenting alternative views of who Jakob is and what he is. In the private language he first learned and in the film script without words, the book explores language in an interesting way. In the cumplusive analysis of train schedules, mirrors, motionlessness etc., the book explores the boundary of experienced world and &quot;real world out there&quot;.Definately not a perfect novel, but a good first novel worth your time."},{"Title":"RAGNAROK. THE AGE OF FIRE & GRAVEL.","review":"Ignatius Donnelly was born in 1831 Philadelphia and became a lawyer in 1852. Married in 1855, they moved to Minnesota. When Minnesota became a state in 1857 Donnelly was elected lieutenant governor. In 1862 he was elected to Congress for three terms. He campaigned for Greenback policies and served in the state senate. Donnelly wrote \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Ragnarok\\" which became sensational best sellers and made him wealthy. \\"The Great Cryptogram\\" analyzed Shakespeare's plays to prove they were written by Francis Bacon. Two novels dealt with a fascist takeover of America \\"Caesar's Column\\", and racial intolerance \\"Dr. Huguet\\". In 1887 he became a founder of the Populist Party, and was nominated for Vice-President in 1898. He died in Minneapolis on 1/1/1901. His politics, oratory, and literature marked his originality and talents; his writings are now out of fashion.Donnelly studied the legends and mythologies of Hindus, Persians, Britons, Chinese, Greeks, Scandinavians, the North, Central, and South American Indians, Arabians, Babylonians, and Egyptians that told of disaster by fire, hail, frost, darkness, changes in climates, and tales of dragons and other monsters. Donnelly claimed these reflected a visit from a giant comet, and the proof lay in The Drift of unstratified deposits which came from a cometic collision rather than glacial movement. Donnelly suggested a comet could have caused Old Testament events such as the destruction of the wicked cities, the sun standing still, and stones falling from the heavens. Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods (or Rain of Rocks), commanded the interest of general readers, and the admiration (if not credence) of the scientific world. Donnelly, a good lawyer, argued his case well with all the evidence available to him at the time. Decades later Immanuel Velikovsky would publish his version of this theory.The surface of our planet consists of layers of sand, clay, and gravel (over stratified rock). It contains no trace of fossils. The pre-glacial world saw tropical plants growing near the Arctic Circle in Miocene times. Herds of elephants and other animals lived in Europe. Donnelly says a sudden cataclysm brought severe cold, and left deposits of sand, clay, and gravel; fissures were created in earth's crust. He explains why this was caused by a comet striking earth, the heat vaporizing the seas to create clouds, rain, and snow. Rocks on the surface would be smashed and crushed. This collision was preserved in the legends of mankind. The Great Lakes suggest points of impact. Vast clouds, and debris in the sky, would create a \\"nuclear winter\\".Donnelly says myths and legends are ultimately based on some fact. Finding the same legends among different nations suggests a common experience in prehistoric times. These myths of a cataclysm imply the existence of mankind; they are in accord with the facts known to science and from deep excavations. The legends coincide in this: a monster in the air; the heat; the fire; the cave-life; the darkness; the return of light. Donnelly respectfully suggests the Book of Job is the oldest in the Bible, and gives a new viewpoint to the beginning of Genesis.Donnelly answers objections in Part IV Chapter IV. The position of certain constellations in Job estimates this time as 30,000 years ago. Donnelly suggests the fire that seemed to drop out of the heavens and set a number of fires in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois on October 8, 1871 was the result of Bielas' comet. There is a universal feeling that regards comets with fear; Revelation (chapter xii, v.3) is a symbol of a comet brushing the earth. Why would God permit such a calamity? Perhaps what was destroyed was not worth preserving? It could be God's plan to punish the wicked of this world, says Donnelly."},{"Title":"RAGNAROK. THE AGE OF FIRE & GRAVEL.","review":"This is a facsimile edition of Donnelly's 1883 Ragnarok, a book that pioneered the notion that a comet struck Earth in ancient times. It followed his sensational 1882 book on Atlantis. Unlike much 19th century scientific writing, this is entertaining reading, blending the geology of the day with legends of many peoples. In doing so he created a pattern followed by many later speculative writers and pseudo-scientists. A must-read for anyone interested in how theories with very little real supporting evidence capture the public imagination. The 12-page introduction to this 1970 edition (first by University Books, Inc.) discusses Donnelly within the literary and scientific context of his era. 452 pages, indexed, with a number of charts and etchings of artifacts."},{"Title":"RAGNAROK. THE AGE OF FIRE & GRAVEL.","review":"if you're any kind of perfectionist. i have no idea how this can happen, but this seems to be one of those print-on-demand books. i guess they took the text file of the paperback edition and did not bother to set margins that would match the paperback, so you get footnotes that are in the middle of pages instead of at the bottom of the page, where they should be and where they are in the paperback. then we have...and this escapes me as to how exactly it was done...sentences that endand then begin again..........with the double space gap and sometimes an indent.absolutely amazing.then, where there should apparently be illustrations...there aren't!!! that is particularly annoying. now i'll have to buy a different edition and, hopefully, i'll be able to get the pics.ok, i'm done with my rant about that. being someone who spent a large part of my life word processing, this kind of thing just irks me no end. how can someone NOT see what's going on?i enjoyed the book, though. having just finished \\"worlds in collision\\", this was a great follow-up, although i probably should've read it first. both books have great theories as to what's been going on on Earth and, if you're not one of those people who are all hung up on what \\"science\\" says is truth, you will be reading this book 'til well into the night. i love speculation and alternate theories, and who really are we to say what is \\"truth\\"?"},{"Title":"RAGNAROK.

It was my first taste of Science Fiction and 23 years later I still remember it! It is set on a world where everyone lives in a huge domed city which is full of broken machines that no one remembers how to fix. People live in gangs where anyone in their twenties is considered an &quot;old&quot;. They suvive by scavenging out of ancient stores. Whole areas of the city are abandoned. Food is running out, and the oxygen makers are breaking down. And children are following a mysterious rhyming man and vanishing. The heroine of the story is a young girl, a &quot;little&quot;, who longs to see what is outside the dome, even though &quot;olds&quot; say everything is dead. So she follows the rhyming man...This story of a future Earth is a bit scary for young readers, but is very haunting and thought provoking for more mature kids. This story is one that many adults would do well to read as well. It may very well be our own future!!"},{"Title":"Outside","review":"I read a friend's copy of this book when I was in early grade school and I have been searching for a copy ever since.

Many of the images are derived from traditional Wicca -- the Black Man who is also the Fool and also the Wise One and who leads his followers to freedom is only the foremost among them. In many ways this book is like a zen koan -- the puzzle or joke that has no straight answer, meditation on which leads to illumination.

His voice and manner are so reassuring that when I go out, I leave his symposium tapes that I bought on his website on for my dog.

However, it's not any different than any other book about the Pekingese breed. The information is very generic, and if you search around personal sites online or just visit breeder's pages, you'll find the same info. At points, I felt like the book became a generic dog care book, giving advice for any breed of dog. It isn't peke-specific enough. For example, they should've had a chart that listed how many calories of food or vitamins pekes need at different life stages and weather. Pekes may be small dogs, but they are heavier and require different nutrition than other breeds. One would expect a book titled &quot;Pekingese&quot; to be tailored to a Peke's needs but the info that is provided for feeding can also be found in a book for any other dog. Do you think a peke needs the same nutrition as a Dalmation? No. It's a good book for those that have never had a dog before, or don't have the slightest clue about the Pekingese. However, if you are already a peke-companion and were looking for helpful peke-specific info, this book doesn't provide info that you don't already know."},{"Title":"Pekingese (Barron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals)","review":"This is an excellent book for a first time Pekingese owner!!

He has always hated to be brushed but since reading the portion on how to brush him he has calmed some and allows brushing for short periods of time now. I was surprised to learn that Peke's do not transfer their loyality well. This is the third Peke we have owned and the only one we have gotten as a puppy. The other two were very loyal after a short period of time. One was an older dog which we knew was blind in one eye but learned later that he was blind in both eyes.

They assert that the human animal is built for physical pleasure like no other creature on earth, and that social and legal acceptance are gradually turning Western society into a culture that better supports our loving nature.Those essays constitute only a small portion of this book, however. The larger part alternates samples of visual and literary art that celebrate the beauty of sexuality. These works cover every era from classical Greece to the current era. Occasional examples of unfamiliar works by familiar artists (including Picasso, Munch, and Matisse) might surprise some viewers - these works come from parts of the artists' ouvres that Mrs. Grundy would prefer to keep hidden.All of the artworks appear in black and white. This works well for line drawings and woodcuts originally meant for that kind of display. Paintings originally in color lose a lot, though, and some reproductions aren't the sharpest. And, of course, there's always reason to want more of everything. On the whole, it's not a must-have for any collection, but still easy to enjoy.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Art of Lovemaking","review":"Great book- This book was given to me by my pastors wife. It's very informative and contains lots of useful information about sex, lovemaking, health, relationships and pornography. The book is well illustrated and I found it very pleasurable to read. The book stays away from using graphic terms or blunt words, yet the author gets her message across. This is the type of book, you can easily hand down to a daughter or loved one who just turned 18."},{"Title":"The Art of Lovemaking","review":"This book is well written and makes for good reading material. Alot of the sexual books written today are crude and in bad taste. This book is written in a tactful manner. It's well illustrated and gives good informative tips."},{"Title":"The Art of Lovemaking","review":"The seller was great, sent the book as promised. This book is a colaboration of love making art, and the history behind it. Lots of pictures, paintings and sculptures. Not what i was looking for."},{"Title":"The Art of Lovemaking","review":"One of these days, someone will write a magnificently-defended and immaculately artful defense of sex as being disgusting, repulsive, hateful, depressing, and just plain ugly. Which, after all, is how it probably is to the majority of the people who don't even leave the lights on to see what's happening when they go through with it. Until then, well-intentioned but soft-headed and ultimately ephemeral books like this are only going to be able to show half the picture, no matter how many soft-focus shots or cutesy-pie &quot;poetic&quot; captions they use."},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"This book was written as a listing of books for children, of many topics. I want to make it clear that this is not just a book list of children's fiction. There are different books on the market that list only works of fiction. This book includes lists of books for these subjects: animals, art and architecture, bible/spiritual teaching, biography, crafts, hobbies, domestic arts, dance, drama, geography, history, horticulture, humor, language, literature (in several reading levels), poetry, rhymes, math, misc. music, outdoor activities other than group games, physical education, reference, science, technology, and special days and seasons.This book was written by a homeschooler who is using the Charlotte Mason method. The Charlotte Mason method uses real books also known as living books, (not textbooks or boxed curriculum). This method allows the individual to use many different books written by people who are passionate about the subject to learn about a particular topic or unit of study. Living books are great books, books that capture the attention or imagination of the reader. Living books are not boring or uninspiring. I appreciate having this reference guide available to me, a pre-sorted list written by a user of the Charlotte Mason method, someone on the lookout for quality and inspiring books. It helps sift out the exceptional books from the unremarkable.OK so this was published in 1987 and any book list that is written poses the risk of immediately containing out of print books. The fact that this book is 14 years old (at the time I of this writing) adds to the possibility that some of these books will be out of print. I see that other reviewers don't like book lists that contain out of print books. I appreciate a listing that contains out of print books, because besides shopping for new books, I also shop at local used book stores, online used book store and online out of print book stores. It is helpful to know about a great book and be on the lookout for that at a used bookstore (or by simply doing an online search for that title). As a homeschooling parent, our family library is growing and I do appreciate the ability to buy used books for sometimes as low as one or two dollars, and end up with better quality book than some currently-in-print, more expensive, new book. Let's not also forget that our public libraries are full of out-of-print books, and that library used book sales are another source of finding great books that are out-of-print. In defense of the author, to further complicate matters books come in and out of print...one never knows when a previously out of print book will go back into circulation.If you are looking for a book of children's fiction lists that deletes out of print books, see \\"The Read Aloud Handbook\\"-with each revision the author deletes the out of print books and only includes the in print books (at the time of the printing, of course).I appreciate the detailed index, which allows easy scanning by title or author, something that not all book list-books include.I found this interesting reading and went right through it, cover to cover, with pencil in hand to circle those that I thought our family would like to read. I also found that this book inspired me to think about introducing different topics to my children that I would not have thought about, such as studying the life of colonial American children or learning about what pioneer Americans ate for food.A great reference book at a low cost!"},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"This book is arranged by subject and reading level.

I love Charlotte Mason's idea of living books, books that are not textbooks and that are well-written and appealing to children without being \\"twaddle.\\" This is an excellent resource for any parent, teacher, or children's librarian. My children have loved the books we've chosen from the library that were suggested by Wilson. I'd highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"I ordered this book to help me select books for our church library. When I first received this book, I was thrilled. The categories are helpful and the descriptions are accurate. I could hardly wait to get some of these gems on the shelves. Therein lies the problem. Many,many of these books are out of print and no longer available. Of the twelve biographies I tried to order, ten of them were out of print. Some of them were available used, but most were not. It was most disappointing!"},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"There are a number of annotated book list books available for Christian parents and teachers, and this is one of the best. In her introduction, Wilson explains that her philosophy grows out of Charlotte Mason's concept of \\"living books,\\" and states that to be included in her list titles must be: (1) interesting to children, (2) of excellent literary quality, and (3) reflective of a view of human life that does not conflict with Judeo-Christian moral and ethical values. The preface is written by Susan Schaeffer Macaulay (daughter of Francis Schaeffer, a leading thinker in formulating the concept of the Christian worldview).While I haven't read every title recommended, in general Wilson's selections seem to be well within the bounds of her criteria. Her eye for literary quality, reader interest and moral value is good. She does make some recommendations that I disagree with (for example, Hatchet by Gary Paulson, The Yearling by Marjorie Rawlings, and A String in the Harp by Nancy Bond), primarily because they express a cultural view of childhood and the role of parents that I believe is unbiblical.Unlike many other book lists, this one includes not only fiction and biography sections, but also a number of nonfiction topics such as music, geography, science, mathematics, performing arts, and the natural world. This makes the book an excellent supplement to a young reader's formal education. The chapters are organized by topic, and the reading level is given for individual citations. Obviously, adults need to read the titles rather than merely selecting them on someone else's say-so, but Wilson's recommendation is an excellent place to begin. And in that five minutes before the library closes, four out of five times you can count on her to provide you with a good take-home read."},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"This is a decent resource for children's literature, and I appreciated some of the older titles. Despite being out of print, a few of them were worth the search. However, I was surprised at some of the recommendations (Lorna Doone for children, really?) and there were some gaping ommissions that really should have been included. Overall, it was worthwhile to peruse, but I'm glad I got it out of the library and can spend my money on accumulating some of the literature recommended here and elsewhere."},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"Every parent should BEGIN their children's library experience with this book! There are hundreds of thousands of titles for children's books, and our children will only be able to read a limited number of these throughout their childhood years. So, don't waste time on the losers in the bunch!It is BEST to start with a PLAN for raising children, and add a tool, such as this book, which can assist us in guiding our children's book choices!Every home library should have this book from which to START the process of enriching children through literature. There is certainly plenty of twaddle to read out there which is of little or no value to our children... so why waste their time allowing them to wade through this twaddle and read it? This is often what kills a child's desire to read.Many books today are poorly written with confusing characters and lacking a protagonist. Many times there are no character building moral values imparted!This little handbook is great for helping us (parents and teachers) ensure that the best of children's literature is not left behind when our children are beginning their reading experiences.This book will inform you about children's books which you never knew existed. Most books assigned for our children to read are actually chosen by people who know next to nothing about the options in children's literature.I am reminded of the little book store owner in \\"You've Got Mail.\\" Kathleen \\"Shopgirl\\" Kelly (played by Meg Ryan) knows all of the wonderful, imaginative, classic children's books for children to read; while Joe \\"NY152\\" Fox (played by Tom Hanks just wants to build a conglomerate book store down the street and sell whatever his buyers stock in it. His staff knows no more about the books on the shelves than the shoppers!Shopgirl knew all the best children's literature and was able to guide her customers through the process of choosing rich reading... those titles that every child should read at least once (because of the quality of writing and storytelling), but will usually read another twenty times because of the richness of the story and the overall experience with which the child is left!Choose books which have characters to aspire to, stories to imitate, life lessons to be learned, all while fertilizing the seeds of each child's natural imagination!"},{"Title":"Books Children Love - A Guide To The Best Children's Literature","review":"A tremendous help in finding worthy books for children.

It is my understanding that a lot of Brethren Members (hutterites) are against Hofer's work because it reveals the nature of your &quot;authentic&quot; culture, of which you do not want the &quot;outside world&quot; to know about. Should you have taken note of the bibliographic references Hofer used as his research resources, scholarly and academic, perhaps you then would consider not making any irrational statement about biases. The research Hofer has cited in his text is based on objective anthropological, and sociological data, and therefore should be deemed free of biases (of course to an extreme extent). I personally praise his work, and commend him for revealing, as best he can, the truths of his culture: negative, positive, or other. Being an academic (Doctor of Psychology: Cross Cultural Psychology), and an ex-member of the hutterite Brethren I can assure you that his revelations are factual. After all I lived on a hutterite colony for 18 years, and am still in close contact with the sub-culture. Further more, it would be helpful to note which aspects of Hofer's writings you deem as being filled with biases?"},{"Title":"Hutterites: Lives and Images of a Communal People","review":"Samuel Hofer is well known in the Northwestern United States and Western Canada for his fiction and nonfiction books about Hutterites, an Anabaptist group that practices communal living. As a former Hutterite himself, Hofer has some unique perspectives into understanding the culture. This book is his successful attempt to present a broad overview of Hutterite culture so that others may understand.Although the book contains many chapters, its information can be divided into two parts. The first part discusses the Hutterite culture, with a large section devoted to describing Hutterite life from birth to death. This chapter gives the readers a good idea of what Hutterite life is like and how Hutterite colonies function. The second part of the book discusses Hutterite history, spanning from the Middle Ages to recent events. This chapter puts the Hutterites in a historical context, providing amazing insights into how key historical events and situations shaped the Hutterite culture. It also provides information on the challenges facing Hutterites today, and why many people, including the author, have left the Hutterite colonies.The book's tone is informative but informal. Hofer also intersperses his own experiences into the text to bolster his discussions on particular topics. While Hofer did become disillusioned with the Hutterite lifestyle and left the colonies, he appears to harbor few negative feelings towards the Hutterites. To the contrary, he seems to be biased in favor of the Hutterite way of life throughout most of the book.Hofer has done an excellent job in describing the Hutterite lifestyle and history, providing me with more insights into the Hutterite culture than I anticipated. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who lives near Hutterites or who wants to learn more about them."},{"Title":"Hutterites: Lives and Images of a Communal People","review":"I have read all of Hofer's books on colony life, both fiction and non-fiction and have found them all immensely helpful. His writing style is honest, if a bit naive. His books run the gamut from researched and documented to biographical, but all ring truthful. I recommend them as references to flesh out the scientific research. From a sociological point of view, nothing compares to the landmark book &quot;Hutterite Society&quot; by Hochstetler and Huntington."},{"Title":"Hutterites: Lives and Images of a Communal People","review":"I specificaly read this book because I enjoy seeing how outsiders (non-Hutterites) perceive Hutterites. After all, I am a Hutterite myself.I found Hofer's book to be loaded with assumptions, biases and untruths. Many of the &quot;facts&quot; that he presents, especially in the recent history section of the book are extremely biased and untruthful; in fact, little of what he writes in this section could be taken for fact. He must have used &quot;warped&quot; sources, else his sources are totally unaware and ignorant of recent Hutterite history. I think Hofer should have attempted to paint a balanced picture in his book. Otherwise, perhaps he should focus on areas in which he can do proper research."},{"Title":"Myths and Monsters (Secret Worlds)","review":"My son is 11 & always looking for cool books about monsters, dragons, sea creatures.

This one I'm giving an average rating. Overall it moves just like the film, although some of the action and most of the comedy that was in the film, is missing in the novel. Madmartigan's humour must have totally relied on Val Kilmer's performance. The other characters are up to par though.The greatest reason to read this novel as a fan of the movie are the few scenes that must have been cut, or too expensive for the film. One thing that totally shocked me was the entire new character and storyline that was missing from the film! Sorsha's father! In the film you never meet him. In the novel it is great!It's a short novel that took me a sitting to read. I don't recommend this novel to anyone other than fans of Willow, who will really enjoy the missing bits from the film!"},{"Title":"Willow","review":"I have always been a huge fan of the Willow film. Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley had great chemisty and it worked perfectly.In the novel Kilmer's Madmartigan character doesn't come through as well. His wise-cracking antics and such are not presented well, if they are present at all.The novel lacks description. Not of just places and people, but of actions. Too much does it rely on script-like dialogue to tell the story. Leaving the reader to figure out on their own what s happening during dialogues.Like most novelizations, I read this one to hopefully hear a little more that went on in the story. Thankfully it was there. Some strange additions and welcome additions were in this novel. Entirely new characters and small new storylines are there. To my shock there is a red-haired king involved of which I don't want to go into too much detail, but the novel really surprised me with this little tidbit.I grabbed a copy of this novel mainly to introduce me to the stories by George Lucas and Chris Claremont series that takes place after this story. Shadowmoon, Shadowdawn, and Shadowstar.I don't regret that I read this novel as it only took me one sitting, but hopefully the rest of the Willowish novels will be better."},{"Title":"Willow","review":"Overall I enjoyed the book. I liked seeing the new background to the story. I wonder how much of it was cut from the movie, and how much of it was created by Wayland Drew. The beginning starts out well. There were a few small but nice scenes from the movie that were not in the book. That was a bit disappointing, because there was no need to cut them out. Madmartigan's character seemed to be slightly off, and in my opinion the ending in the book wrapped things up a little too quickly."},{"Title":"Willow","review":"I got this book when I was in second grade (nine years ago) and now I have read it so many times the book is almost falling apart!

The writer gives an interesting portrayal of Sioux life and culture, but I found the \\"romance\\" angle to be a bit unconvincing. The harsh - usually cruel - treatment of an captive slave, while realistic, at the same time makes the love affair hard to accept. Black Bear and his people torture Jen's brother, enslave her, and essentially force her to be the concubine of the \\"hero.\\" I couldn't accept that the heroine could so easily fall in love when there doesn't seem to be anything between them except sex, and the first time he forces her. Sorry, \\"rape seduction\\" may have washed in the 1970s, but astute readers can see the holes in the 21st century. Black Bear may secretly suffer from having to treat the woman he loves so cruelly, but since SHE doesn't know that - why does she love him? He doesn't tell her until the end which is far too late. This type of historical romance IS hard to write but since it's fiction some stretch could have been used to make it more believable. I didn't think Black Bear was heroic at all, just a brute. The ending is a bit unsatisfying since Jen's brother and grandmother basically just disappear. Entertaining, but I think this obviously talented writer could have done a little better."},{"Title":"Lord Of The Plains","review":"A tragic tale of an Indian Chief, Gray Wolf, and his obsession with his white female slave, She-With-Hair-Of-Midnight, influences the lives of the following generations. Black Bear / Mato, the son of Indian Chief Red Hawk, is raised believing that to love and cede to a woman is a weakness that will bring bad fortune to his tribe. She-With-Hair-Of-Midnight, Elizabeth Taylor, has romanticized her time of capture by Gray Wolf and of her life with the tribe to her grandchildren, Jen and Brad Foster.When Jen and Brad assist an unconscious Oglala woman, Doe Eyes, they incur the wrath of her tribe. Most of the white soldiers at the fort, their wives and children are slain. A few are taken for slaves. Jen is captured by Mato. At the Indian camp she discovers her brother, barely alive, lashed to a post. Although Jen knows a few Oglala words, these are of little use as she struggles daily within the constraints Mato has on her. As his father, Red Hawk, was the adopted son of Gray Wolf, Mato has been taught to understand English. He does not reveal this to Jen, instead forcing her to communicate as an Indian. Yet he can understand her anguish and fear for her brother clearly. Mato will not show her lenience in his punishments for mistakes, as it would bring shame on them both. As Jen gets to know her captor, his fairness within the tribe and his tender lovemaking, she believes that she could fall in love. Mato will never let any emotions for a woman, especially a white slave; have any bearing on his future role as a chieftain. Even if it breaks his heart to be so ruthless with Jen.Ms. Gray is an exceptionally talented writer. Her eloquent prose has taken this reader back to the Dakota Territory in 1866 without long-winded detailed descriptions of the countryside and the Indian Camp. Although these elements are hinted at, the author gets straight to the heart of the story through her characters. I read over many sections twice to get the full impact of her beautiful style of writing, which seems to flow effortlessly.Ms. Gray is an author well-worth keeping a watch for. After reading Lord Of The Plains this reader is hopeful that there will be a sequel featuring Brad and Doe Eyes. By far one of the best Western Historicals I have had the pleasure of reading. Lord Of The Plains and Ms. Gray definitely deserve a 5 Angel rating.

I commend it to new and experienced board members, to the chairs of governance committees charged with board improvement, and to the executives who staff boards.As a trustee and governance consultant, I know these authors and have heard them speak -- and it was a pleasure to see how well the book transfers their years of experience into print.The book works so well because it is built on a straight-forward model that the authors carry throughout every chapter. The model suggests that healthcare boards (and most other boards, for that matter) have five central roles: defining organizational ends, ensuring management performance; overseeing financial performance; overseeing quality; and providing for the board's own structure, composition and effectiveness. Boards carry out these roles in three ways: by making policies, making decisions, and overseeing performance. One of the book's strongest components is explaining how - in order to define organizational ends - a board identifies the organization's stakeholders and their expectations. Few boards do this at all, much less do it well.Board Work joins books by John Carver, William Bowen, Cyril Houle and Richard Chaitt as an exceptional contribution to the emerging body of pragmatic governance literature.I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Board Work: Governing Health Care Organizations","review":"Outstanding!

In this one, he searches for the mythic roots of the great white whale that provided the theme and tumultuous climax of Melville's classic, Moby-Dick. In a journey that spans the vast reaches of the Pacific, he first of all explores the island in the Marquesas where Melville deserted the whaleship Acushnet, travels to Tonga in search of the tattooed harpooner, Queequeg, and then moves on to the Timor Straits and the Flores Sea,in particularly haunting passages that describe his encounters with primitive whale-shark and sperm whale hunters, where harvesting great animals from the teeming tropical waters can mean the difference, for clans and families living on the edge of want, between survival and death.This book is a page-turner. I sat down after breakfast on a lazy weekend morning, and could not put it down until supper time, when every page had been read. His quest rings with a sense of sincerity. Nothing here is contrived. Tim Severin shares with us the difficulties -- and great blessings -- of discerning the links between truth and myth."},{"Title":"In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale","review":"Herman Melville based his gigantic masterpiece _Moby Dick_ on fact. This is one of the most fascinating parts of that magnificent book. As mystical and symbolic as the parts and the whole may be, they are all firmly grounded in fact, in the world of nineteenth century whaling as it was. Facts crowd into the chapters, even the most novelistic ones. Tim Severin has made a career of replicating historic vessels, using them to trace the supposed routes of their historic sailors, and then writing about the results. In _In Search of Moby Dick: The Quest for the White Whale_ (Basic Books), he does not plunder Melville's great work, but actually expands it. Using _Moby Dick_ and other Melville texts, he has gone on an adventure to find the white sperm whale, and although he never brings home the fabulous creature, he does indeed find it in ways that demonstrate that even a century and a half after the white whale entered literature, he still exists as fact as well as fable.Severin's curious quest takes him first to the island Melville described in his bestseller _Typee_, and then to islands where Melville never visited, but where there are still whalemen who still harpoon whales. The descriptions of the dangers of the hunts on which Severin accompanied the islanders are vivid and memorable. He finds, intriguingly, that the island legends of the white whale are in many ways the same as those of Melville's whalemen. He conveys vividly the excitement of the hunt, both of physical prey by contemporary whalemen and his own search for Moby Dick. The islanders know there is a white whale out there. Ahab was not able to destroy him, and the islanders revere and respect him. Severin's vibrant book shows that the whale hunters will surely pass away before Moby Dick, secure in legend and literature, is ever finally caught, or finally known."},{"Title":"In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale","review":"I enjoyed the book, and would recommend it. It has been well reviewed by others here on this page.I was disappointed to find that the still pictures the author took and the drawings by Patturson mentioned in the credits were not found in the paperback De Capo Press book. I guess one has to buy the hardback. I found it a bit odd that the author often referred to Melville's copying (plagurizing) passages of other texts in the production of his book Moby Dick, but did not mention that in the times of its publication it was not uncommon to plagurize other books. Maybe he just didn't know."},{"Title":"In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale","review":"Severin's varied accounts of South Pacific whaling compliment Melville's novel wonderfully. His book provides excellent supplemental reading to support Melville's classic AND add to the lore of the sea. Like the novel, Severin concludes his searching by recording a whale hunt that has incredible action and danger.What fascinated me in this short book was his description of the whiteness of the whale. Nature allows white for only a few examples of whiteness and they are esteemed highly; their significance has spiritual and metaphysical associations. Severin states that whiteness and the sea are common, but in the whale, the shark, the manta ray and in other species, the contrast in seeing a white member &quot;contradicts&quot; our assumptions. I endorse this book for several reasons: Severin's anthropological recording is astute; he carefully respects Melville's accounts; and he is an excellent writer in his own right."},{"Title":"In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale","review":"Before I describe what this book is, I should describe what it is NOT, because I feel that it is definitely (and perhaps deliberately) mistitled, and if I had known was it was, I probably would never have chosen to read it.I bought this book without bothering to riffle through it, being under the impression that it was an investigation into whatever facts lay behind the Moby Dick legend upon which Melville based his well-known novel. Although Severin partially covers this angle in the last (and definitely most engrossing) chapter, this is certainly NOT what this book is about on the whole.Severin himself touches on this [p. 52]: \\"The animal Melville had in mind was probably inspired by reading a short story in an American magazine, The Knickerbocker, in 1839. The piece was called \`Mocha Dick or the White Whale of the Pacific' and it was a yarn about a big bull sperm whale regularly encountered off the coat of Chile. The animal was said to be \`as white as wool', though whether because it was an albino or from old age was not known.\\"But this is virtually the only mention Severin makes of this mysterious beast.So what is it about? For a period of about a year and a half the author roamed through Oceania staying and talking with various whale-hunting communities, for the most part learning about their lifestyles but occasionally exploring the subject of a white sperm whale, which, as Severin is eager to demonstrate, is not limited to Western literature, but makes an appearance in the myths and legends of societies far different from our own.Unfortunately, the lifestyles of these primitive whaling communities, for the most part, do not make for interesting reading (the section on Lamalera is especially yawn-inducing), and several times during my reading I wondered why I was even bothering to finish it.Other sections leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, such as when Severin digs up and exposes Melville's many exaggerations. Every author's worst nightmare! Here's a sample:\\"[In Typee], Melville describes how the natives of Taipivai were very keen to tattoo their sailor visitor. They point out that his white skin would make such a perfect canvas for their art. Mehevi also wants him to be tattooed, and suggests suitable patterns. The tattooer-in-chief pursues Melville about the village waving his instruments, the sharp-toothed combs and tapping mallet. Yet somehow Melville avoids the operation, and he does not explicitly state how. It is another example of Melville building up suitably colourful ordeals while \`living among the cannibals', but then sidling away from any clear explanation of how he emerged intact. Certainly Melville had no tattoos to display when he returned to new England and told an intrigued audience about his \`four months' on the Marquesas, though tattoos were already common enough among Western sailors of his day.\\"Just what every writer needs. A good deal of the book consists of ill-spirited detective work of this kind, most of which is not even germane to Severin's stated purposes.Conclusion: if you are looking for extra information on the facts behind white whale legends of the mid 1800's, don't look here. The closest book I know of that addresses the question of whether a white whale actually existed (an actual white whale, not just an ordinary black, though perhaps unusually aggressive, sperm whale-like the one that famously smashed up the Essex) would be Norton's \\"Moby Dick as Doubloon,\\" and even that book only touches on the matter.Having said that, the book is far from awful. The writing style is brisk and deft, and what Severin has learned on his travels/studies can on occasion be absorbing. It's just that you should know what you're getting into.Moreover, the soft cover edition is handsomely printed, though it could really have used some maps.I should also note that this book can boast a top-notch first paragraph. Don't let that fool you, though."},{"Title":"Growing up in Mississippi","review":"\\"On April 10, in the small town of Webb in the Mississippi Delta, I, Bertha M. Davis was born to Victoria M. Thomas, a single mother of four....\\" So begins the story of Betha Davis's life in Growing Up in Mississippi.Growing Up in Mississippi is a true story about a young girl growing up in the south when segregation was alive and well; African Americans were labeled Negroes; and picking cotton was one of the only ways to make a living.Textbooks and school curriculum can't possibly begin to teach the struggles many black men and women faced during this time. Reading Growing Up in Mississippi not only gave me a glimpse of the hardship they suffered, it also displayed the relationship and camaraderie they each shared as well.In the story, Davis primarily focuses on her childhood and her relationship with her mother and siblings. Often moving from plantation to plantation offered Davis access to many interesting people including plantation owner, Mr. Johnson; the kindhearted Mrs. Fisher; and the scandalous Jenny.Reading this book transformed my views on the history of the South. Davis wrote about many topics that I believe they'd never attempt to teach in school. I think people of all ages and races will benefit from reading Growing Up in Mississippi.Reviewed by Joy FarringtonJoy Farrington is the founder and president of Nubian Sistas Book Club, Inc. and resides in South Florida. www.nubiansistas.org"},{"Title":"Growing up in Mississippi","review":"This book is a memoir about growing up working on the cotton plantations in Mississippi. Not only did this family struggle because they lived in poverty, but they were also black and living in the south when African Americans were discriminated against and looked down on just because of their color.When I read the synopsis for this book it sparked my interest because I was also raised on a cotton farm in the south in the 50's. I was interested in Bertha's story. I thought perhaps I could relate to what happened to her, not because I'm black but because we were also very poor back then and did our share of picking cotton when we weren't in school. I also knew very well what blacks were treated like in the south during that time.Some of the things the author describes are horrible and are certainly things that no one should have to witness and certainly not a child. They are things that should have never happened, but most of the people in the south in those times were raised with a prejudiced attitude. It's very unfortunate when we just can't view everyone as human beings regardless of our differences. Today things have changed for the better, which is a good thing. It was hard enough growing up in poverty but I think it was downright dangerous to be a person of color in the 50's and even the 60's. You never knew when someone would shoot you dead for no reason at all.As the reader we get to look inside of the plain houses this family lived in; live the turmoil in their lives, hear the tales of what they ate, which was sometimes very little. They worked hard all day everyday and lied in their beds at night listening to the rats and snakes in the walls. But they weren't without a few fun childhood moments. They would sneak out of the house when their mother was gone and take the boat out and go wading in the rivers, never once thinking of the dangers of snakes swimming in the same water. My siblings and I used to wade in the muddy ditches too when we were growing up and lie in bed listening to the rats in the walls of the sharecropper's shack we lived in until I was about 13.I could relate to this story on several levels. There was a lot of poverty in the south with people drifting here and there to find work. I found this book to be an enlightening read and a sad story. This family was treated so badly, but its also uplifting because they stuck together through everything they had to endure and they rose above the poverty and the prejudice after the Civil rights movement. The author was able to go to college, which was a childhood dream, and graduate with a degree.There wasn't a father figure present, but Bertha and her siblings had a strong mother who wanted the best for her four kids and she moved them around a lot to different plantations as she tried to give them the best life she could under the circumstances. This memoir also has some nice old family photos. I would recommend this book to anyone who really wants to see what life was like back then from someone who knows firsthand. The reader can get a good feel for the characters and the places by all the description in the story. I felt like I was right there with Bertha, laughing and crying along with her. The cover on this book is a collage of family photos and quite the appropriate choice."},{"Title":"Growing up in Mississippi","review":"In all of the chaos and confusion of an ordinary day, someone with a heart full of lessons to share holds the magic formula for couples to survive and fall in love with being in love all over again. Never have I fancied reading a book on relationships with such joy as from Bertha M. Davis, a masterful writer, shares over 40 years of experience on the \\"good and bad\\" of relationships.Through all of her own pitfalls and personal triumphs, she is able to encourage the reader to compromise and \\"literally\\" grow up. There is much to learn, and even for those in fledgling relationships, Bertha's book, \\"Marriage and The Family,\\" should be the anthem or perfect gift for a bridal shower or wedding. All bridal shops would prosper with Bertha's book that rings like sweet wine, but instead the only intoxicating message is \\"learn to stay in love.\\" When couples are able to react maturely to even the worst of situations, love can remain everlastingly. Just ask Bertha who understands that marriage means, \\"a permanent bond,\\" between two people. She reiterates the meaning of \\"LOVE.\\" and instructs couples before saying, \\"I DO!\\" Bertha wastes no time spelling out the statistics on rapid divorce rates. The country has failed this test.Every couple is vulnerable to the rising trend. Thank goodness for Bertha's clever remedies such as spending time together, learning to love yourself, appreciate the art of maturing, and most of all, rearing children to uphold the same values which may be the culprit for increasing divorce rates. Our adults today are kids all grown up who are the products of young parents who may have compromised going out to work to put food on the table for spending quality time with kids.Not to worry, Bertha is not here to wreak havoc on our young souls as a woman of marriage for many years but rather lend all of us , and including the children, a kind of mother wit that unsurprisingly grandparents can provide as young lings grow into independent teens and young adults. Any married couple should consider reading Bertha's book together.After all, we want our children to see us as role models and be on their way to college, or look out for problems later on as Bertha also, sheds light on the repercussions of neglecting youth who waywardly could end up in prison and resorting to drugs and crime if we don't collectively strive to fulfill our responsibilities as adults. \\"Love and Marriage\\" is an outstandingly well written book that acknowledges every minuscule ingredient of a successful marriage, and while all doesn't always turn out to be a fairytale, \\"Bertha's Ten Commandments of Marriage\\"as well as her scripture references on marriage, may very well be the next constitution to save this country, for social order begins with healthy families. Bravo to Bertha Davis, a lady who I have no doubt will take the seminar segment by storm with her new book, \\"Marriage and Family.\\""},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"This is a beautifully written, well nuanced novel of mystery and suspense that seamlessly moves between the past and the present. The past is told through the diaries of a Danish immigrant named Asta, who went to live in Edwardian England with her husband, Rasmus, and two young sons at the turn of the century. Settling down in East London in 1905, her loveless marriage and loneliness drove Asta to keep a journal of her innermost thoughts and experiences.Though married to a man who spent a great deal of time away from home on business and with whom she seemed to have little in common, Asta added two more children to her family, daughters, Swanny, her favorite, and Maria, the youngest. Asta's lyrically written journals would chronicle of her life, her struggles as an immigrant, her hopes and dreams, and her adoration of Swanny. They would also tantalizingly hint at a secret that would, ultimately, impact on her daughter, Swanny, later in life.Over seventy years later, those diaries, all forty nine of them, would be discovered and become a publishing sensation and a bestseller. Within its many pages would lie the missing pieces to a turn of the century murder mystery and the leads to the whereabouts of a missing child, as well as tantalizing clues to the puzzling circumstances surrounding Swanny's birth. This information would lie dormant until nearly a century after Asta first put pen to paper, when Asta's granddaughter, Maria's daughter Ann, would review the diaries and discover not only the secret of Swanny's birth, but the identity of a missing child, as well as that of a killer, who nearly a century earlier had butchered two women.This is a book well worth reading, and one that will command the readers attention until the very last page is turned."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"Asta's Book is a rich and rewarding novel, not only a &quot;mystery&quot; but a complex social history of an immigrant family, Edwardian London, criminal trials and the place of women in society. The story centers on Asta, a hopelessly middle class Danish lady who moves to London with her husband and two young sons in 1905. Over the next several years, a series of events unfold that reveal questions about murder and a missing child. The format of the book is two fold; one voice is Asta's, her diary. The other belongs to Asta's granddaughter, Ann, who in the present time is trying to discover the secrets Asta removed from her diary. Secrets concerning the parentage of a daughter, Ann's aunt. Secrets concerning jealousy and rage, violence, and the terrible lies within he family. This story is like an onion with many skins; each chapter peels back slowly and reveals the next layer. Asta is a formidable character, full of contractions, and one of the most believable historic female voices in fiction. This book was a marvelous, wonderful find for me, a true gem."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"In 1905, a young Danish couple arrive in England with their two small sons. The husband, Rasmus, becomes a total Anglophile while his wife Asta, struggles with language problems,loneliness and depression as she is left alone with the children for long periods of time while Rasmus travels on business.To while away the hours, Asta starts a diary which she continues for the majority of her life. Years later, her descendants discover and publish the diaries which become an international success and which bring to life a number of unanswered questions about a sensational murder trial and the dubious birth of one of Asta's daughters. At first I struggled with the various characters, finding it difficult to place them in the right generations but all became clear eventually. The plot is involved, with red herrings strewn all over the place--an intriguing read and worth perservering with as all the solutions come right at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"This was the first Barbara Vine book that I read and it's the one that got me hooked.

The Chimney Sweeper's Boy comes a close second in my opinion. It is a pleasure to read such a beautifully written book with excellent characterization as well as such a gripping suspenseful plot. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"I was so looking forward, in middle age, to going back and reading the Barbara Vine novels I had read as a youth, and also to catching up with the ones I had skipped while I married, started a career, and wrote books of my own. Oh how I used to love her, though as I think of it now I don't remember anything in particular, just the atmosphere. Some fans told me to go back and find ASTA'S BOOK, claiming it was among her very best. So I plunged right in. The first 50 pages are exciting enough, but then I noticed that very little happens for another couple of hundred pages, while the narrator's two eccentric forebears grew more dreary and monotonous as the pages dragged by.Asta herself is such a conceited creature that it became hard for me to believe that her diaries have become a national treasure. The mechanics by which her beloved daughter, Swanny, gets to see the diaries achieve the very top ranks of bestsellerdom are nicely outlined, but afterwards I was thinking, she is such a drip, why do readers take to her? We never do find out the opinion of the man on the street, but Ann herself, the accidental detective and Asta's granddaughter, continues to have a skeptical opinion of Asta, one that is well warranted from page one of the diaries. We know she's hiding something, and likely it is regarding the birth of Swanny, and somehow it's connected with a notorious true crime cases of 1905 London; we find all of this out on the flaps of the book. And I didn't guess, which may be due to Vine's admitted talent at the shell game but also because the answer was completely unprovable and improbable to the nth degree. I imagine that ASTA'S BOOK will appeal to those readers who thrilled to the hospital bed detections Josephine Tey had her hero perform in THE DAUGHTER OF TIME, but here I wasn't falling for it.Why have Asta, her husband and sons come from Denmark anyhow? It's not a serious novel about immigration issues. I think the answer is that no English people would do anything like what Asta and Swanny do; their actions are preposterous enough to blame only on the Danes. They remain murky and unreadable. And when you find out who committed the notorious murder, you'll be scratching your head wondering, \\"And Ann knows this how?\\" All in all, a mixed bag, like the famous curate's egg of George DuMaurier. \\"Did you like it? Well, I liked PARTS of it.\\" But Denmark and the Danes should file a class action suit."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"Great book. Very well written. A pleasure to read. Highly recommended. 6 out of 5 starts."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"This book is one of those rare occasions when Vine/Rendell fails to deliver a work up to her usual high standards. Hardcore Vine/Rendell fans might still derive some pleasure from ASTA'S BOOK but, for the most part, the novel is vastly inferior to the rest of the author's stellar production.For one, ASTA'S BOOK is very long-winded and boring. Endless details that can interest no one and that have very little (if any) connection to the so-called mystery get listed for page after boring page. At least half of the book could have been edited out without damaging the story in the least. You get to wait and wait for something finally to happen but when it does, it's usually something so minor that you wonder why you took the trouble at all. It takes the author until page 150 finally to get to mention a murder mystery. Those who manage to get that far in the book need to be forewarned: don't expect that mystery to be anything like what this author usually creates. The best word to describe it is BORING.Asta, the main character, is probably the only character of Barbara Vine / Ruth Rendell who is a complete literary failure. This author's main strength is her capacity to create complex, extraordinary characters. In Asta, Vine fails to do that spectacularly. We get to meet Asta in her twenties and then later when she is in her seventies. There is absolutely no connection between how she is presented at these two periods of her life. Granted, people change. But in order to transform so dramatically something profound needs to take place in their lives. Asta, who is sheltered and pampered her entire life, suffers no such dramatic chain of events, so a radical change in her seems contrived and illogical.It seems like Vine wanted her readers to see Asta as someone admirable. However, this character comes off as some sort of sociopath who never had a chance to get her sociopathic tendencies fully develop. In the end, the scenes in which she appears become so repetitive, you could guess in advance what Asta will say and do in each given situation. All her life, she keeps complaining and feeling sorry for herself, even though this woman, who never had to work a day in her life, couldn't seriously claim there was any actual hardship in her life.Swanny and Ann, two other important characters in the novel, are also fussy boring women whose personalities are so flat you can hardly distinguish them from one another. Ann narrates everything she does (and she hardly ever does anything interesting) in so much painstaking detail, one can die of boredom while reading it. To give just one example, when she searches for her grandmother's diaries, she describes endlessly how she opened every single drawer or cupboard, and what she found there, and what color it was, and what it reminded her of, etc. And this goes on for 8 pages. When the reader is about to start howling, she, of course, finds the diaries in the most obvious place. This is what the entire book is like: a huge buildup that fizzles out in triviality.I guess no author, no matter how talented she is, can avoid writing at least one bad novel. This is probably Vine's worst book ever. If you suffer from a severe case of insomnia, make sure you buy it. Otherwise, I don't think anybody can honestly enjoy ASTA'S BOOK."},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"Asta's Book was originally written as Anna's Book. It is a superb story, I think probably one of the best ever written by Ruth Rendell, writing as Barbara Vine. Going back and forth from the future to the past is usually difficult but the author does it so well. I really enjoy Ruth Rendell's mysteries, but when she is writing as Barbara Vine, she makes more of a story and psychological mystery than a whodunit, which I find more enjoyable. If you like Asta's Book, try The Crocodile Bird and her newer Barbara Vine, The Blood Doctor and The Chimney Sweeper's Boy. All are excellent!"},{"Title":"Asta's Book","review":"I really loved reading this book. It was exciting and there was a great interplay in two different times.

In general I would give her books three or four stars so for me she ranges somewhere in the middle.Asta's book is one of her better books. The story is a mixture between Asta's diary, Swanny's story and finally Ann's search for the truth. But there is also a mistery involved. At the time when Swanny was born a woman was murdered and her one year old daughter misteriously dissappeared and never could be found. Towards the end of her life Swanny started to believe that she was this girl instead of Asta's daughter. Unfortunatly Asta takes this secret into her grave and when Swanny dies it is up to Ann, Asta's granddaughter and Swanny's niece, to find out the truth. With the help of Asta's diary, the things Swanny has told her and some research on the murder case she does not only solve the case but also finds out on the very last page who Swanny really was.What I liked about this book was the idea of giving pieces of the diary, Ann's memory, facts about the case and Ann's present life to the reader but never in a way that it got too complicated. The part I didn't like about the book was Ann's private life. The fact that she found the love of her life really wasn't interesting at all. As a reader I always wanted her to move on with the case. So these parts I found quite boring. It's the same at the end of the book. I really wished the author would make a point and come up with the solution. The dialogues and thoughts on the last few pages seemed to be endless. About the end itself I could accept that Ann solved a mistery that happened almost 90 years ago but the truth about Swanny was too good to be true.Anyway if you do like Ruth Rendell I'm sure you'll love this book. If you want to read one of her books for the first time start with this one.

All of the information is well documented and thoroughly researched. It is my go-to guide for all bear matters. The only down-side is that at this point, it is rather out-of-date. However, a second edition is about to be released here:The Bear Almanac, 2nd: A Comprehensive Guide to the Bears of the WorldIf you are not very interested in bears themselves and are looking for ways to prevent \\"nuisance\\" bear encounters (bears in your yard/trash/etc.), I would recommend other books instead, such as:Outwitting Bears: The Essential Handbook for Living with Bears, Avoiding Encounters, and Preventing Attacks on Anyone Living in Bear CountryLiving With Bears: A Practical Guide to Bear CountryBear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance (revised edition)"},{"Title":"GREAT BEAR ALMANAC","review":"By happy chance, I had the opportunity to speak with Steve Bircher who is Curator of large mammals and carnivores at the world-famous and truly wonderful St. Louis Zoo because I am researching European Brown Bears for an upcoming novel. Among many odd questions about tamed bear behavior and background, I asked Mr. Bircher to recommend a scientifically accurate but readable and understandable book about bears to help me know their realities, life cycle, diet, propensities, etc. This book, he said, was an absolute must have.The Great Bear Almanac is indeed comprehensive and well-illustrated with images. There are chapters on anatomy and physiology, behavior and activities, bears in the human world, their influence on humans, and sadly, how we misuse and hunt them as well as conflicts between us and bears. That may sound dry. But wait, here's the best part, it's stuffed full of fascinating facts about bears, how they get around, parasites and illnesses, digestion, paw-sucking (who can resist a bear when sucking a paw, I ask you?), travel and navigation, climbing, playing, their communication and more. This is a treasure trove for anyone who wants to know anything about bears in general and about specific bear species (Panda, black, brown, asiatic, polar, sloth, sun, speckled and subspecies). I love this book and will be able to incorporate intriguing bear facts in my fiction as a result.So I will pass on the recommendation of a genuine honest-to-God, hands-down expert: Get this book. It's everything you ever wanted to know about bears. And stuff you didn't realize you wanted to know but will love knowing. Paw sucking, I mean what is not to love."},{"Title":"GREAT BEAR ALMANAC","review":"This is an excellent overview on many aspects of natural history, biology, behavior and the human/bear relationship.

Text very informative, concise and clear. Well organised, elegant look, overall impression is excellent.If one thing is lacking it might be the maps. One feels there could be more maps of battles or scenarios, but perhaps that would make too much. Andy Wiest has another \\"brief\\" and illustrated history of the Vietnam War in the Osprey collection that is also excellent, and which made me decide to choose this next book of his to read.

I and my co-author had the task of developinga set of supplemental teaching materials for use in California and other states that are teaching about religion. Driven by current social forces, schools, and hence textbook publishers are including the teaching of religion in history and social science classes. These textbooks generally forget that many important changes in society were brought about by individuals who were not only not religious, but often were anti-religious. Our approach was to utilize individuals from Larue's work as a foundation for a set of teacher materials to teach about the many nonconforming individuals in history. We used Larue's book to produce a time line of freethought across centuries. And we created a number of concept and story lessons and activities based on individuals in his book. His introductory chapters served as a major source for the development of two pamphlets of background information for teachers. I found the work to be accurate and complete, and a well-referenced source of information of many of the people in history that should be in history books, but are either overlooked or ignored. I would recommend it as a fine authoritative documentation of the multitude of freethinkers who have given to all of us many of the important ideas which serve as the foundations to our current liberty and freedom."},{"Title":"High-Tech Etiquette: Perfecting the Art of Plugged-In Politeness","review":"We live in the age of technology; computers, palmpilots, faxes, cell phones, and emails are all part of mostpeople's lives.

Ved Mehta turned blind at a very young age, went to a school for the blind in India, then came to the USA, went to Oxford and later became a staff writer for the New Yorker. His autobiography starts off with the biographies of his mother and father, who had a totally different background. And then he takes off with his own story. And that's an impressive story. He not only gives you a deep look into his own life, he also tells the story of India (the partition of India and Pakistan is the background of this particular book) and gives you a fresh look at American and European culture. These are books that make you laugh, that make you cry, and The Ledge between the Streams sometimes sent shivers down my spines. You'd think this writer would be famous all over the world, and I would have expected him to get the Nobel Prize for literature (I'm serious!), but some of his books are out of print and they have hardly been translated. So grab your chance and buy this book!

The most instersting points made were the indications that groups of people working and harmonizing for specific tasks ie; helping others, healing and cleansing others - mentally. physically and spiritually, can indeed succeed. This might seem odd to the readers unfamiliar with this series, while the readers and believers of the first book in this series, will see the revelation that groups have the ability to generate and observe more energy than a single individual.

If you thought CP was poorly written wait till you get this one! The plot is even more silly and the whole book is full of images I think could only be described as drug induced. The whole point is that they are searching for the tenth insight an insight that has never been written that each must &quot;uncover themselves&quot; come on already! Redfield needs to get over himself and realize that while he may have a valuable way to look at life the fact is he is a miserable failure as a writer.

I eventually got half way through the book. I could not understand the book. I tried it twice. I got nothing out of it! I read an average of 45 minutes every morning at 5 to 6am.

I read the Celestine Prophesy (the prequel) because it was recommended by a friend. I was, by my nature, slightly suspicious of it but I suspended disbelief. In hindsight its hard not to notice the obvious symbolism in the first chapter (ie: the author representing the reader, reluctant to believe and building affinity with the reader, but trusting his friend - who represents the book - and who the author learns over time to trust and believe) and didnt even let in any cynicism with the overuse of repetition (aka Neuro-linguistic Reprogramming). Why did I do this? Well, I like my friend. Plus the &quot;insights&quot; are easy to believe if you &lt;want&gt; to believe them. It's easy to see how they are reflected in today's western society. OK so there's no proof that this is based on an ancient Peruvian manuscript, and I suppose Redfield &lt;could&gt; have written it a few years back just to make a bit of money and conveniently written the story to have all the evidence confiscated but ... well you have to give the benefit of the doubt every now and then, right?So then I read the Tenth Insight. How obvious can you be? It's not so much his lack of writing ability that bothers me, he's not pretending to be a skilled author, but the fact that Redfield is exploiting people who need reassurance, people who are unhappy with their lives and need something to hope for.Think about all of the flaws in his story... One small example: he says that animals are here to remind us of something we learned when we evolved through them. So tell me - when did humans ever evolve from hawks? from rabbits or cats? His &quot;logic&quot; is littered with gaping inaccuracies and holes.If you aren't convinced yet, please ask yourself one question: if his purpose is to bring these &quot;insights&quot; into the world and raise human awareness, why does he make people pay for them? Why doesn't he put it on the internet and make it free to everyone?"},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"I bought the Tenth Insight as library discard for $1 -- I wish I could get my money back!His philosopy is ridiculous in many ways. I believe in reincarnation, but nothing like he describes it. Frequently in the book the characters remember their past lives and the relationships they each had with each other, and problems of the past being acted upon today.The one clincher that really got me was when one character suggests all suppliers reduce their prices 10%, and this would cure inflation. How simple minded do you have to be to think this is remotely possible?I would rate The Celestine Prophecy about 6 or 7, and the tenth Insight a -1thank you for listening."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"This rounds out the first nine insights. It does sound somewhat fanciful to non-openminded people, but does hold the truth within it. It was meant to be fictional and at the same time was able to give a message of utmost importance - respect and non-judgement. Obviously, some people didn't get that message and wished to judge. If you don't like something, that is okay, but this is a book that encourages positive behavior. I don't care what religion one follows, the message is a good one."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"Just like the first, using fiction to keep the reader's focus to teach that we are our thoughts and what we think, we attract, positive or negative. That we truly can accomplish anything if we keep our focus on it with without worries or doubts. Should it not work out, deal with it then, don't worry about something that hasn't happened &amp; might never will, you will only tire yourself out. Being kind to others does reap rewards immediatly through them enjoying your presence (which makes you feel good) and can give you more information you need in your life even if you only speak for five minutes. Even if you only talk for one moment to say pleasantries, hearing them back makes you feel good that your presence is acknowledged and respected to be wished a good life, and will help you to heal yourself through your throughts &amp; heal your body by feeling good."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"Ever notice when something comes to challange the established order or status quo that dozens of critics whose toes have been stepped on come out of the wood works.Many people criticize this book and the Celestine Prophecy because they just aren't spiritually developed enough to understand it(see my review on the Celestine Prophecy). Now, they'll evolve when their time comes.This book expands on the nine insights and goes deeper into the spiritual aspect. As a new age spiritualist, this book talks about what we &quot;preach&quot; all the time, the world is moving into a global transformation towards a spiritually and morally developed planet(contrary to our present situation). This book explains the process. Those that criticize this book are the same ones envolved in &quot;the fear&quot;(read this book for more details) and don't accept the changes that are to come. If you think the Celestine Prophecy changed your life, this book will help to give you direction in a spiritual path devoid of religion and dogmas, and pointing the way to God and it's kingdom within you( just like Jesus Christ said). READ, STUDY, DIGEST, AND APPLY THE INFORMATION ON THIS BOOK, AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT. As for the critics, don't worry even you guys will have your chance to eventually understand all these spiritual matters and then you'll be able not only to understand this book, but also witness the beauty of the spiritual world.

This deals a lot with synchronicities, and has had a profound effect on my life since synchronicities are something that I experience first hand, frequently. I recommend this book whether or not you believe it as a whole. You don't need to, it still will be beneficial. ( I don't believe everything it advocates) To the stubborn skeptic, it might be a little to much to swallow, but as long as you have encountered synchronicity or serendipity... this book will be enjoyed. It will only be worthless to the nihilist. Why do I give it 5 stars though? Was it really that brilliant? No, but unlike some books that are merely valuable as food for thought, this is food for life. It can be directly applied to where you stand now. Perhaps 'soul food' is the proper term. You will not read this by accident, and you will learn that nothing is an accident. Without getting into its minor beliefs, I agree with the ultimate implied message that the book purports:The meaning of life is simply, loveIt emphasizes our need to generate loving energy unto all beings, and search for the genuine meaning in our lives, through prayer and synchronistic events. It speaks a bit about analyzing synchronicities and their context, similar to interpreting dreams. There is alot of fascinating info about things like dreams, and sacred sites. There is much writing about the Afterlife. The book teaches reincarnation, Birth Vision, and the idea that your Afterlife is created by what you believe it will be while on earth. (That concept continues to confuse me!) They deny literal existences of Hell, Devils, and Judgement. These are only to be viewed as metaphors. We can transform our negative side through our heart with positive light. It even contains a chapter about Work and Business, how we can use these as spiritual relationships and oppurtunities through changes. The chapters end with individual and group work, this will probably be where the book directly helps or influences you the greatest. The author has great methods of analyzing our life and the big picture.The vision is here, we must realize it. As I said it doesn't really degrade this books value if you don't believe in NDE's, reincarnation, or whatever. I believe there is alot of good here for us all. I don't think I should get into more detail, if you are interested at all, open your mind to this work!!"},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"Te Celestine Prophecy is the only book I've ever read more than once. I love it. I started the Tenth Insight immediately after finishing the Celestine Prophecy for the second time and I couldnt beleive this was written by the same author. Did something happen to Redfield between writing these 2 books? Most of the first book is very believable and enlightening, but the second is a complete whirlwind of nuttiness and mostly, in my opinion, totally over the top. I found myself skipping page upon page of rambling. Very weird, and a little disappointing really!"},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"James Redfield continues his story from the Celestine Prophecy, which deals with human spirituality. He takes us on a journey where questions about who we are and where are we going are woven into the fabric of life. James gives us a history lesson which includes our individual missions here on earth.He weaves several different themes of possibilities for us to consider, such as soul groups which we travel with throughout life. Another is of animal sightings and how they can provide a signpost for us to be aware of, which may signal a change or an opportunity. Some of the underlying messages within these pages are of hope, compassion and love. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it takes us places which lift us up and provide a sense of belonging to a world larger than we might imagine today."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"I read the Celestine Prophecy and enjoyed it and felt I had received some new insights that could help me. But this book, The Tenth Insight, left me totally bewildered. It is probably the most confusing book I have ever read. If you want to understand \`soul families', Ramon Stevens in his Alexander books, does a much better and clearer job. Even as an adventure novel, the premise was weak and very distracting to the simple message of \`figuring out why we are all here'. I've read the same sermon hundreds of times, all spoken more eloquently, all easier to understand."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"The author has taken on a profound subject and the focus on death, after-life and karma gives this book a different direction from the Celestine Prophecy. After reading it one feels that at times the author has tried to justify having a separate novel for the Tenth Insight. Hence certain portions drag and make you want to flip over. James Redfield seems to have been inspired by 'Saved by the Light' and hence anyone who has read 'Saved ...' will easily spot the similarities. For anyone who is reading about death, after-life first time, this book covers all theories,experiences covered to date."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"This book voiced (almost) every belief that I had...

Not meant to be a bible for those that need to cling, but simply as a vision of what we can achieve. Anyone out there with questions and a sense of a spiritual awakening can truly believe that we are reaching a point of &quot;critical mass&quot; in our colective consciousness, where by shear weight of numbers a possible transformation of our world culture is possible.Well worth the read, and the exercises that are in it are worth attempting just for your own growth. The world is changing and we can all co-create this new existance."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"I bought this book and didn't read it for a while. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The explanation of soul groups was inspirational to me, as I have felt this myself.It goes further in depth, explaining our life missions, how our soul groups help, and how to remember why we came and how to hold the vision.There are new characters as well as some familiar ones from the first book. They are all well done and James does a good job of making us feel as if we know them.To not appreciate this book, is to demonstrate the ego's need to be pompous. To feel this book has nothing to offer is ludicrous. Read this, as all materials, with an openness that allows in the possibility there might be something that will help you on your journey.

A must for the people who enjoyed &quot;The Celestine Prophecy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"The Celestine Prophecy was a very thought provoking book.The Tenth Insight, however, has crossed the line between thought provoking and a bad movie.While The Celestine Prophecy pushed the intellectual envelope when it got to the &quot;Ninth Insight&quot; (being able to physically disappear), the message and structure of the other eight insights expanded the understanding of how humans interact. The Tenth Insight takes the metamorphosis of humanity to a new level of idiocy--where people &quot;centered&quot; enough can actually cross over to the Afterlife, seeing what others are hoping to make of their lives before they are reincarnated, and how humanity will achieve this awakaning through love.Somewhere between page one and the end, this book starts weak, and then collapses upon itself in a rather agonizingly slow process.Save your money, stick to The Celestine Prophecey."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"I will admit-I bought in to the hype surrounding The Celestine Prophecy. It read like a decent episode of MacGyver-thinly plotted, obvious, but you stayed with it to see how it would turn out. The &quot;Insights&quot; were pleasant and one could apply them to everyday life. Thinking the second would be another quick and easy adventure read, I picked it up. Completely unreadable, full of badly written hallucinogenic passages that wouldn't pass muster in a standard trippy 1960's psychedelic film like The Trip or Psych-Out. To cleanse my soul, I turned to Martin Amis' The Information and Elmore Leonard's Riding The Rap-I feel much better"},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"Continuing where the first book stopped .

It didn't flow as smoothly and was more difficult to digest. However, I've read the next book in the series, The Secret of Shambhala, and am now reading the final book in the series, the Twelfth Insight, and they are both in the flavor of the original Celestine Prophesy. All of have been creative and interesting and encourage the reader to evaluate personal values and behavior. I am intrigued by the spiritual rather than traditional religious interpretations of the Bible. The interpretations struck a chord in me and the blending of science and spirituality is in line with my own personal beliefs. I highly recommend the Celestine series to readers."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"The Celestine Prophecy, while poorly written, had something to say, ideas worth thinking about and was intelligible. But Redfield's The Tenth Insight reveals him as the poorest of Casteneda clones. Only by the greatest perserverence was I able to finish this book, hoping that the mindless obscurities and their wraithlike shadows, the Birth Vision, feckless and nameless in the whitish swirl of moving amber souls would lead me out of Appalachia and into bliss.Redfield, trying to capitalize on the wild success of TCP, has shown himself to be a totally incompetent hack. This is dreadful, unintelligible trash. Avoid it. Trust me"},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"There are 9 insights are in the first book, so we get only 1 new insight in this book. The new insight is really nothing new, as it's parts are mostly contained already within the other 9.The story is ok, but it did not really grab me. Like the first book the story will bog down with preachy ramblings. Our hero in the book fails to apply the insights previously learned. While this might be true to human nature, and make for a good example in a self-help guide, it doesn't fly too well for me as part of an adventure novel.Entertainment: 3 starsEnlightenment: 3 starsOverall: 3 starsOf the trilogy, this book is my least favorite of the three."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"I have read most of the Celestine Prophecy series.

As well as delving into the complexities of the tenth insight: remembering the birth vision, overcoming the fear, taking responsibility to the future of humankind, environmental consciousness, promoting the eventual world vision. This time the adventure takes you to the Native American landscape in Southwestern U.S.The author does not exclusively promote one religion as previously introduced in the prior book, but instead considers them all: Muslim, Jewish, Christianity, Eastern beliefs. While ingeniously intermingling science. And just like the prior, this book also breaks down the barriers set up by society/religion/environmental/cultural factors imposed on us since birth, sheds light on the purpose of our true selves and opens the portal to the realization of our fullest potential."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"The Tenth Insight is the sequel to the Celestine Prophecy.

As such, it does not compare all that well. It is quite metaphysical but also does not compare well to Stewart Edward Whites' \\"The Betty Book\\" let alone his masterfulThe Unobstructed Universe. Unfortunately, as opposed to its predecessor,Celestine Prophecy, the, it is skewed towards Western (esp. New Age) traditions--making it somewhat unbalanced. On the other hand, it does provide an introduction to some basic metaphysics and Redfield's personal vision of utopia. It is written at a low level--probably to appeal to the masses--so don't expect great literature here--or much of a plot either--I think C. S. Lewis did it better:The Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics. Also, some of its reasoning, such as the Financial/Economic assertions (esp. lowering prices 10%) are inherently faulty & indefensible. Still, Redfield doesn't claim to be a professional in these areas--we must allow for some poetic license herein. It IS, however, better than most New Age feel-good books as it actually does contain valuable material--but the wheat is buried in the chaff.

James Redfield is on of the most amazing authors yet! Those who have judged wrong of this book in the past should reconsider. I can honestly say, without praising this man too much, that I as a young reader have been inspired and touched by The Tenth Insight! When I first began to read this book, I was kind of sceptical, as it seemed to be a \\"religious book\\", but as I continued my search into the book, a whole new aspect of life had come into view. For a human being alone to have thought of this inspirational book, I find to be highly unlikely. But then again, the evidence has been placed right before me and I now see that it is possible. I remember at one point of the book, my jaw actually dropped in amazment. I had never taken any of this into thought before. I literally refused to stop reading the book and stayed up for hours, analizing every line of this fantastic masterpiece. I hope that anyone who may come across this comment, to take it to serious consideration because I know that I myself have never received so much aspect on life from one book.

Redfield stretches the concept of &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; beyond the acceptable level. He couldn't even &quot;suspend the incredulous&quot; in this one.

Then I went on line and I remembered that a sequel had been written years ago. That was the Tenth Insight. It will give you goose bumps or the shivers (whatever you like to call them.) It keeps showing us visions that we know we saw or felt all our lives but didn't really know if it was just a coincidence or all in your head. I've always believed that when I'm really praying hard for something and I see a bird (especially a hawk or an eagle) that I know that God has heard my request. It doesn't really matter if the prayer isn't answered, it's just awesome that God gave me a sign that he heard it. This book lets you know that all the quirky little things you've somehow believed since you were a child are not just random, they happen for a reason. Everyone's insight and visions are different but if we all work together in love as foretold in The Tenth Insight, what a wonderful world this would be.

I appreciated many of the simple ways the author, in Celestine, tried to explain the ancient beliefs of the Christians, Hindus, Zen Masters and Buddhists through the now popular phrase &quot;New Age&quot;. I even appreciated the &quot;action&quot;, &quot;suspense&quot; and ending of Celestine. But when it came to revealing the tenth insight in The Tenth Insight, running out of gas is an understatement. The discussion on &quot;A-life-unexamined-is-not-worth- living-cum-karma-cum-past-life-regression&quot; is too contrived. Not at all &quot;coincidental&quot; as in Celestine. Wil's character comes in and out to intervene like a guardian angel, but guardian angel he's not. He's more like a distant observer who helps out the protagonist so that the story may continue without any hitches...classic deux ex machina.

The characters, this time, were active participants in the story, as opposed to hapless protagonists passed hand-to-hand through a learning process. It could still have been written better, in my opinion. However, if you are at this page, interested in perhaps picking up a copy, you probably enjoyed the Celestine Prophecy.

There was no way I was going to drop such massive source of growth and aid to understanding higher truths at the beginning of my spiritual path, there were so many energetic concepts that these books offered.The 10th insight was a quantum leap in the understanding of what I had absorbed so far. Yes, I understood the 9 insights and their energetic parallels, and I was doing my best to raise my vibration and follow its cues in order to be able to see beauty everywhere I looked.And I was succeeding quite well, when this Ten Insight propelled me into a further understanding of what the possibilities for the future would be with an unlimited source of power free for all.The world we know today would definitely be not the same because, for starters, there would be no point of arguing or fighting to control such source. But the book describes very well how the major power players in the world would do anything they could to control it, regardless!OK. These concepts are much more heard today, but one must think that this book was really well ahead of its time.I definitely loved the fact that it put so many valuable seeds in my consciousness, which have matured 17 years later.

Don't make the mistake of writing this book off JUST because it comes on the coat-tails of it's highly successful precursor. Admittedly it doesn't have the pathos of Joseph Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot; or the passion and insight of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; by Richard Patton. What it does have, is its finger on the pulse of the present consciousness that asks &quot;What more is there? This can't be all there is&quot;? Celestine prophecy has already become a prisoner of its own success, but for good reason. It is a finger that points at some profound truths. For people that haven't had access or interest in 'Newage' belief systems, this book is a great Reader's Digest. It, more perhaps than any other book before it, has made 'spiritual' an openly used word and concept. If it were only for this, it would be worth reading.

You will find some other ways to view the upcoming Apocalypse/big energy shift. Old views as well as new are simply explained.I learned a lot from the Celestine Prophecy, so I got this book too. Yes, I picked up quite a bit from this book as well. The book talks at length about the Afterlife, Life Reviews, how each person chooses to be born, and the progression of life from the Big Bang. As far as engaging fiction, a few parts of the book are engaging. There are some longer sections involving a lot of explanation. Characters going over what they'd discovered about life and the purpose of life. Very helpful information. Rather long compared to the adventure parts.So the pro of this book is that there's a lot of insight, simply explained, at a level that just about anyone can grasp.The con is that the language lacks beauty and isn't very quotable. The action isn't what you'd call intense.I think the pro outweighs the con by quite a bit. There are some big ideas in here that are very accessible. And at 236 pages you can get this information pretty quickly.If the very long dialogue/explanation parts were put into a more elegant, well written non-adventure type book, that book would be a good deal longer. And probably not as accessible. This book gets 4 stars for the information I got from it. Otherwise, it'd get 2 for the writing style and not-so-adventurous adventure."},{"Title":"The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision : Further Adventures of the Celestine Prophecy","review":"this book is amazing and a great compliment to the Celestine Prophecy.It make you wonder if this could be the new turth we are to learn about where the human race is destine to go.

I only read the first 23 pages, but I figured that if I didn't see one by then, the metaphor would be as hard to find as a sober college student at the homecoming tailgate party. That a novel so devoid of LITERARY INSIGHT can live on the bestseller rack for months should tell us how much we missed in high school English class. -J. A.

This is the book that I recommend to all of my audiences as the primary source for law enforcement case law. To the best of my knowledge, this vital information cannot be found anywhere else.

Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Minister and the Choir Singer (The Hall - Mills Murder Case)","review":"This well-written book lacks an index, but lists the people involved. Part I tells about the events of 1922. After the murders no indictments occurred! Part II tells of the events in 1926. A divorce action against the former Hall's maid alleged a pay-off to keep quiet. The NY Daily Mirror publicized this, and NJ Governor Moore ordered a new investigation. Four indictments followed. Part III tells of the five weeks of trial; all were found not guilty. The murders were never solved. In Part IV Kunstler fantasizes about it being a Klan killing. No proof is given, he only argues by analogy. No group of men were seen there. I wonder if this is part of a whitewash? There is no mention of public opinion from these times.The Reverend Hall married Frances Stevens, 37 years old, a few years before she inherited millions (with her brothers). Around this time Mrs. Eleanor Mills became active in church affairs. Married at 17, perhaps to escape an unhappy home life, she soon had two children. She sought the mirage of happiness in closeness to her minister. But this minister married for money; love was a secondary concern. Their meetings were not secret from their close associates.On Thursday September 14, 1922 Mrs. Mills read an article justifying divorce for a minister. She cut it out and called Reverend Hall for a meeting; he soon left to meet her. Mrs. Mills boarded a trolley then walked to De Russey's Lane. Reverend Hall left his house by 7:30PM and was seen walking to this location. They were never seen alive again. Saturday morning 9-16-1922 a young couple went for a walk down De Russey's Lane and turned into a grassy path. They found two bodies near a crabapple tree, then ran to Easton Ave to call the police. The missing couple was found.Four people who lived nearby heard shots or screams around midnight Thursday (p.31). The affair between the minister and the choir singer became public knowledge. Next month they learned of the testimony of the \\"Pig Woman\\". While riding a mule to follow a suspected thief, she saw two men and two women arguing near a crabapple tree. There was a shot, and someone fell to the ground. She heard a woman scream, then more shots (p.70). She had tried to tell her story earlier, but was put off (p.72). Detectives accompanied her reconstruction; it checked out.I believe that Frances, Henry, and Willie went looking for the missing minister, and found them together. Frances asked Edward to kneel and promise to sin no more. Willie, covering him with his pistol, touched it off. They then chose to finish the job (p.29). Future events would tell of witnesses paid to vanish or forget. Who was paid to kill the investigation in 1922? [If they were to find the missing gold watch buried in the Hall's garden we would know the truth.]"},{"Title":"The Minister and the Choir Singer (The Hall - Mills Murder Case)","review":"After finding an old newspaper article with the Halls-Mills murder splashed across the front page, I took an interest in what actually occurred and who the players in the mystery were. Finding this book put a lot into perspective. The people involved, where they came from, who they were, and the links between each, are nicely brought together by the author (who has done his research thoroughly). This is not a new book, but the story will hold the readers interest, as if the events happened today. Kunstler probes the suspects as any good trial lawyer would, and he gets his answers through fine examination of each. The reader is made to be a member of the jury, from the individual's involved, to the crime scene and beyond -- you decide who's guilty and who's not."},{"Title":"Muscles, Testing and Function: With Posture and Pain","review":"If you ever needed to know what all the muscles in the body were, where exactly they attached to the skeleton, what movement they created, and ways to test how strong they are this is the bible. As a physical therapist, this has been an invaluable book to have both as a student and as a clinician."},{"Title":"Muscles, Testing and Function: With Posture and Pain","review":"This is an excellent book.It is a important reference book which I use and read cover to cover. The biggest plus about this book is the concept of alignment, and the various grouping of restrictions and weaknesses within the body. It shows this and explains these (rectrictions vs weakeness) very clearly and specifically which makes it easy to pick up theses patterns in people's bodies.Although there are better books which are set out better, the commentary and insights contained within the book are invaluable.It is a bit of a bible in many physical therapy circles.Don't get too caught up, and remember that this book should only be a start point as things are more complicated than this."},{"Title":"Muscles, Testing and Function: With Posture and Pain","review":"This is a refined and refinded text of an excellent book.

I was so involved with the plot and never read anything like it before. Great job Nora! Keep it up!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished the book and usually all the books that i read from Nora are ALWAYS a 5 star book, well not this one. The book was good interesting but at the end of the book it left a few things that i would have love for the author to go over, it ended soooo fast! Let me just warned that this book is not the regular romantic Rora's book this book has a lot of violence related to a cult and dark religion. The characters are nice with a good personality... but not one of her best book especially after reading The Reef."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ok although i have read a lot of books in this category i havent read much NR but what i have read I liked a lot. However this book fell flat for me. First of all though the story was interesting overall there wasnt a single character that was. Even the main protagonists were as a whole boring as was their relationship. Sure there was a little conflict between them but pretty much they liked eachother got together and end of story. No real connection was built for me. Also to top it off the book was sooo long! Not horrible but wouldnt reccomend!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. With that said, after reading this book, I had to wonder what happened. The ending, which is supposed to give closure and connect all the dots from the story, left me wondering why I bothered to read to the end. It also left me wondering if there is another book that lets us find out what the heck happened to Min Atherton.The romance in the book was really non-existent. You didn't feel Clare and Cam connecting, and the synopsis of the book claims that he was in love with her ten years before, which did not turn out to be the case.The book leaves you with a lot of questions: What happens to the rest of the cult, what happens to Ernie, what is it that Cam has to tell Clare that he says can wait til later, how do they turn out, does she address the relationship with her mother and new stepfather, how does the town react to everything, and I can probably come up with a million more.The book was okay. Definitely rates higher than boredom. But this was not classic Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I liked this book but it was pretty creepy. Not one of her best books, but I'd say within the top 20 books."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Normally, I love any book by Nora Roberts. However, this book was pure torture for me in its first 300 pages. I couldn't get into it and I also couldn't feel the chemistry between Clare and Cam. If it wasn't for my insane need to finish a book I'm reading, I would have chucked it long before it started to get interesting. This book could have been 200 pages shorter and I lost interest again somewhere past page 500. I had to keep telling myself, \\"You're almost done. Not too much longer.\\" And the ending? Wha??? Like the reviewer before me said, I like to have the ending be nice and sweet, not like this ending was. I won't be reading this again and I put this up on [...] before I was even done with this book. I'm just glad this wasn't the first book of hers I read."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have not read much of Nora Roberts, but I like her romance and writing style. I didn't enjoy this one so much. Maybe I was uncomfortable with the Satanism as subject matter (reading the back of the book doesn't prepare you for how in depth it gets about the sacrificial rites). I was just mostly bored with Claire. Her angst was overdone. She misses her dad, she's still grieving, everything reminds her of him, OK already, WE GET IT. And did Nora Roberts get a kickback from Pepsi and Hostess to advertise how great Pepsi tastes on a hot day, or how handy Twinkies are to have in the kitchen for all the town kids who come hang around your front yard? Please."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I couldn't believe my luck when I picked this up at a Half Price Books for a dollar. And it's worth every penny of it and more. It's intriguing that you really don't want to put it down unless you really have to.I enjoyed reading as it is a change from the usual NR love stories. The part on Clare's subconscious mind keeps coming back to haunt her after all these years of supression and the vivid description of the rituals sends chills down my spine .The story may be a little predictable, with the hero saving his love. All in all, I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"It is not only an intriguing story that keeps you interested all the way to the end, but the characters are very well developed. A very well written novel.I really enjoyed the book and will definitely try more from Roberts."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you are into books with a dark mood and don't mind some Satan worship in your stories, then you will enjoy this book.Clare Kimball, now a well-known artist, returns to her hometown of Emmitsville to face some of her nightmares and come to terms with her life. Cam Rafferty, the new town sheriff, grew up with Clare. He returned to Emmitsville after his partner was killed in the line of duty.Clare has been suffering through nightmares that involve a cult and her father for most of her life. When people in town are murdered and Clare stumbles upon a Satanist bible that belonged to her father, she and Cam start investigating the murders together.While Nora Roberts can write wonderful books, this was not one I enjoyed. The characters didn't have a strong relationship and seemed a bit shallow. There was way too much sexual violence for me to handle."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I waited a long time to review this book. I didn't really like this book.I can usually say that even Nora Roberts weakest books are better than some of the better books of other authors. However, I was very dissapointed with this book. I found it to be very depressing. I had a hard time reading it and almost put it down without finishing it.I am sure that there others who will disagree with me. I just found that this book was just a bit too much on the dark side for me."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book will keep you reading long into the night. I was surprised at the graphic nature of the book but it wasn't offensive and because I'm such a huge Nora Robert's fan I was delighted with it.Without Consent"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Nora Roberts doesn't disappoint with this novel. Her writing style is superb and masterful. She is able to weave in characters and plot with artistic finesse without sounding clich&eacute; and stressed. I fell in love with Clare and Cameron. I wasn't surprised by the people who comprised the \\"satan\\" group but it was a suspenseful read throughout."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I read this book in 1992 when I was in high school, it was my first Nora Roberts book and hooked me for life. I have re-read this book several times over the years and still it reamins one of my favorites. There is suspense, romance, terror, Clare is strong, and Cam made my heart beat faster."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I figure its only fair to let you know up front that I love Nora Roberts. I should also let you know up front that I don't love all of her books. In fact, I can't stand some of them.That being said, this book scared the crap out of me. And that is AWESOME. I really love when a book that is supposed to scare you does the job so completely. I mean, stuff about the occult skeeves me out a little bit anyway but Roberts somehow gets into the minds of these characters, lets the reader get to know them (maybe even like them) and then just BAM - hits you with something so creepy it makes your insides cringe.On to the love story. I like it. I think the reason I gave it a four stars instead of five is because of the love story. Its not that it wasn't good or entertaining, it just wasn't very interesting. Clare and Cameron have chemistry but for the most part it goes unexplored and leaves the reader wanting a little bit more angst. I don't really know if its a conscious effort on the part of Roberts to put more focus on the occult/whodunit storyline but it lacks the Roberts umph.All in all awesome read, especailly when you're feeling in a particularly creepy reading mood."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the only Nora Roberts book that I have actively disliked. I hated the ending. For me if a book about good and evil ends without evil being defeated then it is a very lousy book. I read romance so I can feel good when I close the book. When I closed this one good was definitely not what I was feeling. Yes the smaller evil was defeated, but the greater evil survived and the book's heroes were left ignorant of that fact. Hated the ending."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Honestly I don't understand why people keep saying this book was so disturbing, I personally found it intriguing. I adore light romance novels, but this really was gripping. It grabbed you and would not let go until you finished. The dark undertone truly is what made this book in my opinion. The different characters are portrayed well and the ending is a complete surprise unlike some of Roberts' books.Now all this being said, I still wouldn't recommend this book for people who are easily disturbed. I started reading Roberts' books when I was twelve (two years ago) while I enjoyed her lighter romances, I looooved this one. She took more of her J.D Robb persona into this book, I think. Over the last few years of her work I begin to notice a pattern, The newer the books get, the more graphic and violently inclined they are. Frankly, I enjoy her newer books much more than her old ones simply because she adds to the characters and the plot so much more.Anyway here's a summary:Within the dark woods of Emmitsboro something evil spreads its poisonous power. Now the once-peaceful town is wrapped in a cloak of terror, hiding a teacherous heart. And now Clare must pay the price for digging up the secrets of the past. . . and confront an evil that may be unstoppable -- because those who practice it may be divine.A decade ago, sculptor Clare Kimball fled Emmitsboro, Maryland, to take the art world by storm. Now she's celebrated as the artist of her generation. But no amount of success can eclipse the nightmares that haunt her--or the memories of her father's suicide. Just as her star is shining brighter than ever, Clare leaves it all behind to face her demons.Emmitsboro sheriff Cameron Rafferty loved Clare from afar all through high school. Now that she's back, they form a bond that grows stronger each day--fueled by an attraction that's been simmering for years. But Clare's past soon rises up with a vengeance, rocking the town with a sinister murder that is clearly linked to her return. As an investigation gets under way, Clare and Cameron will learn that evil can linger anywhere--even in those you love and trust the most. But it's a discovery that may come too late to save them....One more time for kicks, I truly loved this book!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"B+Forgettable? Probably. \\"Divine Evil\\" kept me entertained throughout and there was never really a dull moment.I'm still not sure why this wasn't a 5 Star for me...it might have been the characters (or maybe just my personal lack of connection with them), or the fact that the \\"cult\\" killed and raped for more than 20 years and no one in this teeny/gossipy small town noticed. WTH?!Even after my negatives this was still a great summer read and I really enjoyed it. Nora never lets you down (well until her recent works)...When you buy one of her books you always have the comfy cozy \\"never a waste of money\\" feeling b/c you know you're getting a good story, fast action, a real romance, and an ending that never leaves any questions unanswered."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a VERY different kind of book if you are used to reading Nora Roberts series such as the Three Sisters Island trilogy, Donovan books, McGregor books or others -- even the JD Robb \\"In Death\\" books. The occult and Satanism are scary subjects. I really enjoyed this book as it showed insight into small town life, and the faces we show and who we really are.The romance between Clare and Cameron is well done and the secondary characters are very interestingly developed especially Ernie Butts, her neighbor. This book was originally written over 12 years ago but I think it still stands up very well.I loved the mystery and surprises as well!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is one of Robert's best. The book is written so vivdly that it completely absorbes you into the story, almost like you are there. I found I couldn't wait to get home to find out what happened next. I read this right after Sea Swept/Inner Harbor/Rising Tides ( a fabulous trilogy) Roberts is amazing. It is really worth the read. Those who might be scared or squemish....GET OVER IT after all it's only fiction and GREAT fiction at that....Enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Im not usually into the whole satan worshiping book, when I started it I was going &#34;man i just wasted my money&#34; but I read it and it was actually a really really good book. Kept me on the edge of my seat, I think I read it in a couple of days. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I agree with the other review about this being the only N.R. I dislike. The story is ok, the guy is pretty good, but the main character Clare is the most annoying stupid women ever!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I rated this three stars. Not because of the author but because of the manner it was changed to an e-book. Once again, as with many other e-books, I find misspellings, multiple careless running together of paragraphs that are confusing and difficult to read, bad or incorrect punctuation, all of which makes this a poor read. Amazon could and should do much better than this. Perhaps it is the publisher, but who ever is at fault, Amazon is getting a bad rep from this."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Normally I dont' like darker books like this, but I enjoyed reading this book overall. I definetely had to get through it so I knew what happened, but the end is a twist, it's strange but okay."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"In a word, bleech, terrible story. Gratuitous violence, sadistic scenes, beleaguered hero at every turn who is stuck with the most irritating heroine I've run across in a long time - snippy know-it-all who acts like a 12-year-old most of the time. By the time she was captured I thought good, glad to see her go. With all the fantastic stories Nora Roberts has written, why oh why was this foisted off on the public as a re-release?! Truly, IMO it's an embarrassment both to the author and the reader who is disgruntled at themselves for finishing the darn thing. It should have had its first and last printing in 1992. Save your money."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although this book is a little dated (everyone but everyone smokes!), I really enjoyed it--partly because I'm a big Nora fan and can see how her craft has evolved over the decades and dozens of books.Much heavier on the suspense/mystery portion than the romance, but I like that, so I have no complaints at all. I was pretty sure I knew who the villain(s) were but the very last twist caught me by surprise.Left me with some unpleasant memories/thoughts, but over all I really enjoyed this book. I'm going to be downloading her other older ones--ones that I missed years ago."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but could tell it was written some time ago. It didn't bother me, because it was vintage Nora Roberts.It's got a great romance, but the subplot about a satanic cult and the suspense that goes along with it was center stage for me. I really enjoyed it and am going to download Carnal Innocence next.I like Roberts's newer books, but it's fun to go back and read these older ones too."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Alot of people gave this book alot of crap and I almost didnt get it, Glad I did because it was a great book and the story and characters were very interesting. the horror was no where near what people were saying."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Nora Roberts is one of the finest writers I have come across in a long time for mystery and romance. Divine Evil did not let me down. I have enjoyed all of her books and I shall continue to purchase her books. She writes so that you seem to actually be there. Her style is very good and she keeps you riveted to her books. Overall, she is a top notch writer in my opinion."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it was definitely not a typical romance novel. The subject was very dark. I just couldn't put it down, though! In fact, I got on here this evening to see if there were other books featuring some of the characters, include Clare's friends from New York, her brother, and even the dancer. I would love to read more!I loved how it ended. I do enjoy older Stephen King stories, though. I think someone who reads strictly romance would probably not find this book to be nearly as enjoyable as I did."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"In reading other reviews, I see that people were disappointed that there was not the degree of romance usually present in most Nora Roberts' books and were upset at the satanism and violence depicted. Well . . . perhaps the title &quot;Divine Evil&quot; should have been the first clue that this was not a &quot;Dance Upon Air&quot; type book. I suppose in the romance genre, this story was a little more violent than is expected, but for a mystery, it was very mild. This was really more in line with NR's Eve Dallas and Roarke mysteries. I liked Cam and Clare, as well as the supporting characters. Although not a typical NR's ending, I liked the twist. I also did not think there was any confusion about Clare and Cam at the end -- you knew they would end up together and they did. Even though this is an earlier work, I also would like to see a sequel with Blair."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I rarely write reviews on the many, many books that I have read but the reviews written by other readers of Divine Evil have prompted me to write this one. Divine Evil is the very first Nora Roberts book that I read probably in the early 90's and I have always considered it my favorite! It marks the beginning of my love affair with almost every Nora Roberts book written and I have very seldom been disappointed. Divine Evil is morbidly fascinating in the descriptions of a small town cult with townspeople disappearing as sacrifice. I believe loyal Nora Roberts fans would find this book worth reading."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think the book deserves 2.5 stars rather than 3, but you know the routine. Firstly I think the editors did a poor job with this book. I found many grammatical errors and I'm by no means a stickler for that kind of thing. I found myself re-reading sentences over and over again because they made no sense to me. You'd think this sort of thing would have been corrected on a re-print.Now the story - I liked the concept, but I don't think it was developed properly. I could be wrong, but it sounds like from the other reviews that \\"Divine Evil\\" is one of Nora Roberts earlier works and it shows. It was rather predictable - as predictable as the woman ALWAYS falling when the killer is chasing her. I did enjoy Roberts' imagery. She does a great job of painting a picture; at times I felt I could see everything right in front of me. Although, she did overdo it at times - i.e. Clare and her junk food. OK, we get the point that Clare can eat anything and be rail thin, but jeesh, I'm surprised this chick has all her real teeth. She sends kids to the store to buy junk food, carries Twinkies in her purse, and doesn't sound as if she's all that attractive to look at. I can't help but think Nora was on a diet while she was writing this book.The romance between Cam and Clare was a bit much for me. It seemed to develop SUPER fast. I realize they knew each other growing up, but according to both characters, they barely uttered a word to each other. After a few days they're in bed with each other (not absurd nowadays) and discussing marriage only after a few weeks/month dating (that's absurd). No wonder why our divorce rate is so high.The story line is creepy and living in a small town myself made me wonder what was lurking in the woods. It kept me on the edge enough to keep reading, but if something more interesting had come along I think the book would have easily been put aside."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"First, this a a reissue. The orginal copywrite is 1992 in hardcover. I feel the publishers were out to make a quick buck off the reputation of Nora Robert's work since then. I also noted the book was never mass marketed until now, 15 year later.It was a bad book then and it's a bad book now. The publishers know this, I'm pretty sure that's why it was never mass marketed in the early 1990's.I know Nora Robert's name on a cover can sell a book, but I'm becoming more discriminating after this waste of money.The romantic characters relationship is never fully developed. The fact they knew each other years ago doesn't change that. The female lead is just a weird, junk food eating slob. There's just no appeal.She decides to go back to her small hometown and face down some of her demons. Little does she know, there are literally some real demons running around this quiet, sleepy town. The book focuses mainly on the activites of this devil worshipping cult. This story tells of their deeds in more detail than you probably want to know. That said, there was nothing suspenseful for me, I knew almost immediately who their cult leader was. This book is definitely not a romance. It is not a suspenseful romance. It's just kind of weird.Nora Roberts is a good writer so I can't say this book was poorly written but, it is rather gruesome and quite predictable."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought this was one of Nora Roberts' best novels so far. It had the perfect balance of romance and suspense, and all the details were so vivid that I felt I was right there with all the characters. The ending was a complete surprise; not what I expected at all. I was totally engrossed in this book from the time I opened it up until the time I finished the last page. If you only read one Nora Roberts book, make it this one!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book shows how versatile Roberts is. We still had the 'romance'and the happy ending but...., she added alot of darkness and shock also. She gave us many clues along the way but I was still not quite prepared for the ending. Also, it was 500 pages! I can go thru 200-350 page books in about 24-36 hours."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read most of Nora Roberts books at this time. This book however is a very poor example of her skill. It is much deeply evil and uncomfortably graphic. It has a strange aura of the occult which does not fit into her usually great stories and personal relationships."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Nora Roberts has outdone herself! Divine Evil is one of the best romantic suspense novels I've read. Although it's packed full of grotesque imagery and revolting rituals, I would recommend this book, especially to anyone who loves horror and high suspense. If you're faint of heart, however,pass it up -- it's graphic, violent, and will give leave you with nightmares."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been reading lots &amp; lots of Nora's stories in the past year and a half. For me, DIVINE EVIL is one of her VERY BEST. This is a story that I would recommend to a NON-reader of romance simply because it's not your typical romance. In fact, the romance takes a back seat (it's still there -- between Cam &amp; Clare -- very well done) to a creepy, suspenseful plot that will make you think twice about your nightmares of the past.From the opening nightmare scene, you know that DIVINE EVIL is going to show-off the darker side of Nora's wonderful imagination. Clare awakens, screaming, remembering a Satanic-like cult ceremony involving her father. The dreams, the horrific death of her father, and a sense of unsettlement, all bring Clare back to her hometown of Emmitsboro -- and her childhood home.Cameron Rafferty has also returned to his roots -- as the town sheriff. The chemistry is strong between Cam &amp; Clare -- their developing romance is very believable.Because Clare begins to dig into the past to try to figure out why her father died -- and because of the mysterious death of a run-away &amp; the attack on a traveler -- the &quot;cult&quot; begins to escalate in its activities -- especially as it attempts to &quot;cover its tracks.&quot;Again, this story is not for the faint of heart. Nora makes you think twice about your neighbors in small town America -- especially with the twisted ending of this can't-put-me-down thriller.Great stuff. I hope that Nora touches on her imagination's &quot;dark side&quot; again -- soon! (Montana Sky &amp; Carnal Innocence, along w/her J.D. Robb DEATH books are close -- but I want MORE!)"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I once would have said I love all of Nora Roberts' books. I can't say that now. This book was schizophrenic, in that, when it wasn't being violently mean it was being \\"stupid-heroine-keeps-running-into-places-she-shouldn't.\\" The only excuse I can see for the lack of quality in this book is that it wasn't written 13 years ago. Maybe Roberts was still feeling her way into the romantic suspence genre. But no way, did Divine Evil deserve to be reissued in hardback. Publishers want big bucks though, so they'll dig up anything by a famous author to make more money. The rituals of a Satanic cult which lie at the heart of evil in this book are portrayed over and over and over again with mindless, bloody violence. It was stomach-turning and the only reason I kept reading was I was hoping that the relationship between the hero and heroine would make up for it. I was disappointed. Clare is one of those women who thinks she always knows best, who is so independent and blind to the fact that others might know more than she does, that she refuses to accept the truth about what's going on around her, hides what she does know about the crimes, and blithely goes off on a crusade to save people from themselves. She ends up in a nightmare, and I began to feel she deserved it. Her sheriff lover is going to have deal with her stupidity for years. I'm sorry for him. I won't tell you not to read this book. Afterall it did have some good characters and Roberts writes well even when she's writing trashy. So go ahead, but don't blame me if on balance you end up with a bad taste in your mouth."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Bought this book a few days ago and even with the big pgs. count found it quite easy to get through. Clare Kimball is coming back to Emmitsville MD. after a difficult past. Equally interesting is Cam Rafferty the sheriff. Weird murders are taking place in this small town and Clare everyone thinks has the answer to them. Granted this book is not a typical Nora book,but I found it quite fascinating and enjoying Nora's new style of the occult and paganism. I can see why a lot of people don't like this book because of the sexual violence of women and other people,but I think in this book you have to look beyond this view to see the outcome. Yes,the romance and quirky humor is still there,but toned down for seriousness of the book. I really enjoyed this book,but if your not into sexual rape and murder don't read this book. I love reading about horror and the supernateral so this not affect me very much. I also think that people get creeped out being that this book to place in a very small town and a lot of people knew each other for years."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was good....I mean it is a 5 because it's well written and it hold attention...it's not a WOW CANT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN kinda book but it was like: Hmmm wow this is weird let me read to see whta will happen after...ok Im done....that's what it was like. The scenes with the Satanic cult are like any other gruesome scenes in one of her books which adds to the mystery.

However, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The love story was secondary to the primary focus on death, graphic violence, senseless murders, and satanic ritual. The characters of Clare and Cam were never fully developed. The purpose of the Ernie character was predictable from the very beginning.I much prefer Nora's \\"lighter\\" treatments of witchcraft, as depicted in the Three Sisters Trilogoy. Even the sometimes too realistic Eve Dallas stories pale in comparison to this book. A true disappointment."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really liked this book the charters were great. Clare and Cam were great.

I have loaned it out to friends and family who have enjoyed it. I always make sure I remember who has it, as I check to make sure it comes back the way I loaned it to them.

This one is the best one that I've read in a long time. She keeps the suspense up through the whole book and manages to keep you thinking about the book even after you are done with it.

Just a warning though: set aside time to read this one, because you are not going to want to put it down."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This story went a little beyond the typical Nora Roberts crime/romance story.

It makes for such interesting plot lines."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you like romantic suspense, you'll love this book. The romance is good -- two strong people who fight their commitment fears together.But the suspense in the book is even better -- and the villians are ones you don't expect. And while the romance wraps up just like you'd expect, the suspenseful part of the book will leaving you gaping as you read the last page!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Me, myself, and I loved this book. A lot of Nora's books are well written as this but this was an excellent find.... I am a sucker for the murder/suspense/ hero plot and this was one that got me from the get go. As in a previous review those who are quick readers may not want to read before bed time because it can and will make you shiver and make you dream. Nora's hand at suspense did well this time. You may be able to figure some of the details out but you won't be entirely sure until they are totally revealed. An excellent read for the reader of suspense and terror with a dash of hot loving and vivid emotions in the mix."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Nora Roberts writes very interesting and exciting novels, usually. This book is not up to my standards for her. There did not need to be so much violence in the story, or at least such detail about it. I skipped over many pages because it made me VERY uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just read this book and I think it is Nora's best book yet. It didn't try to sugar coat things. It set out to tell a love story with a dangerous twist. It was great. I loved the main male character, Cam, and I thought that Clare was a really good female character. I liked the kid Ernie, how he started to think at the end. I thought it was good how they didn't have one church yelling at another. One bad guy yelling at one good guy. Every character had a little bit of bad and every character had a little bit of good. It was realistic in that sense."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I honestly had to look twice to make sure this was a Nora Roberts book. I have been reading her books for years but this in one I cannot finish. It's way too graphic and not a romance at all.

I'm very disappointed in this book but I will keep reading Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"The guarantee of the romance genre is a happy ending so the reader ends the book with a sigh, full of hopeful, positive feelings.

It's very simple to be able to tell a reissue from a new book. OPEN IT AND CHECK THE PUBLISHING DATE!! I'm so sick of people whining about books not being brand new, when they don't even bother to open the book and look. Also, all of Nora's new novels have her logo and the \\"First Time in Print\\" plastered on the cover. There you go. No more reason to complain and give a book one star because it's a reissue and you feel hosed."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought the book was pretty good, but there was so many holes that you kinda wanted to go to the end and re-write it yourself. I HATED the ending. Not typical Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This Nora Roberts is one of my all time favourites. She really delves into the human soul and shows you what lies beneath the surface of social veneer. I also enjoyed reading about Clare's creative process, how her dreams and her life influenced her art. This book will truly take you through a wide range of emotions, the suspense is masterful and the wonderful love story is just the icing on the cake. (Smooth, Rich, Creamy, Chocolate Icing!)"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"First of all I want to warn people who have not read DIVINE EVIL to seriously reconsider about reading this. DIVINE EVIL is not your average horror or mystery. It is full of controversies and blasphemies. There's such things as satanism, murder and rape. Although the last two conditions are sort of expected, the way Nora Roberts play this out is very scary.DIVINE EVIL isn't one of those happily ever after type books so if you guys do plan to read this book, beware. The author leaves you hanging and after I just finished this book, I was just surprised because usually Roberts give you a sense of peace and closure but the author doesn't give you this in DIVINE EVIL.I had a hard time reading this book because the scenes were really violent and chilling but it was also very interesting. I wanted to find out how it ends and how the author would end it because this is a very deep issue in society. But the author doesn't really end it in a satisfying way. Besides the closure, the plot and scense were explained graphically and vividly. So much that you can just play it in your head.But I think people who have a faint heart should not read this book because the book is just really evil."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"My wife reads Nora Roberts like I eat popcorn. I don't know how many she has written but it must be a ton, for the last six months she has read dozens but there is one she hasn't read, Divine Evil. Oh, certainly she stared to devour Divine Evil but stopped about two chapters into the book and put it, unfinished on my nightstand, saying \\"it's more your kind of book\\". Yes that's right, she likes happy vanilla type books and I like a little more meat in my reading.Divine Evil is about an up and coming artist, sculptress actually, from the small country, probably fictitious, town of Emmitsboro, Maryland. The intermittent nightmares Claire Kimball has been having since she was eight have returned and it's interfering with her creativity. She begins to feel uncomfortable in New York, so she decides to go back to her childhood home and see if she can make a fresh start there in the old family home that her twin brother had previously been renting out.Even before she gets there strange things start happening. Sheriff Cameron (Cam) Rafferty is called to the local graveyard because someone has dug up and removed the hundred year old corpse of a child. Cam himself had recently returned from a stint as a Washington D.C. detective to take over the sheriff's duties after the twenty year veteran had quit and left town in a hurry.Cam and Claire knew each other from high school. They each had a tragedy in their childhood, both lost fathers to untimely accidents and they were attracted to each other. Claire resisted at first but eventually joined Cam in a romantic liaison. Things were progressing quite well romantically but peculiar things kept interfering in their courtship. A fifteen year old runaway disappears after last being seen near Emmitsboro and Cam's hateful step father is beaten to death so bad that almost every bone in his body is broken. In addition evidence of Satanism starts to appear such as a decapitated cat on Claire's rear porch and of course Claire's nightmare seems to depict a Satanic ritual. After that things that start to spin out of control and eventually put their lives in danger.CONCLUSIONThe problem I had with Devine Evil had nothing to do with Nora Roberts writing style. Having written about a million and a half books, she obviously knows how to write. Her writing is creative, slightly humorous and a little endearing. Her character development was good as you really got a feel for the main characters, especially Claire Kimball and Cameron Rafferty, although Claire seemed a little obtuse when it came to grasping events. No, the problem I had was with the subject matter.I haven't read anything else by Nora Roberts, though I did read one of her alter ego, J D Robb novels, and I don't think she has written any other Horror/Terror/Thrillers and it shows. If she did my wife wouldn't have read it. For me the plot was a little silly and the ending was easily anticipated. It wasn't so much how it would end but how would we get there.Divine Evil never really gets scary. In some respects it almost seems like the Keystone Cops practicing Devil worship. It's sort of like Happy Days meets I know What You Did Last SummerI would suggest to Ms. Roberts, that before she tackles any more books in this genre she should read a few by the masters, Stephen King, F. Paul Wilson and Dean Koontz among others. There is no comparison."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought Nora Roberts' DIVINE EVIL was very well written. It was one of the best books I've read lately. Roberts' writing style is awesome and her characters are very complex and dark. Jean-Paul Le Beau is definitely one of my favorite characters as is his wife, Angie. The two are so sarcastic and I love that. Cam Rafferty is by far my favorite hero. The rebel turned sheriff of a sleepy little town who finally gets the girl he's loved for a long time. This book is great."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I found this story excellent. I really enjoyed the somewhat cookie cutter small town with the it's not so sweet after taste. The supporting characters were well developped without taking too much time away from the central characters. Though Claire seemed a bit touchy and in denial here and there, Cam's excellent common-sense more than made up for it. Other good points: Claire's creative process cleaverly included in the plot and dialogue, Cam's rocky relationship with his Mother, the turbulent teenager accross the street, the flowing dialogue and of course Claire's best friends Angie and Jean-Paul.The mystery wasn't very suspensful, but it was still very well developped. I thouroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it all NR fans, especially those who are also fans of J.D. Robb."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Artist Clare Kimball returns to her hometown to try to figure out the nightmares that have always invaded her sleep only to find things pretty much as they were when she left. There is one significant change that is noticeable - bad boy Cameron Rafferty is now the local sheriff.As one of the few who mix romance and mystery perfectly, Nora Roberts has another winner with DIVINE EVIL. The villain in this story had this bibliophile fooled until almost the end! I was so caught up in the entwining of personalities and players, that I didn't see this one coming. I won't tell you if it was the obvious or the least palpable or someone in the middle, but I will say that this is one of my all time favorites!Evil takes on a new definition in this tale that is so reprehensible that no one would think something like this would live in a small town like Emmitsboro. Roberts weaves into the story of Clare Kimball the unexplained bizarre death of her father from years before. The reader isn't sure if this is part of the evil or an excellent attempt to throw you off the track of the evildoers. The great part of DIVINE EVIL is the subplots designed to keep the reader off guard until you're hit upside the head with the truth. Toss in romance to give the reader a chance to catch your breath, and it's the formula for a best-selling novel."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was good....I mean it is a 5 because it's well written and it hold attention...it's not a WOW CANT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN kinda book but it was like: Hmmm wow this is weird let me read to see whta will happen after...ok Im done....that's what it was like.

I usually cannot put them down once I start reading them. This book was full of darkness and evil and definitely not in the same category as her other books. I hope Nora Roberts stays with flesh and blood characters and out of the occult and demonic from now on!

This one was not a disappointment either. From the start to the finish this author kept me engaged and wanting to read more. The storyline gets a bit dark, evil and very graphic in parts and may not be for everyone but I was not disappointed.Set in a small town where everyone knows your business and you know theirs is a great back drop for this story. The one place where you would least expect to find this kind of dark, gruesome activity.As Clare falls in love and then gets involved in solving the murders you have to cheer her on and to want to help her and in some places just put your arm around her and comfort her.I didn't care for the ending very much. A fight between good and evil should end with evil being defeated...not with it getting away. I wonder if it is because Roberts at one point was thinking of writing a sequel to this book and then changed her mind???"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read it years ago.

As a romance a 1.This book should NEVER be categorized as a romance. One problem with this book is that I wanted to read a character driven romance and ended up with a Stephen King horror. I also felt that this book ended abruptly, there was no closure. How did the town feel afterward, what happened to the cult worshipers, etc.This book was difficult and disturbing read. I don't recommend that you read it before bedtime. I generally am not that disturbed by what I read, but I definately did not sleep well the night I finished this book.Be warned not your typical Nora Roberts romance. If you are bothered by the occult and graphic violence pass this by."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Some will disagree with me but I love this book. I became a Nora fan last summer and haven't been able to stop reading her wonderful novels. When I started reading this book, I was taken aback by the graphic nature of it. Not that it offended me but that Nora had the guts to write a novel that would touch so many nerves! I love the characters and how she always has a way of describing each and every one of them, even the small bit players, so that you can picture just how they would look and be. This novel is definitely dark and not a &quot;typical&quot; romance novel but it still is a great read. I recommend if you like suspense and romance tied together. If you are squeamish about cults and satanism, I would avoid reading this book and stick to one of her many other brilliant novels. She has so many to choose from and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is another great read from Nora Roberts who rarely disappoints me. Her characters are nearly always lovable and her stories emotionally satisfying and this one is no exception. It's about satanic cults and, although never gruesomely graphic, certain scenes may bother some readers (read this one with all the lights on!).The heroine, a famous artist, decides it's time to go back home and face the demons of her past when she finds herself struggling with her creativity and having terrible nightmares. There she meets the hero Cam, former town troublemaker turned sheriff, who has his own set of problems. Mixed in between the terrific love story is a gripping tale of a town caught in the midst of a satanic cult and its effects on the people surrounding the h/h. The ending was a shocking surprise. This one makes you think twice about how well we ever really know someone."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is one of the few &quot;romance&quot; type books I have read.

I did not see it coming! I have purchased Montana Sky and Sanctuary for future reading. Being from Maryland, I had heard about Nora Roberts, but had never read her. I think I was missing something, to be honest. I recommend this to anyone wanting a diversion, a little bit scary, with some romantic suspense. A winner! I also recommend the wonderful Barbara Michaels, and Kay Hooper.Kathleen"},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Nora Roberts is a truly gifted writer. What I love about her stories is that they stay so fresh in my mind, even after having read some of them several years ago. I can only pray that I'll be able to forget this one. Unfortunately her gift of description was used to describe in great detail pure evil, Satanism, rituals and enough perversity to give me a nervous stomach to contend with. I have read more Romantic Suspense than I can count, but this book in no way falls under that category in my opinion! It should be in the Occult section. I can't even recommend reading it for the love story because it's so lacking. I would say about ten percent of this book dealt with a great couple that I would have liked to read more about. The last conversation between the hero and the heroin leaves you hanging abominably. And the \\"twist\\" at the end was terrible, and ridiculously unbelievable. I can't even believe that I'm saying this about a Roberts book, but I strongly advise skipping this one. It's not worth the sick feeling that I hope soon fades.For great Romantic Suspense I recommend every other Nora Roberts, Susan Anderson, Cherry Adair, Lauren Bach, Jane Graves, Linda Howard, and \\"To Trust a Stranger\\" by Karen Robards."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is suspenseful, disturbing, and yet still manages to include a wonderful love story. If you are looking for a straight romance, this probably isn't the book for you. However, if you enjoy great romantic suspense and can handle a few graphic and gruesome scenes, you will love this book.Clare is a famous artist who decides to return to the town where she grew up, Emmitsboro, to face her personal demons, and hopefully rid herself of them. Unfortunately, Clare's nightmare is only beginning! Clare develops a reltionship with Cam, a former bad-boy turned town sherrif, and together they try to piece together the events surrounding Clare's father's mysterious death years before and the strange and violent events that are currently going on in their sleepy little town. Clare and Cam are a great couple, and a compelling and touching love story develops amidst the horror of what is going on in the woods outside of town. Evidence of a satanic cult is discovered, and its members may be closer than Clare and Cam ever would have thought. As Clare and Cam come closer to the truth, and piece together facts from Clare's terrible recurring nightmares, their lives are put in jeopardy because of what they know. Soon all hell breaks loose and it's up to Cam to save the day.This book is thrilling and well-written.

The subject matter seemed to be just like many of Roberts' novels, with a tale of romance intertwined with a tale of trial, heartbreak and action. Only, once I got into this book, my opinion changed. All in all, this book creeped me out. I don't know if Roberts was going through some cult phase or whatever, but this book was certainly not like any of the others she has written. If you are a person who is not bothered when reading about sexual rites and animal sacrifices, then go ahead and read it.

Normally I buy Nora's books and circulate them to my friends and family but this one I had to throw away. It just felt too evil. I didn't even want it around. I am not saying ban the book or anything, but be aware before you read it that it isn't Nora's typical style."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"I felt that Nora was experimenting with her audience to see how much horror they could absorb. I did not like the fact that there was no &quot;good vs. evil&quot; in the traditional sense. The whole town was caught up in the corruptive power of the devil (evil) without there being any religious intervention (good). Where were the church leaders? Every town has at least one.

My mother and I both read Roberts, so often we trade books. PUBLIC SECRETS, THE REEF, MONTANA SKY and DIVINE EVIL are her best works because they aren't just romances; they have mystery and hidden surprises, thickening plots with twists and turns that keep you in the novel.

She meets up with an old acquaintance, Sheriff Cam Rafferty. And learns that maybe her nightmares are actually memories.This book was, well, evil. Couldn't believe it was Nora Roberts. First of all, if you're looking for a ROMANTIC suspense, do NOT read this book. I would not consider this a romance at all. The \\"romance\\" in this book had come and gone before you realize that there's the teeniest sliver of tender feelings. You're like, \\"Wait... what? That's it?!\\" And the synopsis is misleading. It says that Cam Rafferty had loved Clare from afar when they were younger, when NO, he didn't. More like he had HEARD OF HER from afar. Which doesn't change the plot, but I had a vision in my head about his long lost love coming home to him- I have NEVER been more wrong. The cult ritual descriptions were terrifying. I got chills, it was so disturbing. The ending- there is no real ending. Everything just gets cut off and there's no more to read. There was so much potential, and I was so incredibly disappointed.

BIG disappointment."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the very first Nora Roberts book I could not be bothered to finish and I put it down after page 89.

I loved her books about he Concannons, the Quinn brothers and so many more but lately it seems that lots of her books are about women/children being raped and I must say it sickens me some, also I am getting a bit tired of all the demons, satanism etc scenarios. So no, all in all, not worth buying."},{"Title":"Divine Evil (Random House Large Print)","review":"Nora Roberts is a great writer and I have loved every book of hers that I have ever read... EXCEPT THIS ONE! As has been noted, there was no counter-balance of good with evil by having the intervention or even the advice of a clergyman. The book was entirely too dark and some of the scenes were downright horrifying. Nora, was it really necessary to show the rape, murder, and human sacrifice of a 15 yr. old girl, at all, much less in all its gory detail??? Was it really necessary to explain in the end that good DIDN'T ultimately triumph over evil in this story??? I skipped through parts of this book because there was only so much of it I could take and I have never skipped through Nora's books before.If you've read this book, toss it into the trash.

I guess I was wrong. This book disturbed me to the core and it also offended me. I read romance novels to escape, they are my indulgent entertainment and because the worst I can expect from them is some harsh words between characters I've grown to love. It upset me that Ms. Roberts mixed Satanism, vicious statuatory rape and murder with romance and love. I have never once, in my entire life, had the desire to burn a book but after reading this one I nearly felt as though that would be a fitting epitaph for it.

Maybe Nora Roberts fans will like this book. John Saul fans might also like it. Personally, I found everything about it to be simplistic and downright idiotic.The bad guys--Satan worshippers--fill every cliche and leave nothing original. They even call for Jesus when they die from stupidity. The main character, Clare, is a modest, rich, supermodel artist. Very realistic. The love interest, Cam, is a modest, rich, supermodel sheriff. Uh huh. Their chemistry together is a series of cliches taken from 80s movies. You know, I'm all for a dash of romance in a book, but please make it believable.

If you are not famillar with the genuis of a musical novel the idea is incredible. It brings upon an interesting form for exploring the duality of human experience. &quot;Moderato Cantabile&quot;, follows the form of the first movement of a sonata, presenting and developing in two contrasting themes in different keys. &quot;Moderato&quot; the word it self indicating a measure of control taken with the time signaure of a sonata being a square four-four outlines the meter the book follows. Anne's (the main character) life in the first theme starts out structured and boring. In the second chapter she begins her strange affair with Chauvin. Chauvin, or the the second theme is Ann's quest for the &quot;cantabile&quot; (the lyrical impulse, or exit from the first theme of boredom). They meet again and again, at the same bar and always at the same time of day, unitl the eighth chapter. Then, just as the eighth note of a musical scale is the same as the first (but an octave higher) the final resolution comes in the form of a symbolic reenactment of the murder that occurs at the end of the first chapter: Chauvin: &quot;I wish you were dead.&quot; Anne: &quot;I already am.&quot; --And Anne returns permanently to her boring life.Brillantly written and a must have in any book collection."},{"Title":"Moderato cantabile (Masterpieces of French literature series)","review":"This novelette (~58 pages) is one of the most technically perfect pieces of fiction I have ever encountered. The \\"plot\\" is fairly conventional (but in many ways is inconsequential to the textual developments). The amount of detail hidden away in the narrative structure is incredible and the construction and crafting are about as perfect as could be desired. The story is interesting on so many levels that repetitive readings continue to illuminate and expand understanding.Consider how Duras plays with objectivity in the first central theme of the novel. After the first reading you'll conclude that a man murdered a woman in a cafe--presumably by shooting her through the heart upon her own request. And yet a closer reading reveals the problems with this assumption: a scream is heard, but no gunshot; blood comes from the victim's mouth, but not her heart; nobody (notably including the primary characters) actually witnessed anything; the man's behavior is unindicative of definitive guilt--perhaps he's simply distraught; the woman was the man's wife (we are told as one of the only \\"omniscient\\" acts of the unknown narrator)--but later an acquaintance notes that the woman \\"was married\\". In short, even the objective \\"murder\\" presented is anything but objective.Instead of reading a story you will end up inventing a plausible reality--just as Anne and Chauvin (the primary characters) invent a plausible reality to explain their unsatisfied (and unsatisfiable) desire.Ever wonder why Anne ignores the closest end-of-work-day siren but pays attention to the farthest-away end-of-work-day siren? Remember that her husband manages a factory. Remember that her husband's factory is the furthest away from the cafe, on the opposite side of town of her house. Remember that she has to beat her husband home from work. Details like this abound, but of course are left to a careful reader to pick them out and assemble them into a larger understanding.Such a beautiful novelette--so well crafted, so enjoyable to read and re-read. Thoroughly recommended.

As with many of Duras' books, one shouldn't expect to the affair to culminate in physical love or if it does, it probably won't be particulary pleasant or satisfying.

It is not until later in the book that one recognizes the brilliance of Duras--that same drop from the ideal is the one experienced daily by her heroine.

(I was perhaps a little struck by the comparison to Monty Python.) I promptly bought \\"A House Called Awful End\\" for my niece, and spent the night ploughing through the book, laughing the entire way. What a brilliant and witty narrative Philip Ardagh spins. Needless to say, I was eagerly awaiting a chance to read more about the mishaps and misadventures of the young Eddie Dickens.\\"Dreadful Acts\\" introduces us once again to the hilariously weird world that Eddie inhabits. He lives in a house called Awful End with his Mad Uncle Jack (who lives in a treehouse, well, a dried-fish house), his even Madder Aunt Maud (who lives in a hollow cow named Marjorie - don't ask if you haven't read the first book), his parents and various other servants who have little sense among the lot of them. Eddie is awoken one morning to find a driverless hearse in the driveway and must contend with the coffin that is left behind and the escapologist inside that coffin, The Great Zucchinni. Eddie's escapades with Zucchinni and his helper Daniella, land Eddie in a variety of troubling positions - jail, helping escaped convicts, and a chase on the misty moors that surround the town.Set in Victorian England, Ardagh peppers his narration with whimsical asides to the readers, definitions of possible little-known words and comments about how our hero might feel if he were in a book. Ardagh's pithy narration is sprinkled with sketches (by David Roberts) that enhance the crazy characters that fill Eddie's life. While the series does read a little like Lemony Snicket, Ardagh has his own style and humor that bring Eddie and his insane relatives to life. And while this may be classified as a children's book, it's intelligence and humor are suited for any adult who appreciates good literature."},{"Title":"Dreadful Acts: Book 2, The Eddie Dickens Trilogy","review":"I really like te Eddie Dickens trilogy.

Like the first, the prose of this book reads almost as if it was written a century ago. The narrator actively speaks to the reader, reminding them that they are reading a book. Here is an example where he's talking about a list of characters:\`I'm beginning to wish that we'd had one of those lists at the beginning of this book, but what's to say that we can't have one over halfway through the adventure?'He then goes on to provide one and congratulates himself for how \`classy' it looks. He does things like this often, explaining the meaning of words he used, asking the reader if they remember something said earlier, and providing a page number to check if they don't, and things like that.Modern books on writing tell us the author should avoid intruding on the story, but I find this style rather quaint and charming, at least in lighthearted books for kids. A.A. Milne did things like this often. Of course, Winnie the Pooh was published in 1926. The first American edition of Dreadful Acts was published in 2003.This short book (128 pages) is mostly about Eddie, a fairly normal young gentleman, and his interaction with several very abnormal adults. The plot is almost secondary, so I won't go into it much. It's really just part of the setting, after all, but it involves escaped convicts, stolen jewels, and a failed magic trick. It's a quick, fun read. I recommend it.

The first installment's adventures are short enough to be completed in one or two nights each and leave plenty of room for the GM to be creative and add their own content. In many cases, this is encouraged. Between some adventures there is enough space to put in one off adventures or to use published adventures such as the ones found in Plundered Vaults.Singing praises does little good in a review, so I'll concentrate on the few problems.First, not enough maps. Middenheim is wonderfully detailed and includes are great map of the city and sewers, but I would have liked to seen a local area map that includes the surrounding countryside. Also, many of the buildings, including some of the main buildings in the various adventures, are not mapped out. These are left to the GM to flesh out, or some such thing. I would still like to see maps for all of the places of any importance.Second, the campaign does not, at least to my mind, allow for elves. I don't see much reason that an elf would want to follow this campaign. Oh, sure, fighting chaos and such, yes. But it seems a lot of what happens are things an elf, whether an aloof High elf or a sylvan minded Wood Elf, would just say \\"oh well, human troubles\\" and be on their way. You have to work a bit harder to get elves involved is all I am saying. With humans you have the religious element of Ulric and Sigmar to make them feel obligated in some way, plus this is their country. Dwarfs, likewise, are somewhat sympathetic toward human endeavors and the Sigmarite cause, what with Sigmar being an ancient dwarfish ally. This is a minor point, but one which caused me some vexation as a GM.Did I mention the history, map and background for Middenheim was top notch? Oh, I guess I did. Well, it is worth the price for that alone."},{"Title":"Paths of the Damned: Ashes of Middenheim (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay) (v. 1)","review":"I'll make it quick: if you're a GM looking to jump right into the revamped WFRP with your party this is the book for you!Novice or veteran GMs will appreciate the campaign and its details. Starting right off where the \`starter' adventure in the WFRP main book left off this is volume one of an Epic three part campaign in the Empire.Taking place in the great city of Middenheim it includes eight \`chapters' (adventures) which tell the tale of chaos corrupting the heart of a noble city from within...and your PCs are the only ones who can choose to fight it.Geared toward beginning characters in their first career (or at most their second) the book contains all the material needed for a great campaign. Along with maps, stats, background history and even an additional career this book is worth the price for the bits of info about Middenheim, the kingdom of Middenland and the religions of Sigmar and primarily Ulric.I completly recommend this book especially if you're like myself: and old-school WFRPer (GM) who has not gamed in their glories world of perilous adventure form many a year. It will jump start not only your gaming but your imagination."},{"Title":"Paths of the Damned: Ashes of Middenheim (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay) (v. 1)","review":"That was exactly what our group was looking for in recent years.

This book has two distinct parts, a summary of Middenheim (~28 pages) and the eight chapters of the adventure proper (~50+ pages).Summary of Middenheim. The recent travails of Middenheim are nicely summarized and the sections of the city are well laid out and accompanied by a small neighborhood map that ties nicely into the map of the entire city. Consistent with a big city, the sewers are also laid out and this always serves to increase the \\"realism\\" of the \\"grim and perilous world of adventure\\" that is WFRP. The city is recovering from a siege, and this is well handled by the book.The Ashes of Middenheim adventure. Picking up seemlessly from the introductory adventure in the WFRP book, this adventure consists of eight distinct chapters. While quite linear, I liked the adventure segments as they involved a nice mix of city, country, tomb raiding, investigation and combat. The NPCs, I though, were unusually interesting, and even as a referee reading it I was impressed with some of the plot twists and turns. The plot gets increasingly incredible and \\"suspension of disbelief\\" is strained but it seems worth it.In contrast to the other WFRP adventures I've seen, this one does include detailed experience point guides, very helpful to those of us new to the system.Printed in Canada."},{"Title":"Paths of the Damned: Ashes of Middenheim (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay) (v. 1)","review":"Damned, tells us the Dictionary, is:[attribute-informal] used for emphasis; [esp.] to express anger or frustration. Also, in christian belief, are those condemned by God to suffer eternal punishment in Hell.I cannot agree more, in all accounts, with the book of grammatical knowledge.Specially with the second of the definitions since it describes what I believe any experienced GM or player group will feel during the whole experience of following the Paths of the Damned, if they manage to go through the whole story.I do not want to be needlessly unkind with this adventure book, but it does deserve some scolding.Edition facts: It is, as with all Green Ronin publications, luxuriously done. Hard cover, nice paper and the works for those who revel in the superficial, as I do. It does provide a very strong background on Middenheim, the City of the Wolf (32 pages out of 95). The story is sufficiently long (8 chapters, playable in about a short session each).Potential grudges: If you are the kind that do not need luxury but accessibility (price wise), then the sole presence of a hard cover-expensive-paper edition in the market may seem to you like an excess. This is no flaw to me but may dishearten a few out there. The vast material on Middenheim will be a waste of 32 pages if you have the sourcebook of that city from the olden days when GW or Hogshead were in charge. It will not if you thrive in playing under the purest of precisions, since the new information on the city is now compatible with the background also provided by the literary segment of the line, detailing to some extent Magic Academies and such newer inclusions to the world. Also not a very bad minus in case you see it this way. But what I really see as the problem is, well, those 8 chapters. I like superficiality but not in my campaign, and this is were these paths are truly damned. The story is bland, unremarkable and common. Like any other story that any GM has ever managed to put together by themselves (and for free).It follows linearly a vastly trudged plot line in WHFR games:Empire is facing direst threat, only lowly heroes can save world, get attacked by mutants or equally lowly beastmen, high ranking official or nobleman hires them, now attacked by cultists, high ranking officer or nobleman is actually involved in the mad-persons cult, demon of supposedly unsurpassed power gets invoked, adventurers ruin the invocation or kill the doom-harbinger demon with no help but their lowly selves.This one is a masterful example of methodology. That one study case by the numbers.Additional mini-grudges: If for some reason you did not play the introductory scenario provided by the Rules Book, then, the hook for your adventurers to be involved is close to non-existing. Other WH adventures went the distance in providing ideas of why your players should immerse in the story, this one takes a more D&D; approach: 'cuz it'll be fun. The chapters are only related since it is the same story running but most feel completely disassociated from one another and as just some anecdotes pasted together. For those that have any of the Bloodstones campaign books: this one is equally bad.Overall, a throughly dispirited beginning of a campaign. I believe that only an absolute beginner group of players would enjoy a story as this one. So if you are just that, do buy it, it may be fun after all."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Of course far from his masterworks, this novel is still better than most which plague the bestsellers lists today. It is one of the first novels written by Greene, on of which he calls \\"entertainments\\", to distinguish them from his more serious novels. Nevertheless, here in an early work his recurrent subjects loom already: hope and regret; the moral loneliness of each individual; the inevitability of fate; the consciousness, or lack of it, of good and evil.A group of people are travelling from Ostende (Belgium) to Istanbul, each one with their fears or illusions. During the long way they meet and interact, love and forget each other. Carleton Myatt, a young Jewish merchant, is on his way to solve a problematic business situation with his employees in Turkey. During the trip he meets and seduces (through kindness and sacrifice) a young starlet of nightclubs who only dreams of love and welfare. Dr. Czinner (sinner?) a socialist revolutionary from Yugoslavia, is on the same train bound for Belgrade, but he is discovered and harassed by Mabel Warren, a British, alcoholic and lesbian journalist. The interaction between the characters creates an increasing tension which is only resolved, for good or evil, when each one of them meets his or her particular fate. Foremost is the heartbreaking story of the young dancer, who loses love in the middle of a snowstorm and political intrigue of which she understands nothing. In this book, Greene lets us see the great qualities that would later lead him to write his great novels."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Although \\"Orient Express\\" (originally published as \\"Stamboul Train\\") anticipates the moral and social issues, as well as the concern with faith and faithfulness, apparent in Greene's later work, this early novel is more of a crowd-pleaser--intentionally so, since the author needed the money. But it's one of the greater of Greene's lesser novels; and not the least of his achievements is to take stock characters and immerse them in unusual situations.Most of the train's passengers are heading East for career opportunities--mercantile dealing, travel writing, theatrical performance, muckraking journalism, and even inciting a revolution. Safely aboard the train, however, they form temporary alliances and shrug off back-stabbing schemers, while the real worldly perils lie in wait off the train, in the towns and the countryside, in the station stops, where the passengers are threatened by thieves and killers, merciless soldiers and dark prisons, and inhabitants who can't speak their language. (\\"She was afraid at being left alone when the train was in a station,\\" reflects one character moments before her inadvertent arrest by people she can't understand.)As is usual in Greene's fiction, each of the \\"good\\" characters faces a test that, in this novel, approaches martyrdom: Will Myatt risk life and limb to rescue Coral? Will Coral abandon Dr. Czinner in his hour of need? Other characters--the gruff reporter Mabel Warren, the conflicted frontier guard Ninitch, the beautiful socialite Janet Pardoe, the absurd writer Q. C. Savory--hobble through life without ever confronting their own morally ambivalent prejudices and desires. Only Josef Grunlich, the murdering burglar, seems to be beyond redemption.By the end of the trip, those temporary alliances are reformed and sealed anew. Each character of this morality play ends up at a terminus preordained by the choices made or the circumstances faced. Even the killer, \\"brooding on the injustice of it all,\\" meets his comeuppance--although not in the manner traditional to a murder story. In many ways, the \\"injustice\\" that determines the fates of these disparate travelers anticipates the fatalism of the noir-like novels Greene published later in the decade, particularly \\"Brighton Rock\\" and the irrational evil of its anti-hero Pinkie."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Orient Express is a time capsule. It was written in the early 1930s and, as such, captures the world of the inter-war period in continental Europe. The book's strengths and weaknesses spring from this perspective. The strength are that Greene shows us a world that was rather bleak and yet vibrant. The downside is that anti-Semitism and class-based prejudices are evident both in the character's and in Greene's attitudes. However, as a time capsule of a lost era, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I have enjoyed a number of Greene's novels, but was disappointed with Orient Express. For a better read and more compelling characters, I recommend Greene's later work including The Quite American, The Comedians or even The Heart of the Matter."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"Graham Greene the eminent British novelist published this minor, suspensful and entertaining work in 1932. In Great Britain the novel is entitled \\"Stamboul Train\\". The novel is short but has a murder and interesting characters to keep your attention. The characters are well sketched and the novel has deeper depth than the typical spy thriller.Among the players are:Coral Musker-a beautiful but poor chorus girl traveling from England to appear in a musical in Istanbul. She falls in love on the train and becomes involved in the pursuit of a Yugolslavian Communist leader Dr.Czinner. Coral is the most human andsympathetic character in the whole business. She is touching, pathetic and deserving of a better fate than the one she receives.Carelton Myatt is a young businessman from London. He is on the way to Turkey to cement a business deal. He is also a womanizer who initiates Coral into sex. Later he sets his cap for Janet Pardoe a half-Jewish niece of Mr. Steiner a wealthy businessman. Myatt is a despicable character who seeks his own ego satisfactions not trifling with such things as true love. As the novel ends his future looks bright but we the readers do not like him. Greene chose to make him Jewish opening himself up for charges of Antisemetic caricatures. Much of British society in the 1930s was adverse to persons of the Jewish faith. The novel was written shortly before Hitler became German Chancellor. It should be stated that Greene served bravely in World War II as a spy for the British Government. I do not think he was overtly antisemetic.Mabel Warren is a lesbian and obnoxious journalist who is eager to interview Czinner and Savery who is a popular novelist. She travels with Janet Pardoe but when dumped sets her sights on Coral.Josef Grunlich is a robber and murderer who flees Vienna escaping to Constantinople. Grunlich is a despicable human being.Greene manages to interwine the lives of all these people into an exciting narrative. This is a minor work but is written in the author's cool style with colorful use of metaphor and a good use of mirror imagery. Penguin has reissued this novel in a beautiful edition for the Greene 100th year birthday celebration which was held in 2004. Christopher Hitchns the acerbic critic has a fine introduction to the novel included in the Penguin edition. This book is a good introduction to Graham Greene one of our greatest modern novelist."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"ORIENT EXPRESS differentiates from other Graham Greene's works, which are normally considered literary fiction of a serious writer, in its entertaining nature. It reads like an adventurous story whose every little detail exuded demands one's undivided attention in order to piece it all together. As the Orient Express hurtles across Europe on its three-day journey from Ostend to Constantinople, the driven lives of several of its passengers become bound together in a fateful interlock. The curious skein of characters include a beautiful chorus girl enroute to a performance, a rich Jewish businessman bound for a business deal, a mysterious, sinister-looking but kind doctor returning to his native Belgrade after being fugitive for five years, a cunning murderous burglar who had fled a crime, and a spiteful journalist who contrived to make the headline story.Given the nature of these various characters and a backdrop that constitutes to a curious sense of suspension in a confined, onrushing train, ORIENT EXPRESS, though a less literary work, does not fail to combine the exotic and the romantic with the sordid and the banal. These passengers, who have little or nothing in common with one another that they will probably never overlap have they not been assigned in the same car, retain their own life drama, conditions and secrets under the changing skies. The meanness of everyday existence is found at the bottom of every suitcase, and has in fact been packed along with everything else.It doesn't seem obvious at first that ORIENT EXPRESS bespeaks self-sacrifice and betrayal. It is the usual case when people are far from home and routine that they will stair to make an unwonted exertion of the spirit or the will. The book, though its contrariety of style to Greene's other works, turns out to be a useful if not fortunate failure in containing the themes of self-sacrifice and betrayal. It is almost unexpected that the train, the passengers, and the direction to which the train steered symbolize a time period and the revolution."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"No, this is not the Agatha Christie mystery :). It's an absorbing semi-political thriller by Graham Greene, with great characters and a compelling plot. Read it!"},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"The story of a bunch of people taking the Orient Express to Istanbul. One of them is a rich Jew and he has an affair with a poor dancer on the train, and almost falls in love with her.Greene writes well enough to carry you along, but I was let down by the blah way in which the story ended. It felt like going along with someone who promises to take you to an interesting bar, only to discover that the bar is smelly and full of old drunks. Perhaps that is a requirement of making a story 'realistic' and thus literary, as opposed to a schmaltzy, feel-good Hollywood finish... but the the ending, in which the Jew goes for the beautiful, empty, vacuous girl and forgets all about the little dancer with nothing more than a slight shrug made me want to shrug off this story as well."},{"Title":"Orient Express (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)","review":"I find Graham Greene to be almost unreadable. I know that this is going to be considered near blasphemous, since literary critics have heaped such praise upon him and so many reviewers here have done likewise.However, in a word, I find him depressing. His characters suffer from interminable analysis of their every thought and action. The larger story is merely a vehicle for these internal monologues that, frankly, I don't find particularly insightful or interesting. It was V. S. Pritchett who first remarked about Greene's 'perverse and morbid tendencies'. While Greene is no doubt highly intelligent and capable of a very high level of writing, the end result, for me, is something very unpleasant.I first read 'The Heart Of The Matter'. God, what an endlessly depressing scene! Nor was there any particular character I could sympathize with or even care about. In spite of my negative reaction to this highly praised work, I thought I would give him another try with 'Orient Express' (a.k.a., 'Stamboul Train'), thinking that in this 'entertainment' as Greene called it I would actually be, well, entertained. Instead, I get a trainload of depressing characters whose every thought is scrutinized to an excruciating degree.Example (from Myatt's suspicions about his business dealings):'It was odd. He had chosen the samples with particular care. It was natural of course that even Stein's currants should not all be inferior, but when so much was suspected, a further suspicion was easy. Suppose, for example, Mr. Eckman had been doing a little trade on his own account, had allowed Stein some of the firm's consignment of currants, in order temporarily to raise the quality, had, on the grounds of that improved quality, indeed, induced Moults' to bid for the business. Mr. Eckman must be having uneasy moments now, turning up the time-table, looking at his watch, thinking that half Myatt's journey was over. Tomorrow, he thought, I will send a telegram and put Joyce in charge; Mr. Eckman shall have a month's holiday. Joyce will keep an eye on the books, and he pictured the scurrying to and fro, as in an ants' nest agitated by a man's foot, a telephone call from Eckman to Stein or from Stein to Eckman, a taxi ordered here and dismissed there, a lunch for once without wine, and then the steep office steps and at the top of them the faithful rather stupid Joyce keeping his eye upon the books. And all the time, at the modern flat, Mrs. Eckman would sit on her steel sofa knitting baby clothes for the Anglican mission, and the great dingy Bible, Mr. Eckman's first deception, would gather dust on its unturned leaf.'Lord have mercy. This stuff is like fingernails on a chalkboard!William Golding called Green 'the ultimate twentieth-century chronicler of consciousness and anxiety'. This does not, however, make for entertaining reading. Greene's writing is an examination of the human condition totally devoid of lightness, humor (at least as I understand the word) or romance. His characters are an unpleasant, unhappy bunch.Ultimately all his writing reveals is the real Graham Greene."},{"Title":"Sister Wit: Devotions for Women","review":"SISTER WIT, is insightful, touching, and real!

I know you don't want to spend a lot of time doing this.But when I read the other reviewers who are exulting that \\"I just saved 5 hours worth of time\\" on their employee's reviews, it really saddens me. I mean, we're talking about summarizing a year of someone's life--time they have spent for *you*, time they have taken away from themselves and from their family. If you are going to comment on someone's performance for a whole year, isn't it worthwhile to take a few hours and really think about it? And don't they deserve more from you than just a rattle-off of pointy-haired-boss-speak?I think books like this do a tremendous disservice to business. By encouraging managers to reduce performance reviews to a paint-by-numbers process, and by letting them \\"get it over with asap\\", it really weakens a line of communication between manager and employee which ought rather to be strengthened.If you use this book, you will cheapen and debase your relationship with your employees.

All young teens should read it!"},{"Title":"Effective phrases for performance appraisals: A guide to successful evaluations","review":"Feeling Sorry For Celia is a great book for young teenagers. It takes place in Sydney, Australia. The book is made up of letters and refrigerator notes to and from the main character, Elizabeth Clarry. Elizabeth and her mom leave messages for each other around the house in different places like the counter top, refrigerator, or any other spots where the notes will be easily found. Usually, the notes are about Elizabeth's best friend, Celia, or Elizabeth's father. In the notes, Libby's (Elizabeth's) mother usually gives her things to think about or chores to do. Elizabeth writes letters to a girl named Christina Kratovac as well. Libby and Christina started writing letters to each other as a school assignment but enjoyed each other so much that they continued to write. Elizabeth and her father, Albert Clarry, use letters to communicate, too. Libby's father and mother are divorced and her father lived in Canada. However, her father's job had him move to Sydney. After such a long time without seeing her dad, Elizabeth and her father are trying to improve their odd, awkward relationship. The most important character Elizabeth receives letters from, is her best friend, Celia Buckley. Celia and Elizabeth go to the same private school and have been best friends for quite some time. There is only one problem - Celia is always disappearing. Celia is always going off on some crazy adventure to try and \\"find herself\\".

The focus here is on the foundations of curvature and connections.The only prerequisite for volume II is a careful study of volume I. In particular, you'll need a good understanding of the Riemannian metric and you'll need to be comfortable with manipulating differential forms. Also pay attention to the differential equations material used to establish Frobenius Integrability in Chapter 6 of volume I. In addition, you'll need the main concepts from the Lie Groups study of Chapter 10 of volume I.The author begins the study of curvature with a review of the classical theory of curvature of curves and surfaces in Chapters 1 and 2. These chapters are written in style that helps the reader anticipate more general results for Riemannian manifolds. For example, the reader will notice the rotation index of a planar curve can be represented in terms of its total curvature; a result which foreshadows the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. Both Euler's Theorem and Meusnier's Theorem for surfaces embedded in Euclidean 3-space are studied.Chapter 3 details the geometry of surfaces as developed by Gauss. Spivak's treatment here is very unusual, and, in Part A of this chapter, the author actually gives an English translation of original paper of Gauss. Reading this is a bit unusual as the author alternates the translation of Gauss on a page with comments by the author on the preceding page. Part B of the chapter gives the accounting of the Gauss Theory in modern notion. Part B is delightfully geometric and includes all of the 'greatest hits' from the theory, including the Theorema Egreguim and the Triangle Excess Theorem.Chapter 4 studies Riemann's theory of curvature of manifolds, and contains 4 parts. Part A and Part C are English translations of Riemann's foundational work, while Part B and Part D cast this work in the light of more modern notion. Riemann's curvature tensor is built up from an intuitive study of the second-order terms in the Taylor series expansion of the Riemannian metric. The author also introduces what he calls the \\"Test Case\\" for curvature theory: Flat manifolds are locally isometric to Euclidean space. Spivak uses this \\"Test Case\\" repeatedly throughout the remainder of the text to reinforce the various notion of curvature as he studies the work of Riemann, Ricci, Kozul, Cartan and Ehresmann.Chapter 5 (the Debauch of Indices) studies the work of Christoffel and Ricci in developing the covariant derivative. The aim of this work is to simplify the somewhat cumbersome formulas for Riemann's curvature tensor. The reader quickly sees that effort, called absolute differential calculus, is not altogether successful and leads to an veritable explosion of multi-indexed quantities and even harder-to-penetrate formulas. Clearly a better way is needed if we are to move forward with our study of differential geometry.The \\"way forward\\" is Kozul's concept of the connection and this is introduced in Chapter 6. First, note that the connection here is one of the versions of the introduced by Kozul as a map of pairs of vector fields to a vector field. Another useful version, not studied in volume II, is to consider the connection as a Hessian which maps any smooth function to a bilinear form on the tangent space. Second, note that Chapter 6 is usually the starting point for most treatments of curvature in differential geometry (e.g Do Carmo's \\"Riemannian Geometry\\"). Without the motivating material from the previous chapters, it would be difficult to understand the need for(or the point of) Kozul's connection.Cartan's theory of curvature via a study of moving frames is detailed in Chapter 7. The author is careful to intuitively motivate Cartan's deviation from Euclidean concept as represented in the structure equations. Cartan's curvature tensor is shown to agree with Riemann's tensor, the \\"Test Case\\" is revisited, and the well-known fact that the curvature determines the Riemannian metric is established.Building on the orthonormal frames from the previous chapter, Spivak now considers Ehresmann's theory of connections in principal bundles in Chapter 8. The main results here introduce the Ehresmann connection on the frame bundle, and gives the Kozul connection as a Lie derivative, thought of as the Cartan connection obtained from the Ehresmann connection.My only complaint is that the author didn't include any exercises in this second volume. This is a real shame as the exercises in the first volume were very well-designed and one of the highlights of that text."},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol. 2, 3rd Edition","review":"There are some cool tidbits in some of the sections where the historical texts are quoted and explained - I think this is GREAT and just shows the need of some real source oriented textbooks on the great history of differential geometry. However as a textbook this book made my eyes roll back in my head. The typeface is ugly, and even if it weren't the style of mathematics is just abrasive in my opinion. Much of the geometry in this book takes a modern approach of defining tensors and other geometric objects the algebraic way, and has a very algebraic feel. Differential Geometry is about the last subject I care to do this too, especially at the beginners level. I know this is supposed to be \\"comprehensive\\" but let's not be pretentious here, differential geometry is an enormous subject, I mean excuse me where is your symplectic geometry and symmetric spaces? If you are looking for the \\"modern\\" language of geometry there are plenty of books - see Springer's publications or DoCarmo, so I don't see the necessity for this book if you are just looking to learn the subject. However if you do want to read and understand some of the original ideas of Differential Geometry, it might be worth a look at the library. I'm not sure if Riemann's papers have been exposed in this book as well as they are here, but it sure would be an expensive purchase just to get these books for that bit!"},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol. 2, 3rd Edition","review":"Hours of reading fun!

It draws heavily on old Dutch sources that had earlier been unavailable in English.I gave it 4 stars only because its treatment of the Moluccas (my field of interest) was more limited than I had hoped for.But anyone with a real interest in the history of either Indonesia or the Dutch should find it highly interesting."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is absolutely marvelous! It's funnier than 'The Scarlet Letter'! It's longer than 'Chicken Little'! It's less poetic than 'Green Eggs and Ham'! And above all, it doesn't have near as many Greeks in it, well, anything by Homer, for instance. It is an incredible book. Based on the BBC radio series of the same name, this book follows the adventures of one Arthur Dent who, after discovering that his home and his planet are about to be destroyed to make room for highways, helps an odd humanoid from Betelgeuse name Ford Prfect write a book.This book, I swear to God, had me convulsing and near throwing up, I was laughing so hard. It's just freaking funny!!!! It even made my grandpa laugh, and he's Amish, illiterate, and dead. I have honestly never read or heard of a funnier book than HHGG, and the reason behind that is probably because such a thing does not exist.So, read this book. If you can't read, have someone read it out loud to you. If you don't have any friends who will read it to you, buy the book on tape. If you can't afford the book on tape, for heaven's sake sell your computer and buy it. If you're computer's an old Commadore and even when you sell it, you still don't have enough money, sell your semen to a sperm bank and move to distant planet where you can prepare sandwiches until a long lost friend shows up with your child she created using your sperm that she found at some distant sperm bank! I don't care how you do it! Go get this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Humor, and our perception of humor, is subjective. What is funny to one person isn't necessarily funny to the next. For example - I think Dave Barry is hilarious, and I think his first novel \\"Big Trouble\\" is a laugh riot - but I found the movie \\"Big Trouble\\" pretty tedious, and not very funny.A friend turned me onto the Hitchhiker's Guide 20 years ago, and I laughed until I cried, and couldn't wait to move on to the next book, \\"The Restaurant At The End of the Universe\\".I see LOTS of reviews of this book trying lamely to describe the \\"plot\\" of the story, which would give a reader as much reason to read the book as it would to give a potential movie-goer the \\"plot\\" of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\". The story isn't the point. The enchantment lies within Adams' incredibly witty descriptions of the mundane and the extraordinary.----------------------------------------------------------Here is an early passage where our hero discovers that his friend is not English at all:\\"Alright,\\" said Ford. \\"How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?\\"Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way.\\"I don't know,\\" he said, taking a pull of beer. \\"Why - do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?\\"---------------------------------------------------Consider this exchange a few chapters later when space traveling Ford prepares earthling Arthur for his first travel in hyperspace:\\"You'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk.\\"\\"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?\\"\\"You ask a glass of water.\\"------------------------------------------I remember, reading the book for the first time, thinking \\"this book hits my funny-bone much the same as the movies of Monty Python.\\"So - if THAT style of witty/wacky British humor hits your funny-bone as well, and you HAVEN'T yet read Douglas Adams, I say:Don't Panic. You're in for a treat.

This is one of the most beautiful pieces of holographically insane literature I've ever read. The fact that it is science fiction is almost irrelevant. Some pages are so nutty/funny I'd be left gasping for air after each paragraph trying to smother uncontrollable laughter. Other pages, whilst not as funny, were so absurdly pedantic that you were left adrift in amazement. One of the most successful literary attempts at psychedelic writing in my 40+ years of reading. The book is miraculously manic; I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' book begins with our protagonist, Arthur Dent, facing the destruction of his house to make room for a new highway. This is all well and good until Arthur's friend of many years and closet alien, Ford Prefect, tells Arthur that their life on Earth is about to end, because an alien race wishes to make an intergalactic highway and Earth is in it's way. This is just the beginning of Adams' satire. He shows us that most of our problems are small and petty once put in comparison with something more substantial. The story continues with the President of the Galaxy, Ford's friend from his alien home planet, steals the most powerful ship in the galaxy, the one sporting the Improbability Drive, and takes it for a joy ride. Adams keeps the reader interested throughout the course of the book, giving the answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything, reasons why towels are a hitchhiker's best friend, and reveals the fact that Humans were only the third smartest animals on Earth, next to dolphins and mice, which come from another dimension. This book grips the reader's attention from start to finish, sending him on the most exciting adventure through the galaxy that he has ever been on. With only a few dull moments, and heaps of humor, wit, and sarcasm, Douglas Adams' has written a real winner."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How can anyone be so closed-minded as to not enjoy this book? I'll agree, this book requires a fair amount of attention to get into, but that's the beauty of it! You need to have brains to enjoy it! You need to be, in the least bit, SMART! In short, Douglas Adams has created a literary masterpiece. Smart, funny as hell, and just insane. I've read it 3 times and I'm still not tired of it. The open-minded will appreciate this. If you did not enjoy this, there's probably something wrong with your reading glasses, or even worse, your brain."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One is cheaper than the other but contains many many typos.

For some it's meaning, for others it's a place in the universe, and for the rest of us, it's a digital watch. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really illustrates that unsure feeling that we all have. Arthur Dent was lost enough on Earth, but after it's demolished, he in desperate need of finding a speck of understanding throughout the rest of the Galaxy. Good luck without your towel there, buddy boy.I really dug this book. It didn't take you straight from point A to point B, as some novels do. It had twisty unpredictable swerves that gave you a glimpse of points X, Q and H, along the way, even though Q and H had nothing to do with anything. They were there for appreciation. For example, a nuclear bomb makes a quick transformation to a sperm whale before any damage is done. The reader is fully exposed to the Sperm whales thoughts and inner ramblings... all thirty seconds of them. It's beautifully absurd, and I loved it.I fully enjoyed the nonsense and the silliness of the book. Little details, especially. An incredibly depressed robot, the hailing of digital watches, eager to please doors; all these things didn't necessarily prove incredibly important on the character's quest, but amusing, nonetheless. Without the silliness, this may have been another book about post-Earth days and the last thing we need is just another book about post-Earth days. Have no fear, this is not just another book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The thrilling yet hilarious book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, includes an exciting plot, great characters, and very cool ways of looking at the galaxy, as a human named Arthur and an alien named Ford travel though space in search of adventure. Ford is sent to do research for the book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an electronic book that tells information about the galaxy. Ford and Arthur sneak away on a passing space ship, just as Earth is destroyed. They attempt to hide from the captain of the ship, but fail and are jettisoned into deep space! Knowing that they only have 30 seconds left of air, they try to find some way to save themselves. Just as they are about to die a passing ship picks them up, but Arthur and Ford aren't ready for the adventures that are about to happen to them. One reason someone should read this book is because it is extremely funny. The book has very humorous ways of looking at earth and the galaxy from an alien's point of view. One example is in the beginning when the aliens describe earth as &quot; An utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&quot;(1) Another example of humor is when the aliens are describing Jesus: &quot; One man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change&quot;(2) There are many more funny jokes and comments about people and things through out the book. Another reason to read this book is because the adventures that Ford and Arthur have are very exciting and action filled. One example is when Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillen, Veet, and the robot Marvin discover the lost planet, Magrathea, which is rumored to not exist. When they come closer to the planet they are shot down with missiles and crash into the planet, and discover strange creatures and buildings on the planet. Another example is when Arthur, Ford and the gang get into a shoot out with police when they get caught with a stolen ship. The adventures and jokes that Douglas Adams comes up with are so funny it makes you want to read this book again. One reason why someone might not like to read this book is because if one reads the book too fast you might miss a transaction and be confused. The book as weird ways of saying things you might skim one thing and think it means something different then it really means, so you must read kind of carefully. This reason is not a good reason to not read the book because is a great book. All one need to do is read a little carefully and the only problem with the book is gone. If one does not read this book this will be missing out of all the funny adventures that Ford and Arthur go on. This book is defiantly a must read, you will have many hours of enjoyment reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was given to me for christmas one year ago.

Douglas Adams' irreverence makes this whimsical stuff a kind of profound Pythonism (not that the Pythons themselves weren't profound). Pretty much all the books in the expanded \\"trilogy\\" are terrific, but maybe because this was the first, and because I heard it in its original incarnation as a radio broadcast before ever cracking open the book, it remains the ultimate classic of the group, the one where it all began, as we so like to say. From the splendid monologues about things like probability drives to the coolest guy in the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox, this book and its offspring will stand tall for the next hundred years--as an Alice in Wonderland for the Space Age."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the very first Kindle book I downloaded, because it only seemed fitting. The Kindle is the ultimate incarnation of the Hitchhiker's Guide. The story is very tongue-in-cheek British humor which has developed a cult following since it came out in the mid-1980's. It is too difficult to try and explain here, but to give you an idea of the humor, this is the first book in a trilogy of five (yes, 5!) books. The only explanation I can give is either you get it or you don't.The Kindle version is easy to read: no gaps in the text, no obvious spelling mistakes and no pictures that appear only in greyscale. My only wish is that someone would contact Douglas Adam's estate and get a skin or cover to make Kindle look like the HHGG (large, friendly letters on the cover spelling out, \\"Don't Panic!\\") That would be perfect (or Prefect, depending oh how your Babel fish translates it). Now, where did I leave my towel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can you say about an author who wrote a 5 book trilogy? One hilarious read, for one thing. I'd read Adams many years ago and wanted to return to read him again only this time a little more critically to see if the material still worked for me. It did.Douglas Adams really started something when he wrote this parody of one genre, and in so-doing he started his own genre and others have followed in his footsteps such as Robert Aspirin, Terry Pratchett and even Piers Anthony could be counted among those who have emulated this tongue in cheek, irreverent treatment of what had in the past come to be a science fiction genre that took itself very seriously indeed. It's not hard to see in Adams' acerbic and dry English sense of humor strong ties to the style of humor made so famous by the Monty Python crew of the late 60s and early 70s.Reading this the second time in the Kindle version, I found that it didn't lose anything for the change in medium. It really is a remarkably short little book for the impact it had. This kindle version included an addendum that provides the background to the production of the movie by the same name that was finally produced following Adams death in 2001. This addendum is fully one third of the length of the actual novel. It didn't need to be in my opinion, but others might find it entertaining and informative.This is one of the standards in science fiction, fantasy and satirical writing and well worth the time and effort to procure and read. Beware though, once you've finished it you'll want to go on and read the remaining 4 volumes of this famous trilogy.5 stars.bart breen"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Guide explains that it is the exception which proves the rule. It goes on to give this example.Long ago, the Gloops of Alpha Nucleii, sited on the far side of the Galacticus Quadrant, were in thrall to the Thargs of the Grand Imperial Empire of Maxorphius. On the last evening of every bi-millennium cycle of the two Suns of Antiochus, which was, The Guide explained, the equivalent of two standard solar system weeks, Thargs from the Empire would arrive to tax the poor Gloops of all wealth produced since their last raid.This left the Gloops permanently overdrawn at Grimgolds, the Galactic Bank, and the Gloops were pretty fed up about it.\`What can we do?' wailed the Gloops to each other after the most recent raid. \`We have tried resistance, we have tried reason, we have tried running away, nothing works. \`The Thargs are a zillion times stronger than us, will no more listen to reason than the putrefying sponges of Planetoid Desolatoria, and win all the running Golds in the Pan Galactic Olympics. They can never be defeated. The Thargs rule us; the Thargs rule everyone. The Thargs shall rule us for evermore.'And so, the tyrannical reign of the Thargs continued.The Guide flicked to the next screen and continued the tale.Eventually, having exhausted all possible ideas for freeing themselves from the ravenous Thargs, the Gloops turned to the lawyers.\`You see,' explained the Gloops, \`the Thargs are all powerful and shall rule us and everyone for evermore. What can we do?'\`Pay us in advance,' the senior lawyer demanded. The Gloops were ready for this, and had booked their lawyers' appointment the day before the Thargs were due, so as to have the necessary legal fees. These, they handed over.The lawyers retired and deliberated. In due course they emerged from their chambers.\`Can you help us?' pleaded the Gloops. The lawyers turned to each other and nodded knowingly.\`Yes, we can.'The Gloops were overjoyed, but a little cautious, for the Thargs were all powerful.\`How can you help us? The Thargs rule us; the Thargs rule everyone, the Thargs shall rule us for evermore.'The lawyers looked down at the Gloops and explained.\`The Thargs rule, you say. They rule everyone. They are stronger, deafer and faster than you. It follows that if you refuse to be ruled by them you will be the exception.'\`Go on...' encouraged the Gloops.\`...And it is forewritten in all the Good Books that it is the exception which proves the rule.'\`...er...'\`So when the Thargs turn up tomorrow to tax your wealth once more, you must defy them.'The Gloops shivered.\`Defy them? They will turn on us with their all-powerful whirlyblaagblasters, and eviscerate us to extinction.'The lawyers smiled the smile of those who chose the right career.\`No they won't. You see, it is written that it is the exception which proves the rule, so by defying them as no one else would dare, you are the exception which proves they rule. If they continue to rule over you they will no have an exception to prove their rule, and will consequently no longer rule over anyone.' The lawyers beamed. \`You've got them, see?'The Gloops did not see, but they trusted the lawyers. Next day, when the Thargs arrived with their taxing ledgers, the Gloops defied them.\`We've got you,' the Gloops exulted. \`We are the exception which proves that you rule. If you attempt to rule us we will no longer be the exception and your rule will not be proven.'The Thargs turned on the Gloops with their all-powerful whirlyblaagblasters and eviscerated them.What the lawyers had forgotten, the Guide concluded, was that if it is the exception which proves the rule, there must be an exception to this.The only exception, states the Guide, to the rule that it is the exception which proves the rule, is that the lawyers always get their fees up front."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of the finest books ever written! It's funny, and edgy, and thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone, though some people do not seem to enjoy the slightly dryer English humour. This is a re-read for me, as it does start off my very favorite five-book trilogy. And contains my all-time favorite quote: \\"Ford, you're turning into a penguin - stop it!\\" Basically, the book begins with the destruction of the planet Earth and ends at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, with a lot of great adventure (and insight) in between. You really should read it, you'll be glad you did. And if you don't like it, well, you're just a mutant..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the funniest, intelligent books that has come out in a long time. While there is not much in the way of plot, that is, rising action, climax, and falling action, it is still worth it to buy and read many times over. The characters are memorable, each with their own unique personality and view of the world. My favorite is Marvin, the 'paranoid android.' He is a manic depressive, and has the best insight into everthing. The humor is intelligent, a kind that makes people think about what the joke is, not the kind of crass humor that is so popular today, like Austin Powers or Blue Collar TV stuff. I am currently reading the second book in this series, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and am enjoying it as well.

That because the hitchhikers guide is the standard repository of all knowledge. That's what I think of the book Douglas Adams wrote. Not the knowledge part but the wholly remarkable part.It's got plot twists left and right. It has weird creatures, mind bogglingly useful fish that you stick in your ear, and incredible descriptions for towels. Completely impossible ways of travel through the galaxy. Depressed robots est..... mainly it's got everything. That's just in the beginning. Except the ultimate question.To bad but I still think it's a great book"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Do you feel that the Earth is utterly insignificant? Douglas Adams uses his book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, to get you thinking about how small the Earth is compared to the size of the galaxy and universe. Upon comparing these sizes, it could be said that it would not make a major difference in the galaxy if the Earth was not there; however, nobody would say this if they thought that the Earth might not actually be there someday. In fact, most people would say that this would be impossible. In this book, Adams changed the life of Arthur Dent forever by performing this impossible act: vaporizing the Earth. Arthur woke up one morning worried about his house being destroyed; however, he later realized that this was the least of his worries when the planet he called home, Earth, was vaporized by a group of aliens called Vogons. This sent Arthur into a world that he had only dreamt about and forced him to learn the ways of the galaxy. By performing this major feat, Douglas Adams created a masterpiece that I would give a five star rating."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this when I was in elementary school and thought it was funny.

Douglas Adams did a brilliant job carrying the reader along with this absurd sci-fi novel. In fact, at times the book gets so absurd that it's hard to follow. But I still recommend it as a great read.Basically the book is about two friends that live on earth. Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect. Ford Perfect(who is actually an alien) reveals to Arthur that the world is about to end.Not long after their conversation, a Vogon spaceship appears and announces that earth will be destroyed shortly because it is in the way of a new intergalactic highway bypass that is being built through our galaxy. Ford and Arthur manage to board the ship before the earth is demolished, and they are quickly discovered.The Vogon ship ejects them into space and they get picked up by another ship called the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; which houses the Infinite Improbability Drive-makes the improbable happen. They travel to the planet Magrathea to figure out what to do about their non-existent planet earth. Then discover that earth was really a giant organic computer that was working on finding the meaning of life. But 5 minutes before the program was done the planet was desroyed. Ah, the irony!This book was all over the place, in a way that reminded me of Slaughterhouse five. The characters would go off on weird tangents that didn't really have much to do with the plot of the story. But I enjoyed its off the wall style and bazaar storyline. Its definitely unlike any other book I've read, and I admire its originality."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Funny sure, wore out two copies yeah yeah, brilliant etc. etc. ad nauseum ad infinitum.The part that usually gets missed in all the adulation is that Adams' trilogy (and *only* the original three) are also a grand and cutting critique of capitalism, bureauracracy, multinational industries, colonialism, organized religion, militarism, etc etc.Yup, these books are smart AND funny, and far far shorter than the Illuminatus! trilogy. That in itself is a blessing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is having a really bad Thursday. Not that that's unusual for him. He's just learned that his home is to be demolished to make way for a new freeway. As is the earth.

Together, they start a wild adventure that will introduce them to Zaphod and his girlfriend Trillian. Not to mention a depressed robot.I've been hearing about this book since high school. Many of my friends have recommended it to me, but I've never gotten around to reading it. Believe me, that was a huge mistake. I was frequently laughing out loud at the book. The characters, the situations, and the narration - all of it was perfectly comical. I'm sure I averaged a laugh a page, leading to some strange looks from my roommate as I was reading.If you're looking for a fun, improbable book you won't be able to put down, look no further. I'm already planning to pick up the rest of the increasingly inaccurately named trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I heard about this book as a humoristic book. Well, it does have some funny parts, but it's not hilarious. It is, though, very interesting. It is the only book I've ever read that doesn't fit itself to your logic, but you need to fit your logic to it. It is a crazy book, and I don't think it fits to all people, but if you liked it, you'll find yourself quating it at any opportunity. I found metaphors in it that fits to almost any discussion: About Capitalism, Zionism, science, and everyday conversations. It's an amazing, funny and weird book and I think you should at least try and read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I picked up the Hitchhikers' Galaxy to the Galaxy beacause of the recommendation of a friend. I really had absolutely no idea what to expect except for the seemingly, pointless question he asked me, \\"What is the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything?\\". Needless to say, I didn't know what the heck he was talking about, and was even more perplexed when he told me the answer was 42. So, when my class was sent to the library to pick out a fiction novel to read for class, I found this book in my hands, and I'm glad I did. I find it quite difficult to describe this book, because I know I won't be able to do justice to it, but let's say I was constantly laughing the whole way through. The plot, or lack thereof, revovles mostly around an ape-descended lifeform living on the wretched blue-green planet in the Western arm of the universe, named Arthur. Arthur lives in England and lives a rather typical humanoid life, with the simple exception of his friend, Ford Prefect. Ford is a wonderfully interesting character who really is not a human, but an alien hitchhiking through the universe with the assistance of the trusty guide, yet finds himself exiled on Earth for 15 years and befriending Arthur. As it happens, a Vogon spaceship shows up and destoys Earth and all mankind to make way for an intergalactic highway, yet Ford and Arthur escape due to Ford hitching a ride on the Vogon ship. Thus, begins their adventure. Through a long, and quite improbable journey, Ford and Arthur meeting old aquaintences, the ruler of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox and another surviving human, Trillian. Together they go on a entirely zany and humorous adventure. It's really quite worth the read and the book we leave you desiring to read the next 3 books of the triology (yes, there are 4). My only complaint is that there is really no defining moment in the book that makes it truly memorable. I guess you could say its lacking any real climax. Also, the hundereds of juxtapostions, ilogical and improbably things, and oxymorons really leave you kind of feeling a little empty. For all the humor, the book is really lacking any substance or something to take away from it, even if you do now know the answer to the universe. Yet, I recommend it to all who are looking for a great laugh. Its a wonderfully written book and will keep you involved, so go check out!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the first in a series of humorous science fiction novels that had their origin in a BBC radio series, first airing on March 8, 1978. This first story by Adams was also made into a short television series. The stories are centered about an alien named Ford Prefect, who has been spending some time on Earth serving as a roving researcher for &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and his human friend Arthur Dent, a common English &quot;everyman&quot; who is constantly searching for a drinkable cup of tea. At the start of the first novel, Dent wakes up in the morning to discover that his house is being destroyed to make way for a bypass. Ford Prefect arrives to tell Dent that Earth itself is about to be demolished in order to make way for an interstellar bypass by the Vogons. Just prior to Earth's destruction, the two stow away on a Vogon ship. The two survivors are thrown out of the ship but soon meet the egocentric Zaphod Beeblebox, Ford's cousin and President of the Galaxy (&quot;President in particular is very much a figurehead-he wields no power whatsoever&quot;), who has a surgically-added extra arm and extra head. With Zaphod is the girl Trillian (Tricia McMillan) who had been picked up at a party on Earth by Zaphod. They are traveling in a prototype space ship, &quot;The Heart of Gold,&quot; stolen by Zaphod. The ship is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive, which can be used as a method for crossing vast interstellar distances in a &quot;mere nothing of a second&quot; by generating small amounts of finite improbability. The development of an &quot;infinite improbability generator&quot; was made possible by calculating exactly how improbable such a generator was and creating this finite improbability. Another character in these books is Marvin, a manicly depressed android with a powerful brain. This unusual group of characters travel to the planet Magrathea which specializes in custom-made luxury planet building. However, two nuclear missiles are fired at them. Fortunately, Dent accidentally triggers the infinite improbability drive which turns the missiles into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. They discover, from the character Slartibartfast, that Earth had actually been designed by the Magratheans as a gigantic computer whose job it was to find &quot;The Question.&quot; Another computer, &quot;Deep Thought,&quot; had earlier calculated the answer to life, the Universe, and everything: the answer was &quot;42.&quot; But, no one knew the question. Unfortunately, the Earth had been destroyed five minutes before the completion of its analysis by the Vogons. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great reading by Stephen Fry.

It has anything you may even dream about finding in a comedy book. It has missiles, sperm whales, potted plants, people with two heads, and these all just happen to be on the same page. When reading this you are nearly guaranteed nonstop laughter. Well I can't say nonstop, because you have to breathe at some point. This may sound an overstatement but I do not believe that it is. My parents banned me from reading this book after dark because I kept them up at night.Now some of the humor may seem a bit childish but we all have to be a little childish at times lest we go crazy, and act really childish all the time. This book is nearly unbearably clean humor, in a good way. It proves that toilet humor is most definitely outdone by nonsensical humor.I don't believe that you can just take the word of some random stranger and go read a book so what I would recommend you do is go to your local library, find this book, get some help if you need it, check it out, drive home and read. Don't buy this book because, you know, not every book is for everyone. This is how to read books and find out what you like. And if you like this book, tell someone.

It to me was clearly way up there along with Wodehouse. The comedy of Douglas Adams is difficult to categorise as satire or pun. It has satire and puns, however i think his books do more. Douglas Adams makes you laugh using parts of brain whose existance you may not even have been aware of previously. Reading this book was to me like getting hooked on to some strange device which would trigger those areas of brain responsible for laughing which the other books and movies have missed. The ridiculousness of some of the ideas in this book and (most of the) series is unbelievable. The humour can be a bit nerdy and I guess hard to understand.

After reading it, I can now see how much it shaped their speech patterns and writing styles. I found myself smiling as clouds of nostalgia unexpectedly overtook me while reading the series. I was also surprised to find phrases original to this series that have worked their way into the American culture. For example, in order to understand people who speak other languages, the characters in this series simply put a &quot;Babelfish&quot; in their ear. In real life, Babel Fish is a language translation program available on the internet. Since the book it appears in was published in 1979, there's no question of which came first.THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXYWe find out that the earth was actually created as an organic supercomputer with the sole purpose of determining the answer to life, the universe and everything. Arthur Dent finds himself whisked away from the earth only moments before the earth is destroyed to make way for a intergalactic bypass highway. Unfortunately, this is right before the earth was to have computed the answer to the question. He and Ford (an alien that has been marooned on earth) hitch a ride on the unsuspecting spacecraft that has just caused the destruction of the earth. They continue their hitchhiking journey throughout the galaxy to a ship called the Heart of Gold (which is actually a stolen vehicle). There, they meet with a series of unlikely coincidences thanks to the ship's Infinite Improbability Drive.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ends as the Heart of Gold heads for a bite to eat at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.This series is bizarre comic sarcasm at its best. A smile automatically paints itself on your face as you begin to read. The series reads like a highly improbable dream sequence.

Dull moments were rare, and fickle as human brains are, even in those moments I found myself cooking up some nonsensical variation on Adams' play-of-words. My only regret is re. the depressed robot Marvin. Though it was initially delightful to imagine a sentient, melancholy machine, in my view Marvin's level of conversation never reached those of the other main characters (Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillian).

To call these books anything less than a masterpiece of wit is not only an insult to the text, but an insult to one of the greatest comic minds of the 20th century. So he hated his works?? Interesting, since he wrote little else. If he were to denounce Hitchhiker he would basically be dismissing himself as an author.But all retaliatory remarks aside, this book (and all the sequels) is an absolute triumph of the ludicrous over reason, a battle that I wage daily.

I came to this book and thought, how is it possible to do science fiction at the same time as satire? And, as I found out through reading, it was quite simple. The first thing that sticks out in my mind as amusing was that Adams completely threw out the rule book on grammar in book-writing, and just went with whatever fit him. It was such a bizzare break from the norm that it felt quite good, and was also, as a result of making up rules, quite amusing.Furthermore, the work he did with the characters was quite good. Sure, they were still shallow enough to see the pits by the end of the book, but considering it left enough to be desired to buy the next book at the same time as giving enough to fit in the original, that's forgivable. And really, they were all extremes, except for the humans, weren't they? That made it all the more funny, to me.If you don't trust me, which is entirely possible, trust the other 400+ people that have already posted reviews.

That book was The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. What really amazed me was the fact that I actually enjoyed reading this book. Since then I have even gone on to read the rest of the &quot;Trilogy&quot;. I think that what really got me hooked on this book was the author's, unique writing style. The best way to describe this is to take a look at the first page of the book.&quot;This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with the digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the ocean. And then, one Thursday, nearly 2000 years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible, stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.&quot; (1)While it is obvious that the author is trying to be comical, if one is to dig a little deeper it can also be seen that Douglas Adams manages to introduce many of our society's different social problems such as technology, economics, evolution and religion. It is typical for his writing to criticize everything in a skeptical and humorous way. But at the same time he never presents any concrete solutions to the problems he deals with. He leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not it is something they are concerned with. I think that this is important as it allows for each reader to use their imagination and see the story from their own perspective.His humorous style lies in his objectivity. He doesn't come right out and say, &quot;money doesn't cause happiness&quot;, and instead he says that people are always concerned about the movement of small green pieces of paper. Douglas Adams just suggests as to what is going on and leaves it up to the reader to figure things out for themselves. He also uses the example of digital watches in order to criticize technology, which is something that we are very proud of. But if you think about it, you become aware that he isn't actually criticizing digital watches, he is criticizing the whole technology, which is in his opinion not the great thing that we think it is.Another reason I liked these books so much is that you can read the books over and over again, and each time you manage to find something that you did not notice before. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is so full of jokes. He always manages to find a twisted and unexpected solution to the problem at hand and really keeps the reader baffled as to what will happen next. He looks at things in an original and very interesting manner. For example, he makes fun of the fact that the human race thinks that they are the most intelligent beings on earth, and explains that this isn't quite right. He says that the most intelligent beings are the mice, then the dolphins, and humans are only the third most intelligent beings. The mice are in fact responsible for the construction of the Earth, in order to find the question to the answer of the Meaning of Life, Universe and Everything. Humans used them as laboratory experiments but they actually just used us, not as we thought that we used them. Now to someone not familiar with the book this seems rather strange and doesn't make much sense, but somehow all of it manages to fit together.Overall, I think that this book really helped to open my eyes as to just how creative and interesting a good book can be. It may not be a classic in the true sense of the word, but it was something that I truly enjoyed and that is not something I can claim about many books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I actually don't read books very often but I read this one seven times now and I still can't help laughing out loud every time I read it again. Also, a very good Dutch translation is available."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ever a fan of the late great Douglas Adams, I would like to add along with my fellow reviewers who gave this novel 5 stars that it is one of the more imaginative stories ever thought out, and indeed one of the oddest. It is quite hilarious and Mr. Adams was one of the few science fiction writers who could insert some real-life humor into his work. While you read about Arthur Dent whizzing around space in a most improbable ship, his experiences and feelings are instantly recognizable.Perhaps some people don't get it. It's on many schools' summer reading lists and kids might be expecting Homer or Shakespeare instead of some good laughs. But the laughs certainly aren't at the expense of your intellect. These aren't stupid jokes. Perhaps that's why not everybody gets them."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must admit I am one of the many Hitchiker Nuts out there. I have read the book, re read and then re re read it over and over. In fact I have read it so many times that I am currently in the process of getting my 3rd copy of it! As for the book itself..it is bizzare, strange and altogether confusing. My advice when reading it for the first time is to remember what Adams says at the start of it where he talks about where he came up with the idea of for it...being drunk in a field. Just kind of look at the book through that approach and maybe it will make sense. If not read it again, keep reading it til you get it and then move onto the next one and so on. And of course...dont forget to ask WHAT THE ULTIMATE QUESTION IN FACT IS!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining. Douglas Adams did a brilliant job carrying the reader along with his absurd style of writing. In fact, at times the book gets so absurd that it's hard to follow. But I still recommend it as a great read.Basically the book is about two friends that live on earth. Arthur Denton and Ford Perfect. Ford Perfect (who is actually an alien) reveals to Arthur that the world is going to end. Not long after their conversation, a Vogon spaceship appears and announces that earth will be destroyed shortly because it is in the way of a new intergalactic highway bypass that is being built through our galaxy. Ford and Arthur manage to board the ship before the earth is demolished, and they are quickly discovered.The Vogon ship ejects them into space and they get picked up by another ship called the \\"Heart of Gold\\" which houses the Infinite Improbability Drive. They travel to the planet Magrathea to figure out what to do about their non-existent planet earth. And they learn that earth was really a giant organic computer that was working on finding the meaning of life. But 5 minutes before the program was done the Vogons destroyed it. Ah, the irony!But I don't want to give anymore away so I'll leave you with that. This book is great for all ages and hard to put down the whole way through."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book rules.

Though funny on the outside it has a continuous undercurrent of satire and irony running alongside.The kind of book you could read over and over again without getting a wee bit bored.Arthur, a very normal guy has known Ford Prefect (one of the most ingenious but irritating characters ever created)for six years.One day Ford comes and tells Arthur that they are to leave the earth as soon as possible beacuse by a curious quirk of fate the earth is going to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.Arthur doesn't disbelieve him though and they hitch a ride on the Vogon ship as they watch the earth vapourize.This is followed by a series of wonderful adventures(?)that could only be devised by Douglas Adams.They get themselves into all kinds of situations and surprisingly get out of them . One feels though that the Author is a touch cynical about everything around him and implements his cynicism in his characters.The c! haracters are probably not very well defined with the exception of Arthur Dent who I guess everyone identifies with.Everyone else in the book is very wacky and all of them would be very good case studies for aspiring psychologists. All in all an excellent read and should not be missed by anyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I didn't enjoy the book a whole lot. I guess it was a guys book.

With our digital watches and all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I was in high school, there were two types of people, the ones who were cool, and the ones who thought that the ones who were cool were were not that cool at all. I was caught in between. I, on the other hand, had first hand accounts of how the other one lived, died, and copulated with the other. It seemed as if I had an omnipotent position in the poitics of teen angst. Soon, I was to learn, that I myself was a pawn in the chess match we call puberty. In that confused state, I was introduced to the most informative, amusing, piece of literature, that any intelligent life form of any age could have been privy too stumble upon. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the first and only reason I began to read. It was the first book that I became involved with, that I began to understand. Life, the universe and everything, meant more than words. Douglas Adams is a shaman, not in a religious manner, but in an intelligent, an understanding, and in the most human of emotions kind of way. Douglas Adams to me is a sort of father, in that he showed me the way to understanding, in a world that refuses to accept science and the understanding of truth. He to me is the messiah that so many ignorantly accept."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I will never get back the precious time I wasted reading this stupid book for my upcoming book club meeting.This was a &#34;best seller&#34;?

Out of the many books I have read and owned, this is definitely one of the greatest. The great characters, the hilarious storytelling and dialogue, the comical, strange situations, and Douglas Adams' unique talent make this a good read from start to finish. If you like comedy, science fiction, or any good book whatsoever, you will like this.P.S.- What's P.S. stand for anyway?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Though I'd heard of this book for years I'd never read it until recently. I'd definitely characterize this book as Monty Python-like in its humor and approach. And, if you think about it, the original release of the book parallels those early Monty Python movies like the 'Life of Brian'. And, this book basically is about the meaning of life. I for one enjoy British humor and found this book to be a fun romp thru space. The author has a keen imagination and uses it well. The fun part about this book is that it is a fantasy and as such the author is given free reign to conjure up all sorts of silly and outlandish plots and schemes. However, I found that he wrapped the story with just enough \\"scientific\\" data that it bordered on the nearly, almost but not quite believeable. The improbability drive is one just such example. You can tell the author has fun making this journey up and you end up having fun being pulled along by some of the witty antics. At times I found myself laughing out loud about some of the dialog and insights given by the characters. Even the thought that mice rule the Earth does get one to thinking about \\"what ifs\\". I don't know that I'll continue on in the \\"trilogy\\" but I'm glad I read this one. It's a fun, light hearted read that is worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy was just about the hippest book for a lot of us in the early 80's. The cult following begat a franchise of video games, radio programs and a TV series, all of which deal with this dry witted tale of Earthman Arthur Dent and his journey through the galaxy.I'm not sure if the book has aged as well as its most loyal fans would claim it has. Much of the humor that seemed edgy 20 years ago now seems outdated in a Weird Al sort of way. Nonetheless, any book that opens with the destruction of Earth can't be all bad.Following our famous cast of characters through the bizarre events that they mostly seem to have no control over is always a pleasure, even when it's a bit of a corny one. The dialogue is steeped in Adams' very British humor and has always seemed like the best thing about the series. The conversations between such oddball characters as Ford Prefect and galactic president/scoundrel Zaphod Beeblebrox are worth any lapses into the preposterous."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"interesteing read and concept though this novel has no real beginning, middle or end, a bit like outerspace. if your into over the top humor in sci fi form, pick it up and have fun."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is the best book ever and anyone who hasn't read it is a loony"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Book was misrepresented to attract buyers.Book was advertised as 1st edition and it was NOT.Also the image that was chosen for an item was absolutely misrepresentation (I'm talking about an autograph).Seller did not respond to my emails after the purchase.As I was looking at a book it had a price tag of $2.00 from used book store.It tells me that this person did not make an innocent mistake.I think everyone needs to be aware of this and think twice before dialing with this seller."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, let's get this straight. This isn't science fiction. It's social satire. And I'm afraid the satire has dated rather badly. Since Margaret Thatcher was ousted, putting the boot into the class gaffes of the newly trendy seems pointless. I no longer find it funny to joke about how seriously one takes going out to lunch (which, in the roaring eighties, WAS kinda funny, especially at the hands of skilled actors like those who did the radio shows). Adams writes very droll modern dialogue, but putting it in a book kinda takes away the punch. Adams was once script editor for Dr. Who, and I think HHGTTG harkens back to his luvvie days at the Beeb.For social satire that plays with the conventions of science fiction, get Harry Harrison's &quot;Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers&quot;. The aliens have much funnier names, too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sorry, but I don't get all the fuss. The book is episodic. The writing is sophomoric. And I get the impression that Adams was either one sick dude or doing heavy drugs. A summer read, only for the bored. Doesn't deserve the following it has. If you want comedic sci-fi, try Connie Willis."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is hard to judge because it is not a book that makes you think, it is more of a leisure book that is fun to read. Adams is a good writer in that he moves fast and makes you anxious for what comes next, but there are not many themes and there is not much character development."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy book written by Douglas Adams is a book that I could not really recommend as a book focused around education specifically, however I can highly recommend it as a way to stay up late reading and apologizing to your roommate after he wakes up unexpectedly in the middle of the night from unexplainable laughter. The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a book which incorporates some of the most brilliantly put together random event while all somehow making sense together in sequence. The theme of the entire book is put together from douglas's amusing imagination where some of the most hilarious scenarios scientifically fit together while integrating our current history and politics. While the book is extremely out there it is also put together in a way we can relate to it. All in all I would recommend this as a great fast read that you can continue on in the rest of the series if you desire."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"While the book seems to be wildly popular, I did not like it.I loved the beginning (about chapter 1-3), which were funny and witty. Yet during the travels through space I didn't consider very funny. While there was somewhat of a plot it seemed to be mostly pointless. However, there was a great twist in chapter 28 (or was it 29?); the book has only 35 chapters.Overall: good beginning and good end, but a waste of my time in the middle."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As this outlandish story begins, earthling Arthur Dent, lying in front of a bulldozer about to demolish his house to make room for a byway, doesn't realize that finding a new home is the least of his worries. After convincing him to leave his post to share a drink, his unintentionally conspicuously-named alien (unbeknownst to Dent) friend of five years, Ford Prefect, plies him with drinks and then shares the big news - the earth is about to be demolished to make way for...an intergalactic byway. Fortunately, Prefect is able to save them both from demolition, after which they become space travel companions. Defying what appear to be insurmountable odds, the two are able to survive certain death and spend time with former acquaintances. During their journey they learn what Prefect has been missing during the 15 years he was stranded on earth, as well as the meaning of life and how the earth was first formed. A central part of the plot is the existence and content of the guide that Prefect was working on when he got stuck on earth, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It contains helpful information on a variety of topics for galaxy travelers like this, (p 76) \\"Space...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is.\\" This short novel provides a sometimes silly, frequently funny look at alien-human interaction but is probably better for fans of space-related science fiction than average readers. Similar: Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein and Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle. Also good: The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before you read this review, you should know that I am not a fan of science fiction. The only other book I've read that any reasonable person might claim is science fiction would be Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut. Any fan of sci fi will tell you that Vonnegut isn't actually a science fiction writer. He's a satirist.I decided to read the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy because of its popularity. For the uninitiated (and I'm barely initiated) the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was originally a radio show on BBC. The first novel (which I am reviewing here) was based on portions of the radio show (although Adams mixed the order of things up when he set down to write the novels). Other novels followed until there were four (the trilogy of four). Some years later a fifth book was added to the series. There has also been a movie, record albums, a TV show and so. It gets confusing because the novels, TV shows, and movies of the same name, mix and jumble the order and content of the original radio show. To further complicate things, the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy title is often used to describe the entire series of novels not just this one.Like I said, Sci Fi is not my thing, but this novel isn't serious science fiction, it's inspired lunacy (I didn't make that up - I read it somewhere, but it's true. The novel has a \`Monty Python like quality'. I especially enjoyed many of the little diversions from the main plot (like the tale of the warrior-like planet that attacks the earth but fails to take scale into consideration and are inadvertently swallowed by a small dog).It's something of a mystery to me though why this novel is such a sensation. Sure, it's amusing, but in an inconsequential way. I liked it, found it quite funny , but I have to wonder if it deserves such high praise and loyalty. I can't say this light hearted romp deserves much more than 3 stars.Personally, I prefer Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I thought this book was a really good book.The only reasons why I started reading the series is because I saw the movie.

The novel was completely devoid of plot, making the reader ready to put it down after only a few chapters. It was also rather confusing at some points and the reader is led to believe many occurrences of improbable events that are explained as intentional because of the &#8220;improbability drive&#8221; in the main characters&#8217; space ship.The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy severely lacks plot. The story focuses on the travels of four unlikely comrades and their morose robot, Marvin. The entire plot of the story can be summarized in a few sentences: The two characters from Earth get a ride on a spaceship, seconds before the Earth is destroyed, only to be kicked off of the ship into open space. Conveniently, they are picked up by a stolen ship powered by an &#8220;improbability drive&#8221;, hence the convenience of the Earthlings&#8217; pickup.... The book is pointless and has really no theme, symbolism, or any of the elements of literature that are to be expected in a novel.There is also surprisingly frequent use of common grammatical errors such as missing commas, misplaced modifiers, and sentence fragments. The grammar in the book makes it hard to respect the author much for his writing ability. There also seems to be large words used where they are unnecessary that just seem to be attempts to make the book seem better and the author smarter.One thing I liked about the book was the author&#8217;s use of the character Marvin, the eternally depressed robot programmed only to make lives miserable. Although Marvin was rather annoying, he accurately represents and criticizes people who act very much like him. Marvin was so depressing in fact that he saved the heroes lives by talking to another machine, making it feel compelled to kill itself. Obviously, Marvin is an exaggeration of people who only see the bad side of things, but he still brought forth thoughts of how people could be like that.Overall, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a rather poor piece of literature that seemed to be more of a waste of time than an enjoyable novel. Douglas Adams shadows some aspects of the real world, but the poor writing, lack of plot, and undeveloped characters made the book less interesting and made it harder to notice a theme or relation to my life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I do not understand why people love this book. Or why they think it's funny. It's just so boring. There's no plot, there's no character development, and the characters are one-dimensional anyway.The entire story can be summed up in one sentence: The Earth is destroyed, and Arthur is saved by Ford Prefect, who is an alien researching Earth.Woo, what an exciting plot. Honestly, I'd rather be on the Earth when it was destroyed than go on this boring adventure.However, it's obviously a cult classic, and I guess it's just one of those books that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime.

Its only redeeming quality is that, while I found it to be boring, uninteresting, and at best marginally funny on occasion, it was a very fast read, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time on it, or just give it up entirely. Right up until the end, I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. I can think of at least two dozen books written in the 20th century that were better written, with better plots, characterization, and, for some, even humor. If you think a book is &quot;good&quot; because it's trendy and popular, by all means, this is THE book for you; but if you're interested in quality literature -- something of more substance, meaning, and purpose than you'll find on the magazine rack at your local convenience store -- &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; is something to avoid."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I suppose this book is written for a different type of reader than I am.

He has what most other sci-fi writters don't, and that is the abillity to keep a reader interested without having to introduce a multitude of caracters or having to fil the book with scientific babble ( Arthur.c.Clark, David Brin).

It is like watching the opening scene of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (where they are argueing about sparows carrying coconuts), and saying it is bad because sparows obviously can't carry coconuts.

It was almost as if the author fell asleep at the end of writing, said \\"Ok, I'm done\\" and published it.The story has its moments of humor, to be sure.

This is not a book that was first written to stand alone so you need to be sure to have all the sequels on hand when you start as it is a short read as well.Overall, people who enjoy Monty-Python type hi-jinks will enjoy this.

The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. He and his friend, Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years, are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. Their rescue was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. On his journey through space, Arthur discovers many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and that the Earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. Douglas Adams' use of situational irony in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes the book a hilarious and entertaining read.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is completely full of situational irony that enhances the novel's over all effect on the reader. In the beginning of the book, a alien warship comes to destroy the planet Earth to make room for an interstellar bypass. Similarly, on Earth, the main character, Arthur Dent, has been trying for days to stop a wrecking crew from destroying his house to make room for a interstate highway. The alien ship says that a notice has been posted 300 light-years away at their home planet, and that the inhabitants of earth have had thirty years to see the notice. The alien invaders promptly destroy the earth seconds before it completes its function. To find the question to the ultimate answer, forty-two. Arthur and Ford are rescued by the heart of gold, a ship that has just been invented it is so advanced that it makes interstellar bypasses no longer need by the universe.All these events are situational irony. The fact that the alien wrecking crew posted a notice 300 light-years away from earth and expected the humans to read it and lodge a complaint against the rest of the galaxy is very ironic. Also in this book, the earth is a giant supercomputer that has been working for billions of years to find the question to the ultimate answer. Five minutes before it has completed its task, it is destroyed by the alien demolition crew. Many other ironic situations exist in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, everything from extremely depressed robots, a universe contained in a piece of sponge cake, and how mice have secretly been controlling humans since the beginning of time.It is because of all these ironic situations in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that make this a very entertaining book. Douglas Adams' use of situational irony definitely enhances the overall meaning of the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you only read one book in the rest of your pitiful earthling life, make it this one!! Here is an example of the valuable philosphical and historical education this book will endow you with:There isn't a God. Not any more. There used to be. He was very insistent that he exists exclusively on the idea of faith without proof. He went on to design amazing and incredibly improbable creations, including the mind-boggling Babelfish, worn inside the ear of galactic hitchhikers. The fish, which parastically feeds off of sound waves entering your brain and excretes energy waves straight into your mind, allows the host to accurately understand sound transmissions in any language. Later, a scientist pointed out that this direct affront to the idea of probability and evolution offered direct and undisputable proof that there, was, in fact a God. \\"I hadn't thought of that,\\" said God, and immediately disappeared from existence after having proven himself wrong.Thus, you are on your own now. Thus, you need Douglas Adams' cunning wit and sarcastic advice to guide you through the rest of your own silly existence!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"this is the best book ever. it is very funny. I have and have read all the books. they are very good, as all of douglas adam's books are."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an imaginative book that takes the reader along for a wild ride through interstellar systems to the far regions of Magrathea. Led by his friend Ford Perfect, Arthur Dent travels the galaxy, meeting many people and creatures along the way. The book is dripping with situational humor like the Earth being destroyed 5 seconds before the secret of life is to be found, as well as the often unintended sarcastic remarks from Ford Perfect, who is sent through the galaxy to revise the electronic book Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. Although somewhat confusing at times, the creative imagination and description helps the reader actually envision intergalactic travel. Arthur and Ford are led through much of their adventure by The Intergalactic President Zaphod Beetlebrox on the spaceship \\"Heart of Gold&quot;. Zaphod is a creature with two heads and three arms, he was later described to have gained the third arm to improve his ski-boxing. This is another example of Adams' imagination and creativity. A humorous portion of the book comes when a computer says the calculated meaning of life is 42, which offers no more of an answer than anyone else's theory of the meaning of life. Along with humor, Adams uses satire to mock things like society and government. He states the Zaphod's duties as president are to take the attention away from the governments actual power. Zaphod achieves these goals by spending the first two years of his ten year term in trouble with the law. If satirical and sarcastic humor mixed with sci-fi entertainment sound appealing, The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy has exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To put it simply, this book moved me.
