This was one of my all time favorite children's books."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"I also read this book many years ago as a child and have never forgotten it. It contains many wonderful characters and adventures that are truly memorable. This is a book that has survived over time and remains a story that lets children use their imaginations. It remains one of my all-time favorite children's books and I am lucky enough to have two original copies. I am delighted that the book is now being published again so that I can share it with my young nephews and nieces."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"Ah! To relive the memories of reading this book again. I have read this book many times when I was a child so long ago. I remember building a box just like Johnny and Janey did and trying to fly to The Land of Noom just as they did. I would lay under the stars at night and try to imagine what it would be like to go to the Moon, not knowing just what the future would bring. My mother still has the first edition of that book. My two sisters and three brothers sometimes hint that they would like to have that copy. I have purchased six copies of this book for my mother, so each will have their own copy at Christmas this year. Such nostalgia! I recommend this book for all children to read."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"Ah, nostalgia! A friend of my older sister gave me this book when I was, well, nevermind.

Such a rich and inventive tale, and it captures a different tone, time, and place that will infuse your spirit.As an adult, I searched for this book at antiquarian shows. My mother had given my copy away in a cleaning spree and I was heartbroken and always searching for a copy. Finally, I found one. You don't want to know how much I paid for it. But I'm thrilled to see that there is such a huge following and appreciation for this book. It's wonderful."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"When my mother was a child, my grandmother bought her this book and read it to her often. In turn, my mother read it to me and my sibs over and over. I have the original (published in 1921) and my sibs have copies.

Thank you for having it affordable so I could do this."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"I was thrilled to discover The Magical Land of Noom back in print. I was given a copy by my grandparents in 1944 when I was five years old. I read it and reread it as a child. I read and reread it to my children. Our copy is now just loose pages kept in a binder. I have now ordered two copies of the book, one for me and one for my grandchildren. Thank you, thank you to the folks who have made this book available. I hope many people are made aware of the beauty of the illustrations and the gentle goodness which the story imparts. I will certainly spread the word to my friends and acquaintances."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"I am so thrilled that this book is available again!! My twin sister and two brothers have commented many times about our fond memories of bedtime when our parents would read to us about the Magical Land of Noom. Even today, some 30 years later, we each look at the moon and think of Johnny and Janey and laugh with amazement that our innocent children thoughts remain so sharp in our adult imaginations. I have an old copy of the original publication, somewhat torn, tattered and crayoned, which has reminded me periodically to try to find this book. Together with the help of my siblings, we have searched bookstores from Chicago to Cleveland to NYC to Salt Lake City, and have been disappointed to learn that it was not in publication. So, today, I just happened to log onto Amazon.com, and here it is!!!! I have ordered six copies for my family and expect to be reordering for many years to come when I need a gift for special friends with little ones. The Land of Noom shoul! d be a standard for all children, along side such classics as Pooh and Christopher Robin, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle, Charlotte's Web, The Wizard of Oz, The Secret Garden, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, 101 Balloons, and so many others. I am looking forward to sharing the enchantment with my niece and nephews, and hope this book remains forever in publication."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"While doing an out of print book search on Internet for one of my favorite childhood books, The Magical Land of Noom, I discovered to my great surprise and joy that it was reissued this year! Born in 1938, I was given the book at about age 5 and I still have that much read copy which was also much loved by my children.Wanting to give a copy to my grandchild,I was seriously considering spending upwards of $250 for a used copy.This book is singularly magical in the English tradition of such classics as The Princess and the Goblin and The Phoenix and the Carpet and appeals to the very imaginative child. Like the Wizard of Oz, it foll- ows a sort of &quot;quest&quot; type plot in which the char- acters must succeed in getting through many scary adventures and surmounting many obstacles to reach their goal of returning a long imprisoned princess to her throne. There are molasses candy bogs,ink rains, and a wicked magician, but there are also pleasant adventures involving such delights as lemonade springs, mushrooms that taste like cake, and a wonderful meal served by invisible hands.The illustrations,including fascinating black line drawings in addition to full color plates, are gorgeous and bear the imprint of the design trad- itions of that era.The reading level is set at 9- 12 but I think the book can be introduced to a certain sort of child even as early as 5. I rejoice in this reissue and was pleased to read of the delight of other Amazon customers at this re- view site. It seems that I wasn't the only one to have such vivid,striking memories of this special book. I have purchased 6 copies for special friends and relatives,young and old. Now a new generation can explore the Magical Land of Noom."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"I couldn't believe it when I saw this book was being published again. I must have read it three times -- once all in one day when I was only about 10. That was more than three decades ago, and I will definitely be getting this edition for my own children, now 10 and 12. It painted such vivid pictures in my mind that I can still see the flying machine (which I believe was made of an orange crate with spools for dials).

He even got held back in first grade which made him sad and he actually started to hate reading and books in general. The teachers and our parents treated him like he was dumb and school was turning in to a nightmare for him. Then in second grade he had an angel for a teacher. She was patient and she loved her students and she read THIS special story book to them. My little brother came home every night and at the dinner table he would tell us all about the adventures from the magical land of Noom which is &quot;moon&quot; spelled backward. His eyes sparkled and his speech became animated. He couldn't wait to get to school the next day to hear more. He did so much better that year and he kept trying with books because of that kind teacher and this enchanting story book. Johnny Gruelle, who created Raggedy Ann and Andy, knew how to reach children with his light-hearted, funny adventures and his utterly charming illustrations.

I have always said my brother and I were named after the children who flew to the far side of the moon and had the most wonderful adventures. Where else would you find Kneebud ice cream or popcorn with mustard on it to keep it hot, but Noom? Or chocolate mushrooms growing beside a lemonade spring?This is a timeless tale, told with such imagination and downright glee, that it should be a part of every home and public library's collection. Huzzahs to all who arranged for this new addition after more than 70 years!"},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"This is a children's book, but it is also a book for world weary adults wishing to refresh their spirits by traveling back a few decades to a much more innocent and optimistic era.This book is the product of a time when modern juggernauts such as global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation, acid rain, habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, nuclear weapons, nuclear waste, biochemical weapons, toxic pesticide poisoning of birds, bees, butterflies, and children, etc. were, for the most part, undreamed of.It is doubtful that most writers of our decade could write and illustrate for children with such unburdened imagination and innocence as Johnny Gruelle did in The Magical Land of Noom. (How could Neil Armstrong's cramped and complicated space capsule ever compare with the simplicity and beauty of Johnny and Janey's flying machine?)One can only hope that the current Kali Yuga will eventually give way to another golden age in which innocence, imagination, the beauty and integrity of nature, and human goodness can once again be supported on this planet.

The story and concept made such an impression on me that I have searched for the book through-out my adult life. The details have grown fuzzy except for the cow, the dark side of the moon, and the flying machine. The overall concept, however, is still fresh in my mind. Children really can accomplish good things. They are important and have a place in the world.

I'm so grateful it is being published again."},{"Title":"The Magical Land of Noom (Books of Wonder)","review":"The Magical Land of Noom is the only book I have ever read to my children and grandchildren that fascinated ALL of them without fail.

I bought it and immediately read it from cover to cover as soon as I received it. When I started to read, I wondered if I'd get bored halfway through, as by then the \\"joke\\" of these crazy letters would be old. But Joe kept coming up with different scenarios, so the book is fresh, funny, and fabulous from cover to cover! (I laughed so hard that my husband had to close his office door to concentrate while I read.) I'm not sure which letters are my favorite, but there's a part where he \\"confuses\\" letters to Kia and Ikea that caused me to hyperventilate.Beyond just being clever, I think the book particularly resonated with me because, I, too am unemployed and have tried practically everything to get hired since my layoff in 2001. It has been so frustrating! But reading what Joe did to keep himself sane not only amused me, but also inspires me! So now every time I have another lousy interview, or get dinged for the perfect job, I only have to read Joe's book to get a smile on my face! Buy this book and you will smile, too!Thanks, Joe... you rock!!"},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be good &quot;toilet lit&quot;, something for the guests to read. I really didnt like it, but since I spent the money I still put it in the guest bath. Turns out most of our guests thought it was dry and quite boring. We tend to enjoy the &quot;letter sytle&quot; books....but this one was pretty much the worst. I would tend to recommend either Consumer Joe (our current favorite) or Lazlo Letters. I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I have never been more skeptical over the hype of a book more than this one. Well for once the hype lived up to my expectations. I loved this book, not just for its humor and originality, but for it's hidden social commentary. The author is smart enough to realize the serious statement that this book makes, though he cleverly disguises it all with humor. Crazy or genius, he puts it all out on a limb and walks away. Hiring practices get a kick in the rear and they don't even know it. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"From the title to the last letter this book was a fun and fast read. A real original humor book that gets funnier every time you read it. The fact that this was never meant to be a book in the first place makes the whole concept more hillarious. Great job to the author for its brilliant execution."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"This book really set me off laughing. A great example of making lemonaide from lemons. My favorite letters are the ones where he ads his personal stories. I especially loved the letter to MTV. Can't wait to read the follow up to this this book."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I read it the first time by myself and I found myself laughing so hard that people on the plane were staring! The second time I read it out loud in front of friends after a dinner party and they were falling off the couch! I know a number of people who have been let go recently and I have recommended this book to them to pick up their spirits. This is a perfect book for the times. These irreverant letters are ones that everyone would like to write and a must read for all HR people."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I thought I could get away with just skimming through this book at a local book store. I could not. I found myself stopping too often to catch my breath from laughing. It was a bit embarassing to say the least. It was the kind of laughter that the more you try to control, the harder you laugh. Several people actually asked me what I was reading and went off to find the book themselves. That laugh was a great experience and had to have added a few years to my life. Ended up buying the book and continue to read in public."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"While reading this book I found myself continuously laughing out loud. I paused for a moment to think of when the last time a book made me laugh like this. The answer was never. The notion that a person would write such outrageous cover letters and actually mail them is just priceless. I have read the book cover to cover three times, and still find myself skimming through the pages and reading certain letters to friends over the phone. Many friends have ended up purchasing copies for themselves. This book is a great example of the American sense of humor and our ability to laugh at ourselves during adverse situations."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Unemployed? Joe Mozian's been there, and in fact, is still there. His humor is a buoy for troubled times and a damaged economy. His audacity comes from a place deep within that we all can relate to: Joe mines the well of vengeful feelings that is the sole domain of the fired, the laid-off, or the unceremoniously dismissed. Intelligent readers will relate to his pursuit of profession, and will recognize him as one of their own, the literal Joe America in search of a job wherever he can find it. His wacky and irreverent approach to the great American job search is a hilarious tonic for this country's growing class of out-of-work professionals."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"This book is a rare find. Employed or unemployed, it will make you laugh out loud constantly...then, of course, you will try to tell someone else what was so funny. They will want to read it too. He is crazy funny...DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!!!"},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I found this book at our library's used book sale, and am glad that the dollar I spent on it is not going to the author. Clearly, Mozian is no Lazlo Toth. His attempts at satire fail so dismally that I cannot imagine even placing this book in the same class as Toth. You can see the punchlines coming a mile away: writing a Coke letter to Pepsi? How screamingly funny. I wondered how this piece of dross ever got published, then I looked at the publisher's name. Now it all makes sense."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"While the author did get a few chuckles out of me, I'm afraid the concept of wacky letters sent to companies has already been done, several times over, and his twist wasn't quite fresh enough to wow me. (In fact, my husband recalls that in the 70s or 80s someone had done the exact same thing with cover letters.) Certainly there was some charm and humor in the one where he asks his father if he can pay him for chores, but I think, for example, the Paul Rosa books and certainly Don Novello's &quot;Lazlo Letters&quot; were a bit sharper, and their inclusion of actual corporate responses does give them more of an edge."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I thought this book would be a collection of resumes/cover letters/etc. actually submitted to various companies -- instead it's all written by the author. yes, some of them are funny, but his schtick gets tired after a while.

It seemed promising, but honestly, I found the letters to be very bland and unimaginative. The ideas weren't fleshed out with enough detail and most of the jokes fell flat. Nowhere near the caliber of Letters From A Nut or Lazlo Letters."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"One of my marketing students brought this book to my attention. The author succeeds in finding the humor in the difficulties of job hunting during a sluggish economy. But what I was most impressed with is his genuine knowledge of marketing and his willingness to riducule all that he knows. It has now become routine for me to begin each class by reading one of the letters from this book, many of which have set the mood for fantastic discussions and case studies. This should be required reading for all business school grads lacking a creative edge."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I've been unemployed for a while now, and this book helped me deal with my situation. The author is in a predicament too many Americans are in, but he has an unbelievable ability to not take it too seriously. This collection of letters kept me laughing from cover to cover. I'm buying it for all my unemployed friends to help them remember that there's more to life than a job."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"If you've ever been laid off, like most of my friends and I currently are, you know how frustrating stock rejection letters can be. Joe Mozian is speaking back for us all by challenging corporate America with his irreverent, gut busting sense of humor.He sends the letters none of us have the guts to send our-self. I laughed for three weeks after reading this book. Buy it, you'll feel like you're back in the game. We'll not really but you'll laugh really hard and feel better while counting your remaing weeks of unemployment."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"This is the kind of book that you can read again and again and again. Then put it down for a while. Then pick it up to read again and again and again. The humor really hits the spot."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"This was such a great collection: my favorite letters were the one to the company that laid him off, asking for a mailroom job, and the one asking his dad if he can do chores again for $20/wk. Oh-- and the generic fill-in-the-blank cover letter where the companies can supply the criteria they are looking for. The book builds momentum as you go, so the first 20 resumes are just so-so, but once I got to the halfway point I was laughing so hard that I was worried I would damage internal organs. I recommend this for anyone whose been job hunting in the past two years. It's a wasteland out there, and barring any actual response from employers (ha!), this is the only satisfaction to be had."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"These are the letters that you wish you had the courage to write. The idea of the human resources person opening one of these letters and wondering if it's for real makes it fall off the chair funny. With the illegal activities of the big execs coming to light, this is a most appropriate time for a slap back to corporate America, and this book does just that. Don't miss the marketing plans for Snapple and The GAP - they're hilarious!"},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Joe has just played the greatest practical joke ever on the stuffy hiring practices of corporate America. This is no doubt the funniest book I have ever read. I almost wish I was unemployed."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I never laugh out loud while reading. This book had me howling like a fool as I read it on a plane during a recent trip. Both passangers on my left and right eventually asked me what I was reading.

A real American humorist in the making."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I am still laughing ...!!! Need a job? Have a job? Hate your Job? It doesn't matter. You have to get this book.

His letter to his very own father is priceless."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I found this book gave me belly laughs like I have not had in years. It is so hilarious I could not put it down. This is such a joy to read...a real page turner to the end. Joe Mozian shows us how funny he can be in print. Not only is he a funny comedian, but a truely gifted writer and, of course great musician (search for Blue Clocks Green). I know this would make a perfect gift for anyone who has recently lost a job and of course for those ( if you are a supervisor) you will soon need to terminate (for any reason) at work. A must read for anyone who really needs to chortle about the world of work and have a delightfully joyful laugh out loud X 10."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Very funny and a good relief for those hunting in this tough job market. These are all the cover letters you wish you could write and still get the job."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Joe's book is a breath of fresh air to all of us tired job hunters.

Thanks Joe for making us all find laughter even when job hunting"},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Unemployed and wearing out the soles of your shoes by hitting the pavement, knocking on doors, sending out resumes and the like? This book will brighten your day as you trudge through the task of landing your next career adventure! A quick, fun, joyful and refreshing read while tackling the job market--loved it!"},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Hire Me Dumbass! is a chilling reminder that we are all one pink slip away from economic catastrophe - and a straightjacket. Still, Mozian's collection of cover letter dispatches from the apocalyptic landscape of the unemployed offers inspiration and laughs. While plying the likes of GE, the Bronx Zoo, and Enron for a job, Mozian employs a never before seen virtue in Corporate America: Honesty (which perhaps explains why he remains unemployed). Mozian's cover letters always tell the truth. Mozian freely admits, when writing Playboy, that he wants to work for the magazine because he likes \\"naked women.\\" When dropping WorldCom a line, the author discusses his \\"total inability to comprehend financial applications\\"; leaving the reader wondering if Mozian might have a point. Finally, Mozian tugs at the reader's heartstrings with his letter to NASA in which he admits he is blind (well, colorblind), but shall not be deterred from his dream to become an astronaut.Whether you find Mozian's work brilliant, hysterical, or just plain pathetic, you will no doubt be hooked on Joe Mozian after the first page. Laugh, cry, or sing along with the whole family, Mozian's collection of missives are a triumph for the unemployed and a beacon to ... well, whoever needs a beacon. Finally, let me say that someone should give this man a job. And while you're at it, give me one too."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I have read a variety of the available crank letter books and although I did find the early releases - Lazlo Letters, Letters From a Nut, to be hilarious, all that have followed since have relied on the same original gag. Every few years or so a new author or sequel emerges with the same idea, mostly to the same companies, and sadly with the same theme in the letters to each. Finally someone was willing, or clever enough, to break the mold! What intrigued me and excited me about Hire Me Dumbass, was that Joe Mozian (who bravely uses his real name unlike most previous crank letters authors) was able to change the concept enough, making his letters fresh and topical. He did not set out to write crank letters just for the purpose of being a crankster. He had a real cause. He really is the guy he's writing about in all of his queries. His letters seem more to have been written by a crank anarchist than from one of the dime-a-dozen humorist wannabees rehashing the original idea. Even the replies, though few compared with most crank letter books, are a testamonial of the indifference towards job hunters by human resource managers. The classic example of this is the generic postcard rejection Joe receives from Carvel. The note thanks him for his application to Carvel then lists three check boxes with reasons as to why Joe is not going to be considered for employment with Carvel. The sender merely checks off the box that best suits Joe and feels accomplished in is his/her job duties. It's interesting to note also that most other crank letters books are praised more for their replies than for the humor in the letters. The Hire Me Dumbass letters brilliantly stand on their own. To say this book is the best in the genre would certainly be an overstatement, but it's filled with enough laughs and finally 'originality' to make it a valuable addition to any humor fan's collection."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"I am a bit surprised that it has taken me over a year to discover this title. It is exactly the type of humor I usually seek out. Fortunately, it found me. The guy next to me on a long flight home from CA was reading it and laughing continuously. At first it was annoying, but curiosity won out and I eventually asked what was so funny. The title alone won me over and I uncharacteristically laughed out loud. He lent it to me when he was done and I soon became that annoying guy when I too began laughing non-stop. Eventually three or four people ended up passing it around and all had the same experience, and a few who never got their hands on it made a point to ask for the title - which prompted a few more laughs. It is a very funny book and I am so glad it saught me out!

I still laugh to myself when I think of the hapless assistants who are relegated to opening their boss' mail and then sit there trying to decide if this is for real or not and whether or not to show the boss.Can someone give this guy a job?!?! Evidently, he has too much time on his hands! If he's not gainfully employed soon, Volume II will come out. No company is safe. Better yet...don't give him a job.

The title turned me off right away, but I gave it a chance. I turned page after page without laughing once. It's crude, pedestrian and as the title suggests, dumb."},{"Title":"Hire Me Dumbass!","review":"Not too thrilled with the book, would have rather bought another copy of Lazlo and given it away. Save your money and look else where."},{"Title":"Belly Gunner","review":"This was a nice little read about the memories of World War II from Dale Aldrich who served as a Ball Gunner on a B-17.Dale didn't volunteer for the war. He was drafted. He says he wasn't afraid and would fight if so called on. Dale found himself being trained as an air mechanic simply because he drove tractors. It was assumed he knew how to work on them. He decides to become a gunner after he finds himself not being able to get something to eat since he worked a graveyard shift at an airfield. A clerk tried to warn him off saying gunners get killed.He later gets assigned to a B-17 and trains with them. He also finds out that the ship carrying the mechanics was torpedoed. Jumping to gunners school probably saved his life.Eventually, he finds himself in England. He becomes a ball gunner by trading positions with another taller man. He describes what it was like and the fact he used to sleep while the plane was in flight simply because it was warm in the ball turret versus the rest of the plane. Again, his life is saved as the other man get's killed on a mission while fighting fighters. His plane is shot down and he finds himself in Holland. He is betrayed and becomes a Prisoner of war and ends up in Stalag 17. Eventually, he gets his freedom and returns home.Overall, this book is aimed at the high school level. For what it is; it's a good book about a man sharing his experiences which are interesting to hear as they give an idea as to what hit was like versus the \\"romanticized\\" versions that come from movies. Stories such as Dales are invaluable especially when considering his generation is dying off and the war starts moving in to mythical realms.The stories are interesting such as Dale talking about Corporal Schultz versus Sargent Schultz of Hogans Heros. What happened in Stalag 17 and how some of that actually was used the movie Stalag 17.Some of the photos are interesting. Two I found particularly interesting were a photo of a guard fence where the Germans tossed used cans to build a sound barrier against possible escape and another where the author was examining a restored B-17G called the \\"Nine-O-Nine\\" which was a plane that I once got to take a ride in."},{"Title":"Belly Gunner","review":"The Belly Gunner is the dramatic, first-person narrative story of Dale Aldrich, an American GI who served in World War II, and who told of his life to author Carol Edgemon Hipperson.

I am no classical scholar, as is obvious from that last sentence, but I am a mom who reads alot to her children and I've a working understanding of Homer's poetic tale, The Odyssey. Ms. McCaughrean's version was gripping! We had a very hard time putting it down the first time, and on our second read through we just kept going until the end! This book enthralled a 7 and a 4, while remaining as true to the text as I've seen yet in a children's version (slight editing may be required for the very squeamish or quite young.) My children acted the tale out on their own when we were through and held impromptu literary discussions for days afterwards. Like Bible stories, Greek myths have been done a thousand times over for children. Before you set off to wade through to find the diamonds, take my word for it that this is definitely one of them. Also, her collection of classic mythical stories is recommended although, dare I say it, this is even better than that."},{"Title":"The Odyssey (Puffin Classics)","review":"For young readers not yet ready to tackle Homer in translation this prose version is a superb introduction to the epic's most stirring episodes. McCaughrean writes in an alliterative prose which honors the poetry of the original. She pumps new life into the tangle with the Cyclops, the lure of the Sirens, and the final smackdown on Ithaca when a weathered Odysseus teaches the loutish suitors a thing or two. Seventh graders here have really warmed to this commendable retelling. Our ancient history curriuculum has certainly benefitted from its inclusion."},{"Title":"The Odyssey (Puffin Classics)","review":"The disclosure of the publisher \\"Puffin\\" rightly gives the fact that this is a child's version away.

Do not buy this version. The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick was first published in 1987 in five volumes by Underwood/Miller, a small press. The books were reprinted endlessly by Citadel Press and also by mainstream publishers in the U.K. Those five volumes assembled all of Dick's short fiction (with some exceptions, such as stories later expanded into novels) from a wide variety of sources, and many of them had not previously been reprinted.This book from Subterranean Press is a very poorly edited version of the first volume of Collected Stories, with a smattering of ill-considered material added, and crucial information removed. They have inexplicably taken out the original preface and introductions and replaced them with ... NOTHING. They have inexplicably removed the publication information at the end of the book about many of the stories, including the first story \\"Stability.\\" Dick wrote that story as a teenager, and it remained unpublished until 1987. But there is no way to know that from reading this book. \\"Stability\\" is followed by \\"Menace React,\\" a half page story FRAGMENT new to this edition that ends abruptly without explanation after, well, a half page. If one goes to the back of the book, the nature of \\"Menace React is then at least explained in the notes. \\"Menace React\\" is followed by 24 stories from the beginning of Dick's professional writing career. There is much great material here, but you don't need this edition to find it.Aside from \\"Menace React,\\" there are some added notes by Gregg Rickman (though uncredited in the book) for several stories. These notes were originally published in 2009 in \\"The Early Work of Philip K. Dick Volume 1: The Variable Man and Other Stories.\\" That is all that is \\"new\\" in this version of the book. If this new material had been integrated in a minimally thoughtful manner, rather than crudely copied and pasted in after butchering the original text, it could have been a welcome addition. Instead, they have taken a masterpiece and turned it into a turd."},{"Title":"The King of the Elves","review":"These are Dick's earliest short stories. They are interesting and well-written, and there are some real gems here, especially the one about the dog barking at the trash truck. The only thing which would have improved the book as a whole would have been an introduction and some more contextual information at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The King of the Elves","review":"This is the first of five volumes reprinting most of PKD's short fiction in chronological order. The stories range from seriously dated historical curiosities to mini-masterpieces of high concept. There have been several previous editions reprinting Dick's stories but this one is by Subterranean Press, one of the finest specialty presses operating in the US today. If you like PKD you should get this entire series. Original/first printings of his works are prohibitively expensive."},{"Title":"Shadow Dances","review":"I received Shadow Dances as a gift, read it and thought it was a good read, nice pace, nice New Orleans feel.

The poems are a snapshot of an evolving verbal form of verse called catus. The verses are known and recited with personal modifications by many literate people in south India. They may mention well known poets, such as Kalidasa, but don't necessarily refer to the actual person. Kalidasa may be incanted in a modern setting, or be conversing with another poet from a different time period. Poetry and poets from former times are reinterpreted in the context of today's world in south India, in a form I found very refreshing."},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich: Instant Motivator","review":"This is a good CD. I own it and have listened to it a few times. Earl Nightingale gives a clear summary of Think and Grow Rich. To me, Napoleon Hill is the greatest success author/speaker ever and Think and Grow Rich is the single greatest book I have ever read. However, a part of this particular CD feels like an advertisement and could have been skipped. Also, the editorial reviews and the narrator of this CD talk about 13 principles. This could sometimes be the cause of confusion. Hill organized 13 Steps Toward Riches (in Think and Grow Rich) and 17 Principles of Personal Achievement (in his courses and lectures), also referred to as 17 Keys to Success. This CD talks about the 13 Steps in T&GR.;I would recommend this CD to you only after you have heard the 9 CD set that contains twelve hours worth of live lectures in Napoleon Hill's own voice. The set is calledYour Right To Be Richand was recorded in 1954 in Chicago. In this, Napoleon Hill talks about each of his seventeen Principles of Personal Achievement. The set is amazingly inexpensive and well worth the investment in cost, time and effort."},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich: Instant Motivator","review":"This is a unique book, though written to help become financially independent, the principles may be used to help achieve anything you may want to have in life or want to become.May start with the short CD (about 45 minutes) on this book read by Earl Nightingale, or 2 hour version read by Joe Slattery."},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich: Instant Motivator","review":"It is a simpler distilled version of the great book that has been around all of our lives.

A simple, to the point version of a classic self help book that rings as true today as it ever has. And that Earl Nightingale has a hell of a voice."},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich: Instant Motivator","review":"I have bought Napoleon Hill's book some month ago. I have tried to read it, but for a non native English speaker it is pretty difficult, therefore I gave up. But when I found this audio book I thought to give it a try. I liked the audio book. I liked all the principles and I am thinking to give a try and test them. Some of them look a little bit strange for a European, but as long as a lots of people consider Napoleon Hill like the father of motivational literature, should be something behind. A great note is also the lecture of Earl Nighthingale and also the sound like an old radio show gives you the impression that old good thinking is still valid in these days."},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich: Instant Motivator","review":"This is a great synopsis of the Think & Grow Rich philosophy. Think and Grow Rich is an excellent work written in 1937. It is essentially written from the perspective of the solid values of the World War II generation.I read Think & Grow Rich all the time. Next to the Bible, it is my favorite book. Make no mistake about it, reading and following the principles of Think and Grow Rich will help individuals in all walks of life achieve their goals. For instance, former Heavyweight Champion and International Boxing Hall of Famer Ken Norton credited his winning ways to Think and Grow Rich. Norton's victory over \\"The Greatest,\\" Muhammad Ali in 1973 is a great illustration of how one can beat the odds, achieve their goals and reach their fullest potential using the principles contained in the motivational bookThink and Grow Rich, a book that Norton discusses as a foundation for inspiration on the road to becoming a world champion. Norton also attributes what he learned from Think & Grow Rich for helping him to handle severe adversity from a near-fatal car accident in 1986.Individuals will accomplish their particular goal(s) in proportion to the effort they put into following the Think and Grow Rich philosophy. Reading and following the principles in this book will change your life. Think & Grow Rich is one of the greatest self-help books ever.P.S. Another great book that Norton kept at hand on the road to becoming a world champion wasSuccess Through A Positive Mental Attitude, by Napoleon Hill and W. Clement Stone.P.P.S. I also recommendEarl Nightingale's The Strangest Secret. This is an excellent work from 1956 that can help anyone to succeed in life.

It's two major thrusts are this: when you read the Bible you should expect God to speak to you through it. Not just academically, but spiritually. God wants to encourage us, correct us and guide us through His Word. The second thrust is that it is beneficial to memorize Scripture so we can quote it during times of weakness or temptation. Just as Jesus did when He was tempted by the devil. I would encourage EVERY Christian to read this book!"},{"Title":"He Still Speaks Today: Releasing the Dynamic Power of God's Word in Your Life","review":"My husband and I loved this book by John Sherrill, who shares his spiritual awakening related to the Bible. He does so with remarkable insight, honesty and reverence. Sherrill describes how he began his life influenced by the views of his father, who believed the Bible to be mostly historical and allegorical. But in his writing career, the author interviewed men and women who had a living relationship with Christ and accepted the Bible as the Word of God.When Sherrill began to read the Bible for himself, he found it spoke to the issues of his life (finances, alcoholism, family, sex, etc.) with the sharp edge of truth described in Hebrews 4:12.Sherrill calls the illumination of short passages of Scripture to be Manna words because they are God's gift of spiritual food for the day. But he also makes a strong case for Scripture memorization for our ongoing spiritual development.The previous reviewer is rightly concerned that Scriptures taken out of context and personalized can be misinterpreted. However, if we truly believe the Bible is the eternal Word of God, then He surely can speak to us through every verse. I'm glad YWAM books and those of many other ministries challenge us to love God's Word and let it draw us closer to Christ and guide our everyday life.It is indeed unfortunate that the previous negative review went unchallenged for nearly a year. That author appears to have had only a cursory experience with YWAM in making statements like this: \\"YWAM has a sad tendency to be biblically shallow.\\"According to who? That's quite a general statement to make about a global organization with nearly 20,000 full-time volunteer staff. And all of the staff from the president on down raise their own support, which by the way doesn't come from a Magic 8-Ball.Sherrill's view is supported by an illustration from the life of Dr. Douglas Feaver, a professor of Greek and Hebrew at Lehigh University who later helped form YWAM's University of the Nations. Dr. Feaver said that as he neared age 80, he and his wife Margaret began praying about whether to continue working with YWAM in Kona, Hawaii, or to retire and return home to Pennsylvania to be near their family. They were willing to go either direction to obey God.Dr. Feaver said that on his 80th birthday his daily devotional reading included 2 Samuel 19. As he read it, the story of Barzillai, a trusted friend of King David, leapt from the page with astounding personal impact. Verses 32-33 say, \\"Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. The king said to Barzillai, \`Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.'\\"Barzillai could have died in honor in the King's court, but he replied to David, \\"Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother.\\" Obviously, this Scripture applies to a specific individual in history, but Dr. Feaver said the timing of the reading, their mutual ages and the type of decision they each faced led him to take it as a personal word from God. He and Margaret returned to Pennsylvania.Sherrill's book, He Still Speaks Today, does not disappoint. Instead you will be drawn ever closer in relationship to your Savior."},{"Title":"He Still Speaks Today: Releasing the Dynamic Power of God's Word in Your Life","review":"I give this book two stars, because there are some things in it that may be worth reading. On the whole, though, the ways in which it encourages us to read the Bible are questionable at best.The book discourages a rather serious study of the Bible, perhaps unintentionally, and instead opts for what I can only call a Magic 8-Ball way of reading it--reading passages and waiting for a verse or two to 'stand out' or 'light up' or in some way draw the reader's attention, and see how that passage can somehow be applied to whatever problems one is facing. He calls these \\"Manna Verses\\", because he also experienced how when he came back to the passages later, they didn't 'stand out' but just sat on the page.This book is put out by YWAM Publishing, and I fear such things as this book are one reason YWAM has a sad tendency to be biblically shallow. In my time with them, I remember people trying to use verses like Jeremiah 29:11, \\"I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans to bless and not harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future\\", and to claim the promises for themselves, as if God were speaking to them in that verse, when in reality God was addressing that promise to a specific people at a specific time, as the context would easily show if they would have read it in context. Or they would try to use the verse in Hebrews where is says \\"Ask of me and I will give you the nations\\", and to try to claim the nations, not realizing that in it's context, both in Hebrews and in the Psalms, God is not speaking to them but to His Son, Jesus Christ.Probably the worst thing this type of reading does is that it makes the Bible about us and our problems, taking the emphasis off of Christ and what He has done for us. It isn't that the Bible does not address us, with rules about how we should live and things we need to do and to believe, as well as promises and words of encouragement, but it is not a magic cure-all for our problems, nor is it a Magic 8-Ball which we shake and expect a message to appear. The Bible is not about us, it's about God reconciling us to Himself, and Jesus' sacrificial death for our sins and His resurrection for our life.I simply cannot recommend this book, nor the way in which the author recommends that we approach the Bible. God's Word is simply to important a book to approach in such a shallow way."},{"Title":"Dance With the Devil: The Rolling Stones and Their Times","review":"Stanley Booth not only wrote the best book ever written about the Stones, but the best book ever written about Rock and Roll period. If &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; was a book, it would be this. The book is a rich tapestry of layers and textures. A must read. Please pay special attention to the chapter that takes place in Sam Sheffler's basement on Hudson Ave. It is filty yet fun."},{"Title":"Dance With the Devil: The Rolling Stones and Their Times","review":"This book was suggested to me by a friend who knew that Gram Parsons was a musical influence of mine. I had a hard time getting into at first and almost put down.Then the universes collided, and while I was meandering somewhere between 1965 and 1967 among the foggy world of the Stones' wine, women and song, Martin Scorsese's concert movie/documentary on the Stones, Shine A Light, was released. Having a small glimpse into the mixed up, confused world of the Stones through Stanley Booth's book, I caught a matinee of the movie, and it was exactly as Stanley had depicted. I realized that I was being told the bare naked truth by this eloquent, poetic southern writer.With 50 pages left, I suddenly felt that time was no longer on my side, so I dug my heels in and savored every last second like one of the drugs so expertly described by the author. By the end of the book I felt like I had gotten to know something about those times, that band, and about Gram Parsons. I came to see Keith Richards as a very well defended spiritual person with a big soul and conscience. I had neither known nor cared much about him beforehand.Most of all, I felt like Stanley was my good friend who shared secrets with me that he would tell no other person. I hated for him to go. There is a picture at the back of the book of the two buddies -- Keith R. and Stanley B., looking handsome, robust, young and full of fire. They were filled with fire, all right. The killing kind. And by nothing short of a miracle they both made it out the other end.A publisher would do well to re-release this book, which is more of a historic ode by now, worth revisiting and treasuring again and again. It's more relevant today than ever, and a perfect aperitif to Shine A Light."},{"Title":"Dance With the Devil: The Rolling Stones and Their Times","review":"I loved this book very much. When I first got a hold of this book,I wanted to read about the rolling stone's founder,Brian Jones. So I was pleased to read so much about him. I found the early days of the rolling stones to be much more interesting than I imagined. It described in detail how mick,keith,and brian lived together in a small,horrible apartment,owned by Mick,and how they hardly had any money for food. I enjoyed how the author started the book out by describing his experience interviewing Brian Jones's parents,years after his death. The author was very good at detail,in this book. He always described the concerts of the stones with the girls screaming,and the last days of Brian Jones,and all of the band member's different love interests,and some certain instances with groupies. I like reading non-fiction books that have some detail in the writing,not just generalization. Lastly,the weakness in this book is including all of the members of the rolling stones. He included alot of brian,and mick,but not enough of the other band members. Overall,I would say that this book is definitly worth reading and I would recomend it to any stones fan. I know a book is good when as I'm reading it,I can get a mental picture of what is happening,and that's what I did."},{"Title":"The Whisperer (Nightmare Hall)","review":"This book was alright but it has NOTHING on R.L Stine's \\" The Cheater\\" it seems that's was Diane Hoh was trying to copy off of.

Este ha sido el caso con esta novela, que me ha gustado much&iacute;simo. Una de las cosas que m&aacute;s me ha asombrado es que si hago bien la cuenta, Carmen Mart&iacute;n Gaite ten&iacute;a apenas 22 a&ntilde;itos cuando escribi&oacute; este libro. Yo a su edad me chupaba el dedo y estaba en Babia. La capacidad de observaci&oacute;n que la autora demuestra es asombrosa.No s&eacute; si la trama le sonar&aacute; a chino a algunos lectores, bien porque no sean espa&ntilde;oles o porque hayan nacido en una Espa&ntilde;a diferente. Hay algunas escenas que est&aacute;n tan cargadas de verdad que dan miedo. Un ejemplo es cuando &Aacute;ngel presenta a Gertru en la fiesta, y la lleva cogida del cogote (&iquest;y por qu&eacute; ya de paso no le pone una brida?). Otra escena de &Aacute;ngel y Gertru es cuando ella le dice que quiere terminar el bachillerato, y &eacute;l le contesta que para casarse con &eacute;l no le hace falta ni geometr&iacute;a ni leches. El macho espa&ntilde;ol, en todo su apogeo.M&aacute;s escenas de miedo: la mojigater&iacute;a de T&iacute;a Concha, oponi&eacute;ndose a que sus sobrinas vayan a una fiesta \\"como cabras locas\\". El di&aacute;logo es de perlas. Quiz&aacute;s mucha gente se sorprenda de que unas mujeres ya casi treinta&ntilde;eras se tengan que someter a tales humillaciones, pero desgraciadamente Carmen Mart&iacute;n Gaite estaba escribiendo la realidad, pura y simple. Esta novela te ayuda a entender las realidades del momento y sus repercusiones en los a&ntilde;os siguientes. Las Gertrus y Julias espa&ntilde;olas no consintieron privar a sus hijas de una educaci&oacute;n, para que no tuvieran que aguantarle estupideces a nadie, para no tener que pasar de la dictadura de los padres a la dictadura del marido, para ser libres de hacer lo que les diera la gana. En la distancia suena raro, pero es la realidad espa&ntilde;ola de la posguerra.Quiz&aacute;s una de las cosas que me decepcion&oacute; un poco es que hay algunos personajes a los que no se les saca demasiado provecho, como Goyita y Manolo Torre. Es extra&ntilde;o, ya que Goyita aparece en una de las primeras escenas, y me dio la sensaci&oacute;n de que iba a ser un personaje m&aacute;s principal, pero al final nada. Natalia es la que abre el libro, y aunque pasa a segundo t&eacute;rmino por buena parte de la narraci&oacute;n, al final aparece de manera bastante rotunda. Cuando CMG escribi&oacute; esta novela, probablemente no tuvo un editor mir&aacute;ndole cada coma y cada punto. De todas maneras, me sigue maravillando la percepci&oacute;n tan profunda y la soltura de los di&aacute;logos en esta novela, brillant&iacute;sima."},{"Title":"Ki and Reiki","review":"I was disappointed. While the author is clearly well-intentioned, there simply isn't enough new information here to justify buying this book. Anyone with an hour or two to kill can get all the information presented in this book for free on the web.If there had been something more useful on joining the disciplines of Reiki and Aikido(+Ki training, kiatsu), this could have been a very exciting and useful intermediate to advanced book for people on either path, even if it's a short one. Unfortunately, it's exactly what it says it is, a very basic book for beginners. So basic it's really not worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Ki and Reiki","review":"There are *lots* of Reiki books on the market these days. Many of them are expensive--a hefty investment for someone just interested in learning some fundamental basics of the &quot;Ki &amp; Reiki&quot; subject.

Up came this book, among others, and I remember almost throwing it across the room over ten years ago when I read it. You have a guy who escaped, knew a few people involved, and whose only personal involvement is from the outside. He had no balls, and never dared risk himself. Sure, he knows the figureheads, the history, and can write about what happened as if was there. But he was hiding in his room, making himself out to be a hero. If you want to read a book with the only suspense being whether to finish it or not, then this is the one."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"I found this book very informative about the events leading up to the Tiananmen Square occupation by the students and workers in June of 1989. Since traveling for one month in China this past year, I have been reading alot of personal accounts on China by people who have escaped or left the country. This was a nice change; a book speaking of the efforts by the citizens to change the way things are there and by peaceful means. This book really makes one appreciate the freedoms and democracy that we take for granted in this country."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"Very easy to read account of growing up in China in the late 20th Century, and the background of student revolutionaries of Tienamen Square. The author does not exhibit his part in a boastful way, but we get to experience the Student Movements from the epicenter. He makes these historic times seem everyday......but it is an interesting and insightful read."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"This is a personal story of one leaders life that was easy reading and that I enjoyed.This is not a history or an analysis of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests and subsequent massacre. It is a rather standard autobiography told in strict chronological order. The first part deals with life growing up in China in the 1970s and 1980s, including the struggles that his college-educated parents went through as seen by a young boy. The second part is Shen Tong's life at university, especially his first steps into political activism, his steps out of activism, and then his full involvement in the Tiananmen Square protests, ending with his eyewitness accounts of the massacre and an epilogue about the few days leading to his escape from China. There is nothing about his experience in exile.I enjoyed both parts. The first was a glimpse of one's person's boyhood in Beijing after the Cultural Revolution but before the recent economic expansion. What did a boy think about the embalmed body of Mao lying on display? How did he date? How did he study for college entrance exams? For this very casual China watcher, I gleamed new insights. The second part about how he became a student activist in college and his experience and frustrations led to me thinking about my own involving in activism. Having watched the protests and massacre unfold on my TV in Minnesota, I learned more about how it looked from someone on the ground with access to the different meetings and venues. What went through his head? If I was there, would my reactions be the same?Neither part was very different from other autobiographies that I have read. It was about average for the genre. There never is and there was not here much detailed analysis of his actions or the events in question. Shen Tong is just relating his experiences as he remembers them. He has left it for others to write the histories and analyses. I would have given it 3-stars but world-significant topic -- the Tiananmen Square Protests and massacre -- earns it another star.If you want a history or an analysis of the Tiananmen Square Protests and subsequent massacre, read another book. If you want a personal story told in chronological of someone who grew up in China and was very active in the protests and an eyewitness to the massacre, then this is a good, easy read.Here's a brief review in an academic journal that has a similar view to mine; [...]"},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"I read this book because I was very interested in the topic and event surrounding Tiananmen. I wanted to get an inside view, and in many ways did from the author. But this was more of a memoir with the democracy build up as a background. The author even talks about his first kiss in his hometown. And when he goes to university the protests are all around him, and he has friends who are putting themselves on the line, and he cares, but basically he is a distant observer. All in all, a thorough disappointment."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"So said one of the student leaders, as quoted by Shen Tong (himself a leader) in \\"Almost a Revolution.\\" This is a very fluidly written, personal account of the events leading up to the killings of workers & students by Chinese soldiers in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on June 5 1989. Fortunately, with more recent events in Ukraine, \\"Soviet\\" Georgia, Tajikistan, even Lebanon (not forgetting Eastern Europe), we have seen how revolutions gain strength, often like tropical storms that develope into hurricanes with surprising rapidity. Meteorologically, we can explain such happening on the weather front ONCE THEY OCCUR, but we're rarely capable of predicting such developments until they are almost in our faces, so to speak. The event that sparked events in China was the death of Hu Yaobang on April 15th. \\"Hu Yaobang had become something of a hero since he had been made the scapegoat of the 1986 student movement and ousted as general secretary, and many of us,\\" says the author, \\"had hoped that he would be brought back someday to lead China on the road to reform.\\" Acknowledgment of his passing by many, however, soon began to be read by the government as a renewed call for reform. Thus began the chain of events that resulted in students' boycotting classes, printing flyers, and finally, camping out in Tiananmen Square. In the author's view, \\"there was clearly an internal struggle going on between Li Peng [a hardliner] and Zhao Ziyang [a Chinese leader who had declared on May 7th his openness to a dialogue with the students].\\" Evidence of such was the fact that \\"starting May 17, the press in China operated without censorship from the goverment for a few days.\\" Mikhail Gorbachev had arrived for a visit 2 days earlier and the Chinese government was seemingly caught off-guard in the headlights of the world's media for a moment while it contemplated how to respond a mass protest in Beijing's central square. The one fault of this book (besides no index) is that the author has nothing to say about this visit by Gorbachev. He mentions the Soviet leader's arrival and departure, but literally nothing otherwise; no impressions or anything how such a visit affected events on the ground in Beijing, or within the corridors of the Chinese government. This was before the collapse of Eastern Europe, mind you, but I find it hard to believe that the issue of Gorbachev (glasnost/reform) wasn't a topic of discussion amongst at least some of the student leaders arrayed around Shen Tong. Back to events: Martial Law was declared on May 20. On May 21 word began to filter out that Zhao Ziyang had been removed as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (though it wasn't announced until May 26th). The crackdown came soon after, but the author wasn't as much a witness & participant to this aspect as he was in all the events leading up to it. He doesn't, consequently, write much about the tanks entering Beijing (or the famous photograph of the solitary man courageously standing his ground before one particular one), or what exactly happened that day---he doesn't even guess at how many Chinese were killed. But, this is nevertheless a remarkable story (that reads quickly & gives much interesting detail of the author's childhood, particularly as it relates to his coming to question things & the role his intellectual father had on his development). Cheers!"},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"There are two wonderful things about this book: first, Shen Tong's charming account of life growing up in Beijing in an exceptional Chinese family; and then the deeply moving story of the growth of the student movement and its tragic surpression. The courage of the students, and later people from all walks of life, in their struggle for a more open society is very impressive. This book should not be out of print."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"Too many Westerners, mostly Americans, are overly eager to transform China but have little or no understanding of that huge and complex nation and so many of the young and very impatient Chinese youths would want a Western styled democracy in China but with little idea what it takes to have democracy in a huge country never had such political system before. Deng Xiao-pin was very eager to bring in political reforms but the Tian-An-Men Square event set back this reform by at least one or two generations. The author does not seem to understand that and he is now a young man in his 40s living in the U.S. and I wonder if he realized this historical \\"mistake.\\" The new economic social class created since the Tian-An-Men Square riot are not very concerned with the great majority of rural Chinese left behind and any political reform seems to be the last thing in their mind. The Chinese government has one of the toughest challenges in the world history to provide an improved lives to the peasants still in the seven to eight hundred million people in the far left behind in living standard."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"This book presents a good inside look at the 1989 democracy movement from the viewpoint of a key student leader. The reader learns about some aspects of the movement that have not been widely publicized, including the trials and tribulations of one of the principal organizers of the movement.Also, a good documentary film about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests is Carma Hinton's \\"The Gate of Heavenly Peace.\\" A condensed version of this film was broadcast on PBS Frontline in 1996."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"Almost a ReviewI watched the events of Tiananmen Square unfold on TV as they were happening in 1989. I even video taped them believing I might even be watching a revolution. CNN's great line was \\"We came to cover a summit, but are covering a revolution.\\" This allowed me to review the coverage as events were happening. It soon became apparent reported rumors had a tendency to become accepted facts in subsequent commentary even when they had been found to be baseless. Massive media hype.I was living in Seattle in November of 1990 when I heard on the radio that Shen Tong was in town and would be at Elliot Bay books to give a talk and sign copies of Almost a Revolution. I rushed over. He made a few remarks, as I remember, and then took questions. Most questions asked things like when he thought the Communist Party would collapse, what position he would take in the leadership in the future, etc. Very fanciful.I asked him if he thought there had almost been a revolution and, if not, why was his book named Almost a Revolution. He said quite clearly and calmly there had not almost been a revolution and he was told to make that the title.I have a signed copy of the book from that day, November 21, 1990. The credulous questioning about \\"when he would become emperor\\" so to speak resumed. I felt very sorry for him then and do so now. I think he was and hope he still is a good person. He was not a victim of an evil PRC government. Rather he, like most of the other students, were ultimately victims of the Western Media and political operatives behind the scenes who commandeered the events and with them the lives of some very good kids and used them for their own ends.I do not remember whether I ever read the book (hence my lead line Almost a Review ). I am sure I skimmed it. I hope my comments give some useful perspective for those who do read it. I may someday too. .I am sure it has some useful information in it."},{"Title":"Almost a Revolution","review":"Too many history books deal in dry facts.

I found it fascinating!"},{"Title":"Searching for Oliver K. Woodman","review":"Most of our eight- and nine-year-olds found this sequel to The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman a disappointment. Although they enjoyed the tale being told (again) through letters, postcards and newspaper articles, they thought this storyline was confusing with too many new characters to follow. They did love the oil-over-acrylic illustrations, and advise the second and third grade audience to pay close attention to the details to better understand the fast-paced plot. For the best travel-tracking, they recommend the reader become familiar with the cities and states mentioned, and refer often to the maps on the book's end pages. As an introduction to the recurring places and people, our young reviewers suggest starting with The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman. In fact, the reappearance of one particular character renewed their interest in this story and had our third graders hoping he'll be featured in another, more clever Woodman travelogue."},{"Title":"Searching for Oliver K. Woodman","review":"When young Tameka Schwartz, loses her friend Oliver K. Woodman, she and her uncle enlist the aid of reporter Paige Hall to find him. The reporter and Tameka's uncle, Raymond Johnson, send a wooden private investigator (Ms. Imogene Poplar, who is actually made of wood) to find the \\"local traveler of some renown,\\" as Paige Hall calls him in her newspaper piece about the missing Woodman. Hall and Johnson place a letter in Poplar's bag asking that anyone who reads it write back to Hall, so that she can keep up with the investigation. Various people pick up and transport Poplar to various locations, and the style and content of their letters to Paige Hall reflect their various personalities, jobs, and locations, along with reporting either seeing Woodman or hearing of him.This Griffin and Sabine-like gimmick works for awhile, but the appeal of various strangers spread about the country successively working to find Woodman (think \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\") is soon lost in a confusing story that neither establishes a convincing point of view nor conveys much humor or excitement. Paige Hill and Mr. Johnson, for example, laugh together when they write the letter for Poplar, as if they are planning a big joke on Tameka: Sending a wooden figure out on the road just to see (like a message in a helium-filled balloon) what responses they might get. Much of the problem lies in whether we are to take Oliver Woodman and Imogene Poplar as fantasy figures who actually do things and make friends, or as what they appear--carved wooden figures. The people who encounter Poplar seem to write about her as if she were real, projecting their own interests and needs onto her (e.g., the rodeo clown says she'd make a great rodeo clown, the jazz band director--in a phony bop \\"jazz\\" voice--writes that Ms. Imogene has a jazz ear), but the reader is left looking at one very wooden figure and wondering whether Tomeka really misses the missing Oliver K. Woodman. The relationship between Tameka and Woodman is just one of the missing elements here, and we never know what, if anything, Tameka is thinking while he's gone. There's an irrelevant and predictable subplot about Mr. Johnson and Paige Hall becoming a couple and marrying: These are the same two uninteresting people shown laughing and smiling as they set Poplar out on her quest for Tameka's lost \\"friend.\\" The nicely done pictures are designed primarily for younger children, but the profusion of characters and narrative twists makes this generally inappropriate for them. A confused and confusing story, \\"Searching for...\\" can't even muster much excitement when the two wooden figures finally meet."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Cowboy Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 20)","review":"In world where children seem to grow up way too soon, I'm thrilled that our 5 yr old grandson still enjoys bedtime stories from the Happy Hollisters.

You will find a family of children and friends who sincerely care for one another as well as adult characters. They are polite and courteous to all. When they do make mistakes they learn from them rather than make excuses for them. There is a bully or two in the story lines, but they do not win out and the other children do not adopt those behaviors. They help others, even the bully. The late author's family trust is in the process of reissuing the titles which is an arduous undertaking (retyping the original texts and proofing them as well as using original art).

The tone is the greatest strength of the book. The world it creates is one which most readers will not have intense experience, but the author gives the readers the tools to enter that world, and shut the door behind them. The characterization grew a bit tiresome, as verbose descriptions of the supporting cast were repeated ad nauseum.

When I learned that there were other books about them I immediately checked them out from the library. The first one I read was this one. I was VERY disappointed. It lacked a central message or point and seemed quite disorganized. I put it down one day, almost done with the thing and never picked it back up except to return it to the library.\\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" was so smooth and perfect. I guess it was because L'Engle had become a much better writer by the time she wrote that one..."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Young Vicky Austin narrates as she and her clan try to apply their ultra-functional family dynamics to help Maggy, a girl who was spoiled rotten until her parents died in a plane crash.At first, Maggy runs right over the polite and restrained Austin family, but eventually goodness and civility seep into her, as administered by the kind and wise parents. A double crisis arises in the book's climax; while the Austin parents are at a meeting where Maggy's fate will be decided, Rob, the youngest Austin, turns up missing.There are many good elements in this book, yet I wouldn't recommend it over scores of better books. The book is, first and foremost, an idealized portrait of a strong family unit living a life in the country. Money is never an issue, as the father is a doctor, and the family's energies are devoted to becoming paragons of virtue.There are some awfully sweet moments in the book, and brash Maggy is a character who will earn both our disapproval and our sympathy. Vicky, the narrator, has feelings that are very realistic, as she struggles with problems that may seem very familiar to an adolescent reader.We get a sense of how wonderful a community a family can be, if it is isolated from the intrusion of the outside world. Family songs, group readings, piano session and other wholesome pasttimes keep the Austins together and, for the most part, happy.On balance, however, the book's strong suits are overwhelmed by contrivances and preachiness. The plot meanders; while Maggy's situation and fate are always up in the air, there is never a real sense that she will be taken from the Austins. Meanwhile, many of the episodes, such as when a reading of Charlotte's Web persuades Suzy to give up ham, simply aren't very interesting. Also, the characterization of the children is seriously flawed. While they have realistic emotions, they are supernaturally able to articulate those emotions. Their powers of self-analysis, and their ability to overcome pettiness, just doesn't ring true.Another problem that I had with the book was the stealthy insertion of religious views. Early in the book, we are treated to Rob's comically cute bedtime prayers, which is fine. But the last few chapters introduce a brilliant religious grandfather who prompts a dinner discussion about how Einstein believed in God (among other religious topics). I think it's fine to portray a religious family practicing their religion, but when the text is hijacked by a very clumsy presentation of a belief system, it becomes a problem for me.This is also evident in the resolution to Suzy's refusal to eat ham. John, the eldest son, presents a \\"scientific\\" argument to Suzy about why vegetarianism is wrong, and that's pretty much the end of it. The biggest points in his argument are that not eating meat is unhealthy, and that eating a pig is, ethically, no different than killing and eating a carrot. I won't go into it here, but these points are very off-base. That they are presented as fact, with no counter-argument, represents a bad job.Believe it or not, I am a huge L'Engle fan, and I highly recommend her \\"Wrinkle in Time\\" series, including the religiously inclined \\"Many Waters.\\" This book, however, should be pretty far down on your list. If you would like a portrait of a wholesome, God-fearing family that is less objectionable, I would recommend the Little House on the Prairie series."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"I liked this story very much. It is about a quirky, nice, good family and is well worth rereading.I have only three big complaints about it. Two of them are completely subjective opinions about the Austin family. The other is a complaint about the narrator's writing style. These complaints follow:1. I think the parents in this family are too strict with their children. To me, there's always a creepy feeling of \\"do what we say or else we'll hurt you.\\"2. They are too religious to be held up as a perfect example family for my own personal tastes.3. The narrator overuses the word AND. It's cute at first, but by the end of the story, my head was throbbing. I wished I could dismiss the word \\"and\\" forever, as wonderful a conjunction as it inarguably is. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and. Shudder.Overall, though, this is a great book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Very bad print and this book is a very boring, not well written book"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"When Meet the Austins was first published in 1960, standards and sensibilities in childrens/young adult publishing were very different from what they are now. Madeleine L'Engle had a great deal of trouble selling this book because it began with a death, which was considered too upsetting for children to handle.Even when Vanguard Press agreed to publish it, the novel was not published intact. An entire chapter, entitled The Anti-Muffins, was omitted. The chapter was about a small club of children who believe that people should not be too much like muffins, i.e., looking and behaving the same, and judged by superficial criteria (if it comes from the oven, it must be a muffin). It's hard to say after all these years whether the anti-conformist message was considered dangerous, or whether someone was upset by the middle class WASP kids being good friends with a poor Hispanic farm boy.In 1980, The Pilgrim Press published The Anti-Muffins as a separate book. It has long-since gone out of print, and is considered rare. That hasn't stopped L'Engle fans from looking for the book ever since, so that they can read this missing chapter in the lives of the Austin family.I'm glad to say this is no longer necessary. The current Farrar Straus Giroux edition of Meet the Austins, first published in 1997, restores The Anti-Muffins material back into the novel from which it was cut. (I'm pretty sure that even now, in 2002, the paperback edition still does not have this extra material.) If you're a fan of L'Engle's fiction, and especially of the books about Vicky Austin and her family, spend the extra money and get the hardcover. You won't regret it! ..."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Twelve-year-old Vicky Austin has a secure and happy home with her physician father, homemaker mother, older brother John, and younger siblings Suzy and Rob, in their big house outside a small American town. The Austins practice an unpretentious but fully committed brand of Christianity, and despite normal squabbling and adolescent angst their elder daughter knows she is surrounded by love and treasures it.Then Maggy Hamilton, ten years old and newly orphaned, lands in their midst and does her best to change everything. For a time this little girl who has never known a real home before does a good job of disrupting the Austins' lives. To Maggy, toys are for breaking (her rich grandfather will replace them on demand, so why not?) and so are rules. Yet like all children, Maggy desperately wants to be loved. Can the Austins love her in spite of her obnoxious behavior? Or will her presence tear their happy family apart?The answer to that question may be predictable, but the way it happens isn't predictable at all. Vicky as narrator has a sweet but decidedly not saccharine voice, and an outlook on life as a budding woman that when this story was first published (copyright 1960) was positively revolutionary. I particularly love the way L'Engle imbues this and many of her other books with a matter-of-fact yet profound spiritual dimension, by depicting Christians who live their faith as if that were the most natural thing in the world.I'm surprised I didn't find this book when I was at the age level for which it was written, since in 1960 I was 8 years old. However, all really fine children's literature can also be enjoyed by adult readers; and that's especially true of Madeleine L'Engle's work. I look forward now to reading the rest of the Austin series."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"I love all the Austin stories. I was first introduced to the family through (I think) Women's Day magazine when I was 10. It was the &quot;24 days till Christmas&quot; story. A few years later, I came across the &quot;Meet the Austins&quot; book and felt like I found an old friend. I have probably read this book over 10 times and can't help but pick it up when I need an old friend. Vicky's struggles as a 12 year old learning her place in the family and at an &quot;awkward&quot; age between teenager and child is wonderfully written. I plan on buying my niece, who is 11, each Austin book for Christmas over the next few years so that she can also grow up with Vicky."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I love all of Madeline L'Engle's works and this is one of her best. It is told through the eyes of Vicky who is a thirteen year old. Many changes occur with her normal and loving family. One of Vicky's mother's beloved friend's (a.k.a Aunt Elena)husband died along with his co-pilot. The co-pilot's daughter is an orphan and comes to live with the Austins temporarily. At first she is a spoiled little brat, but she ends up changing for the better. Just when she's become like a member of the family, her grand father is deciding her fate. Many think the family is too unreal because they are too trusting and are very old-fashioned, which they are, but they are still lovable. You should really put this book on your shelf now!"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"This is the best book by Madeleine L'Engle I ever read! I got it when I was eleven, I'm now thirteen, and sinse then I've probably read it ten or so times over. It's a grrrreaat family story, the characters are incredibly REAL, and the theme is just marvy. I wish I had the new version that has some new chapters that weren't in the book my grandmother gave me."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"\\"Meet the Austins\\" was a great read when I was a kid, and I appreciate it even more today because, despite the fact that decades have passed, the characters in the book are so human and true to life even today. This is a rare quality in family stories and met in my experience only by a few classics such as \\"Little Women\\". I also like the way L'Engle presents an obviously very intelligent and somewhat unusual family as normal folks who are not comically eccentric - there are no crazy inventor fathers building a flying machine in the back yard, or any of that. The family also has a strong sense of spirituality without being overtly preachy or religious, at least in my opinion. (Be warned, however, that the characters do discuss God and how he fits in with science in ways that non-believers may find a bit heavy-handed.)The main character, Vicky Austin, didn't grab me as much as Meg Murry from L'Engle's \\"Wrinkle\\" did at the time, simply because Vicky was way more ordinary. Vicky doesn't go jetting off to a far planet to save her father; instead her adventures are far more conventional, such as a nighttime bike ride that ends unfortunately in a bad accident. Vicky's activities and thoughts generally have to do with more traditional female concerns such as the feelings of her various family members, world peace, and so on, and it's her older brother John who is busy building a space suit in the backyard with the help of his uncle - a project I was quite jealous of myself at the time! Thankfully, all is not lost in terms of female liberation, since Vicky has a younger sister Suzy who is very independent and non-traditional, in that she is bound and determined to become a doctor when she grows up come hell or high water. Suzy's goal might not seem unusual today, but when this book was written, and even for a few decades afterwards, little girls didn't just grow up and become doctors. You get the feeling Suzy is not going to let anything stand in her way, though.This book is usually presented as being about the Austins taking in their orphaned cousin Maggy, who doesn't really fit in well and threatens to disturb the family unit. However, only a small portion of this book is about Maggy, and a lot of other things happen to the family. There are quite a few cliffhangers, dealing with everything from a broken radiator that floods the house to Vicky's bike accident to the family coming down with the measles. In between, this family has a lot of very intelligent discussions about God, the universe, science and, well, everything. I really wished I had parents or grandparents who would take the time to engage in the deep discussions that the Austins get into with their brood. Best of all, despite the occasional mentions of God and values, and the obvious high intelligence of the whole family, the kids are presented as human, not a bunch of plaster saints. They occasionally misbehave, bicker, have to be reprimanded, and feel like their life is grossly unfair, just like all kids did back then and still do today. Truly a timeless book."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"This book deals alot with feelings of the typical 12 year old, even if it is set further back in time. Something that would be great for a mom and a daughter to read and then discuss together, because... they can both relate to it!Plus, it leaves so much for you to talk about!"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"this book is awesome. it remains one of my favorites. despite the fact that it was written in the 60s, it is still completely relevant to teenagers and families today. in fact, it seems to promote the \\"simpler\\" life of love and family that we all still want, without being at all saccharine or pushy. i love how the narrator, vicky, describes her family's life and events in such a matter-of-fact way, as if she was just talking to someone about what was going on... you know how sometimes someone can say a few words or describe a scene and you know exactly the feeling they mean? thats what happens thru out this book. it gives a warm and fuzzy feeling and the only problem is that you have to remind yourself the characters arent real. but it has great ethics, fun and 3d characters, and the Austin family is wonderful. also something ir eally liked: the Austins' family clearly includes some of their close friends (for example, the character of Aunt Elena)... its not about a birth thing, and it never gets addressed but its just so natural that their extremely loving and tightknit family should include friends just as easily.i really, really recommend this book to anyone. its both an easy read and thoughtprovoking, and encouraging, anddddd just awesome!!!! :-)"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Here's the funny thing about Meet the Austins. When I read it in elementary school, I found the pace slow and so almost never discovered Madeleine L'Engle. I reread Meet the Austins only after I fell for Madeleine L'Engle's other books. Yet now upon rereading the Austin books, Meet the Austins is by far my favorite because of its rich thematic depth. The rest of the world almost never discovered Meet the Austins either, given that it was rejected by publishers for two years. Why? Because Madeleine L'Engle dared to write about the then-taboo subject of death. In first chapter, called \\"The Telephone Call,\\" the Austins receive a call from their close friend Elena that changes their lives. Her husband Hal had an accident with his plane. Both he and his co-pilot were killed instantly. The co-pilot had a little girl, who doesn't have a mother. Guess who ultimately takes her in? As such, Meet the Austins is partly about grief. If you think that makes for a depressing book, take comfort: It's more about understanding life itself. Vicky's brother John most aptly puts it this way: \\"I don't understand about anything. I don't understand about people dying, and I don't understand about families, about people being as close as we are, and then everyone growing up....\\" Meet the Austins is about even more, in that it's also about family. Maggy rarely saw either of her parents, but was regularly left with nurses and governesses. In contrast, the Austins are a close-knit nuclear family with loving parents who take their time to talk with their children about the confusing events unfolding around them, but at the same time make clear that certain actions such as playing in their father's office are wrong and therefore have consequences. Over the years, I've also grown to appreciate how subtly Madeleine L'Engle slipped in positive references to God; something that still remains unusual for a book not published in the religious market. There are so many other compliments I could bestow on Meet the Austins. Read it!"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Madeleine L'Engle is one of my favorite authors, and \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" has been one of my most loved books since I was a child, also in the 60's. I read \\"Meet the Austins\\" later, many times, and really liked the family, except for Suzy. Never could stand her, especially as the books went on. She supposedly had it all, brains, looks, personality, while Vicky felt plain and boring, yet she took every opportunity to shoot Vicky down.I hadn't thought much about their family dynamics other than they were pretty close to being a \\"perfect\\" family, which was nice to read about, especially if one didn't happen to have the same at home. One thing that really stood out for me though, was that the Austins were supposed to be the embodiment of a loving, secure family with good Christian values. Yet, when sad, unhappy Maggy comes to live with them, every one of the kids loathed her and wanted her out of their lives. It didn't seem like they ever really tried to put themselves in Maggy's place, even for a minute, and think what her life was like. The parents made only one halfhearted attempt to point out that Maggy had never known one moment of what they took for granted, never known love, security, or a real family. No one even gave a thought, as they were feeling so bad for Elena, that Maggy had lost both her parents within a month. Where did the \\"good Christian values\\" go as soon as they had one test of those values? I don't think being a good Christian just means loving the people that are easy to get along with and who love you. I wondered also why Elena wanted Maggy to live with her, after she had been several years at the Austins', and had only known Maggy and her father one month before his death.The other thing I never understood about the Austin series is that as soon as Maggy went to live with Elena,at the beginning of \\"The Moon By Night,\\" after living with the Austins for years, she was never mentioned again, except for the LA visit. A part of the family is suddenly not there anymore and it's \\"out of sight, out of mind?' It was the same with Emily in \\"the Young Unicorns.\\" That just seemed so odd to me."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Found an old copy of &#34;Meet the Austins&#34; in a box at my Mom's. Re-read it, and wondered why I didn't have the whole set. Since that copy was falling apart, ordered a new one, and bought the others.&#34;An Acceptable Time&#34; is an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"In the first book of the Austin Family series, Meet the Austins, Madeleine L'Engle beautifully wrote the book from the point of view of a twelve year old girl. The lessons in the book can be applied to the lives of everyone. People can relate to the events that occur such as someone dying and many other situations. L'Engle uses excellent language when describing a moment that the characters are going through. I would recommend this book to any age because there is at least one person or event that someone could identify them self with.Victoria Austin, better known as Vicky, is a girl who is twelve year old at the time and lives with her older brother John, younger sister Suzy, younger brother Rob, and her parents Victoria and Wallace. One night while her family is waiting for Wallace to come home from work, Vicky's aunt calls and says that her husband died in a plane crash. On the following day, the children find out that a girl named Margaret, known as Maggy, is coming to stay with the Austin family because her father also died in the plane crash leaving Maggy as an orphan. Maggy is a spoiled child who causes discord in the family and their routines. As time goes on Maggy becomes less selfish and becomes more fun to be around. Throughout the story Vicky narrates all that happens while Maggy is staying with the Austin family and how her and her family feels about all the changes. In the beginning the events are more towards negative but as Maggy lives with the Austins the events become more positive.There were lessons that were taught that can be applied to daily life. One of the lessons taught is not to question why something happens. When Maggy came, Vicky and John were questioning why she had to come and live with their family. In the end they were happy Maggy had come to live the Austins and they had gotten used to the change. They realized that if Maggy had not come to live with them, then she would be a spoiled little girl who was troubled and never learned what being part of a family really is. Another lesson learned is do not do something just to prove to someone that you are better or you are trying to prove you're worthy. Vicky tried to prove she could be helpful to her older brother John by doing something she knew she really could not do. There are other lessons that this book teaches but those two are the main ones that I can relate to in my life.The events that take place during the story can be related to. Most people have had at least one person special to them that has died. In this book Vicky's uncle died and the event had an effect on everyone in the family. Another event that most people can say has happened is when their sibling has gotten lost. In Meet the Austins Rob went missing and Vicky, John, and Suzy were worried. Everyone has thought that telling a lie is better than telling the truth. Suzy lied about the candy she stole and Maggy lied about leaving Rob and going to buy an ice cream. There other events people can relate to like when you have to go through a lot of pain or when your favorite toy gets broken and many others.L'Engle beautifully wrote this book. She excellently uses imagery. There are two parts where she uses imagery very well. One is when Vicky falls off her bike and she is describing how Vicky is feeling. Another time she uses a lot of imagery is when she is describing where Vicky's grandfather lives. When reading this book I felt that no unnecessary words were used and the story flowed easily like a gentle river. The words used are not complex level but not elementary level either. I was twelve and I felt that I would have described the events that took place in a similar way.Meet the Austins is a book about a family and what happens when a death occurs and the events that happen after. The author narrates this book from the point of view of Vicky, a twelve year old girl, and how she and her family feels about all the changes. Nearly all of the problems that happen can be real life situations. I give this book an A+. The lessons that the characters learn can be used in daily life, what happens to Vicky and her family can happen to anyone during their lifespan, and the excellent use of language makes this book something that will greatly touch your heart. When you are done reading this book you will want to read the other books in the Austin Family Quintet. (My favorite book in the Austin Quintet is A Ring of Endless Light. It is the 4th book in the series.)"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"I originally downloaded this for my daughter, on the recommendation of her teacher.

This book shows how people overcome their differences and begin to accept each other for their similarities.

She's both much younger as compared to the worldliness of today's tweens, and much older as compared to responsibility level. I loved the classic old-fashioned big-family fun tales of the whole Austin clan, which included such things as a fun trip to Grandpa's barn-house on the beach, a secret \\"Anti-Muffin club\\"- and my favorite -a whole-family scheme to scare off Uncle Douglas' girlfriend.First published in 1960, parts of it seem extremely dated such as this bit of a parental rant: \\"If they've gone out in all this rain, I'll beat them to a pulp and spread them on my toast like strawberry jam\\" (p. 52). Children of today might see that as some sort of weird child-abuse threat, but for me, growing up in the 70's with such threats as \\"I'm going to put you in a world of hurt,\\" I know it's all in good fun.Other parts also seem like something that kids today wouldn't understand, such as a girl whose mother travels all over Europe leaving her in the care of nannies and the nurturing yet firm mother and the authoritarian father that she comes to live with after her parents' death.This book was delightful -- comfort reading. I am halfway through the second one in the series, and I can't wait to read the whole series.But how would it go over with a well-read ten-year-old girl of today? Well, my daughter Amanda loved it. She told me she really liked it, and she even described it as \\"timeless.\\" So, go figure.No matter your age, if you are a L'Engle fan, I recommend this book. The back of the Square Fish paperback reprint has a chart listing all the characters of the Meet the Austins series and Wrinkle in Time series and how they intersect -- yes, some of the characters are in both series!"},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"Meet the Austins is a humerous, touching book that cannot be simply summed up with a plot line. Madeline L'engle has done a superb job of creating characters that are believeable and can be easily sympathised with. I have read this book countless times and it never gets old, I always enjoy it just as much each time I read it."},{"Title":"Meet The Austins","review":"At first when I started reading this book I thought it was a boring story about a seemingly perfect family and their less than extraordinary life. Then I remembered that not every book needs to be full of strife and conflict and sadness and action-packed despair. Some books can be about life, the SIMPLE parts of life that often get neglected in storytelling. Which is exactly what this book is.The story is about the Austin family, two parents who love each other, four siblings who love each other but don't always like each other, and the girl they take into their home after her father has died. Over time, the bratty spoiled house guest becomes a loved member of the family, and all the kids are changed for it.It's definitely a story about growing up. As the book goes on, Vic notices how her older brother John is changing; his voice is deeper, he's more rational, more responsible. While she tries to fight against them both getting older, she also starts to see how necessary it is.I think this is the kind of book I want to someday read to my kids. It's full of lessons about how to be uniquely you, to stand up for what you believe is right, to embrace your faults and your gifts, and mostly to love. ALL this without ever once being preachy. I've loved L'Engle since I readA Wrinkle In Time, but this series is so different and yet has that same simplistic element that makes me feel home."},{"Title":"Plowman's Folly","review":"'Way back in the day when there was still magic in Radio and Asbestos was GOOD for you, agriculturalist E.H. Faulkner examined standard American agricultural methods (which have changed little since then) with a critical eye. Surprisingly or not (as the case may be), Faulkner found these prevailing methods lacking in efficiency, productivity, long-term viability, and just plain old common sense.&quot;Hey look!&quot;, he said (in effect). &quot;Let's examine the NATURAL environment into which plant seeds have fallen and flourished ever since Life came to Earth! Who ripped up the soil with plows back then? If all this ripping up of the soil were really necessary, and was not done, why does plant life survive on Earth to this day? What or who fed the seeds before Humans started meddling with their life cycle? Tractors? Gasoline? Chemical fertilizers and pesticides? Where are the bees, and the earthworms? Then we EAT this abused, blighted, poisoned produce and expect healthy children? HAH! WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?&quot;Being a practicing farmer (and no mere theorist), Faulkner then set about devising a sound, sane, Earth-sustaining agricultural cycle and methods to suit. The results of his development work are recorded in his classic account, &quot;Plowmen's Folly&quot;.This reviewer, nearly thirty years ago, discovered a rare hardcover First Edition of Plowman's Folly in a health-food store in Fort Wayne, IN. Having access to some land at the time and desiring excellent veggies, but being impoverished and able to afford neither tractor nor chemicals, she set to implementing the Faulkner method. The results after three years of remarkebly light labor were not only spectacu;ar, but involved far less physical effort and expense than she was accustomed to exerting in the garden plot. SO:If you have ever, while sweating behind your roto-tiller or spreading toxic, expensive &quot;Agricultural Chemicals&quot; on your land, thought to yourself, &quot;There MUST be a better way than this!&quot;, I am pleased to confirm that you are correct. There IS a better way, (one that Monsanto and ADM Corp, among many others today, would rather you did NOT learn), and &quot;Plowman's Folly&quot; shows just how it is done. Buy it! Share it! USE it! Your Mother the Earth shall surely bless you abundantly for it!May 14, 2001 CE. (Your calendar may vary; we've been on Earth a long time now.)"},{"Title":"Plowman's Folly","review":"Today, plowing is still part of the regiment of conventional farming, but since The Plowman's Folly we have made strides toward minimum tillage or organic incorporation; examples of this are no-till gardening, mulching, and organic no till. For its day, this book and the idea of following nature was rare, and while reading this book I heard echoes of books like Salad Bar Beef and The Natural House, anything written much later that advocates working with nature rather than against it. The basic practice described in this book is to disk a cover crop like rye, incorporating it into the soil or as close to it as possible, planting seeds or transplants in rows, and covering them with some dirt.The organic matter holds water close to the surface, moderates temperature, reduces evaporation, and controls weeds. Although he didn't know it, Faulkner also explained carbon sequestration, now touted as a big benefit of no till. After reading this book, no-tillage--if you have an imagination--can be applied without purchasing multi-thousand dollar equimpent that weighs thousands of pounds so coulters can penetrate the soil.There are some downsides, however:No pictures--By the 1940s you'd expect a guy conducting experiments would think to take pictures. Originally it was printed during WW2, so they printed poorer quality. By the way, I bought an original copy on eBay for 89 cents a week ago.He planted mostly vegetables, so for somebody wanting to plant grains you need to innovate some.Short trial period--The field test was only for two seasons, and for such a short period of time Faulker seems awfully sure of himself, though he used research to back his claims.And finally, it's old. We have since made improvements and the reader can go online and find a ton of information on no tillage gardening etc."},{"Title":"Plowman's Folly","review":"This book lays out why plowing is horrible for the soil and completely unnecessary.

Her younger sister is dead from drowning in the baths where she worked and Annie suspects foul play. Ambrose Wells, the mystery man, agrees to help her.Next we find Concordia Glade, a teacher, and her four young women charges at Aldwick Castle where a second explosion has just taken place and the castle is on fire. They use the confusion to escape having to defend themselves from one villain as they make their way to the stable. Concordia and her charges who are orphans have come to the conclusion that the two men who run the castle are going to auction the young ladies off, possibly as high-priced courtesans!! As they go to leave the stables, the villain's companion appears and tries to stop them but a stranger comes out of the shadows and knocks him out with two quick chops. He states that Concordia is the \\"teacher\\" and they must all hurry to safety. This is, of course, Ambrose Wells. They get to an inn and Concordia and Ambrose send the girls to bed while they discuss what was going on at Aldwick Castle and why Ambrose was there.Ambrose becomes their protector as they had for London and Concordia becomes Ambrose's partner as they further investigate both their mysteries which have managed to combine!Lots of very fun secondary characters including the young women, plot turns, romance and comic relief!A very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I love historical romances but I get bored with the same old plots. Usually the main characters hate each other but are attracted to each other and they end up falling in love. Amanda Quick's novels are different, and this one is no exception. The lead characters do not hate each other at all, in fact they like each other very much. Ambrose, a 19th century private investigator is a hero to fall in love with. He's not overpowering or full of himself like most romance novels.I'd recommend this book to anyone that loves the romance from the Victorian Era but is looking for something different."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I adored this book. This is probably Amanda Quick's best historical in years. Her hero and heroine were wonderful and there was such a strong emotional component to this one.

I have glasses!\\" -- the heroine needs to *be* intelligent.Also the sex sucked, and was ever so sparse.Zero stars."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book, truth be told. Perhaps I am once again becoming a little weary of the typical romance storyline and expect more. Perhaps it was the seeming cheesiness of the entire \\"Vanza\\" society (doesn't that just sound phony?). Perhaps I just didn't quite buy into the characters, though I really did like Ambrose. But Concordia was just a little too \\"modern,\\" and the whole idea of the hippie commune at that time seemed a bit of a stretch. All that being said, as far as romance novels go, it wasn't that bad. There were a few lines that made me chuckle, and the story was interesting enough to keep me reading. I'd say it's worth your time if you enjoy romance novels, just don't go in expecting anything too deep and meaningful."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Quick had outdone herself with this novel.

Rather than an effort to be mysterious, she explains that \\"the three names are designed to let readers know which of my three different worlds they will be getting when they plunk down their hard-earned money for one of my books.\\"There surely is a lot of \\"plunking down\\" going on as her titles, whether by Amanda Quick (historical settings) or by Jayne Ann Krentz or Jayne Castle (paranormal focus), make cash registers ring. Lie By Moonlight, her latest in the history/romance field is typical Amanda Quick, which is precisely what readers' want - suspenseful, romantic, and rich in Victorian period detail.Consider the opening lines: \\"Midnight in a fog-shrouded graveyard. There could be no darker place on the face of the earth....\\" Who can resist reading on?Concordia Glade is a twenty-something teacher with unique notions about education. She accepts a position as headmistress to four young orphaned heiresses, and journeys to a lonely old castle, Aldwick, to take up her task.Her charges are charming, their welfare seen to by an unknown person of wealth. However, Concordia's enthusiasm begins to wane when she finds that her predecessor vanished without a trace and, even worse, she suspects that there is an evil plot to sell the girls as courtesans.Meanwhile, in far off London, Ambrose Wells, a 19th century private detective has agreed to investigate the death of a young woman. His research takes him to the grounds of Aldwick Castle, where to his astonishment he finds the building afire, dead bodies about, and a woman and four girls riding off on horseback.Will Ambrose champion the five? Of course, he will. Will he and Concordia be attracted to one another? This is a Regency romance. But, who is behind the vile plan to sell the girls and why?- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I enjoyed this book for the following reasons. First, both of characters are likeable. I really dislike heros that fit into the catergory of, \\"I'm a man, your a woman, therefore I'm better than you.\\" Ambrose Wells doesn't fall into that type of hero. Second, although, both characters have baggage stemming from their upbringings, neither are so stubborn and foolish that it gets in the way of their story. Both of these points are very important to me when considering a good book.I would also like to point out that this book makes mention of a Cabinet of Curosities. These cabinet is also mentioned in the Jayne Castle book \\"After Dark\\". The character John Stoner, I believe was in another Amanda Quick book, but I can't seem to remember what book that was. I thought that this would be interesting to point out to those who might not of noticed it.The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't able to really feel for the characters. In other words, I wasn't able to see them falling in love. The story focused more of the plot of the 4 girls and their situation than the love story. I thought that was rather disappointing. However,I think this is a good book and I don't regret spending the $25 dollars for it."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Concordia Glade ia a freethinking, independent teacher. She has had to hide her true idenity since the death of her parents ten years ago. Her parents were very free thinkers and had been married to other people. Therefore being illigetimate, she had wisely changed her name. Now she finds herself teacher, friend, and protector to four young ladies in her care. While teaching them at a secluded castle she discovers they are to be auctioned off to the highest bidder by a notorious criminal. Immediately she comes up with a plan to escape from the castle with her charges.Ambrose wells may very well be the last practicioner of Vanza in England. The mystic discipline has fallen out of favor over the years. He spends the wit and energy gained from his dedication to this lifestyle by solving mysteries and answering puzzling questions. In the course of an inquiry he meets Concordia as she and her charges escape from their captivity.There are so many unanswered questions about the situation and both Ambrose and Concordia are very courious people. The more they learn the more questions. Wherever the search leads, deaths follow.The attraction between the two of them is hot and quick, suddenly Concordia can believe in love at first sight. But marriage because of obligation is not in her vocabulary.Ambrose's mentor John Stoner returns late in the book and has his own thoughts on the relationship between Concordia and Ambrose. He is a delightful character and I quickly checked to be sure he was the Vanza student who was saved and sent to the island to study by Edison Stokes in I THEE WED.This is typical Amanda Quick and it is wonderful. I loved it. I read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I will not rehash what was stated by the previous reviewers. Suffice it to say, I agree that \\"Lie by Midnight\\" is one Ms. Quick's best books in years. I envy and appreciate her ability to come up with interesting story lines and fascinating characters book after book. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I haven't read Amanda Quick since I finished Lavinia & Tobias' 2 stories. This one seemed to follow the same formula. Two non-societal leads get thrown together under criminal circumstances and the female insists they partner up to solve the mystery. Except in this case, Cooncordia Glade is a teacher with modern & unconventional sentiments. Ambrose Wells is the same person of inquiry, but with a better sense of humor. The mystery wasn't very tight, I found the motive not matched to the crime.There is so much explaining dialogue in this novel, and a lot of the time I felt like they were just recapping events so that the reader, all who apparently have short attention spans, could remember what was going on.In my humble opinion, I think Ms. Quick lost her way writing this book, and went with telling a story about dull mystery rather than focusing on the funny and complex Ambrose, Concordia's love and dedication to help foundlings that society would rather board up and ignore, or the endearingly interfering four students, Edwina, Theodora, Phoebe and Hannah. Speaking of whom, how many times those four names were stated together in this novel, I haven't a clue. But it's probably upwards of 500. Almost each time the 4 of them are mentioned, it's not as \\"the girls\\" or \\"the four students\\" or \\"Ms. Glade's girls\\" or \\"Concordia's pupils\\" or any other number of ways of referring to them, it's \\"Edwina, Theodora, Phoebe and Hannah.\\" But that is besides the point.I much would have rather read about Concordia being headmistress of a girls school and seeing how she inspires and gives hope to the forgotten children. This book instead was just a romance with a backdrop of a not very intelligent mystery.Amazon won't like me saying this but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK. If you like Amanda Quick, just check it out from the library. This is one of her less than great novels. Normally she's superb."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Concordia Glade has to set fire to the castle where her four schoolgirl charges are at risk in order to rescue them. However, their escape nearly goes wrong, until Ambrose Wells, reformed thief, appears on the scene for his own reasons.Thus starts a series of events which include murders, disguises, romance and complex plots. The usual Amanda Quick hallmarks are there - fierce rather than handsome hero, strong women giving up their virginity at the drop of a hat, journeys in carriages in the fog. This book is set in the Victorian rather than Regency period, although this makes little difference to the overall feel of the book. We meet the Vanzagarian society again, with John Stoner (a young man in \\"I Thee Wed\\") as an old Vanza master.This book was definitely a return to form after the rather disappointing Tobias March and Lavinia Lake series. No surprises in this book, it's standard fare, but well-written and gripping and fun too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This book works on many levels, which is a tribute to the meticulousness of the author. It is a romance, a mystery, a wonderfully atmospheric period piece, and a character study. The author has a theme which she carries through to the end with a twist (and you probably won't see it coming).I also enjoyed that she went down several layers of English society for her Victorian protagonists, giving her a great deal more flexibility with plot. Concordia and Ambrose are no hothouse plants, nutured in the English aristocracy and hidebound by tradition, but orphans who have learned how to survive by their wits. Yet they each have a core of goodness and decency, and the real question is whether they can overcome their sad childhoods and embrace the feelings they develop for each other.Well done and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"In the latter part of Queen Victoria's reign, Miss Concordia Glade accepts a position at Aldwick Castle as headmistress to four teenaged orphan girls. She gradually becomes aware that her employers are up to no good especially when she overhears them talk about auctioning off the girls. The place is well guarded making it almost impossible to get away but Concordia and her wards build and set off explosives that cause a diversion so that they can get to the stables.Once there they are caught by one of the guards but inquiry agent Ambrose Wells appears in the stables and helps them flee to his townhouse in London. He was hired to find out who killed Nellie Taylor. His investigation leads him to crime lord Alexander Larkin who is behind the auction that will soon take place. Ambrose intends to keep Concordia and her teenagers safe while he also seeks evidence that he can take to the police. Concordia, who believes she is the equal of any man, helps him until one of the perpetrators concludes she knows too much and must be gotten out of the way.Amanda Quick can always be counted on for quirky characters that don't fit into society and as a result are freer than most of their peers, but also find ways to get in trouble. While working together the two protagonists realize they are attracted to one another while the teen quartet play matchmaker nudging them along until one of them proposes marriage. LIE BY MOONLIGHT is one of MS. Quick's most charming and entertaining historical romantic investigative novels that she has ever written.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Amanda Quick seems to get better with each new book. She also seems to be one of the few romance writers who can come up with a heroine -- Concordia Glade, in this story -- who is more than just the usual Lady Doormat. Concordia has a backbone without being a b**ch, is sensitive without being simpering and intelligent without over-apologizing for it. She's a woman with modern ideals trapped in a time where that and her unusual upbringing are scandalous to proper society. She has to hide who and what she is just to survive and to do what she loves, to teach.Ambrose Wells could easily have been the Lord Neanderthal of so many other bad romance novels, tall, dark, overbearing and condescending. But Ms. Quick doesn't allow him to degenerate into that clich&eacute;. Of course he has a mysterious past and he's incredibly handsome, but he respects Concordia instead of trying to dominate her. He works *with* Concordia, not around her in order to protect her young pupils and to solve the multiple murder mystery. Like any man of the time he would certainly prefer it if she didn't put herself in so much danger and allowed herself to be protected more, but once he realizes she's not the type of woman to cry for help and hide behind a man, he learns to accept that and her, and to love her for who she is instead of despite it.The mystery itself is a good one. Why were the girls taken from orphanages and tutored like Ladies? The answer isn't as easy as it first seems, although Concordia's conclusions were logical given the information she had. I certainly didn't see the bigger picture until she and Ambrose were able to dig further into things. The story moves along at a fast pace and there are some genuine surprises along the way, twists in the plot I never saw coming.I'd actually recommend this book to people as good fiction, and since I usually mock romances for fun, that's saying a great deal."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Quick is back in the late Victorian era with an irrepressible teacher, Concordia Glade. She meets Ambrose Wells, one of the last members of Vanza, while trying to save her four young pupils. Together the two follow clues to the villians planning to use the young girls for nefarious deeds. A minor character from Quick's Vanza novel, I Thee Wed,is reintroduced as an older gentleman linking the earlier period novels to this one. The mystery is interesting, there is the humor, and the story is fast paced. As always you will not be disappointed in this story. It makes a fun beach read."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I listened to the audio book, and the reader was not very good. I'm not sure if I didn't enjoy the book because of the poor reader or the poor writing from the author, probably a combination of both. Either way I couldn't get through the whole book. It felt like a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I enjoy anything written by Amanda Quick/Jayne Castle /Jayne AnnKrentz - I love that the women are strong headed and outspoken.

I found myself interested in the story, liked the characters, but not wanting to go through all that reading for such a simple plot. Again, OK."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Another Amanda Quick winner. She writes so intelligently and descriptively. You could almost feel yourself in the graveyard! And I loved the end, and not just the love story-this story just made me feel good!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I was pleased with this Romance, mostly because the story was so interesting. This teacher, Concordia (What a name!), escapes a burnings castle (they set the castle on fire themselves by the way) with her students. Bad guys are on their tail and it's up to our heroine to save the lives of these young women.In comes tall, dark, and handsome. Ambrose kind of takes over, but not really because our heroine didn't have things under control. His showing up is more of just a happy accident. So, we don't necessarily have a \\"Man rushes in and saves the day\\" situation, because lady was already saving it... she just got some extra help.Anyway. There's a really well developed mystery going on about why the girls were pretty much being schooled and raised properly to be farmed as wealthy wives for underclass crooks. More than once I just wanted to punch one of the bad guys right in the nose.Concordia is very intelligent and very independent, but not so independent that she's frosty and unlikeable. She likes Ambrose from the get-go, so not a lot of pretending not to like each other, which aggravates me the majority of the time. She's also very loving, with a touch of sisterly/motherly to her that softens her up and makes her even more likeable as a character.Ambrose is, you know, your general awesome hero. He's got the jaded past, the unbelievable smarts, the wealth, and the smarts. But he's also funny, indulgent with the girls (like a brother or father), and not overly protective or \\"Me Man, You Woman\\".The \\"romantic\\" parts weren't over the top or so frequent as to be a hindrance to the storyline. As a matter of fact Ms. Quick made one of them turn out downright hilarious. I appreciate this.There's mystery, wit, and adventure in \\"Lie By Moonlight\\" along with a great story of a woman that's not afraid of herself, her feelings, or her dreams.Applause to all the Concordia's out there. May there be an Ambrose for each of you!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I believe Lie by Moonlight is my favorite Amanda Quick novel because it is the first of her books that I've read. Immediately, I was taken and very impressed by the writing style, the hero/heroine interaction, and the detailed setting.

As a writer myself, I'm very impressed and will continue to read the author's work under the various pseudonyms. Highly recommended for the novice writer who wishes to learn from a professional. By the author of Windrunner."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This is a historical romance about a teacher determined to protect her charges (four young ladies) against all comers. However, rather than being a gold digger, the hero here is the Victorian equivalent of a private investigator who just happens to practice mystical Eastern arts (and possesses a chest remarkably like a marble bust according to the cover). So the book is about two eccentric individuals colliding in the midst of madness, mayhem, and murder... which is standard cookie-cutter formula for Amanda Quick, who is on my chocolate-chip-cookie-comfort-books list. So I knew exactly what I was getting into and got exactly what I wanted, but I feel like I could have read any of her recent books because they've gotten so formulaic."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"It's not a terrific book, it's not a memorable book, and it's not an enthralling book. To understand the underlying Vanza you have to have read the other Vanza books. The plot is terrific and it could have been a great book but it does really fall short.I don't regret reading it and will probably read it again (it'll be like I never read it!) but I'd say to get this from the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This Quick novel, although I did like it enough to read it the whole way through, did not contain the same suspense as some of her better novels.

Much of the time I felt like, \\"Oh, I guess I'll read that now...\\""},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"It felt like an Agatha Christie mystery with a little romance thrown in. Ambrose used to be a thief but is now a private inquiry agent (private investigator). He sees Cordelia (a teacher) and her four female students running away from a fire and helps them. The girls had been kidnapped and the plan was to sell them. Some people are murdered in connection with the events. The story had no major flaws, but overall, I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped. I wasn't surprised or delighted. Once or twice the story felt a little plodding and slow, especially at the beginning. Cordelia and the girls were escaping from the castle and the girls kept expressing their fears. Cordelia kept saying we've practiced this before, just keep to the plan. I like strong and smart heroines as much as anyone, but Cordelia was unpleasantly strong and smart. She was almost too bossy, too perfect and overly confidant that she could handle herself in any dangerous situation. She was too demanding that Ambrose include her or do certain things. Overall, the story was ok, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: two brief scenes. Setting: Victorian England, sometime around 1890.

You first meet Concordia Glade and her young students as they are running away from the burning castle they've been staying in. This is also the moment that Ambrose Wells enters the story. He's investigating the castle and is a little put out that it's burning down but he offers to help Concordia and her four charges. The whys of their residence at the castle is interesting and the two main characters are quite well suited but their attitudes to sex are quite modern.I loved the way Ambrose received \\"payment\\" for his services. He came across as quite an interesting character with lots of depth. The four girls really didn't come across as deep characters, but there is an opening for them to have further adventures.For it's type it's quite good, and I did enjoy the story and enjoyed the ride, it's only after I finished reading that I started having some reservations about some aspects of the story.

Ooh, sends shivers down the spine just thinking about how quick, how intelligent, how agile, how inventive Ambrose Wells is, yum. Truth be told, his father was murdered when he was a young teen, and Ambrose turned to a life of crime to support himself - until he met his match whilst burglarizing a Vanza master! Now he's turned from the dark side and is one of the good guys. He's investigating a possible murder when he encounters determined schoolteacher Miss Concordia Glade, hastening four of her tender orphaned charges away from some suspicious goings-on at their \`school', a heavily guarded castle. Concordia suspects the girls are being groomed for something very nasty and illegal, and smuggles them out with Ambrose's assistance and a couple of well-placed bombs! Hooray for Chemistry! Things turn into a very murky stew with further murders a-plenty, and the grim possibility the young girls are being hunted down ruthlessly. Naturally, Ambrose and Concordia get on the job to protect and defend. Concordia is a delight - unconventional, passionate, and such a champion of \`her girls' your heart will be caught. Ambrose, on the other hand, is knocked for six by Concordia; something most unusual. He is, after all, a control freak - he is a Vanza master. Snort!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This is a typical Amanda Quick book, and if you're a fan, it's a decent read. I found that I enjoyed it while I was reading, but after finishing it (which was only yesterday), I've already forgotten half the characters and large chunks of the plot.The story lacked some of the zest, romance, and spice of her other books, and I never really felt the chemistry between the hero and the heroine. They (and their blossoming relationship) felt hollow to me compared to some of the other characters that she's created. I'm in the process of reading one of her other newer ones right now (\\"Wait Until Midnight\\"), and I'm already finding that the main characters and their romance in that one seem to be coming to life much more quickly for me than the characters in \\"Lie By Moonlight\\".The story was overall not bad... worth reading if you just want an enjoyable, easy read, but some parts of the story really do border on silly. If you've read some of her other books, she makes a return to the whole \\"Vanza\\" thing in this one, although I never did figure out what purpose it had to the overall plot, and thankfully it did not take up half the book. The villains in the story are very weak and you never really feel much threat from them. I was hoping for some kind of unexpected twist at the end to spice it up a bit, but it didn't happen. It was a predictable Scooby Doo ending... \\"I'd have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you kids!\\". You could see the \\"twist\\" coming a mile away.So overall... it made me grin a few times, made me chuckle, made me roll my eyes a bit, and although I liked it, I'm really glad I took it out of the library instead of paying money for it. If you like the period type Private Investigator book, I enjoyed Quick's \\"Slightly Shady\\" and the other two books with Tobias March and Lavinia Lake much more than I enjoyed this one. If you're not sure if you like period P.I.'s... maybe start with those other books and then pick this one up if you find you liked her others."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I have to admit I was viewing this book with a bit of dread. The last two AQ books I've read have been lacking her usual style and comic flair. Finally, she seems to be back on the right track. Lie By Moonlight has a protagonist who is likable and with whom one can relate, Concordia Glade. She is a bit of a modern woman and has distinct ideas regarding women's rights, but that only serves to make her character more interesting. The hero, Ambrose Wells, is a likable sort who actually began life in much less fortunate circumstances. He's not as overbearing and brooding as some Quick men. They have the usual mystery to solve and have a host of sidekicks, including a gay man - very unusual for a regency romance. Quick treats each character well.The plot is fast-paced and there are a few twists and turns. Overall, this is an excellent example of a good Amanda Quick work."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This was an excellent read. Full of suspense and romance with a lot of spice. The story starts out with Concordia hiring Mr.Wells to find out what really happen to her sister who she suspects was murdered. Meanwhile she trying to protect her students from certain harm and danger. Then there the mystery Mr. Wells himself who Concordia finds intriguing despite herself. This is a must read novel don't be surprise if you finish in one day."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"When she learns that the female students she is teaching at a private boarding school are being sold as courtesans to the highest bidder, Miss Concordia Glade takes it upon herself to save them from this fate. She hatches a plan to sneak the girls out of the school and keep them in hiding until she can figure out their next step. What she doesn't expect is that a dashing gentleman named Ambrose Wells will turn up in the middle of her escape and help she and the girls to safety. Under Wells' protection, Concordia and the girls remain in hiding while the man in question tries to figure out who is behind the dastardly scheme to steal these young ladies' innocence.This is one of the only romance novels I've read in which I had no problems at all with the plot. The heroine didn't do something stupid that made me wish she would just grow up or mind her own business (which has happened frequently in the past with some of my favorite romances including Kingdom of Dreams by Judith McNaught and Love Me Forever by Johanna Lindsey). She had a dream at the beginning of the book, in this case to become the headmistress of her own school, and she went on to achieve it instead of letting it fall by the wayside when she got the guy (this was my main problem with Quick's The Paid Companion). And finally, she wasn't some young girl fresh out of the schoolroom who had no idea what she wanted (which happens more often than I could name). Concordia had a mind of her own, a passion for her students, and an even greater passion for the man in her life. All in all, this novel was essentially a perfect romance for me, and I can't think of the last time I felt this way. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly to Amanda Quick fans who might feel she's fallen off her game recently (which I thought when I read her newest book, Second Sight). It has all the mystery, wit, and excitement of a Quick, but it's done so well I can't think of a single complaint."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Completely modern Concordia Glade hopes some-day to establish a school for girls. But when she learns that the four girls in her charge are in danger--and might be subjects of a white slavery ring--she moves into action attempting an escape. Fortunately, professional investigator and seriously mysterious sometime thief Ambrose Wells is in the midst of his own investigation into the peculiar boarding school where Concordia taught. He helps Concordia and the girls escape, but finds himself falling for the strong-willed teacher.Concordia insists on becoming Ambrose's partner and employer as they search for the truth behind the mysterious boarding school and the criminal masterminds who have invested so much in these four students. But the criminals are intent on having the girls back--and don't draw the line at murder. Ambrose's mystical training and skills will be called to the ultimate test, both to confront the criminal masterminds who rule much of Victorian London, and to withstand the emotions he endures as Concordia repeatedly ignores his instructions and insists on thrusting herself into danger.Author Amanda Quick combines a darkly mysterious hero with a quirky and amusing heroine in a charming romance. Fortunately, both Concordia and Ambrose soon recognize the attraction they feel, but true love is never easy--especially when it involves a 'modern' woman who is unconcerned about her reputation and who is convinced that Ambrose only wishes to marry her to spare her from being 'ruined.'Quick makes the Victorian setting of her novel, with its continued emphasis on 'society' and its gradual transition to a more liberated worldview, come alive. Her writing is charming and witty. It's hard not to enjoy reading LIE BY MOONLIGHT.LIE is not exactly profound and the characters left me both chuckling and frustrated at some of the silly things they did, but Quick once again delivers an enjoyable diversion."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"The well-toned male torso of sexy hero Ambrose Wells that emblazons the cover of Amanda Quick's latest novel, LIE BY MOONLIGHT, is sure to make it another New York Times bestseller. The classical statuary image used is as seductive as any modern-day Australian Gold Tanning Product poster. Quick knows what attracts her fans and LIE BY MOONLIGHT delivers passion, lust, adventure, and a suspenseful murder mystery along with a thoroughly modern perspective on one Victorian lady's view of the relationship between the sexes.The privacy of the palms in the warm and richly scented conservatory cast in moonlight creates the perfect spot for a sizzling rendezvous between lovers that showcases Quick's mastery at creating a steamy, sensual, and satisfying romantic scene. This kind of writing is what has attracted millions of readers to Quick's historical novels, as well as the contemporary novels she writes under her own name, Jayne Ann Krentz. The pure male cover guaranteed that lust would be found between the pages of LIE BY MOONLIGHT, but the conservatory scene is one you'll read more than once.\\"I thought you intended to ravish me\\" are hardly the words one would expect from Concordia Glade, a teacher in Late Victorian England in charge of four orphaned young ladies at Aldwick Castle. In her late twenties and raised by parents who fell in love at first sight and made some scandalous decisions to be together, Concordia boldly pursues her feelings for Ambrose Wells, the knight in shining armor who arrives unexpectedly at Aldwick Castle just in time to help her and her students escape a fiery castle and a scheme to sell orphaned girls for brothels.Courageous, smart and independent, Concordia has an unconventional and liberal view of the relationship between the sexes and social rules of the day, even allowing one of her students to wear pants inside the elegant mansion in which they are taking refuge. Concordia encourages her girls to read novels, including \\"sensation novels\\" and exposes them to a broad range of subjects that would allow them to pursue careers of their own --- shocking teachings for this period of history.Intrigued by the small flower tattoo above Ambrose's left pectoral and inflamed by her instant attraction to him, Concordia Glade trusts Ambrose with her safety and that of the four girls --- Hannah, Phoebe, Edwina and Theodora. Working together, Ambrose and Concordia unravel a trail of scandal and blackmail to identify the \\"gentleman\\" and other so-called respectable members of London society who are secretly behind many unexplained deaths and deceptions.Despite the ways of the secret society Vanza, to which professional thief turned \\"private inquiry agent\\" Ambrose Wells practices, he no longer is \\"master of his passions\\" in the presence of Concordia Glade. Concordia threatens his self-mastery and he doesn't care. Ambrose openly admits to her, \\"There is no hope for me, is there?\\" When Concordia gives herself to him for the first time, she has no regrets and tells him, \\"You were the right man.\\" Unconventional to the core, Concordia's proposal of marriage to Ambrose defies the decorum of the period, speaks volumes for women's liberation and suggests that men like Ambrose Wells were not threatened by the freethinking women who were present in Victorian London society --- but then what man wouldn't welcome a woman who would \\"lie by moonlight?\\"--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"If you like Amanda Quick (Jayne Ann Krentz, etc) you will love this mystery/romance historical fiction.

Lord Curzon was a Viceroy of the British Raj and ruled over millions of Indian subjects. In this short book, Curzon writes about his travels on the subcontinent. In his travels, he meets some of the Indian royalty, visits Afghanistan and other small princely states, and goes on tiger shoots. His description of turn of the century India was insightful. However, one also has to tolerate his arrogance and feelings of superiority over his subjects. In his eyes, most of the Indians and other native subjects are socially lower than all Europeans. Curzon writes in this way, and destroys his creditablily.If one can overcome the arrogance of Lord Curzon, this is a great travel and history book.

Part history lesson and part educational treatise, Tyack argues for the importance of schools as civic spaces that ultimately sustain democracy. Tyack spends the greater part of the book examining the tense and often troubled past of American schooling within both ethnic and religious contexts.Neither overly critical nor overly optimistic in his assessment of schooling, Tyack issues a clarion call to all citizens that our democracy rests on an ability and willingness to make schools better. Although at times loquacious, Tyack's claims are well taken. So well, in fact, that educators and non-educators alike should be able to get beyond his verbose style and really enjoy reading this book.A common theme in Seeking Common Ground, what Tyack calls \\"the search for common ground amid controversy and ethnoreligious diversity\\" (p. 183), is situated around three key issues: 1) the ways in which school leadership attempted to create citizens through schooling, 2) how diversity has been dealt with by school leadership, 3) and the ways in which schools have been governed. Each of these three issues is covered through historical analysis of textbook use, changing philosophical foundations, and power struggles in schools and school districts. Tyack is critical yet fair in his interpretation of history by painting a picture that schools have never really gotten it right, yet they have also not failed entirely. This articulation allows the text to carry a cautious optimism.At the core of Seeking Common Ground is a critique of educational leadership's preoccupation with functionalism. As Tyack lays out his historical analysis it becomes clear that he is framing his critique within a critical perspective, aiming his analyses directly at the ways in which functionalism is manifest in educational policy and practice. Tyack is successful in his effort to portray this struggle. Through his interpretation of history it can be understood that the aims of education have always rested on shifting sand and the winds of socio-cultural discourse often create tension and, at times, chaos. In other words, educational policy makers and school leaders have never gotten it right, and probably never will, but the struggle is necessary in creating and sustaining liberal democracy.Also at the center of Seeking Common Ground is a critique of the \\"melting pot\\" pathology exerted toward those deemed \\"other.\\" As Tyack illustrates time and again, white male Protestants have used the school as a device to manipulate and control anyone outside of their own group, even white Protestant women. Whether it is through the explicit use of public policy against ethno-religious difference, or implicitly through textbooks and their propagation of historical meta-narratives, Tyack paints a picture that white privilege and male hegemony have been at the center of determining what education is for and what is to be taught.Finally, Seeking Common Ground is a tract on the values of local control and the ways in which that control has been removed from localities and placed into the hands of the government apparatus. Tyack illustrates his point by saying that \\"I think there is still a good case for vesting decisions about education, as much as possible, with the people who have to live directly with the results of those decisions, in local districts and even in individual schools\\" (p. 185). It is here that Tyack is perhaps his most aggressive and uses the historical analysis of the text to set up his primary assertion; that for our democracy to flourish, we must learn to wrestle with difference. This is done best in the context of local school districts and individual schools who can locate the idiosyncrasies of difference and struggle as a community. Essentially, it is a classic argument against the government apparatus \\"steering from afar.\\" Tyack wonders how it is possible that governments can maximize the effectiveness of schooling from such a distance. He brings the book home by asserting that only at the community level can schools create and sustain the democratic experiment in an organic way.David Tyack does not necessarily say anything new in Seeking Common Ground, but that does not mitigate his saliency. In many ways Tyack issues slightly nuanced rhetoric to a long-standing discourse; namely that schools have never gotten it right - and probably never will. However, it is our obligation as a society to try anyway, which according to Tyack, is an important truth to confront. Only when our society learns to accept this fact will schools realize their potential. Tyack situates the text around the theme of difference and reassures the reader that our difference is what makes us American and democracy is our voice. Schools then, in this context, are a means to foster and reify what democracy can and should be."},{"Title":"Seeking Common Ground: Public Schools in a Diverse Society","review":"Excellent resource for introductory Education classes.

They are enjoyable, intelligent, engrossing, dramatic comments upon society. They are relevant today as they were in the 1890s.The nineteenth century John Gabriel Borkman, like the twenty-first century's Bernie Madoff, bilked his friends of their life savings. Both were highly respected until they were caught and sent to jail, and both had lived well. Ibsen examines the impact that Borkman's nefarious acts have upon him, his wife, her sister, his son, and his friends.Borkman spent three years in detention, then five years in jail, then, after his release, eight years in the upper story of his sister-in-law's house, for he had no money any more. For eight years he walked back and forth in his room, like a caged rat, waiting for the day that he was certain would come when he would rise again.Ibsen focuses especially on three episodes. Borkman wanted so strongly to obtain wealth and power that he gave up what was important to him. Without realizing what he was doing, in a Faustian fashion, he gained power and wealth, but destroyed his own life and the life of another. What prompted his need for power? What did he give up? Who was involved? Who did he especially hurt?Borkman's wife hates him. During the eight post-prison years, she refuses to meet with him although they live in the same house. Why?Borkman's sister-in-law helps him for Borkman did not squander her funds. Why? Why also did she raise his son? What affect did all of this have on her and his son?"},{"Title":"John Gabriel Borkman, (The green tree library)","review":"The subject of John Gabriel Borkman (1896) makes it seem like a companion piece to some of the writer's earlier dramas The Pillars of Society or Enemy of the People, dealing with the subject of corruption, or at least an act of guilt in the past on the part of an individual that is to have a profound effect on the wider community. It's the aftermath of such a situation that is viewed here but, as one of Ibsen's latter plays, the subtext of John Gabriel Borkman is that of an act of corruption by an artist, who has forsaken the truth and love for more material gains, a theme that is borne out by Ibsen's next and final drama, When We Dead Awaken (1899), where the subject is made even more explicit.In the case of John Gabriel Borkman, the figure at the centre of the intrigue is a disgraced bank manager who has served five years in prison for financial irregularities that brought about the collapse of the bank and the savings of many people in the community. Borkman has served a further three years locked in the upstairs apartment of the house leased to the disgraced family by his sister-on-law Ella Rentheim. Borkman's failings however go deeper than his mere failing as a banker - in the past he renounced his love for Ella in order to become a successful and powerful businessman. Now, both his wife and her twin sister are seeking restitution for the losses they have suffered and hope to achieve it through his son, Erhart. Erhart however is unwilling to join in the \\"Danse Macabre\\" that has erupted around him and wants to take off and find happiness for himself.The hints that there is a rather more autobiographical context to the drama are found to some extent in the suffering of most of the characters associated with Borkman. Nearly all of them however have to share responsibility for their own failings - a complication that makes the role they play rather richer and more complex - but the purity of the artistic endeavour that has been lost or corrupted can be seen in Borkman's former assistant Fodal, an aspiring writer who doesn't have self-belief, or who has rather sacrificed his art for the people around him, perhaps foolishly. Borkman doesn't lack in confidence, aware that the keys to the kingdom were once in his grasp, but that his ability to retain them has long since passed and he is now \\"dead\\" to the world. The question that arises is whether the dead can awaken and redemption be achieved, a subject that Ibsen also approaches in his last drama, and to which the answer here would seem to be an equally bleak and dispiriting one."},{"Title":"John Gabriel Borkman, (The green tree library)","review":"The publisher created this book utilizing OCR software.

It takes place in an icy Scandinavian winter, in an icy Scandinavian house, filled with people whose emotions are anything but cold.

Runciman's telling of this bitter tale - and it is a tale that spans not only the 11th and 12th centuries, but has roots going back far deeper - is both concise and lucid. Runciman clearly details this narrative that has proved debilitating to Christianity ever since - not only between the East and the West, but also between the umpteen gazillion Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic church.Runciman does a wondeful job summarizing the various events of previous years (especially the Photian Schism, which occured in the 9th century) that helped to lay the \\"groundwork\\", so to speak, for the ultimate rending of Christendom. Yet, despite the great attention that is sometimes given to various events (especially to Cardinal Humbert's excommunicating Patriarch Michael Cerularius, who in turn excommunicated Humbert), Runciman's thesis is that the \\"schism\\" did not occur at a particular instant, but gradually over time. It was not until the middle of the 13th century that the received opinion of both clergy and layman was that the churches were no longer in communion with one another.In fact, the mutual excommunications noted above, which occured in 1054, are really little more than a blip on the screen of East-West relations: Humbert did not have the power to excommunicate Cerularius, and Cerularius' excommunicating Humbert should not be understood as Cerularius excommunicating the whole Western church - something that the popular imagination of both Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy would do well to remember. So, the received thesis that the split occured in 1054 needs to be abandoned.Runciman also does a wonderful job of appreciating and detailing the socio-theological and theological-political nature of the Church during the so-called \\"Middle\\" Ages. That the Church should have such a public presence, and that this public presence should be so important to both the popular mind and international relations may seem strange. It was, indeed, a different world, complete with its own pitfalls and glories. Yet, it is interesting to note that the most divisive theological issue - papal supremacy - also fueled the Crusades, which were more influential than anything else in breaking Christendom apart.It is a shame that this book has gone out of print again. Perhaps on its 50th anniversary it will be printed yet again, and people will begin to appreciate the subtle differences that, given the fourth Crusade, were exacerbated into the greatest and most tragic split that the Church has ever known - and most likely will ever know. If you can find a copy of this book, I highly recommend picking it up. Although you will catch bits and pieces of this story in many other books, this volume will illuminate its complexities and clear away the myths surrounding it like other books - especially theological works - won't. It is, sadly, a crucial and divisive narrative."},{"Title":"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches During the Xith and Xiith Centuries","review":"\`It is an article of faith that the followers of Christ should form one united body on earth'...\`The usual definition of a schism is that it is the emergence of a separate faction within the church, whereas heresy is associated with false doctrine.' So begins this gracious book on the split between Eastern and Western Christendom that formed an accumulative dispute over the nature of the trinity throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries and led to a contest for ultimate authority between the sees of Rome and Constantinople.Runciman's erudition where theological matters are concerned gives us a greater perception and understanding into the respective mind sets of Orthodox and Catholic. Opposite views on the trinity...\`The Western view is that the unity of God is absolute and the Persons of the Trinity are relative within it, while the Eastern view is that the three Persons have each a distinctive property but are joined in a hypostatic union'...were exacerbated by translation errors between Greek and Latin and the arrogance of some of the higher echelon churchman, until in 1099 a political dimension intervened: \`The chief tragedy of the crusades was that they brought the misunderstandings between Eastern and Western Christians down to a popular level.' Western armies, \`rapacious' and \`unruly,' used Constantinople as a half way house en route to their bloody business in the holy land, while Byzantines \`were eager for allies against the Turks...could not interest themselves in wars in Palestine.'Antagonisms mounted with crusaders plundering Byzantine lands and accusing schismatic Greeks of perfidious dealings. The stage was becoming set for the Fourth Crusade and that most profane act; the sack of Constantinople in 1204 and temporary overthrow of the first Christian Empire by Christian crusaders would set a gruesome precedent that not even the sack of Rome in 1527 by Christian mercenaries could surpass. Although Venice bears the guilt for much of the impetus and logistical execution, infamy clung to Rome, who for one brief moment gleefully enjoyed its dominance until schisms of its own would contribute to the Reformation dawn. After the Fourth Crusade, division remained a bitter reality.Runciman covers all points of contact in this judicious narrative and leaves us with a greater frame of reference for future developments."},{"Title":"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches During the Xith and Xiith Centuries","review":"Famous historian Steven Runciman shows how different cultural backgrounds and linguistic traditions, theological disputes rooted in differing concepts of the Trinity, and Papal insistence on papal authority and supremacy, all combined with several hundred years of strained relations to result in a permanent split in the Universal Church. Runciman's thesis is that the experience of the Crusades (and his three volume work on that topic is one of the current basic accounts) in which Western armies came to help the Christian east and stayed to help themselves (to Eastern property, lands, and church offices) was the real reason for the permanent division between Eastern and Western churches. But for the legacy of Western depradations in the East, especially the Fourth Crusade, the breach could have been healed.I gave this a four star rating only because it is so good that in twice the length, Runciman could have given us even more background and detail which would have made his erudite narrative even more engaging."},{"Title":"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches During the Xith and Xiith Centuries","review":"Many of us burdened with the Western perspective of history look to the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century as the shipwreck of Western Civilization. But, in fact, one could make a good case that the Schism between Eastern and Western Churches that occurred several centuries prior to the Reformation was of even greater importance. And herein, Steven Runciman describes that great event in truly remarkable and eminently readable fashion.Runciman argues quite cogently that it was not the technical aspects of the procession of the Holy Spirit that led to the Schism, so much as the cultural and linguistic differences between the Greek and Latin survivals of the once unified Church. Most importantly, the Greeks, centered in Constantinople, believed that important matters of dispute ought to be settled in council among equals. Opposed to this view was the Latin perspective that one man, occupying the See of Saint Peter, ought to hold sway. Runciman is scrupulous in terms of not taking sides in this terrible collision of ideas. But, in the end, we must reasonably conclude, from the evidence provided, that the Orthodox is the more reasonable position with regard to this monumental issue.The writing is great. And the subject matter is really terribly important. We strongly recommend this excellent book to all who would thoroughly understand these great matters."},{"Title":"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches During the Xith and Xiith Centuries","review":"Runciman's slim volume is the standard authority addressing the greatest rupture in the Christian Church prior to the Protestant Reformation. The tragic division of the \\"Great Schism\\" between Christianity in the East and the West is often dated as occurring in 1054. Cambridge scholar and Crusades expert Steven Runciman makes a compelling case that while 1054 is the year that papal legates issued a bull of excommunication to the Patriarch of Constantinople at the famous Hagia Sophia Cathedral, the final schism hardened only after the next 150 years.As the Latin West established parallel jurisdictions in other parts of the empire (e.g. Antioch) alongside their Eastern brethren, an intensified conflict was inevitable. It was only by the time of the Fourth Crusade when the Western Crusaders sacked Constantinople in 1204 and desecrated Hagia Sophia that the schism was official. Eastern Christianity sought to maintain the Christian standards of the Patristic Fathers and the Seven Ecumenical Councils. While they recognized the historic honor and dignity of the Pope as Bishop of Rome and \\"first among equals\\" Eastern Christians refused to submit to the the Papacy's claims to jurisdiction over the entire universal Church.Eastern Christians also objected to such things as the Western use of unleavened bread in the sacrament, the Western refusal of married men to become priests, and, especially, the Western addition of \\"Filioque\\" to the Nicene Creed teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father \\"and the Son.\\" In the words of on Eastern Archbishop named Nicetas, \\"we do not deny the Roman Church the primacy amongst the five sister Patriarchates (Rome, Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople); and we recognize her right to the most honorable seat at an Oecumenical Council. But she has separated herself from us by her own deeds when through pride she assumed a (universal) monarch which does not belong to her office.\\"The issue of the centrality and authority of the Roman Papcy in the first 1000 years of the Church is another topic for another book(s). However, if you're simply looking for what remains to be the authoritative treatment of the Great Schism that is honest and sympathetic to the Eastern plight - and from a Catholic scholar nonetheless - then Runciman's work is the place to turn. Having read the hardback edition, I'm thankful the work is now in paperback format and available to a wider reading audience."},{"Title":"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches During the Xith and Xiith Centuries","review":"To begin with , I am a big fan of Runciman and I was very eager to get into this book. I was not disappointed, though there were times when I nearly lost my way. I found his treatment of the subject interesting and fascinating and always fair to both the Greek and Roman rites. I was also very pleased to find information that I did not know before. I would highly recommend this book to readers interested in the Great Schism."},{"Title":"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches During the Xith and Xiith Centuries","review":"A great history and explanation of an extremely important historical event scarcely known which even today influences nations."},{"Title":"Getting Back Together","review":"My old paperback copy has a face price of $1.25, which tells you how old it is and how long it's been with me. I'm not likely to give it up soon.There's no denying that some facts like altitudes, locations and names are wrong, but this is clearly deliberate. Houriet was a professional news reporter, and surely knew how to fact-check. I concluded long ago that he was blurring the identifying details of people and place as he wrote in order to protect those he had visited. Clearly, the delicate communities (and some delicate people) were all very vulnerable to excessive attention from both friend and foe.For instance, I'm quite familiar with the area in SW Oregon (Takilma & environs) that he wrote about, and the hippie/redneck tension there is still quite uncomfortable. But despite knowing the area, I couldn't figure out just exactly where the places were that Houriet was talking about. Though Cave Junction must have been the \\"big\\" town with the market, he could also have been referring to the Holland store, where a friend of mine could be working at this moment.So I have always thought that Houriet took factual liberties in a very deliberate way, blending facts and incidents into a coherent narrative. That way he could protect his friends and sources and still write insightful and illustrative stories.Like Castaneda's, Houriet's stories may be more true than what a camcorder would have recorded. His tone in the book and his subsequent life (google it!) amply show his sincerity and his wish that he could have just *found* the perfect place instead of having to try to create it.As someone who visited a few communes back then with an eye to joining, but who was put off by the same factors that Houriet cites as leading to their failure, I see what he wrote as valid and important. I also have a few other (but more limited) books by people who tried that way of life, and while all agree on the ways that small groups fail, few are based on the same amount of research or insight as Houriet's. Students of social psychology would do well to use him as a source, despite his blurring of the hard edges of the facts.Still, by now I know well the lessons Houriet's book teaches. What keeps me rereading the book every few years is the depth and color of the picture he paints of the times and the people, and his viewpoint: from the inside. We all faced pressures and fears that I would not like to confront again. We also felt hope that I fear I will never feel again."},{"Title":"Getting Back Together","review":"I don't know about accuracy, I suspect this book was based on diaries that were covered in all sorts of dirt and hallucinogenic chemicals. The tone of the book is very exciting for someone like me who missed the era completely but has always admired it.The most interesting aspect of this book is the insight into the hippy world, it is a diary that has been entirely unchanged by 30 thirty years of media history re-writing. Contrary to what is believed a lot of hippies were meat eating and killed their own animals. They were not about peace and love - woodstock was peace and love communes were places that middle class dropouts bummed around in for a while most of them desintegrating into chaos, one commune he found deserted had 'forever change' written on the wall with a marker pen.Sometimes he was happy and felt accepted but those moments were quite rare and I get the feeling he felt he was surrounded by immature teenagers. He gives a honest account of his feelings and how his personality is developing.One part where I laughed and laughed was the following:&quot;One applicant not accepted was Crazy Paul, a spaced-out young man who had visions and who eventually found his way to New Buffalo. His membership, he was told, would be contingent on his taking a bath - something that evidently conflicted with Paul's principles. One member recalled that 'he stood there looking up at the shower head for hours.' Then, without turning it on, he left the community.&quot;"},{"Title":"Getting Back Together","review":"Had I had no previous knowledge or personal experience with the communes and people mentioned in this book, I would have thought the author had done a fine job of not only reporting on but also participating in communal life. Houriet has impressive narrative skills and some of his personal observations (both positive and negative) seem valid and interesting. But since I do have knowledge and experience of many of these communes and people, I am dismayed and disappointed with this &quot;off the bus&quot; report.Houriet devotes considerable space to his stay at New Buffalo (in New Mexico) and right from the beginning the inaccuracies are evident. He says the elevation of Santa Fe is 1,000 feet when in fact it is 7,000 ft. (the capital city with the highest elevation in the country; Denver is only 5,000 ft.). He calls vigas &quot;vertigas&quot; and latillas &quot;lotillas&quot; and says the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are west of Arroyo Hondo (near New Buffalo) when in fact, they are in the East. He says that Santo Domingo Pueblo was one of the few inhabited pueblos left in the state. Not true. There's Taos, Isleta, Santa Clara, Laguna, Zuni, Acoma...just to name a few. A quick check of an encyclopedia would have set him straight, but he didn't bother. Irritatingly, he repeats these sloppy mistakes over and over. Unlike Tim Miller in *The 60s Communes* and *Hippies and American Values*, Houriet hasn't done his homework.He shouldn't have changed some names and not others. He should have either changed them all or reported them accurately. Jane became &quot;Mary&quot; and her child, Sarah, became &quot;Nancy.&quot; Joanne became Joanna while George and Joyce Robinson and Cowboy Bob at Buffalo, Byron and Jason at Morningstar and Jasper and Max at Reality Construction Co. retained their true names. Cave Dave became &quot;Cave David.&quot; Apparently Houriet didn't get it that Dave was called &quot;Cave Dave&quot; because it rhymes.These inaccuracies may seem unimportant, but when this author makes up incidents of violence out of whole cloth (like something from &quot;Easy Rider&quot;), the falsities become more seriously misleading. He has a reporter's instinct about what kind of material sells books but he doesn't seem to worry overmuch about telling the truth. When you find fabrications and inaccuracies in the parts you know about, how can you trust the rest of it?Reporting on his one peyote meeting (at Morningstar - a couple miles from New Buffalo) he got his facts hopelessly confused. The water bird became a &quot;mourning dove&quot; and the dried cedar used as an incense sacrament became &quot;cedar berries.&quot; He misreported the Indians and Hippies there and what they said (I know; I was there). The mistakes and misrepresentations involving Buffalo, Morningstar and Reality are too numerous to mention further.Houriet's interview with Lou Gottlieb at the California Morningstar, however, as well as his conversations with Justin at Buffalo, sound authentic, but that was probably due to the unique personalities of these men coming through despite the author's embellishments and falsifications.Similarly, I don't find as many breathtaking fabrications in his accounts of Libre and Lama (but that may be because I didn't live at either of these places - just visited and knew people from them).Houriet only mentions The Farm (at Summertown Tennessee) in a footnote and he makes three mistakes in that footnote. This omission is odd because in his travels, the author was fairly near The Farm. It's one of the oldest and most successful of the Hippie communes and in fact, it is still going on today. It has produced doctors, lawyers, a school, a publishing company and several businesses and charitable organizations. Perhaps Farmies saw Houriet coming, knew he was likely to misrepresent them, and gave his his walking papers. We'll never know.Most people I've talked to who have read *Getting Back Together* clearly recognize that the author had his own agenda. What they may not have realized is that the book has been through at least two editions and thousands of people must have read it and believed it.In my opinion, this book is worse than worthless because it can't be trusted. I'm glad it's finally out of print.pamhan99@aol.com"},{"Title":"Getting Back Together","review":"The 1960s saw a sudden resurgence of communes and other \\"utopian\\" intentional communities, that had otherwise been in decline since the early 20th century. There are a number of detailed books about such communities (e.g.,The 60's Communes: Hippies and Beyond (Peace and Conflict Resolution);The Children of Prosperity: Thirteen Modern American Communes, etc.).However, there is certainly room for a more subjective, less \\"scholarly\\" account, and Robert Houriet's 1971 is one of the very first books written about this exciting period. Houriet visits and chronicles such places as Oz, High Ridge Farm, Twin Oaks, Harrad West, New Vrindaban (of the Hare Krishna sect), Lama, and others. He says, \\"The people of the communes opened their homes and lives fully to me at the risk of allowing their fragile way of life to be distorted and glamorized by the mass media.\\"Houriet's description of Harrad West (inspired by novelist Robert H. Rimmer's novel,The Harrad Experiment) is one of the most detailed I have found. Houriet recounts that in a meeting he had with Rimmer (who hadn't visited Harrad West, interestingly enough), \\"Harrad West had failed, not for lack of sexual allure or sexual jealousy, but because they had nothing BUT sex to hold them together---no common culture, no nonsexual forms of communicating and expressing love.\\"Houriet has a realistic outlook: \\"Thus far, I have not found one rural commune that has achieved anything close to economic self-sufficiency. From the viewpoint of the economic individualist, communes are invalid.\\" Nevertheless, he closes on an optimistic note: \\"We say good-bye for now. Someday I'll go on another trip to visit them and the other families in Oregon and New Mexico---all members of the new community taking roots over this, our land.\\"Houriet's book is engaging reading; if you want objective, detached scholarship, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Planning Your Future: A Guide for Professional Women","review":"Essentially a planning tool for professional women, gives insightful results from extensive research conducted across samples of women in their 20's and 30's.

I'm currently using this book in conjunction with others to study for my MOUS exam, and where this book lacks, the other titles supplement. If you don't have a lot of experience with Access, for example, then this book isn't a good choice. Start small and buy a guide tailored to the Office application you specifically need strength in.The book is clear in its instructions and does include exercises to help you practice and test your skills; however, if you're a visaul learner, you'll be sorely dissapointed. The screen shots ARE NOT plentiful. In addition, they're sized so small, they're almost useless. You won't be able to read text in the shots of the dialog boxes, and that's a definite minus. So many of the skills you must master for the test involve knowing how to use these boxes...The CD that's included is a waste, which is the major reason I gave this only 3 stars. The CD is glorified advertising with a little bit of actual practice material as filler. The book even shamelessly states: &quot;And when you need some diversion and want to explore some exciting new software...&quot; The MOUS exam itself is about $100, and this book is no bargain--if I wanted to buy software, then I'd have done so. If the CD included only practice material, then I would bet that the cost of the book would be greatly decreased.I hope that subsequent study manuals by these authors spend more time on design and function in their writing and less time on selling ads (one of the endpapers is an ad for Earthlink internet service)."},{"Title":"Microsoft Office 2000 User Specialist Study Guide","review":"This book is the most comprehensive book I found on the Office 2000 MOUS exams.

However, I find 2 major flaws with this course. First, aside from the dialouge for each chapter, Korean script is not used. Anyone who wants to learn Korean MUST master its writing system (it's not hard). New Vocabulary for each lesson is done in Romanization. Once you learn Korean script, you will find that reading korean script is much easier than any system of romanization. Well, that can still be remedied with a dictionary, so no harm done really. The second flaw is that one the accompanying tapes, the dialogue is read very slowly. For people who have no prior experience with Korean, this is good, as vowels and whatnot tend to be blended together often which an make distinguishing words rather difficult. But learners with more experience might not like this. It's soo slow sometimes, like this, &quot;An-nyeong ha----se---yo.&quot; Anyway, this is overall a good course. &quot;Teach Yourself Korean&quot; combined with &quot;College Korean&quot; should make an execellent selfstudy program for anybody. Sorry this was so long:)"},{"Title":"Korean Complete Course: With Book (Teach Yourself)","review":"I highly recommend &quot;Teach Yourself Korean&quot; to any beginners at the language. It has entertaining dialogues (not dry like most other textbooks) and teaches things in a systematic format focusing on the practical application of grammar principles supplemented by useful vocabulary. After learning a principle from this book, you always seem to be able to find a way to use it in a real conversation, and my Korean friends have complimented me when I use the expressions on how natural they sound. I have also purchased the more traditional &quot;College Korean&quot; paperback by Rogers, You, and Richards, and would say if one had to go with one or the other, most would be better off with &quot;Teach Yourself Korean.&quot; The books weaknesses include using only romanized Korean in the vocabulary sections and grammar explanations (though dialogues are printed in Hangul), and its lack of any kind of index. Using romanized Korean as opposed to Korean script makes verb forms and pronounciation rules needlessly confusing; a good text should include both.

Barnett, Psy.D.\\"Readers of the Independent Practitioner are likely well acquainted with Division 42's efforts to assist psychologists in independent practice to expand their practices into new areas. This focus has emphasized how well trained psychologists are able to utilize their existing training and skills, augment them with additional training and experience, and develop the ability to expand their competence into new areas of practice. This approach helps take independent practitioners beyond their usual outpatient psychotherapy and assessment practices. Perhaps all that is needed to make this transition is the right set of resources to guide psychologists on how to make this transition.Family Evaluation in Custody Litigation: Reducing risks of ethical infractions and malpractice, by Benjamin and Gollan is just such a great resource. This book is built on Benjamin's years of experience as the founder and Director of the University of Washington's Parenting Evaluation Treatment Program (PETP). A psychologist and attorney, Benjamin, along with co-author, Gollan, brings his expertise from both fields to provide this wonderful practical introduction to the field of child custody evaluations. The authors make it very clear that appropriately trained psychologists who follow standardized procedures are able to make valuable contributions in the often-contentious area of custody litigation. They have written this very readable and easily comprehended book so it is accessible to all psychologists, not just those with forensic backgrounds. In fact, their practical, nuts and bolts approach seems ideally suited to psychologists new to the forensic arena. The book is very well organized and set up around the evaluation process developed over many years at the PETP. Their approach focuses on conducting a comprehensive parenting evaluation that is consistent with established professional standards and guidelines. This approach emphasizes taking on the role of objective evaluator and educator; a role that seems increasingly important as one learns more about the potentially contentious nature of the forensic environment. The authors provide the reader with a step by step approach that takes us from establishing competence in custody evaluations all the way to testifying in court. In between, we are guided through each step of the evaluation process with a thorough explanation of methods and the justification for using them, specific strategies for ethical conduct and risk management, and highly useful templates for each aspect of the evaluation. Templates are provided for informed consent, tracking the progress of the evaluation, release forms, recording and investigating allegations, and communicating with the parties involved and the judge. In addition, detailed comprehensive semi-structured interviews are provided for use with both adults and adolescents. Also of great importance is the fact that readers are guided in how to use these materials in the context of a comprehensive parenting evaluation. The reader is taken step by step through the evaluation process. In addition to theory and rationale, specific strategies are provided to guide the professional in conducting these evaluations. This book goes far beyond a review of the literature and an abstract discussion of child custody issues. It is also a practical guide that takes the reader through each aspect of the evaluation, highlighting clinical and ethics issues each step along the way. Common pitfalls and commonly anticipated difficulties are described in detail and preventative strategies are shared. One great strength of this book is the highly useful Practice Tips interspersed throughout the book. These very practical and useful strategies are gems from the authors' years of experience. The book also includes two sample evaluation reports that are built upon the methods and techniques described, and that integrate clinical examples used, throughout the text. The authors repeatedly tie their practical recommendations to professional standards, highlighting how these steps help us to meet existing professional standards. They also repeatedly emphasize steps to take to minimize the risk of ethics and malpractice suits. They present a protocol designed to result in each party feeling fairly treated and thoroughly evaluated. What this book is not: A comprehensive textbook that covers every aspect of the custody evaluation process and all the reader will ever need to know about this topic. It also is not the sole resource for establishing competence or a \`how to' book to be blindly followed.What this book is: A well-written, practical, and comprehensive guide to assist practitioners to enter the field of custody evaluations. It presents one model for conducting these evaluations and shares a step by step approach for doing so. The authors make very clear the need for additional formal training and in fact, make specific recommendations for the types of training and expertise needed before one begins to provide these evaluations. They also emphasize the need for supervision and ongoing consultation with experienced colleagues as competence is developed. They present an innovative strategy of videotaping all interactions throughout the evaluation and writing the report contemporaneously to ensure the most comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased evaluation possible. They further emphasize how to protect the integrity of the process involved and the goal of a process that results in the most useful possible evaluation report; one that will be perceived by all involved as objective, unbiased, and helpful.Readers of this book will be taken through each aspect of the custody evaluation process. The detailed descriptions help the reader have realistic expectations in areas such as conducting interviews, testing, and observations; participating in depositions, preparation of the written report, and testifying in court. The useful templates and practical guidelines take the reader through each step of the evaluation. The reader is guided in how to remain consistent with the role of objective evaluator at all times, how to avoid common pitfalls, and how to conduct an evaluation consistent with accepted professional standards. The emphasis on multiple methods of measurement and data collection and how to integrate data into a comprehensive report that meets the court's needs is especially helpful.This book is an excellent practical introduction to the field of performing custody evaluations. While it is not the last word on the topic (clearly more training will be needed beyond what this book provides), it is an excellent place to start and an outstanding resource for all psychologists interested in entering this exciting area of practice.\\""},{"Title":"Family Evaluation in Custody Litigation: Reducing Risks of Ethical Infractions and Malpractice (Forensic Practice Guidebook)","review":"Benjamin, et al have written a helpful book for those interested in learning how to conduct a child custody evaluation. The reservation I would offer is that they have made some unconventional recommendations that are not identified as such. For example, the authors advise against interviewing children younger than teenage. This is inconsistent with the practice of most experienced, custody evaluators. Another controversial and possibly dangerous suggestion is the destruction of video taping that is made during the evaluation process prior to court proceedings. I believe these and other, unconventional procedural recommendations that the authors make should be clearly identified as such, especially in a book that is subtitled \\"Reducing Risks of Ethical Infractions and Malpractice\\". With this reservation, the book is a useful addition to the references guiding those who perform child custody evaluations."},{"Title":"Family Evaluation in Custody Litigation: Reducing Risks of Ethical Infractions and Malpractice (Forensic Practice Guidebook)","review":"Having read a number of custody evaluation \\"how to\\" texts, I find that this book provided more of the \\"brass tacks\\" than any other book out there for someone with no experience or exposure to evaluations. Even for experienced evaluators, the suggestions to reduce risk and liability are invaluable. Dr. Benjamin has the reputation of having conducted/supervised over 800 evaluations and never having had a board complaint or lawsuit filed against him. His background as both a psychologist and an attorney, combined with his experience in the field has given him the knowledge to be able to put together a book that not only outlines how to conduct these evaluations ethically and reduce one's own risk, but still gives the simple basics - those details that only one who has done it can impart to others, for example, when and how to collect fees, forms and an example of an evaluation (valuable because evaluations are confidential and it's difficult to get a copy of one), and in essence, walks the reader step-by-step through the first evaluation. Of course, he stresses supervision and consultation to those new to the field, which is critical, but his outlay of the process helps those who have not experienced it to know what to expect and avoid the pitfalls. Out of 20+ books I read while getting started, not to mention seminars I took, this text was the most helpful."},{"Title":"Family Evaluation in Custody Litigation: Reducing Risks of Ethical Infractions and Malpractice (Forensic Practice Guidebook)","review":"After having completed the text in its entirety, my thoughts on Dr. Andrew Benjamin have been confirmed.Dr. Benjamin was appointed to conduct the family evaluation and reunification process between my daughter and I, following a custody battle that revealed the non-custodial mother to be wantonly dishonest, mentally unstable, and malicious in nature. From the first meeting, I had made clear my concerns, which were substantiated by the records of the court, and by previous evaluators, which Dr. Benjamin smugly dismissed. Shortly following the second evaluation session in 1998, my former wife abducted my daughter - I have not seen her since she was four years old; she will be sixteen in June of 2010.Not only was Dr. Benjamin grossly negligent in his form of practice and conduct, but he acted both unethically and improperly in the evaluation of my daughter, myself, as well as my former wife. Dr. Benjamin destroyed, or otherwise made unavailable a videotaped interview in which I outlined my concern for what would occur, but also refused to amend the contract for evaluation, which he was not legally, but was ethically obligated to do.According to his writings, Dr. Benjamin is directly complicit in the abduction of my daughter. Not to be denied his due for underhandedness and cunning, the contract is written in such a way that allows him to escape any responsibility whatsoever.More insulting is the very publication of this book. My daughter's situation is referenced multiple times as an example of what NOT to do. My daughter has been denied an upbringing with her father and an entire branch of her family. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars attempting to rectify the arrogance and misdeeds of Dr. Benjamin...yet he has reaped significant financial profit from the destruction of my family.The very idea that anyone would follow the advice of a despicable man such as Dr. Andrew Benjamin is, in a word, nauseating."},{"Title":"On the Yankee Station: Stories by William Boyd","review":"On The Yankee Station by William Boyd is a series of short stories, the longest of which provides the title for the set. This particular story is a superb piece of short fiction, much more than a short story, confronting, in less than twenty-five pages, several big issues and, at the same time, drawing its characters in considerable, complex detail.Set on an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea during the Vietnam War, it describes the antagonistic relationship between two crew members. Pfitz is a pilot, conscious of and grateful for his perceived and actual status, a status he does not hesitate to assert to his advantage. But this tendency is sometimes exercised to excess. It is as if he needs to feel the elevation of his status in order to bolster his own self image. In short, he is a bully. This characteristic begins to dominate his thoughts and actions when events conspires to question his own competence, his right to that nourishing status.Lydecker is a member of Pfitz's ground crew. Suffice it to say that Lydecker is not at the intellectual end of the fighting machine. Neither does he hail from privilege. Quite the contrary, in fact. Lydecker, had he not joined the navy, would probably have grown into a complete bum, at best one step up from a down-and-out. Even in the armed forces he can only aspire to the most menial of tasks, but he is at least thorough and tries to keep his nose clean. But for Lydecker events conspire to heap suspicion on his competence, a suspicion constantly fuelled by a torrent of abuse and accusation that flows from Pfitz, the pilot it remains his responsibility to service.Pfitz likes his job. That much is clear. He takes a particular liking to napalm and delights at the idea of heaping tons of the stuff from his jet onto the population of rural Vietnam. He takes involved interest in technical improvements to his preferred weapon, improvements that ensure the fireball sticks firmly to anything it encounters, thus guaranteeing that it will burn right through. If he were closer to the action, one feels that Pfitz would delight in the smell, the mixture of burning organics saucing the suggestion of roast pork emanating from oxidised human flesh. He takes that kind of pride in a job well done.Lydecker is demoted, effectively humiliated by the time he gets an opportunity for some shore leave. During his week in Saigon he remorselessly pursues two forms of recreation, one out of a bottle, the other between whatever sheets are on offer. But there is one girl who is different, staying remote from the business of others, busying herself about her own affairs. She is treated with apparently universal and complete contempt and she alone amongst the bar hangers-on is never on the menu, her meat not for sale. Bullied himself in the workplace, one might expect Lydecker to sympathise with her plight. But he treats her with as much - if not more - disdain than the rest and, eventually, it is more out of spite than either sympathy or desire that he insists on a session with her, forces himself on her merely to underline his right to assert assumed control. What Lydecker subsequently experiences with that girl changes his view of the world just a little, but enough to influence events elsewhere, his new-found conscience constructing a plan he might employ back on board.In a short story, William Boyd illustrates class systems embedded in the USA's professedly classless society. He confronts the so-called clinical nature of modern warfare by identifying the blunderbuss of terror that maims everything in its indiscriminating line of fire. He characterises sadism, vengeance, conscience and retribution. He draws sketches of exploitation, both economic and social, and illustrates how communities, even whole societies, can be seen as built on a crass and ruthless assertion of domination for domination's sake. And all of this happens in less than twenty-five pages.Other stories in the set are also of a very high standard. To review them all would reproduce the book, no less, for they are succinct, often surprising, sometimes humorous pieces which together form a supreme achievement."},{"Title":"On the Yankee Station: Stories by William Boyd","review":"A collection of stories about initiation. Killing Lizards is a marvellous story about a young boy shifting from killing lizards, as phallic symbols, to blackmailing his mother to get the love he wants from her, especially since the blackmailing tool shows the father does not control the mother any more.I also loved Hardly Ever, as a frustrated initiation to sex for a teenager. His initiation is purely superficial, unable that he is to go through it, in spite of a real possibility he goes to sleep on (he goes to sleep, with a girl, when that girl is ready for more), but it is always compensated verbally by some bragging about with his school pals.Gifts is even stranger. The young student is unable to get through his initiation and has to satisfy himself with some gifts. Everyone of his conquests presents him with personal or confidential elements. His poverty, caused by some postal strike, makes this experience even funnier, funny-strange, because the poorer he gets, the more private gifts he receives.Boyd is a strange writer about frustrated, and even twisted, initiation for teenagers. Fascinating how they can live on this frustration that becomes their everyday food, or even fodder, the brain being more or less negated.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"On the Yankee Station: Stories by William Boyd","review":"This book was given to me by my college English professor.

This work shows how hatred and murderous pogroms, directed toward the Jews, made it imperative for &quot;Benny&quot; to save his family from this violence. Benny's life is filled with trials and tribulations that highlight his strength, determination and endurance.Short chapters and detailed prose rivet one's attention. As the story &quot;unravels&quot;, the author's foreshadowing adds intrigue and gut-wrenching suspense. The story, although a character work, presents more than enough drama leading to the climactic ending. Very illuminating are the roles of the rabbis who serve as sources of guidance and assistance for Benny. Good versus evil represent an underlying theme.For all who relish being entertained and enlightened, this book is a gem."},{"Title":"The Way of Abu Madyan: The Works of Abu Madyan Shuayb (Islamic Texts Society) (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"The growing interest in the historical and doctrinal aspects of Sufism in the scholarly world continues to yield fruits that make one hopeful of the advent of a new scholarly tradition. The paradigmatic remainings of the classical Orientalist categories are now being put aside and a new emphasis is being placed on the meaning what of a tradition is and what kind of perspectives and methodological tools one should have to understand that tradition. The new trend in question turns its face to more authentic, deeper and vertical aspects of Islamic civilization - a breakthrough that marks off the newly rejuvenated current from the established scholarship. Since it is the intellectual and spiritual schools of Islamic thought that have suffered the most from the reductionist and historicist approaches of modern academia, it is a pleasant coincidence that this newly emerging set of perspectives makes its first appearance in the field of Sufism. Vincent J. Cornell's recent work on the leading North African Sufi Abu Madyan deserves to be placed under this new scholarship. Cornell's successful attempt to bring to daylight one of most prominent figures of North African Sufism is a significant step in mapping out a comprehensive picture of Western Sufism.Cornell's work begins with a lucid account of Abu Madya's life. Based on original sources and the accounts of Abu Madyan himself, the biographical sketch of Abu Madyan presents a vivid description of how a simple and illiterate countryman sat out a journey that was destined to culminate in a fresh flourishing of Sufism in Muslim Spain. Abu Madyan's travel to different parts of Spain and North Africa, and his final settlement in Bijaya carries the common characteristics of North African Sufism. Throughout the socio-political difficulties that Abu Madyan faced because of his outward reaction against the issues of social and political injustice, the Shaykh pursues a life that combines both the ascetic and metaphysical aspects of Sufism. Abu Madyan stands out as the \`yardstick' of spiritual as well as social affairs of his time.In the second part of his introduction, the author provides a comprehensive account of Abu Madyan's spiritual lineage. This part is valuable not only for the crucial aspects of Abu Madyan's life but also for the spiritual map of North Africa until the time of Abu Madyan. In this part, one also finds a concise analysis of the ideas of the \`Junayd of the West' on such cardinal issues as fana' and baqa', futuwwah and ithar, being a faqir, and the manifestation of the Divine names Jamal and Jalal. Abu Madyan's way of life provides some clues about the nature of his \`thought' or mashrab, to be more precise: His is more pietistic and less metaphysical. This aspect of his path can easily be seen in his insistence on taking al-Ghazzali's Ihya' as the central work of his training. The ever present hadith component of North African Sufism makes itself abundantly felt in Abu Madyan's short treatises.The translation part contains the main extant and so far available works of Abu Madyan. These are the Supplication for Forgiveness (al-Istighfar), the Blessed Creed (al-\`Aqida al-Mubaraka), Basic Principles of the Sufi Path (Bidayat al-Murid), the Intimacy of the Recluse and Pastime of the Seeker (Uns al-Wahid wa Nuzhat al-Murid) and the eight qasidas. The three prose works of Abu Madyan edited and translated in the book reveals his mashrab: They explain, in a concise and direct language, the divine unity and the manners of behavior that the spiritual seeker has to follow to grasp deeper meanings of this unity. \`Speculative thoughts', if any, are allowed only if they do any good to the perfection of the soul. Abu Madyan's Uns al-Wahid wa Nuzhat al-Murid, on the other hand, continues the marvelous hikmah tradition of the Sufis. His work is by no means less moving and insightful than Ata'ullah al-Iskandari's Hikam-i Ata'iyyah. Abu Madyan's poetic works included in Cornell's edition presents a salient example of the poetico-mystcical language. Some of the seminal ideas that could not fit in the strait-jacket of the formal language of philosophy or theology are expressed in these verses with an elegant use of language. The symbols, metaphors and allegories bring about a higher world of meaning with the aim of elevating the soul to the higher levels of reality.The last part of the book contains two a ppendixes: The first one is al-Qasida al-Nuniyya by \`Ali ibn Isma'il b. Hirzihim, and the second one is Risala fi al-Tasawwuf by Abu Ya'za Yalannur ibn Maymun ad-Dukali. These two short treatises are important for any study on Abu Madyan because both of the treatises belong to Abu Madyan's spiritual masters. Besides his comprehensive analysis on Abu Madyan and West African Sufism, Cornell also stands out as a highly successful translator. His lucid English rendering does not betray the original Arabic. Cornell's knowledge of Sufi terms and concepts which are, to say the least, elusive to the outsider is certainly an important reason for his successful translation. The full texts of the original works published with a beautiful Arabic style and side by side translation are probably the best gift for all students of Sufism. The Way of Abu Madyan deserves a warm congratulation as a lucid as well as rigorous scholarly work. Our hope is that new works of this kind will follow."},{"Title":"The Way of Abu Madyan: The Works of Abu Madyan Shuayb (Islamic Texts Society) (English and Arabic Edition)","review":"Mr Cornell has made an exellent contribution to the study of both Islam in the West and Islam in Africa with this work as until recently little had been translated with regards to African Islam especially regarding primary sources.Abu Madyan was perhaps one of the most important Sufis in North West Africa and this work covers both an exellent biography of the Sheikh and an introduction to his works. What is also of great benefit is that it is complete with the original Arabic text.An extreamly important work especially in that much of the study of Islam in our current time is under the influence of either Saudi Arabia or groups with political agendas.

It is if the authors plugged in a convincing number and applied it to almost every plate. If you want to read a cute little history of the life and times of 19th century England and America, with some of Germany thrown in to boot, then buy this book. Perhaps it tries to do too much: to be an encyclopedia of the times and a compendium of literally thousands of pieces of ABC ware, a price list, and a picture book.

His aesthetic theory is basically subjective, or &quot;psychological&quot;, and if viewed from a contemporary standpoint, somewhat at odds with current developments in neuroscience, but closer than most schools of Western philosophy. All philosophical theories of aesthetics are interesting to investigate from the standpoint of comparing them to what is said about the human aesthetic faculty in modern research in neuroscience.As in ethics, Santayana approaches aesthetics in three different ways, namely as the exercise of the aesthetic faculty, the history of art, and the psychological. The first two do not concern the author in the book, his attention devoted entirely to the third. His intention is to remove himself from the influence of the poets and of Plato, and find the out how ideals are formed in the mind, how objects may be compared with them, what properties are shared in beautiful things, and the process by which humans become sensitive to beauty and in turn value it. He is after a definition of beauty that explains its origin in human experience, and one that explains the human capacity to be sensible of beauty and the relation between a beautiful object and its ability to excite the human senses.The author takes a different definition of aesthetics, being one that he calls &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;appreciative perception&quot;, and which results from combining a notion of criticism with that of the notion of aesthetics as a theory of perception. Santayana wanted to develop a theory of aesthetics that relies on perceptions as a judgmental, critical notion. Perceptions that are not appreciations are thus to be excluded. An aesthetic theory then deals with the &quot;perception of values&quot;.The author's view of religion is well-known, and his atheism rare for his time. The religious imagination he says, has resulted in creations that rival those of the poets and novelists, so much so, he says, that humans believe the content of these creations to have objective reality. The ideas of these divinities are further enhanced by the realization of their natural power, with the belief in the reality of an ideal personality bringing about its further idealization, eventually spanning many human generations. History and tradition are cast by the imagination of these deities, in which peity resides and is nourished. The author of course does not excuse the God of Christianity from this, but he acknowledges the possibility that the human conceptions of Christ and Mary may in fact have real counterparts (the evidence of this not to be explored in this work).The author states that unless human nature undergoes radical change, the main intellectual and aesthetic value of ideas will come from the creative acts of imagination. If human perceptions are not connected with human pleasures, there would be no need to look at things, no interest in them at all, and no importance would be imputed to them. It is indeed amazing how many ideas, thought to be rational, logical, or abstract, actually fit in with the author's aesthetic worldview. Concepts and results in science and mathematics in particular, after their discovery, are sometimes thought of as having their origin in logic and reason. But it was the keen human imagination that brought them about: a grand interplay of intuition and playfullness. Ugly ideas are not permissible: only the most beautiful survive...and oddly, and most interestingly, it is these that usually seem to work the best, and transcend the context in which they were discovered."},{"Title":"The Sense of Beauty Being the Outline of Aesthetic Theory (Dover Edition)","review":"In this book, Santayana rejects the Platonic conception of beauty is an intrinsic characteristic of a thing, and argues for beauty that exists only in the mind (and senses, hence the title) of the viewer. The pleasure that beauty gives its audience is universal, but what is beautiful is not universal across audiences. That may be old hat to us, but wasn't quite so old hat in his time. Santayana enumerates various types of beauty, and relates each to the pleasure it gives its audience. Santayana even claims that some of our other preferences -- for example, for youth over age -- are fundamentally aesthetic in nature.The argument is Santayanaesque, and thus not exactly rigorous. A lot of the physiology (&quot;Psychology is always physiological,&quot; he writes) is hokey to our &quot;modern&quot; medical minds. Some of the digressions seem to be just him taking the opportunity to say something clever, rather than advancing the main argument in any way.Still, Santayana is a virtuoso of putting together large, complex &quot;big think&quot; arguments, and he writes subtly and beautifully. This book is worth it, even if only to see Santayana doing what he does best: arguing broadly and forcefully, this time for a new conception of aesthetics."},{"Title":"The Not So Little Book of Contemplative Insights: 365 Mystical Insights for Daily Meditation and Contemplation","review":"I keep this book handy at all times.

Safety is the number one priority in the aviation industry. To improve safety levels, attention has traditionally been focused on improving equipment, techniques and regulations. However, safety has not improved much and is getting worse with the increase in traffic. Although there has been attention to human factor considerations with respect to performance of flight crew and air traffic controllers, consideration of human factors issues directed at aircraft maintenance personnel who inspect and repair aircraft, has not received as much attention, even though maintenance related incidents and accidents are a significant proportion of the total. That is why this book is welcome as it focuses on an area that is very critical to the improvement of safety in the aviation industry.Human error continues to plague civil aviation. There has traditionally been a tendency to take a simplistic approach and write off aviation mishaps as being caused by \\"aircrew error\\". It is well established that mishaps cannot be attributed to a single cause, or in most instances, even a single individual. Rather, accidents are the end result of a myriad of latent and active failures, only the last of which are the unsafe acts of the aircrew. It is necessary to identify these active and latent failures in order to understand why the mishap occurred and how it might be prevented from happening again in the future.Active failures are the actions or inactions of operators that are believed to cause the accident. These can arise from \\"pilot error\\", or \\"maintenance error\\", among others, and they are the last \\"unsafe acts\\" committed by aircrew or maintenance personnel, often with immediate and tragic consequences. For example, forgetting to lower the landing gear before touch down will yield relatively immediate, and potentially grave, consequences.In contrast, latent failures are errors committed by individuals within the working areas or elsewhere in the supervisory chain of command that affect the tragic sequence of events characteristic of an accident. For example, letting someone work for say 24 hours without rest, can lead to fatigue and ultimately errors (active failures) in the maintenance department. Viewed from this perspective then, the unsafe acts of aircraft maintenance personnel are the end result of a long chain of causes whose roots originate in other parts (often the upper echelons) of the organization. The problem is that these latent failures may lie dormant or undetected for hours, days, weeks, or longer until one day they bite the unsuspecting aircrew or maintainer.This is an excellent book that is recommended for all aviation maintenance personnel, regulators and aeronautical engineering students."},{"Title":"Introducing Black Theology: Three Crucial Questions for the Evangelical Church","review":"The apostle Paul's task included providing an avenue of intentional discourse between Judaistic Jewish theologians and Christian Jewish theologians.

Who is left behind; who cares for them; what does it look like; what does it smell like; what does it do to a community? Gregory Coco brings the reader as close as one can get to the horrors of war. I searched for a book like this for a long time, and during one trip to Gettysburg I found it. I had the good fortune to meet Mr. Coco a couple of years ago. He is a tremendous historian, an unbelievable storyteller, and a very nice person. He is a seasonal Park Ranger at Gettysburg, and I suggest that anybody who goes out there in the spring or summer find Mr. Coco and tag along on one of his presentations."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"This book isn't about the battle of Gettysburg. It's about the price that was paid for that battle by the men who fought it and the citizens of the town. The aftermath of Gettysburg was a nightmare beyond imagination.After the guns fell silent Coco shows us that there was much to do. Thousands of dead soldiers needed to be buried and tens of thousands of wounded to be treated. How do you do all that? The truth is you can't, at least not very well. In the end many bodies were buried in shallow graves that didn't take long to get uncovered by the elements. Some bodies were simply dumped into the crevasses in Devil's Den. The wounded in many cases were left outside for no other reason than you had over ten times as many wounded as you had population in Gettysburg and there simply wasn't enough room indoors for all the wounded men. Toss in countless horses whose corpses needed to be gathered up and burned and you begin to get the picture. The aftermath of Gettysburg was a gruesome horror story.This book is not for the casual or beginning Civil War reader. There's nothing about infantry charges and military tactics here. Coco doesn't hold back and to be honest the book is rather disturbing. However it tells the story that I don't think any other book does and that's the frank truth about the aftermath of Gettysburg."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"Coco's view on the darker side of Gettysburg is brilliant. He picks up when the shooting stops. His description of what it was like in the days, months and even years after this battle was very interesting. He spares no details and his desciptions of wounded and dead are shocking. He also brings to light the darker side of Adams County civillians in their treatment of wounded soldiers. Although there were many heroic and merciful civillians, Coco brings to light the ones who were not so. This is a great human interest story and sheds a different light on one of the most discussed battles in human history."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"The Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) was the largest ever fought on the American continent and the pivotal battle of our Civil War. Following the battle, with the retreat of Lee's Army and the pursuit by Meade's, there was a pressing need to take care of the dead, wounded, and destroyed that the armies left in their wake. There also was, and remains, a need to reflect upon the significance of the Battle and the lessons to be learned from it.Gregory Coco's book, \\"A Strange and Blighted Land\\" (1995) gives a comprehensive account of the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg. Mr. Coco is a Park Ranger at Gettysburg, and he hasa written extensively and well about the battle. He is also a Vietnam veteran. His history in this book stresses eloquently, the carnage of war, its terrors and pain, and its irreplaceable cost in human life and treasure.The book is arranged in five rather lengthy chapters. In the first chapter, Mr. Coco offers his readers a tour of the Battlefield in which he presents eyewitness accounts of the death and destruction evident over the 25 mile square Battlefield. The second chapter discusses the dead of Gettysburg and their burials. There is excellent historical material here about the establishment of the Gettysburg National Cemetery. In his next chapter, Mr. Coco discusses the Gettysburg wounded, both North and South, the medical and surgical practices of the day, and the camps set up in haste to care for the masses of grievously wounded soldiers. In his fourth chapter, Mr. Coco discusses the treatment of prisoners of war, and the fate of the many stragglers and deserters which followed in the wake of the battle. In his final chapter, Mr. Coco discusses preservation efforts for the Battlefield, culminating in the establishment of the Gettysburg National Military Park in 1895.I have read several other accounts of the aftermath of Gettysburg. Mr. Coco's book is by far the most thorough. He has the factual details at his command and presents them in a convincing manner. He shows great familiarity with the Battle itself, and discusses well the controversies and issues in determining the numbers of the killed, wounded, and missing.But there is much more to this book than a factual recounting of the aftermath of a battle. The book is written in an appealing, personal, sometimes buttonholing style in which Mr. Coco seems to be at the readers side offering observations and commentary on the significance of the events set forth in his story. He offers opinions on a variety of topics emanating from his reflections on Gettysburg and on war. (Specifically, Mr. Coco shows a healthy skepticism in matters of religion.) Mr. Coco focuses on the meaning to be drawn from Gettysburg and from our Civil War. His own perspective is clear. Mr. Coco is opposed to efforts to glorify or romanticize war. Again and again, he stresses the horrors of war and tries to impress upon his readers that the greatest lesson to be learned from Gettysburg is -- to try to prevent such things from happening. Thus his book concludes (p.373)\\"Let us now leave behind the aftermath story with this hope: that for each and every attempt to parade the 'pomp and circumstance' of war, we give equal time to the corrupt and merciless monster shielded smugly within, because, 'if the bugler starts to play, we too must dance.'\\"This book is both an excellent history and a deeply-felt attempt to think about the meaning of Gettysburg."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"This is a very good book, well researched, but the author's incesant anti-war sermonizing gets old fast. A wounded veteran from Vietnam, Coco obviously has a few lingering issues to work out, but he should have done so with his therapist and not in the pages of this book. One wonders why if he is so anti-war he writes about the Civil War at all. Perhaps he feels guilty about his own morbid fascination with the most gruesome aspects of Gettysburg. After a while the reader wishes that the author would get off his soapbox and just report the facts."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"After the shooting stopped at Gettysburg, within a very short time the whole landscape had turned black from the flies spawned in the bodies of the fallen. The earth was soiled and black with grease and filth and the very air was heavy with foulness.This is not a book for the faint-hearted, but it is a superbly well-researched account, drawn from eyewiteness statements and official documents of what happened when nearly 10 000 dead and two or three times that many wounded were left in a quiet farming community by armies that had gone elsewhere.This is essential reading for anybody wishing to know the whole story of Gettysburg. It has many maps and illustrations and photographs not seen elsewhere, and a comprehensive set of notes."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"A fascinating study of a rare Civil War topic! Carefully researched and detailed, a must study for those who tend to glorify a brutal event. One serious detraction is the writer's peculiar use of his study as a stump to blast Christianity, saying that this &quot;particular brand of religious myth had not really taken hold of society.&quot; He goes on to question the origin of the Christian cross and the existence of the soul. Coco needlessly attempts to diminish the important role religious faith played among Civil War soldiers, especially among Confederates. Also, it would have been helpful to have seen some comparative discussion about other Civil War battlefields, especially in the South (where most battles were fought), where the resources to clean up were, in comparison, far lacking. Otherwise it is a must read, and should serve as a model for further writings on the subject."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"A definate contribution to capturing the history of the aftermath of the battle at Gettysburg. The amount of details, statistics and facts along with eye witness accounts make this probably the best book on the subject.

The content written in this book offer a shocking reality to the absolute horrors which occured in Gettysburg in 1863."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"Greg Coco's \\"A Strange and Blighted Land\\" is, as far as I know, a uniquely intimate and yet comprehensive look at the aftermath of Civil War combat. The Battle of Gettysburg left 6000 soldiers dead on the ground (with thousands more to later die of their wounds) and 20,000 seriously wounded. When the two great armies that had fought there marched away, the dead and the wounded remained in and around Gettysburg, creating a horror worthy of an inner circle of Dante's Hell. This is an unflinching look at the days, weeks, and months that followed. I see that a previous, anonymous reviewer at this site complained about the \\"author's incesant anti-war sermonizing.\\" To the contrary, I consider that Coco did little \\"sermonizing\\". Rather, he lets the eyewitnesses speak for themselves, quoting liberally from a vast array of primary sources. The result is a powerful, fact-packed book that is certainly grim, even gruesome, and far removed from the conventional romanticing and glamourization of the very deadly consequences of genuine 19th century warfare. I think that anyone who finds him- or herself thinking back to the supposed glory of Civil War battle where everyone dies heroically and cleanly should read Coco's book as a strong antidote against such a false picture."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"I have to totally concur with the conclusions about Coco's misplaced comments about religion and his belief that Christianity is a \\"myth\\". The book is stunning in the amount of information backed up by countless references and stories told by those who were there and witnessed the scene and I loved that he let the people who lived the aftermath of Gettysburg do the talking. When his comments/opinion about Christianity suddenly (and for no known reason) appeared in the middle of the book, it was difficult to understand why on earth he would feel compelled to share that with the reader ... I really didn't want to read about it nor do I care what his opinion is.Another topic he could have left out was his total trashing of the Dutch/German farmers who didn't behave the way he personally thought they should have when the battle was over. If you had a lovely, quiet, peaceful life and farm and 170,000 soldiers ran over your property, took over your house, killed your animals, burned your fences, ate your food, and left hundreds of dead and dying soldiers and horses all over your land, wouldn't you get a little grouchy too? That topic could have been left completely out of the book -- there was simply no reason for him to trash those poor people who lived through a hell that we can't begin to imagine, even after reading this book.Finally, I have to say I was appalled at his comparisons of how the Southern POW's were treated with care and compassion by the North and the Yankee POW's were treated like hell by the South. According to his information, Rebels died wishing they could live longer to remain in the North because the Yankees were literally \\"killing them with kindness\\". On the other hand, Northerners were starved (or given a small piece of bacon with vermin on it), beaten, made to march 25 miles a day, left for dead on the trail, and treated so abominably they couldn't wait for death to set them free.I doubt it would be difficult to find good things and bad things that occurred on both sides of the line. I imagine there was kindness as well as great cruelty exhibited by Northerners as well as Southerners. We were not left to wonder which side the author was on.Let's face it, the Northern POW camps were every bit as hideous as those of the South (my great grandfather died of pneumonia at Camp Chase in Columbus, OH ... try reading a book about the hellhole).This book was awesome until the author allowed his own viewpoints and opinions to creep in and finally take over the whole story by the end. I would have appreciated it much more if he had simply stated the facts and kept his opinions to himself."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"For anyone interested in the Civil War I highly reccomend this book. There are literally thousands of books on the Civil War but most of them focus on the political or military side. This book focuses on the aftermath of the battle, something that is overlooked by many historians. The reader will get a whole new perspective on the impact the War had on areas where armies clashed. Anyone even remotely interested in the Civil War should pick this book up. For those of you who have weak stomachs, do not read the book after a meal."},{"Title":"A Strange and Blighted Land: Gettysburg, The Aftermath of a Battle","review":"This is a great book spendy but worth it.

Something bad has happened to Nellie, Samantha's poor friend who works as a maid. Nellie's parents died from influenza and now she too is an orphan.When Samantha finds out where Nellie is, she goes to the orphanage. She sees Nellie's house, but when Samantha finds out that Nellie is going west on an orphan train, she hatches a plot. Can Samantha keep her secrets safe from Gertrude, the maid whose eyes never miss a thing?"},{"Title":"Changes for Samantha : A Winter Story (The American Girls Collection: Samantha Stories, Bk. 6)","review":"For those familiar with the delightful American Girls series, ValerieTripp presents Victorian Samantha in 1904, the 5th chronologically in a series featuring 7 different girls (eras in American history and ethnicities). Each young female protagonist stars in 6 books in her own mini series; after a story of 5 chapters (some 60 pages) readers are treated to an easy introduction into the mores and fashions of the day in the final, non-fiction section, A PEEK INTO THE PAST.Set in Victorian NY City CHANGES opens as Samantha is preparing to celebrate Valentine's Day with her loving Uncle Gard and Aunt Cornelia, while her grandmother is honeymooning abroad. Aside from a critical servant, things are just fine for Sam, but be assured that we will meet or hear about various villains and cold-hearted characters, which offset her pleasant existence. Alas, her dear girlfriend from Mount Bedford, poor Nellie, faces personal disaster as the influenza epidemic takes both her parents--leaving the three sisters suddenly orphaned.Samantha is abruptly brought to face the harsh reality of big city callousness toward children of poverty. First, their only relative, a hooligan uncle, robs and deserts them; then they are taken to an orphanage (think \\"work house\\") where they will be trained as future domestics. Manipulated by the heartless directress the sisters are little better off as they are browbeaten into servitude. The only fate worse than this institution for legalized robbery and cruelty is the dreaded Orphan Train, which will mean separation of the sisters forever. How can generous Samantha help these girls from being torn apart?No matter how young, girls want to preserve their human and feminine dignity. Family values surface as the satisfying denouement--however implausible--concludes the series of Victorian adventures. The Peek into the Past provides excellent photographic documentation and a gentleintroduction to future Social Studies or pop cultural history. Excellent fare for grades 4 - 6, this series brings the past alive for today's girls.

This one worked best."},{"Title":"American taste: A celebration of gastronomy coast-to-coast (The Cook's classic library)","review":"\`American Taste' is the first book of culinary writer extraordinare, James Villas, who has served the exposition of American eating by producing cookbooks of Southern cuisine with his mother, major books of great American comfort foods such as casseroles and biscuits, essays on American cuisine such as this work, and a better than average book of memoir essays entitled \`Between Bites'. While not as dominant a figure as either James Beard or Julia Child, he has thereby succeeded at just about every recognized form of culinary writing, especially when you add his food column which ran for decades in \`Town and Country' magazine.By covering so many culinary bases, Villas has created a niche for himself in American culinary writing which is not as scholarly as John Thorne, Jeffrey Steingarten, or Paula Wolfert, less personal than Jim Harrison, better informed and more involved than Alan Richman, but with certainly the strong opinions of Harrison and Richman, with the authority of having worked full time in the field for over thirty years now. For readers just discovering this book, it is important to recognize that the essays were published over 20 years ago and were probably written in the ten (10) years before that. Therefore, they represent something of a time capsule where one can read about the culinary world of almost a generation ago when Julia Child was important but not yet deified, James Beard was the biggest influence in writing about American food, Alice Waters was still getting her bearings at Chez Panisse, Paul Prudhomme had just left Commander's Palace in New Orleans and Emeril Lagasse was still a very minor player indeed. This is also a time just before the iron grip of the culinary police grasped our food conscience and made us fearful of all things tasty due to fats, eggs, or carbs. At least, that is how Villas makes us feel, with his rapture over good French fries, pates, terrines, gumbos, and Brunswick stew.It is no surprise that Villas, a North Carolina Tarheel to his core, largely equates American cooking with Southern cooking. His very first essay deals with that paragon of Southern cuisine, fried chicken. He here claims that no one except a native Southern cook can do true justice to fried chicken and proceeds to give the gospel on how it is done. It is notable that his recipe disagrees on some important points with many other experts on Southern fried chicken I have audited, especially those with such heady credentials as Edna Lewis, James Beard, and \`Cooks Illustrated' magazine. What is interesting however is not the differences, but the similarities. While Villas calls for a marinade in sour milk, acidulated with lemon juice, Lewis and \`Cooks' use buttermilk, which is simply a natural sour milk. Beard also uses mild, but no acid, and all agree on the importance of cutting whole chickens rather than using precut parts and using a cast iron frying pan. I am certain that Villas' recipe will produce primo fried chicken, but I am also certain that his approach is not the ONLY way to achieve Southern fried perfection.Villas takes a similarly strong position when it comes to that quintessentially American technique, barbecue. From many hours in front of the TV watching Al Roker, Bobby Flay, and Steve Raichlen, I know that the centers of the barbecue religion are North Carolina, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City. Needless to say, Villas elevates back country Tarheel techniques to the level of gospel and, in his first essay on the subject, relegates all that stuff they do in Texas to the footnotes of culinary consideration. To be fair, in a later essay, he visits some prime Texas barbecue eateries and recants, allowing that beef can approach the great taste achieved from a well barbecued piece of pork.To also be fair about his regionalism, Villas does give a fair amount of time to non-Southern specialities such as native American cheeses and true caviar, harvested from American bred sturgeon. He is especially fond of the national love and creativity with the lowly sandwich, most especially the hamburger; the bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich; and the glorious club sandwich. In spite of how important the sandwich is to American eating, Villas bemoans how poorly the hamburger is served in so many fast food outlets. If I were to cite one aspect of this book with which to encourage you to buy and read it, it would be for Villas' advice on sandwiches. Like so many of his opinions, I cannot follow him to create an inch and a half-thick burger with close to half a pound of carefully ground meat. I am much fonder of Julia Child's recipe using five ounces and a liberal enhancement from encapsulated saut&eacute;ed shallots. But again, Villas strong opinions are always sound, especially with his advice on how to acquire the best meat for his tasty burger.The very best thing about Villas' essays is the fact that he pokes his discriminating nose into some of the more obscure corners of American gastronomy. I found his essay on Bourbon especially interesting, as he reveals that the rules for distilling and aging Bourbon are about as strict as any French, German, or Italian rules on crafting beer, cheese, and wine. Among other things, it explains why Jack Daniels product is not really Bourbon, but simply a \`sour mash whiskey'.Unlike Bourbon, these essays are Villas without the effects of aging which may have mellowed his writing in his later books. Villas' writing is entertaining for his strong opinions. These opinions may shorten the shelf life of his writing, but I personally find his thoughts as nourishing as more moderate writers such as Thorne, Colwin, and M.F.K. Fisher.Very highly recommended vintage writing on food. Buy it!"},{"Title":"American taste: A celebration of gastronomy coast-to-coast (The Cook's classic library)","review":"such a great read, I love James Villas' books on food, he is indeed an American treasure.....the book arrived in perfect condition, only wish it was available in hardcover, as I tend to be rough on my bindings"},{"Title":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine","review":"The illustrations are beautiful.

The story is quite good despite the writing from David Micheline being fair but the artwork by Alex Maleev is quite good.

Having thoroughly enjoyed the Lonely Planet's photo extravaganza predecessor, \\"The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World\\", I was excited to see that editor Roz Hopkins has chosen to follow up with this subjective ranking of the two hundred cities deemed traveler favorites by Lonely Planet's readers and editors. Smaller, lighter and admittedly less definitive than \\"The Travel Book\\", \\"The Cities Book\\" is just as entertaining - slightly over five pounds of often glorious photographs and thumbnail sketches of the chosen cities.The format is straightforward. Each city has a two-page spread with four defining photos and the following information consistently presented:--Vital Statistics: Quick facts providing the date when the city was born, its elevation, its geographic size and location, its population and its nickname. It's amazing how Paris has set the standard for so many other cities, e.g., Budapest is known as the \\"Paris of Eastern Europe\\" and Beirut the \\"Paris of the Middle East\\".--Anatomy: Description of the geographic layout of the city and how to navigate within.--People: Ethnic breakdown of the denizens.--Typical Native: Profile of what characterizes the city's typical native and what he/she thinks is important.--Defining Experience: A sequential series of personal experiences unique to what the city offers, which can be done fairly easily by a traveler.--Strengths: List of places, events and experiences that identify the best of what the city offers.--Weaknesses: The flip side of what areas of development the city may have, e.g., Tokyo's high cost of living or St. Petersburg's collapsed buildings.--Gold Star: One unique characteristic of the city that approaches the transcendent, e.g., carnival in Venice or the four Unesco World Heritage sights within Kathmandu.--Cityspeak: Top conversation topics of natives.--Starring Role in...: Selected books or films in which the city is prominently featured.--Import: List of things (e.g., sports, foods, types of people, etc.) that have been historically absorbed in the city from other places.--Export: List of personalities icons, famous items of interest or pervasive traditions that have their roots in the city.--Sensory recommendations: See, Eat, Drink, Do, Watch, Buy, After Dark...sound bites about things to do to tantalize your senses in the city.--Urban Myth: A colorful story, usually apocryphal in nature, about the city's history.Obviously not as all-encompassing as \\"The Travel Book\\", which covers all the countries of the world, the list of top 200 cities will clearly elicit arguments as to which ones have been selected, where they rank and most critically, which ones did not make the cut. It hardly reflects the most scientific of methodologies as it is based on a poll taken for three months in early 2005 on the Lonely Planet Web site asking readers to vote for their favorite cities. Votes were also added for Lonely Planet's writers and employees.From my perspective, the selections for the first one-third of the list are inarguable even though the rankings may surprise, e.g., Los Angeles seems low at #49, while Melbourne quite high at #11. The remainder of the list is a colorful hodgepodge with established cities mixed in with quite obscure choices in often remote locations. I think it would have made sense to include some parameters around what constitutes a city versus a town or a village, e.g., at #159, Christiansted in the US Virgin Islands has only 7,800 inhabitants, while Alexandria, Egypt, at #162, has 3.3 million people. Unsurprisingly, the US is the most represented country with 14 cities recognized and yet the omissions are glaring, e.g., Boston, San Diego, Santa Fe, Honolulu, among others. However, debating the choices is a major part of the fun, as well as the type of information that Lonely Planet offers for each city which has been culled mainly from their comprehensive guidebooks.To give you a sampling, the top 25 cities are: (1) Paris; (2) New York; (3) Sydney (4) Barcelona; (5) London; (6) Rome; (7) San Francisco; (8) Bangkok; (9) Cape Town; (10) Istanbul; (11) Melbourne; (12) Hong Kong; (13) Kathmandu; (14) Prague; (15) Vancouver; (16) Buenos Aires; (17) Rio de Janeiro; (18) Berlin; (19) Jerusalem; (20) Montreal; (21) Edinburgh; (22) Venice; (23) Hanoi; (24) Amsterdam; (25) Singapore. Here's a list of the last five to illustrate their relative obscurity: (196) Saint-Denis, Reunion; (197) Granada, Spain (not obscure but the last of five Spanish cities listed); (198) Beira, Mozambique; (199) Madang, Papua New Guinea; (200) Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.There is an interesting series of introductory essays on the past, present and future of urbanization. The photographic quality is generally superb, and you get a true flavor of the cities especially the inhabitants. I think for the more obscure locations, it would have helped to have a greater sense of the cityscapes. A great purchase for global trekkers and armchair travelers alike, this hefty book achieves its primary objective - to showcase the incredible diversity of the world through the urban oases in which most of us live."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"I was looking for a book that had a few great pictures of each city and a bit of commentary. I'm more than willing to overlook the commentary -- how could any 1 page of bullet-point text ever really capture a city? But the commentary is weak -- a bizarre mix of pseudo-hipness and hackneyed stereotypes that may have been apt 20 years ago (if ever).What I found unforgivable are the pictures. The only explanation I can come up with is they let loose an amateur photographer with instructions to be \\"artistic\\". Poor-quality pictures included of Paris: The canvas canopy of a pizzeria, pastries, the underside of the Eiffel tower, a couple kissing in a cafe. Of Rome: The face of a statue, a blurry shot of a street, a slice of a colonnade, 2 men with the city in the background. Lisbon: A tram in a narrow street next to hanging laundry, 3 undistinguished houses, a woman in a window and a crowded beach.I've spent time in many of the cities covered and can't fathom why they chose the photographs included. They don't capture the cities and they are not good stand-alone photos.I was looking forward to an interesting read with some evocative pictures. I don't recognize most of the cities as depicted in the book -- including New York where I live. I strained to identify all but 1 of the pictures (close shot of 2 women in the subway, a blurry shot of 2 cabs, a painting in a gallery at MOMA and the Apollo Theater sign). A little New York nit: how can one of New York's \\"strengths\\" be Dean & DeLuca and a \\"weakness\\" be \\"the coffee\\". One can find any style of really great coffee in NYC -- and Dean & DeLuca has some of it.The book has the feel of an 8th grade social studies textbook. With the odd commentary and bad photos -- completely grim."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"Lonely Planet has done it again. I loved the Travel Book and now they have something similar... but its Cities. I starting flipping through this in a bookstore, was totally mesmerized and had to buy it. There are the usual suspects (Paris, London, New York) and then cities that I've never even heard of. Each page is dedicated to a specific city with beautiful photography and the usual Lonely Planet sass and humor. One of my favorite parts is the first few pages where there is a history of the city and an exploration of its future. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"This book follows Lonely Planet's previous The Travel Book, and is generally similar in format. Unlike The Travel Book, this volume does not purport to be comprehensive. Rather, Lonely Planet has expressly made subjective judgments on which cities merited inclusion. US readers may be slightly surprised to see that cities like Boston, Denver, and San Diego were excluded while Memphis, Tennessee and Austin, Texas were included. Of course, like The Travel Book, the text descriptions of things representative elements of each place are inherently subjective. These comments should not be taken as criticisms. This is an appealing book for some armchair travel and could well motivate some actual travel."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"Initially, I bought this book as a gift for my brother, but once I looked through it, I found it so hard to part with that I ended up buying one for myself too. Although it doesn't quite measure up to the sheer bliss that is Lonely Planet's The Travel Book, this sleek coffee table book is chock full of stunning photography and interesting trivia about 200 cities around the globe. Admittedly, the rankings are subjective (the order is based upon the results of an online survey), but the cities included in the book are very diverse, and one doesn't need to put much stock in the rankings to enjoy vicariously wandering through each city.One thing I couldn't help but notice: since the book is geared toward tourism, it tends to whitewash the horrible conditions existing in some of the cities it describes, leading to rather silly-sounding descriptions such as \\"Strengths: lovely foliage; friendly people; excellent coffee...Weaknesses: rainy weather; expensive golfing; land mines; summary executions; boring food.\\" Also, you can tell things are bad in a given city when it receives a Gold Star for \\"optimism.\\"With the holidays approaching, The Cities Book makes an excellent gift...and you may consider buying one for yourself."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"Interesting book.

I have the Travel Book and was excited to purchase this book also. It is a beautiful coffee table book and many guests flip through it even though they already have before.While I can agree with everyone's comments about the cities that are included. I find it completely ridiculous that people are whining about what cities are included. Its done, that book is published. Yes some great cities are left out, I have been to many of them. But Lonely Planet put together a decent list of cities, I am not sure that anyone would ever agree with the rankings. But the Title is \\"The Cities Book\\", the subtitle even says the best cities in the world, NOT the highest ranked/favorite cities. Its just showing readers a informative/pictorial narrative of A FEW of the world's best cities. You can find amazing cities all over the world.

In my opinion, Han Hoi (23) or Kathmandu (13) may be exotic to the unfamiliar eyes, but I fail to see how they are ranked much higher than Florence (24), Shanghai (48), or Delhi (60).Some cities (no names mentioned) are simply, for the lack of more polite terms, wrecks, and yet they show up on the list in relatively high ranks. When evaluating the \\"goodness\\" of a city, stablity should be a pretty important criterion. But it is understandable how these young adventurous travellers who end up in these places would overlook this factor.Not that I think they should exclude these \\"underdog\\" cities from making it to the list, but for the cities that already have a reputation, there are reasons that reputation is there in the first place. The evaluators should keep that in mind, and not let their passion cloud their judgment, whether be it for the sake of representation, political opinion, or simply to be different.Another peeve of mine about this book, is that much better pictures could be used to represent certain cities. But I suppose sometimes Lonely Planet is at the mercy of the same travellers for footage. This begs the question, would the lack of \\"good\\" pictures indicative of the lack of willing travelers? If so, does it have something to say about the skewness of the Lonely Planet ranking system?"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"Inspires new travel ideas, allows you to reminisce about past travels."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"'People that might live in a city somewhere on Earth'.

One of the listed weaknesses here is \\"bugged hotel rooms\\" and that \\"you can't leave the hotel without a guide\\". These two gems made Lonely Planet's list of best cities in the world, yet great places like Santa Fe, Boston, Victoria (Canada), Bergen (Norway), Menton (France), and Lucca (Italy) were left off the list! My suspicion is that the editors at Lonely Planet wanted to give equal time to a lot of places in the third world, even if the truth is that some of the cities listed there are places most travelers/tourists would never want to go to. It may be politically uncorrect to say so, but I think that it's true.Anyhow, I am so glad that I was able to get this book from the library so that I did not waste any of my hard-earned money on it!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Cities Book (General Pictorial)","review":"Unexpected below par book from Lonely Planet.

I consider myself a well traveled individual, and unless one has personal knowledge of each city to be ranked, they can not provide a valid ranking of any one city as it compares to all the other ranked cities.

It provides a real insider's view, with photos, into many cities. The only problem I have is, why for instance are cities of 10,000 included and cities like Yogjakarta (Indonesia), but not Houston or Dallas ? Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S., and even if the review is bad, that would be interesting (I can write the \\"weaknesses\\" section: \\"heat and humidity in summer that sucks the air from your lungs\\", \\"highways, highways, and more highways\\", \\"Tom De Lay and the religious right\\"; strengths: \\"100,000 new trees planted since 1995\\", \\"100 different cultures\\", \\"Yao Ming\\", etc.). That would have been interesting. Maybe in the next edition...Also, some of the negatives in the book are not really explained. For instance, Amsterdam, states, a negative is \\"the Heineken experience\\", but that is not explained at all. Is the \\"Heineken experience\\" a bad thing ? Do they mean the tour of the brewery, or do they mean that Heineken tends to push out the better beers. There are many entries like that that are really too subjective.

When LP published \\"The Cities Book\\" recently they reversed that trend. Once again the liberal writers have found every possible opportunity to take shameless cheap shots at conservatism not just in the US this time but in just about every country in the world. The pro and cons are great for a 60's gay, pot-smoking, big business protesting, secular, Green peace loving, socialist, tree hugging, anti-Christian, vegan hippy. Of course everyone agrees that meat hardy meals are a big con for restaurants but yet vegan friendly. This is coming from the same book which lists cultural traditions as a pro but traditional dishes (heaven forbid they have meat) are a con. Just tell a third world country, \\"Your thousand year traditions are a pro but as long as they fellow our loony liberalism\\". The writers should just say patriotism is unacceptable for any country to have. Sarajevo lists \\"nationalism\\" as a con. Luxembourg lists a con of \\"conservative attitudes\\". These are not true pros or cons at all but more of the personal disagreements of each city's public opinion .Would it really matter to a the world traveler whether or not we know about Lonely Planet's personal political views? How about listing some pros and cons about it city that are actually relevant towards visiting or living there?The only surprising aspect of the entire book is that Amsterdam is not rated #1. Who would of thought the worldwide Mecca for liberals didn't receive enough praise following the theme in which this book is written. If you don't believe me look at a pro for Amsterdam; \\"Liberal attitudes(world's first homosexual marriage and legal euthanasia). Of course! We all agree that is a tremendous pro for a city to have. Thank god I know Amsterdam legalized euthanasia, that is really going to come in handy when I visit. Although Amsterdam does get a gold star for \\"Liberal attitudes\\", surprisingly it is not #1 for the Lonely Planet publishers. The authors are quite simply too blinded by their own ideology to produce an honest book about the great cities of the world.Would this book be a good educational reference for children? Highly doubt it. The pictures are full of nude sunbathers, topless women painted in \\"body art\\", transvestites, and people drinking at a bar on every other page. Is that really the best photos you can find that would represent a famous city that has so much more to offer?From the laughable pros and cons to the complete butchery of some great cities such as Austin. Out of all the pictures of the great city of Austin all LP could come up with is a picture of \\"where will the chicken poop\\", someone eating chicken, a dog fashion show, and a women getting a tattoo on her thigh.By the end of reading \\"The Cities Book\\" you can move on to \\"Das Kapital\\" next. Read between the lines not so carefully and you will see the anti-capitalism all over the pages. The Havana page shows a man with Hugo Chavez and a shackle and hammer captioned with \\"A cool commie shows off his true colors\\". \\"The Cities Book\\" is a clear attempt to discredit cities who do not share the same liberal ideological views as the publishers and want us readers to have the impression that that city is \\"bad\\" or has many negative aspects because of it.Point overall else is; this book is very laughable from Pros & Cons to the pictures \\"representing\\" each city.

I would definitely buy it again."},{"Title":"Captain Smith and Princess Pocahontas,: An Indian tale","review":"That's the mould of the myth of Pocahontas. Never before the love affair of Pocahontas and John Smith, only platonic, and John Rolfe, quite procreative, had been told, at least as a love affair.The contention that it was collected from the Indians is of course part of the myth. We know better today since Paul Radin has vastly explained a story can only be told by a certified person, in fact a \\"priest\\" if we can use that word, an official and trained person who is keeping the memory of the tribe, a Quiackro (medicine-man, doctor, priest, memory-man, historian, poet eventually, etc, the famous Rsi of old Indo-European and Old Vedic traditions, nothing new there) and what's more this old sacred oral tradition has just been published today and it definitely refuses that hypothesis since Pocahontas is ten and nothing but ten at the time of the first meeting in 1607. At best - or at worst - this story was collected from hear say from some Indians by John Davis during one of his trips in Virginia probably by luring the Indian out wirth the story, or the story out of the Indian, with some money, some life-spirit or some trinkets. The rest is embellishment.The originality of this story is the romantic dimension of this love supposedly experienced by Pocahontas. We can of course wonder why this model was finally produced a century or so after the events, why this tale was concocted at a time when the Indians had disappeared from Virginia as said in full detail page 65-66:\\"No longer does the moon shed her silver light over the wigwams of the Indians sunk in profound repose. No more is the cry of the arrival uttered by the young red warrior approaching the hamlet. No longer are the ebon tresses of the Indian nymph fanned by the evening gale, as she reclines her head upon the bosom, and listens to the vows of her roving lover. The race of Indians have been destroyed by the inroads of the whites. Surveyors with long chains have measured the wilderness, and lawyers contended for the right of possession. Beneath these forests once the favourite seat of freedom, the swarthy slaves groan under the scourges of an imperious taskmaster; and the echoes multiply the strokes of the cleaving axe as he fells the proud tree of the melancholy waste. All alas! is changed. The cry of the hawk only is heard where the mock-bird poured his melody; and no vestige is left behind of a powerful nation, who once unconscious of the existence of another people, dreamt not of invasions from foreign enemies, or inroads from colonists, but believed their strength invincible and their race eternal.\\"Note the allusion to the Blacks slaves so discreetly including in a side remark. The Indians never were slaves. They were just plain exterminated by their own illusions about the world and probably because they did not want to become slaves and they were in the way of the colonists.This end of the tale is the basic justification of the appropriation of the land of Virginia by the whites just because John Rolfe marrying Pocahontas amounted to the Indians legally giving the land to him and all his descendents, all the Whites. The disappearance of the Indians does not have to be explained since the land was thus given by the Indians themselves, so they just vanished like a morning mist.\\"In Virginia [Rolfe] was entitled by the right of his bride to lands of immeasurable extent.\\" (63)The second motivation of the tale is to found this colonization on love, love for John Smith and John Rolfe, love from Pocahontas and her brother Nanquatas. And this is a sign of primitive innocence.\\"The lovely Indian was melted in softness, and with blushing timidity consented to become his wife.\\" (58)This implies the reduction of Argall's abduction of Pocahontas to a good thing in its end even though despicable in its means and method. The end justifies the means.\\"[Argall's] prolific brain was big with stratagem which, however unjustifiable, was likely to prove effectual.\\" (56)And this stratagem is at once shifted to the hateful character of Japazaws who helps capture Pocahontas for a simple copper kettle. And that's the third motivation of this tale: to show the childish, cruel and hateful, meaning full of hate and hence justifying hate against them, psychology of Indians. They are born liars, traitors, childish tricksters and infantile envy-devoured untrustworthy individuals. That's the vision the tale provides us in line wuth what John Smith wrote at length in his various writings.It is true the whites have come to invade and take the country, land and resources that are not theirs from their lawful owners. But the fact that they try to resist, to oppose that spoliation with violence or with wicked planning, in the narrow-minded and greedy vision of the whites, is enough to justify the full and heavily violent and bloody capture of the aforesaid land, resources and country.In other words the colonists, and in 1817 the Americans, are fully justified in their manifest destiny since if the Indians had not resisted, like Pocahontas who supposedly did not, that absence of resistance would have meant giving the land, resources and country. And since they resisted it justified the Anglo-Saxons in taking over in the name of their security. So, they surely were trespassing and indeed had no warrant to do so, except their own decision, will and ambition, not to reduce the three to the simple greed of theirs.Pocahontas was thus colonized by the tale, integrated into the folklore of the Virginians justifying both the takeover of the country and the disappearance of the Indians.The question is then to know how Pocahontas and the Indians can be decolonized from this absolute imperialism. Can she be decolonized now the Indians have disappeared, or mostly disappeared? Can the USA be decolonized without rewriting history in blood?That leads to the simple idea colonization is a twofold phenomenon and the decolonizing process can only be a dual process, a process of re-evaluation, of remembering, of reconciliation and of recommitment to the equality and historical dimension of both cultures and people by both cultures and peoples.Coming to terms with the genocide by acknowledging what those who were eliminated represented and have embedded in the culture and consciousness of those who cleansed the country of its original Indian inhabitants.Obviously that has to start with the positive assessment of the survivors and descendents of this expurgated people. Then the Americans in general, Whites, Blacks or Reds, will be able to find a modus vivendi and a modus operandi that will bring fertilization and fertility to the three cultures that are thus mixed in this vast communal bowl or baptismal fount, even if the baptizing was done in the case of the Reds and the Blacks in blood.

The other fairies tend to avoid her out of embarassment or discomfort, even her sisters. And while her parents are always loving, Fia must find her friends among the little animals. All this changes after she befriends one fairy boy, who later turns out to be the Prince; and after Fia bravely journeys to the Troll's cave to rescue all the other fairies, who have been captured by the Troll so that he might cut off their wings for his collection. Reminiscent of Rudolph the Reindeer, everyone changes their opinion of Fia after her heroism.I read this story to my 4 1/2 year old daughter, and she really liked it. I imagine that this was primarily due to the wonderful, luminous illustrations. Although there are illustrations on every page, there is also a lot of text to go along with it, perhaps more than the patience of many younger kids can handle. The ideal ages would probably be from age 6 through 10."},{"Title":"Fairy Wings: A Story","review":"Little Fia is the youngest fairy in a family of eight sisters; her sisters have lovely wings, she has none. Fia's seven sisters have compassion for her lack of wings, but they disapprove of her earthly behavior and the animals she has befriended, which are a frog, a rat, and a crow. It's time for the May Dance, and the fairies will be showing off their wings in the reflection of Puffers Pond near Troll's Wood. Fia has reconciled to being left out again. While sharing a new creation with rat, Fia runs into a boy fairy named Kip. He invites her to the dance, and she accepts. Will she be brave enough to follow through? Will the May Dance be safe near Troll's Wood where the wing-collecting Troll lives?Fairy Wings is a creatively written, artistically illustrated tale. The story is memorable, and little Fia, delicate in appearance, is valiant in thought and deed. She is a great role model. Fairy Wings is enjoyable for all ages, including adults.

There is adventure and compassion, deceit and intrigue, princes and trolls--it's all there. Fia is a wingless fairy and stands in for all who feel incomplete. In a rare occurance in modern books, her father is her greatest advocate. Her best friends (other fairies shun her, including her seven beautiful sisters)--a frog a rat and a crow--are also considered outcasts. By chance or fate she meets the Fairy Prince without realizing his true identity and he invites her to the Great May Dance. Amidst the ensuing Cinderella story, Fia exhibits great fortitude in saving all the fairies from a troll who--in a great swash of irony--wants the fairies only for their pretty wings. She is aided in this endeavor by her outcast friends and they all gain the respect of the fairies through this act at once compassionate and courageous.

One day while she's playing along the river, a boy fairy finds her and asks her to play. He tore one of his wings and is grounded for the time being. Fia tells him that she can fix his wing and they play together for a while. when Fia returns home that evening her family tells her that the royal family has come and is throwing a ball. Her sisters don't want Fia to come because of her winglessness but her father says that she could attend. The night of the ball her friends frog and rat bring her a chair floating on a lily pad with wings on it and pull her to the centre of the ball. as it turns out the her friend who happens to be the prince sent over the chair to her (and her friends added the wings). He lifts her out of the chair and dances with her, but when he lifted her everyone sees that she doesn't have wings, especially the king and queen and they are outraged and they send her away. Right after this happens however, a troll comes by and captures all of the fairies at the ball in a net and walks off. Fia scrambles around to find help and comes across some woodkins. Normally woodkins don't like fairies because fairies are mean to them, but the like Fia because she doesn't bully them. They do not go with her because they feel that it's bad luck to help a fairy, but one of them tells her a riddle about trolls that will help her. And the riddle goes like this, the old troll's home is a rat like place. his greed is a frog like thing. but when crow wakes, troll hides his face, or gather moss not wing. Fia then goes to save the fairies with only her friends rat, frog, and crow and solves the riddle, turning the troll into stone. Then all the fairies fawn over her and the royal family want her to marry their son.This story is somewhat predictable and almost feels a bit overplayed because of the every popular Cinderella story line, but I do like this story because unlike many stories these days, Fia doesn't gain wings at the end of the story. The fairies just accept her as she is, she doesn't have to change her form to become acceptable, which is where the story deviates from the Cinderella idea. The prince takes time to notice her and like her when she is playing in the mud and being herself, and the rest of the fairies only accept her after she saves them even thought they've treated her so poorly, but no ugly duckling transformation takes place. This is really rare in children's books, and adult books too, and is really discouraging to people with disabilities or differences. There are very few stories saying that you don't need to change your physical state of being to be accepted. She still ends the story getting married, not so great, but it's still really refreshing that she remains wingless."},{"Title":"Fairy Wings: A Story","review":"My 5-year-old daughter and I readFia and the Impfirst and loved that story, though \\"Fairy Wings\\" is in a class of its own. The story is so well-told, filled with characters that are vivid and so real, especially the lead character, Fia. She is an amazing young fairy, filled with compassion and empathy for those who are not of the fairy realm, like the woodland animals (Frog, Crow, Rat) and the jolly woodkins who are looked down upon by the fairies. Fia understands what it's like to be downtrodden, as she herself, though a fairy, lacks wings. Her wingless state mortifies her seven older sisters, especially the spiteful Violet, who constantly belittles her. Yet Fia is loved by her parents, and beloved by the animals and many of the woodkins.In this prequel to \\"Fia and the Imp\\", Fia meets Kip, a young male fairy whom she befriends, not knowing his true identity. When she is invited to the May Dance celebrations presided over by the King and Queen of the Fairies, she discovers some startling truths. When a troll appears and kidnaps the fairies, Fia has to rely on her wit and inner strength to help them.This story is appealing on so many levels - though the illustrations are sparse, they are beautiful and the story is so well-crafted, the world of Fia, the fairies, woodkins and animals come alive for the reader. My daughter was enchanted by this story and so was I. I just wish Lauren Mills had continued the story of Fia and Kip (I believe there are only two books in the series). This is one book worth tracking down!"},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"This is the hardest kind of review to write, I find. The first of the Dudley Pope &quot;Ramage&quot; series is not bad as an adventure-at-sea novel, but it is not great either. It is fun, but not amazingly exciting. Pope is knowledgable, but heavy-handed. So the book rates 3 stars.First some background. I have read the Horatio Hornblower &amp; Aubrey/Maturin series, as well as a couple books by Kent, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, and scattered other bits of nautical lore and adventure. I enjoy the genre as a whole. Thus at a friend's suggestion I picked up &quot;Ramage&quot;.The action in this book can get pretty heavy, but often to the point of strained credulity. As this is a historical novel, I don't really expect to see sections that strike me as &quot;What an AMAZING bit of luck!&quot; every 20-30 pages, but that does happen here. Ramage begins his career (at least as far as the book is concerned) by coming back to consciousness after being knocked about by an explosion. Luckily he has not noticable concussion... He is the only officer left on board his ship. Luckily he can find the captain's secret orders... Luckily they directly involve skills he has... And somehow he is able to convince his heavily battered crew that he is NOT abandoning them by leaving the ship in the ship's boats. This is only the opening sequence, so I am not giving much away here.His adventures take a much more believable turn on land and the pace really picks up; unfortunately things drag later during a courtmartial scene. I want to get involved with the adventures and the excitement, but I keep thinking, &quot;How much blind luck can one fellow have?&quot;Another disappointing aspect of the book revolves around the nautical lore. It is always tricky as to how much to include in a given book and how to present it. Patrick O'Brian was the great master of being able to spoon bits of knowledge of sailing vessels to his audience without making it seem like a long lecture. Unfortunately Pope is much more heavy-handed in his approach. When he wants to explain something about the management of ships, he very obviously places a non-naval person in the scene and then proceeds to have Ramage give a mini-lecture. This is not only clunky in execution, it becomes woefully predictable. The only time this didn't happen, Ramage thought all the steps out in his head, sort of like a Shakespearean soliloquy on naval maneuvers.Ramage himself is a rather nice character, with some little quirks, an interesting background, and rather too much luck. Gianna, his lady love, is a standard head strong young woman who comes to love the hero. Jackson, Ramage's American sidekick, is also rather nice, but a little too Johnny-on-the-spot, as if all he is at times is an extension of Ramage's luck.Pope knows the period very well. He knows the sea, the commanders, the action, and the politics. As this was his freshman effort I have every hope that the later books become less heavy-handed. In the end &quot;Ramage&quot; is not a bad book, but it is not a great book of the genre either."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"Ramage is the first installment in the Hornblower like Ramage series. The jacket cover states that Pope was encouraged to write the series by C.S. Forester and Ramage was published in 1965, just before Forester died. Ramage is about the same age as Hornblower and Pope even pays homage to his mentor by having Ramage recall his midshipman days with Horatio Hornblower.Unlike the first Hornblower installment, Ramage begins with the hero in command. He is unconscious in the middle of a furious sea battle and is roused by the enlisted men to assume command. Can Ramage assume command in a desperate situation, carry out his orders, gain the confidence of his men, overcome the political enemies who destroyed his father and would destroy him, and find the woman of his dreams? Of course he can! Mind you this is the first installment in the series and Ramage's position has plenty of room for subsequent insecurity. However, I have a feeling that whatever ill fortune is thrown Ramage's way, he will find a way to overcome it. What more can one ask of this genre?Pope has a thorough knowledge of sailing which shows in his writing. Unlike O'Brian, he does not bog us down with details. His writing is simple and effective. He also got the message from Forester about the importance of the American market and included a trusty American seaman as Ramage's right hand man. Nicholas Ramage may be a little too perfect and the novel is formulaic but Pope has followed the formula well. I am sure that Forester was pleased."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"This was the first novel I have read by Pope and I throughly enjoyed it. It gets off to a very fast start, which is unusual for a sea novel. It slows down somewhat in the middle but never gets boring and the ending is very suspenseful. Ramage is an interesting and likable character. The book is well-written, for the most part, although there are lines here and there that struck me as a little corny. The tone of the book is mostly serious, but there are a couple of scenes that are pretty funny. One of the things that I particularly liked about this book was the way Pope does not romanticize the Royal Navy. He presents the Royal Navy with all its flaws; such as its tendency to promote incompetent officers from wealthy and influential families while far better officers get stuck in the lower ranks. This book shows the tremendous pressure that Royal Navy officers were under to succeed in their missions, or die trying. Pope compares very favorably with the novels I have read by Alexander Kent and Richard Woodman. In fact, I like him better than Kent. Pope is not nearly as good as Patrick O'Brian, though. Anyway, I am looking forward to the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":".*************************************************Review of the Ramage series of novels:This is first of a series of nine books. All of these are fictional novels based on British Admiralty records of the Napoleonic era. Written in the best tradition of Forester and O'Brien, these books will capture our imagination. And if you haven't read the Hornblower series by Forester, or the Aubrey/Maturin series by O'Brien, try them also. All of these are excellent books that you will treasure and reread. I particularly like these books by Pope. I recommend that you buy them all at once and read them in order. You will be glad you did.If you enjoy reading accurate descriptions of naval maneuvers in the age of sail, or simply a good adventure yarn, Dudley Pope delivers. Pope conveys how the best of the best, handle emergency situations. He portrays these situations with realism and authenticity.Review of this book:In this novel, Ramage awakes after receiving an injury in battle to find himself in command of the rapidly sinking Sibella. The pace is fast and furious as he struggles to complete the Sibella's mission and save his crew. As any Captain who has lost his ship, this book concludes with Ramage facing a daunting courts martial board with the deck stacked against him.*************************************************"},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"This was Pope's first novel (of ultimately nearly 20) about Lord Ramage, a character who seems based [like O'Brien's Lucky Jack Aubrey] somewhat on the real Lord Cochran. It gets off to a hurtling start as Ramage comes to in the midst of total chaos, on a sinking ship littered with dead and wounded, and is told he's in command. He completes the mission his sunk ship was on, to rescue some Italian nobles, and meets the Great Love of his life, the georgeous Gianna. Back at the base, he's court-martialled and it looks grim... but the novel switches from courtroom drama to another rousing naval operation as Ramage rescues the officers and crew of a wrecked British Navy ship. If you entered Age-of-Sail fiction by way of O'Brien, this will be pretty thin gruel, but it is pretty much up to the Forester/Kent/Woodman/ Lambdin mark, and quite enjoyable. I was certainly motivated by reading it to eventually read the other novels in the Ramage series."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"A fine beginning to a series and introduction to a character. This is a well-written book, with some vivid scenes and a good understanding of the title character. This shows signs that the rest of the series could be right up with Kent's &quot;Bolitho&quot;, O'Brian's &quot;Aubrey and Maturin&quot;, and Stuart's &quot;Hazard&quot;."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"A reprint of Pope's novel first published in 1965. The action is concentrated in a very short time period (less than two weeks) in the later part of 1796, just before the British evacuation of Corsica. Ramage escapes from a sinking frigate, aids the escape of Italian refugees from the French, and then deals with the aftermath of his actions. There is a final side action on the coast of Corsica involving the grounded frigate Belette (W.P. Gosset, &quot;the Lost Ships of the Royal Navy, 1793-1900,&quot; lists the frigate Belette as &quot;burned at Ajaccio as unserviceable&quot; on 20 October 1796, along with the frigate Poulette). The action is, perhaps, a little too fast paced. At points, the author gets wrapped up in details of ship handling, but overall it is a good story with a somewhat romantic ending."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"What sets these books apart from the works of Patrick O'brian and C.S. Forrester is the emphasis on the fun and romance of the era. Everything's extravagant and exagerated, from the beauty of the maidens to the ferocity of the action! No boring passages about setting sails and chapters upon chapters of gunnery training. Its just action, action, and more action, by land and sea! Daring rescues, crazy manuvers, with punishment dealt out by Captain Nelson himself."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"I have read a number of Pope's books and have enjoyed them, including the Ramage series. Pope is an historian and his writing is very informed and his portrait of the British navy accurate. If I had any complaint it is that the Ramage books are more of the same Royal Navy fare that we have seen many times. For a more unique series, one that is just as accurate and fast paced, I recomend James L. Nelson's books about the American Navy during the American Revolution. By Force of Arms is the first in the series."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"Enough reviewers have gone on at length to talk about the merits of this book, so I shall be brief.This is a good story. The characters are interesting. The action is plentiful, and well written.Ramage is no Aubrey, nor is he a copy of Bolitho or Hornblower. He is a fine character in his own right.Full marks for Dudley Pope!On to Ramage &amp; The Drumbeat!"},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"I put off reading these books for years but found they are a great, fast read, more like Hornblower than Aubrey series.I think I equated the name Ramage with rampage and figured they were a cheap teen age rip off of the Hornblower books.I was wrong and was happy to find another good series on the life and times in the Royal British Navy at the turn of the 18thcentury.Don't be critical and just enjoy."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"It was while reading Van Reid's funny historical adventures about the gentlemen's club, the Moosepath League, that I was led, by a communication with that author to James L. Nelson's &quot;Revolution at Sea&quot; saga. Even if Mr. Reid hadn't already made me laugh and shout with surprise at his unlikely heroes' exploits, I would be grateful to him for telling me about Mr. Nelson's writing. From the latest in the &quot;RaS&quot; series I began hunting for some more nautical adventures. The first thing I tried was Dewey Lambdin - not too bad. Now I come back after reading the first of Mr. Pope's Ramage novels (Where did he get *that* name?) to say that this guy is another good storyteller. I've said elsewhere that the British nautical hero has probably been done enough, but if you love a sea-story, they are the go to guys, I guess. Mr. Pope does it up pretty well - not quite as good a tale-spinner as Mr. Nelson, nor does he have such an original tale to spin, not quite as roguish as Mr. Lambdin, and certainly not the stylist that Forester was. But all in all, a solid entry in the lists and I will give the second in the series a read soon. It will hold me between Mr. Nelson's and Mr. Reid's next books."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"I picked up this book after reading Pope's excellent &quot;The Black Ship&quot;, a true story of a mutiny in the British navy. If he could write that well about a real event, he must be equally able to create a great fictional story. Unfortunately, Ramage is shallow &amp; cliche-ridden &amp; it was only with difficulty that I managed to finish it.I had two major complaints with this book. First of all, the characters were very one-dimensional &amp; poorly drawn. All of Ramage's enemies are evil cowards; anyone on his side is brave &amp; forthright. Count Pisano is an hysterical backstabbing maniac &amp; the captain in charge of the court martial is described as though he were Death personified. Neither has any redeeming traits at all. Seaman Jackson, on the other hand, is brave, trustworthy, &amp; capable, as are the others in Ramage's camp. Couldn't some of his enemies have even had a few decent human qualities? Couldn't some of Ramage's friends have had a few flaws? Considering that many of the &quot;bad guys&quot; are merely proteges of a different admiral from the one whom Ramage follows, these hysterically drawn villains are bizarre &amp; ridiculous.The second complaint is with the preposterous plotting. One of the most common cliches of historical novels is the presence of a headstrong, domineering, &amp; beautiful young woman whom the hero falls in love with. Naturally, there's one in this book too--an obnoxious &amp; uninteresting character dropped anachronistically into the novel to serve as love interest. Later on there's a big court martial scene--another cliche. Surely Pope knows how courts martial were conducted but he writes the scene as though he were someone who had no knowledge of history at all. People come bursting into the room, precedents are overturned &amp; the feeling is that Pope knows nothing about what he's writing about but is only making it up as he goes along.It is unfair to judge an entire series of books by just the first one--perhaps the later books are much better. But, given the number of books there are to read in the world, &amp; the paucity of time to spend throwing good reading time after bad, it's unlikely that I will ever get to find out."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"This book starts out right in the thick of battle! Plenty of good action here. Pope can tell a great story. The book is an easy read--not so much detail or naval jargon that the reader gets lost. This book reminds me a little of Hornblower, but Ramage, as both a book and character, is a LOT more interesting than Hornblower. Whereas Forester gives us some action and then 90 pages at the whist table, Pope gives us more action. Hornblower spends every moment lamenting his decision to marry Maria; Ramage thinks periodically about his Truelove, but it's quickly back to planning how to get out of the next scrape. Good action, good story, good reading. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"Set in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, this is a novel much like others of that genre--or like Temeraire without dragons. The main character is a plucky young man, thrust into command despite the shame hanging over his family name. There are sea battles and small boats, an alluring foreign noblewoman, political wrangling and desperate missions. It's not really my sort of thing--too much naval jargon and maneuvering without enough wit."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"If you enjoy naval fiction of quality (CS Forester and Patrick O'Brian for example), you are likely to be very disappointed by these books.

I would recommmend this series to anyone."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"For readers wondering where Pope's star is to be found in the firmament of the historical novels dealing with the naval campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars, it lies betwixt Polaris, representing C. S. Forester and Ursa Major's Patrick O'Brien. It is the fate of any writer of historical fiction undertaking this era to be rated among his literary kin. C. S. Forester was a naval historian and his writing reflects his passion for historical accuracy, giving his novels a dignified, scholarly feel. O'Brien writes of relationships, and is unlikely to be surpassed for his portrayal of sailors' feelings and their internal struggles. The voice Dudley Pope shows in this first of eighteen books in the Ramage series is the booming and crashing of violent naval action. For readers fascinated with the handling of fighting ships in hostile action, and by the heroism emerging from that carnage, Pope's Lieutenant Ramage is your man.Pope himself invites the comparison with Forester, by mentioning Ramage's meeting with \\"that fellow, Hornblower.\\" Unaccountably, though, the second reference comprises exactly the same phrase, \\"that fellow, Hornblower.\\" It's most remarkable that his editor failed to notice the repetition. But Pope's repetitiveness doesn't stop there. Several times he refers to the Marchesa di Voltera's \\"raven-black hair.\\" There are also some \\"Tom Swifties,\\" as when a character says something \\"excitedly.\\" Again, blame the editor.But the more fundamental flaw in this book is decidedly Pope's, an insipid story line. Ramage faces a court martial for cowardice in the face of action, which the reader knows to be a false charge, which cannot be proven by the accuser, and which would not in a more historically accurate telling even be subject to military adjudication. Moreover, it is just too much that he has Lord Nelson himself giving the junior lieutenant a dispensation, even interrupting Ramage's court martial to do so. Pope should have waited until he came up with a more compelling plot to launch his series. The action is compelling; the protagonists are compelling; but the weakness of the plot launches the series into a headwind."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"Rather than reviewing this single book, I'll comment on the entire series. Pope's Ramage lacks the edge of O'Brian's Jack Aubrey and evolves less over the course of the series than Forseter's Hornblower. In short, the characterization of Ramage is less mature. Likewise, the writing itself is slightly ponderous at a number of points, with Pope feeling the need to remind the reader of a list of character traits and events in the protagonist's life that the reader of the entire series already has in mind. Pope does, however, give the reader a more robust set of recurring characters to enjoy reading about than dose Forester in his Hornblower series (who really only gives you two significant recurring characters other than Hornblower himself). Also, Pope's Ramage has nobility (both in title and in character) that O'Brian's Aubrey lacks and readers who prefer protagonists with greater moral clarity will find this appealing in Ramage. Pope also has sprinkled throughout the series a number of court martial scenes that are well done and entertaining. The series makes for good reading during vacations, business trips or during your daily train/subway/bus commute. A solid three stars. Suggest O'Brian's Master and Commander series and Forester's Hornblower novels as better over all reads if you enjoy the style of the Ramage books."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"Everything about this story is over-the-top: Ramages' incredible luck and skill (after surrendering his frigate) in boldly carrying out his mission in nothing but an unarmed ship's boat, his loyal and adoring seamen, his disgraced but virtuous Admiral-father-Lord, his mean but laughably incompetent enemies who shoot each other with ball or word, the lovingly described Italian landscape, and not least, diffidently falling in love with the utterly beautiful, noble and powerful damsel whom he rescues. The latter is handled with a romance novel cliche, the man obdurately misunderstanding the woman's intent. Lord Ramage can walk in the best circles or rough it with sailors and peasants; all characters seem fixed in the mold in which Ramage first sees them. Pope goofs when the French-occupied frigate Ramage rescues fails to employ sternchasers against Ramage's approach in its supposed blindspot. Napoleon's soldiers weren't as incompetent handling artillery or holding their ranks as depicted, but then they are enemies too.Dudley Pope has conducted much research, as he reminds us by tacking on occasional dry passages of customs. His narrative is closer to a day by day and even minute by minute story than most. Such detail can become tedious as in the long trips in open boats, or the slow approach to a night shore. Nevertheless, this is an entertainment, a story of extremes, and hugely enjoyable if no more is required. It reminds me more of a pep-book Marryat than Forester (with whose Hornblower Ramage allegedly first shipped out!). I look for lots of &quot;texture,&quot; local color, and sail handling in a nautical story (having finally figured out what most of O'Brian's esoteric lingo means), so I'm going to continue this series before I return to Kent's contemporary Bolitho series."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"If you like the O'Brian series of novels you'll like this one.

As good as some of the Hornblower novels. An enjoyable read -- ."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"If you are a fancier of Nelson-era sea novels then you have probably already read and enjoyed Ramage. If you are not, then I want you to imagine a book similar in spirit to the film Master and Commander or to the television series Hornblower, both of which were also based on books. In particular, if you are a lover of space opera I would encourage you to read this book because though set on the high seas 200 years ago its structure is strikingly familiar.The general idea of this novel is that a junior officer, freshly escaped from the capture of his ship and the death of all senior officers, undertakes to continue the original mission in enemy territory with but a handful of crew. The mission is a rescue party. Along the way he is forced to make decisions that could destroy him, face deadly enemies who are not always wearing a foreign uniform, and deal with a beautiful but influential foreigner.The book's author, Dudley Pope, was in the British merchant navy during World War 2. His writing does reflect some of the opinions of the time in respect to foreigners (non-British). However his writing style is clear, his novel structure linear, and he manages the mix of action with interpersonal drama fairly well. If he has a weakness in his writing then it is that he probably over-does the nautical jargon to the point you feel that you are receiving a bit of a lecture. It does not happen too often, but it does happen.Over the past thirty years I have read this novel three or four times, and I imagine I will read it a few more times before I pass. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure."},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"This is a great book. You should buy it.

If you know what those descriptions mean then you will probably enjoy the book a lot more, and if you don't, just skip those parts (I did), and you will find that there is nothing lacking.

I would counter by saying O'Brien also had a somewhat slow court-martial scene that in no way diminished the overall story. So did Kent. In fact, I would say that, in this genre, a court-martial is obligatory. And in many ways, this court-martial is very different from all the others I have read.A rousing good bit of naval action and entertainment. 1 down, 17 to go!"},{"Title":"Ramage (Chivers Audio Books)","review":"Talk about beginning a story in media res! Nicholas Ramage returns to consciousness on the lower deck of the frigate on which he serves as Third Lieutenant to find that his captain and the two superior lieutenants have been killed by shot from the French 74 that waylaid them a few minutes before. Like it or not, he's now in command -- and half the crew is dead, many of the guns are dismounted, and they're taking water at the rate of a foot every fifteen minutes. The groggy Ramage takes a round turn on himself, however, and manages to get the survivors of the crew away in a boat and out of their fix without being captured. Then he opens the captains orders and finds they were on a mission to rescue some aristocratic Italians who are trying to escape from Bonaparte's invasion of the peninsula -- it's 1796 and they're patrolling off the coast of Tuscany -- and Ramage finds he knows one of them. He's the heir to an earldom and he mostly grew up in Italy after his admiral father left England in disgrace, having been the victim of a highly political trial a decade before. That's the set-up and Pope, who had written several previous books of history about the Napoleonic Wars at sea, does a good job with it. Pope is post-Hornblower but pre-Aubrey, so he didn't have a great deal of competition when he was writing this series, which, unfortunately, was allowed to go out of print for a couple of decades. Ramage is a likeable character, competent and courageous, though somewhat lacking in self-confidence. The love story part of the narrative (you knew there would be one) is couched in Jane-Austen-like terms and is perfectly believable. The book doesn't overreach in terms of plot, focusing instead on the rescue of the refugees and then on the rescue of a crew from a frigate that went aground up the coast -- for the purposes of which Lieut. Ramage gets command of a nice little cutter. In between those two episodes, he has to get through the court martial that is required whenever a ship is lost, even though no decision he was able to make had anything to do with the loss, really. But the vendetta against his father is being visited upon the son, in the way of naval politics, and Ramage comports himself well. Nelson has a part as a supporting player and there's an American coxswain who obviously is destined to become Ramage's sidekick. All in all, it's a good yarn, though not a patch on O'Brian or Forester in terms of quality. I read this book shortly after it first appeared and I had forgotten nearly all the details, but now I'm going to have to try to locate the others in the series."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"Joachim Kohler has made a career out of writing intellectually dishonest, crass books on both Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche, and while I expected more of the same here, this weighty tome actually possesses some merit.As far as reliable biography goes, Kohler's book is more responsible than Gutman's Richard Wagner: The Man, His Mind, and His Music (but, again, that's not saying all that much), and Kohler does present some interesting analysis regarding Wagner's phobias, dreams and obsessions. The problem that arises here, though, is one that plagues all such psycho-biographies; that is Kohler's conclusions are purely subjective & cannot be conclusively proven.Some of the reviewers here have made the remark that this is more of a philosophy book than a biography, and this is entirely correct. If one has little desire to wade through the theorizing of Feuerbach, Schopenhauer, Schelling, Hegel and Kant, then that person would be much better served in reading either Watson's or Millington's bios on Wagner. But if you are interested in seeing the philosophical backbone of Wagner's work, Kohler's book can be stimulating. I think Kohler is correct in discerning Schelling's influence in Wagner's thought, as well as his emphasis on Hegel's ideas on Wagner. Kohler is incorrect, in my opinion, in stating that Schopenhauer's thought had virtually no impact on Wagner. While it's true that Wagner's most \\"Schopenhauerian\\" work, Tristan und Isolde, is just as much in debt to Feuerbach, Schopenhauer's negation of the individual consciousness and the primacy of the Will are indeed pervasive presences in the opera. Wagner's Meistersinger & Parsifal are even more patently Schopenhauerian.Kohler's views on Der Ring are also interesting, but again, those views are entirely subjective, and one can easily argue against them.Having discussed the book's merits, there are also some major flaws. Nietzsche & King Ludwig are both portrayed as hapless victims of Wagner's megalomania, and Liszt is portrayed as an artist whom Wagner shamelessly [...] and blatantly copied. There is no doubt that Nietzsche & Ludwig were both psychologically wounded by Wagner (the man was quite a pill, after all), but neither men were utter victims, and both profited from their association with Wagner, and said as much. In regards to Liszt, Wagner was definitely influenced by him, but by the time of Die Walkure, Wagner had far surpassed his mentor.Kohler addresses Wagner's notorious anti-Semitism, and it must be said, Kohler's murky analysis of Wagner's worst vice is almost as murky as Wagner's anti-Semitism. There are much more responsible (and clearer) examinations of Wagner's ugly hatred in the books The Darker Side of Genius, The Tristan Chord, and Ring of Myths. I recommend reading these first, and then coming back to this book.Finally, we have Cosima. I never liked her, and it's easy to agree with Kohler's assessment of her as a self-righteous, manipulative woman. But I think it's also fair to say that she adored her husband (a quick glance through her diaries will prove that), and Kohler is off the beam in stating that their relationship was based primarily on fear.Anyway, if you have the time and patience, this is a worthy read, but if you aren't inclined to wade through 700 pages of subjective psycho-biography and philosophical meanderings, then I would stick with a more manageable volume. In any event, I'm off to listen to Act II of Tristan."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"Let's begin by saying that this is a very difficult book, dense in style and at times obscure in its arguments. Stewart Spencer deserves high praise for his lucid translation.What this book most emphatically is NOT is a biography. Rather, it is a set of semi-philosophical musings on the themes of Wagner's music dramas. There is NO narrative, and readers ignorant of the track of Wagner's career will be lost. Koehler is hung-up on Wagner's relation with his step-father and his sisters. Moreover, in this account Cosima is an ogre fresh from the pages of the Brothers Grimm at their nastiest. Koehler's Wagner is glad to die at age 69 just to get away from her. This Wagner is also a Freudian's wet dream, with speculations that range from the interesting to the absurd.It is NOT a good first--or even second--book on Wagner. For biography try Ronald Taylor; for philosophy read Bryan Magee's exceptionally fine \\"Wagner and Philosophy\\" (American title: \\"The Tristan Chord\\").What this book IS is that it's much better than some of the crap Koehler has previously published. (For a book-length pathology of \\"post hoc ergo propter hoc\\" give his \\"Wagner's Hitler\\" a perusal. His logical fallacies will have you rolling with laughter out of your chair.) I am glad I read this book, difficult as it was. I learned a lot--or at least was exposed to some thought-provoking ideas.In sum, I'd recommend this book only to die-hard Wagnerians fairly well steeped in the literature already."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"Joachim Koehler, at his best, writes well. So well, that it's a pity his book is marred by a NATIONAL ENQUIRER type of prurience, by wild unconvincing generalizations, and by an almost complete absence of interest in Wagner's actual music - which is, after all, the reason why Wagner matters today.Having discussed the present volume's virtues and failings at 2,000-word length in the February 14, 2005 AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE, I shall simply say here: this should've been the one-volume Wagner biography that all Wagnerians were longing for, but it isn't. Best to stick with the Wagnerological surveys of Bryan Magee, Rudolph Sabor, Deryck Cooke, and (more recently) Milton Bremer for greater insight than Koehler offers. The really hard-core Wagnerian will also want, within handy reach, Ernest Newman's four-volume account."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"There are some worthwhile parts in the book. His analysis of Schopenhauer's place in Wagner's philosophy and art is quite interesting. He also lays out some of Wagner's thoughts on Germany and Judaism. Here is a brief summary: The heroic race of Aryans had grown weak and the 'demons of egosim' crucified Christ and bent his message with the 'terrors of Jehovah'. They also took control of money and power. If the Aryans did not want to perish, and that's what those of the 'Mosaic faith' desired, then 'consequences would have to be drawn'. What were the consequences? Wagner describes it as his 'ultimate insight', 'Only when the demon who gathers around him these maniacs in the madness of their partisan struggle is no longer able to find a where or when to lurk among us will there then no longer be any Jews.\\" And Wagner described this as his 'great solution' to the Jewish problem. This sent chills down my spine knowing how important Wagner was to Hitler. Did Hitler's final solution originate with Wagner's solution? We'll never know for sure, but it sure is creepy. Wagner goes on to exhort Germans to cast aside modesty and conscience when attacking their fellow humans (Jews) because they are 'demons'. Again, knowing how Hitler consciously disposed of his conscience and feelings of empathy when he gave the order for genocide, it made me wonder if Wagner's exhortations were partly to blame.But there are parts of the book that were not very satisfying. When it comes to biographies I like very clear and logical conclusions. I don't want a fanciful near fiction account, nor do I want fantastical extrapolations. And about half of this book is just that. I want reasoned conclusions with footnotes and quotes. Here is an example: \\"But she was Wagner's blank sheet of paper. And soon this sheet contained familiar features, for Mathilde, formerly known as Agnes, resembled Wagner's lost lover Jessie in every way and hence was the archetype of the heroic sister. Like Rosalie and Jessie, Mathilde played Beethoven and may have sung his songs. Above all, she yearned for the brotherly genius who would fly to her side and free her. For art alone could make her loveless life endurable.\\" Sure it's poetic, but its not very convincing.Also his readings of the operas themselves are painful to read. It reminded me why I dislike critical theory so much. Here is an example from his 100 page explanation Der Ring, this part is about Siegfried: \\"Although the lovers [Brunhilde and Siegfried] have created the new God-man through their union, they do not understand what this means. Their self-awareness has experienced the self in the union of 'I' and 'you' but does not know the history that has led to this point. Yet they need to experience this history before they can reconcile it within themselves. And experience always means experience of the other--that is the splitting and tearing apart of the self. History that is experienced is the history of suffering. It was not his knowledge that made Jesus the Son of God but his passion.\\" I have yet to read an analysis of the meaning of the ring that doesn't devolve into mumbo-jumbo.Anyway, in between the fantastical leaps of logic and interminable operatic analysis is some interesting and well documented material. I just wish the signal to noise ratio was better."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"I have read a couple of other biographies on Wagner and this on is by far the most complete and detailed account of his life and works. Be prepared to slug through some dense writing but its all worth the effort. If you are new to Wagner this book might be more than you can handle. However be warned that whatever you read in the other biographies won't be as accurate as Wagner and his wife Cosima did a amazing job of recasting the details of his life to suit their idealized image of his life and legacy."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"I found the German idealistic readings of the Ring insufferably pompous. They left me with a feeling of utter disgust both with Wagner's mistake at having gotten involved with the whole thing in the first place and with Kohler, for taking it's philosophical pretensions so seriously, with nary a single intelligent comment re the MUSIC. HOWEVER, the devastating critique of the oft-mentioned (not least by W) Wagner/Schopenhauer connection, and the much-deserved and well-documented trashing of Cosima make the book very worthwhile in spite of the aforementioned."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: The Last of the Titans","review":"Richard Wagner is the type of guy you would not want yourdaughter to date!

He takes us from Louisiana to San Francisco to Alaska to Russia and back to Alaska in a relatively short book. In doing all this traveling with his character, Jean Labarge, we do not get the typical Louis L'Amour descriptions. We do not get a good description of Sitka, Alaska or its inhabitants. We do not even get a good adventure. When Labarge's warehouse with his very valuable wheat is set ablaze by the bad guys, he does not even go after them. Instead, he sends his ship to Alaska on schedule while he heads overland, on a miraculously fast journey, to Oregon where a sufficient quantity of wheat just happens to be available.

The hero, Jean LaBarge, begins life as a trapper and sailor. He eventually acquires the means to purchase a boat of his own which he uses to sail between Alaska and the West Coast trading grain and manufactured goods for pelts, gold, and other products. Only problem is that Alaska is owned by the Russians and some of them aren't real happy about Jean's cutting into their business. Throw in a beautiful Russian princess, a trip to Moscow to visit the czar, an evil Russian functionary, a few fist fights, and good history lesson about the US acquisition of Russia, and you have another fine L'Amour tale.This is a fine, if typical, L'Amour tale. Nothing particularly profound, but a light, entertaining read for anyone who likes Westerns. There is a fair bit of geo-politics and historical characters and events throughout the story - usually these tales are a bit smaller in scope.

Perhaps that is the reason I found this book to be one of his weaker efforts. Many times when I read a book by this author, I have trouble putting it down because it is enjoyable. This time I found myself in a hurry to get finished. I thought the plot really struggled. He failed to give enough details of that time period. The crossing of Russia in order to deliver Helena to the Tsar needed more effort. Of course he was writing about a time and a place which would be difficult to give accurate details.

Sure, it's meant to be larger than life and a page-turner, but the values probably left a more abiding impression for me than the ride. Nothing really surprising I suppose: an American hero can fight better than anyone else, turn pretty girls' heads, and make lots of money - there is seen to be great virtue in being able to amass wealth: poverty is in a real sense disreputable.I've only read a couple of L'amours that I recall, and both pick up on the closeness of Alaska to Russia. Our hearts are meant to surge with nationalistic pride at the visionaries who aim to win Alaska for America. One odd variation in the story is that the standard babe heroine (who is partly won by what would now be mere sexual harassment) is married to a respectable older gent, so our love interests must curb their passions until he has the grace to die.Borderline - it's not terrible, but there's better average books around.

On the other hand, if you're like me, you really have no choice, this is just something you have to do. I started my first one while in college. I had no idea of the problems that I would face, and sure enough it failed within a few months.My second business lasted a little longer, my third for about ten years. Then it got cought in a classic inventory squeeze and boom it was gone too. When your business fails, you have to go to work for someone else. Hopefully you have learned something from the failure, and the next one works better. My current little business has paid me a living for some years, shows no signs of failing and is a hell of a lot more fun than having a boss.Why do I say all this, it's because if I had known what was printed in this book when I was first getting started I could have done a lot of things differently, a lot of things better, and understood a lot more about what I was doing in general.This book is basically a full course in running a small business. It's better than what you'd get in college (I know I have an MBA.) because colleges teach you how to be mid-level management in large companies and in a small business all the rules are really different.This is a wonderful book. Open it to just about any page and you'll find something that will help you. Note especially the opening paragraph, with everything you have here, you'll still need some good old-fashioned luck.

Well, he does, but only for Superman and Batman for the most part. Not that other DC Comics don't rate a mention; even Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis get a bit. The problem with the book, which isn't bad by any means, is that it is broken into two-page sections, with no topic allowed to go beyond that. Therefore, there are copious two-page spreads about Superman and Batman, and other characters are likely to get one. One of those two gets a spread every five or so.I grew up a Marvel zombie, but because of Daniels's choices, I learned more about the Marvel Universe from Sanderson than I learned from Daniels about the DC Universe, and I expected it to be the other way around. This is not to say Daniels doesn't have valuable information. His material about the founding of DC and much of the Golden Age material is going to be largely new for younger DC readers, who grew up with Action #1 as the most valuable comicbook of all time. I doubt too many people knew about the Golden Age Red Tornado, a hefty homemaker turned superhero who was something like a female predecessor to Marvel's Forbush Man, or certainly dressed that way, and played for comedy. Oddly, aside from showing a two-page spread depicting the Super Powers action figures of the eighties, the better known Silver Age Red Tornado is never mentioned. While Red Tornado is a second-stringer, he's hardly a minor figure in the DC Universe. There is comparatively little on Vertigo, despite its significance, and it perhaps goes into excess on film versions of the DC characters (the only place Congo Bill is mentioned, despite his recent Vertigo treatment). Other characters rating only a few paragraphs or even a mere sentence include Green Arrow, Mister Miracle, Shade the Changing Man, Animal Man, The Spectre, Deadman, The Demon, The Phantom Stranger, The Creeper, Firestorm, even Aquman! Very little about Brainiac; nothing on The Scarecrow or Mr. Freeze, either. Too little on The Flash and Hawkman. Oddly, even though it notes the Super Powers action figures were designed by Jack Kirby, it doesn't mention whther the Super Powers comicbook series he was deeply involved in in the 1980s was really a toy tie-in or really had to do with the Fourth World (though the two page spread on it said it was never completed, it still made no mention of Super Powers other than the action figures).Perhaps because DC had to restructure its continuity so many times and say certain stories never happened, or were at least part of an eradicated timeline (they happened, but the world itself was revised through a crossover paradox, negating that they happend) that Daniels took this treatment. Perhaps he was trying to be more commericial. But two page spreads on Superman food products, Batman food products, ephemera for each, is a little excessive considering what was chosen to be left out, even if these two ARE more commercial.At this time, I don't know that there is a better alternative to this book regarding the DC Universe. None of what is here is bad, but some of the choices leave a lot to be desired. Great coffee table book for the DC fan, but one is unlikely to learn much about the characters of the past 30-40 years that isn't going to be well known to them."},{"Title":"DC Comics : Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes","review":"A little mouse whispered into my ear that this book was what my grandson wanted .

All of the company's major titles and their respective print and filmed versions are featured here, from the &quot;Batman&quot; serials of the 40's to the update 90's television series &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.&quot; For anyone with a passing interest in comics as an entertainment and art form, this is a lavishly illustrated and comprehensive work. In sequential order, we get the full history of DC from its humble beginnings to its status as one of the premier companies in its field. Marvel may have overtaken it in the 60's with its more &quot;adult&quot; characters, DC still reigns as the originator of the comic book and the book supremely showcases that status."},{"Title":"DC Comics : Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes","review":"This book is great, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

From the begining of the begin. Everything before Superman creation and beyond. It is a very nice reference book for those who love comics and mass media."},{"Title":"DC Comics : Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes","review":"What is the link between Dante and DC ? Many of you are going to laugh about that question. Although DC is responsible of creating and evolve a universe for the last 65 years. A universe of Gods Humans and Super humans. A universe full of hope, full of despair. DC creates entities that keep us company for many years and they became parts of our life. And this is not only an American thing. This is a Universal phenomenon. Here in Greece that impact is even greater since Greece is the birthplace of Tragedy (hopes and despair). And Tragedy was given by gods using Pandora's Box. That is Divine. And why Comedy? Do not forget the etymological meaning of \\"Comic\\". Its always Comedy. That is the reason for buying this book, to learn (or to remember) about that beautiful universe that make every one of us a little more humans that make us Super Humans."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Some of you might have thought, &quot;What an old booklet it is! &quot; when you saw the publishing year of this piece. Well, I must admit that I thought it's rather thin in size. Nevertheless, the message was strong enough: to love one another, as I have loved you, so that the world may know that the Father has sent me, and they will see that you are truly followers of mine. The message has a very clear structure and the author pointes out the aspects that I seldom thought of when I read the New Testament. By the way, he &quot;speaks&quot;, rather than &quot;writes&quot; the book."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Schaeffer's tiny booklet is a must for anyone who calls themselves a Christian. In it, Schaeffer shows that Christianity is not simply about right answers or intellectual belief, but about a deep, heart-felt love. We may be able to share a perfect gospel presentation and logically and concisely answer all objections, but as Schaeffer says, our &quot;final apologetic&quot; is that the world sees us love each other. Christians can do infinitely more harm with all our bickering and in-fighting that we could ever do good with mere words."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"The same problems plagued Francis Schaeffer in 1970 that continue to plague Christianity today. This little book is a mini-exegesis of John 13:33-35. The question being, even in our differences, can a world of non-believers see Christ's love in our dealings, one with another? If you've never read Francis Schaeffer this is a great introduction. If you've already read Schaeffer, then this is a great addition. In either case, 'The Mark of the Christian' is must read material!"},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"What is it that sets the Christian apart from the unbeliever - it is faith, or devotion, or piety? Schaeffer explores this question in light of the fact that today it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between professing followers of Christ and anyone else. Schaeffer believes that this is a unique quality of the Christian life that should be present in their lives that would not only clearly demonstrate their relationship with the Lord, but would also transform those around them in the process - that quality is love.An incredibly short book, less than 40 pages long, The Mark of a Christian is a powerful and poignant book for every Christian today. In the era when denominational struggles reign and Christianity is presented to mainstream audiences highlighting the most extreme antics of gay-bashing and anti-abortion demonstrations where young women are labeled as murderers, it's not difficult to see why the world views all religious people as \\"fanatical\\" and \\"extremists.\\" Some radicals are \\"called by God\\" to fly planes into tall buildings, others cut the arms off their infant children. The world is left wondering what kind of God these people worship. Schaeffer agrees with them.True Christianity, Schaeffer argues, is marked by this one great principle - love. Love for God is demonstrated by a love for His greatest creation: man. Which means that one fundamental principle of the Christian walk is truly loving one another. While this may sound simple, Schaeffer explains that this is the greatest contradiction to the self-centered human nature of the unredeemed and when faced with the concept of a sacrificial love for another, the world will be turned upside down!We all know those self-professed followers of Christ who we definitely wouldn't describe as embodying the quality of love - this short and powerful book is for them; and for all Christians as a reminder that what the world needs more is love, sweet love...it truly is the only thing that's worth living (and dying) for."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Francis Schaeffer defends the simple notion that a Christian must be known by their love in this short and meaningful book. Astounding in its simplicity but deep in its implications."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"This is an important little book by Schaeffer. Of course, we know that we should love our neighbor and love our brother but Schaeffer outlines the consequences of of failing to show that love, specifically love for the bretheren. He argues convincingly that the world is in scripture granted the right to doubt our salvation if we do not love fellow Christians. He further argues that it is this love that shows the unity of the Church to the world and if we fail to show that unity the world will not believe that the Father sent the Son. This Love is what Schaeffer calls the final apologetic. We must have the answers for peoples honest questions but without openly demonstrated love the world will not care.It should also be pointed out that Schaeffer does not argue for a Love which accomodates on issues of Holiness. We must both balace the Love of God and the Holiness of God. We must rely on the Spirit to empower us to maintain this balance. But, we need to realize that a failure to demonstrate either side shows the world a diminished God."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Spoiler alert = the mark of the Christian is love.This simple book is an argument for Christians to adorn themselves with love. Not just for outsiders; but for each other. Not just for each other, but for outsiders (those who don't know God) too. He claims that this balanced love-giving is not automatic; and takes discipline to maintain.Our love, as Christians, is supposed to show the world something about God. And our love should be according to, or similar to, the love Christ has for us. \\"According to the Scripture and the teaching of Christ, the love that is shown is to be exceedingly strong. It is not just something you mention in words once in a while.\\" (p.21)Visible love includes apologizing and giving forgiveness. Also, we must have a deep unity according to John 17 - not merely a shallow organizational unity.He gets into church discipline and true disagreement; but maintains that this is not unloving - quite the opposite! it is not true love to merely tolerate each other and watch as we each destroy ourselves.Schaeffer rebukes churches for acting snobby and rejecting toward fellow believing churches. He mentions that the non-Christian world doesn't understand all of the little theological differences, and that we would have a better witness to them if we could focus on the good things in other churches that can be agreed upon. As Believers, we don't need to rely on fakery or shallow love - we literally do have a unifying factor between ourselves and other Christians = God's Spirit. So, when we preserve the unity He gives us, we are allowing His Spirit to show something to the world about God.He concludes: \\"In short, we are to practice and exhibit the holiness of God and the love of God, for without this we grieve the Holy Spirit. Love - and the unity it attests to - is the mark Christ gave Christians to wear before the world. Only with this mark may the world know that Christians are indeed Christians (Jn.13:34-35) and that Jesus was sent by the Father (Jn.17).\\""},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"This book clearly and succinctly (the book's only 38 pages) spells out the duty that a Christian has. Both to other believers and to the world at large. Schaeffer always bases his theories heavily on Scripture and this book is no exception.This book is a must-read for Schaeffer enthusiasts and Believers who are searching for a way to reconcile their inward faith with the outward world."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"More than a global condemnation or a decrying of denominational distinctives, the Mark of a Christian is an honest view of how Christ has given the world the \\"right to judge Christians,\\" by the merit of their love for each other. Schaeffer doesn't set up love for the brethren as penultimate, but he takes seriously the fact that Jesus stated that the second greatest commandment as, \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"This was a very convicting work for me. It's too easy to live life in thinking that \\"love\\" is just as well as getting along with other people. Schaeffer gets to the point that loving our neighbors is more than we are capable of - something that only Christ can bring alive through the muck of our souls.Schaeffer was very aware of the human condition. He doesn't set up unrealistic expectations before us. He has taken truth and set it before us to say, \\"This is what the Lord has said, how do you measure?\\" This is a very stern work for such a grace-centered man. I would recommend reading True Spirituality in addition to Mark of a Christian in understanding that our lives in Christ are much less centered upon what we do and don't do and so much more imperative upon the object of our faith. Therein, He bears fruit through trees that should be tossed into eternal flame."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"I believe I paid under a dollar for this book. It is only 35 pages long. Though cheap and short, it addresses the love we should have for one another in John 13 in the most comprehensive and intelligible way I have ever seen. Francis minces no words.He boldly addresses our need to weigh if those who claim to be in the faith truly are. One who is a false brother or a \\"Christian\\" by religious affiliation only cannot receive the Spirit love that we are endowed to give one another. The love between true Christians is a unique gift that we are only able to give and receive because the Spirit within us enables us to do so. If we are in Christ and refuse to give this love to a fellow believer, the world has every right to judge us as not being in Christ. To not love is to refuse His mark.John 17:21 tells us that we should be one as Christ and the Father are one. To refuse to be unified as one tells the world a deep message according to this verse. It tells the watching world that the Father did not send the Son. Schaeffer again addresses the ideas of false unity that are propagated throughout the church. Beware of being unified in anything but Christ.\\"It is not a mushy, gooey, romantic love, but one that is practical and that a watching (sinful) world can see.\\""},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"All men have value because they were created in the image of God. Not only are we to love God but to love our neighbor as we do ourselves. This is what sets the Christian apart from the rest of the world. Though this does not mean that we are all equal. And with our fellow Christians it is out of love that we must show where they have gone astray. Schaeffer expands upon these basic, foundational commands.How can we expect the world to listen if we don't show this love and have the honest answers.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"I first read this book as a young Christian and now am impressed with how many of the concepts I have adopted in my own creed. I detest pop Christian symbols and the urge to define a Christian by market forces. Schaeffer attempts to challenge the reader into not only glimpsing in the mirror, but to really make changes accordingly."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"How can a person prove they are a Christian, that their faith is real? This is Schaeffer's question. He seeks Christ's answer and finds it: \\"They shall know that you are my followers by the love that you have for one another.\\" So the defining characteristic of a believer is that they exhibit love toward other believers. Sounds simple enough but it is, alas, terribly hard to live out in real life. In this brief tome, Schaeffer economically explores the mandatory nature of this quality (\\"As I have loved you, you must love one another\\" is pretty imperative), how its neglect dooms the church to skeptical reception at best, and examines how one can cultivate such love for fellow Christians. A very important read from one of the 20th century's most important Christian minds."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Enjoyed the ease and readability of the book. Schaeffer helps you to see what is really important in the life of a Christian."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"A great challenge to get back to timeless basics.

Namely: the world has the right to judge Christians based on whether or not they love. You will have to read the book to understand everything Schaeffer uses to reach that conclusion, but I doubt you will be able to argue once you do. Schaeffer explains how love is the not just an element which distinguishes Christians from nonChristians. You will be challenged to re-visit your own heart and determine the truth of John's words \\"If a man does not love his brother, the Truth [Christ] is not in him.\\"You can read this book in an hour or two, but its thoughts will travel with you for weeks and its impact for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"I had originally read Mark of a Christian in 1974.

For more info see [...] and use Schaeffer as the search phrase."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"The Mark of the Christian was written almost 40 years ago and has less than 40 pages. Despite the thinness of his book, Pastor Schaeffer presents a critical message that many people who profess to be Christians need to hear. As stated in John 13:33-35, love must be the distinguishing mark of all Christians. He who fails to love has not been truly changed by the gospel message."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"For the individual more interested in Christian living than philosophical arguments this is the Schaeffer book for you. This book is very short, I finished in two nights of easy reading. It is basically expanding his thoughts on John 13:34-35\\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\\"I think his main point is that God has given the world a litmus test for whether Christianity is the truth and whether we are truly followers of him. If the world can OBSERVE that we love one another they will know, if not, then they have the right to judge us accordingly. How we deal with conflict within ourselves is the true test. Loving each other through harmony is easy, loving each other when there are disagreements is much harder.This is an oversimplification of his work, and reading this short book is well worth the effort. Light and short reading with maximum impact."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Though may easily be overlooked as something Christians are and should be familiar with, I still take Dr. Schaeffer's encouragement seriously to love like Jesus loves according to what he commands his disciples at the Last Supper; both those \\"in the household of faith\\" and those who are outside, that the world may know that Christians are Christ's indeed. I can not agree more that cold, uncaring, indifferent, unloving, narcissistic Christianity; something that I'm liable to as well; is not only an oxymoron, but also ugly, as Dr. Schaeffer puts it. On a similar subject, pursuing Christian unity; what it is and what it is not; is something that he claims as the other mark of a Christian, and though intuitively is natural when there is a genuine love to one another, but is still worth studying in this little yet practical book."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"Schaeffer writes a book here that is challenging and very needed. He simply takes two statements of Jesus on how we should love one another and strive for peace and unity instead of discord and pride, and demonstrates the crucial need to follow these verses. A Christian is supposed to be a bearer of love and peace to every other human being (Christian or not; you can promote peace and show love without sacrificing truth). This book along with his \\"True Spirituality\\" are both on the top of my list of messages that have made the most impact on me. All of Schaeffer's work is good but this book is one of my favorites. I second the motion that this is a must read for any Christian."},{"Title":"The Mark of the Christian","review":"As with most of Francis Schaffer's books... though written in the 1970's it seems like it was written yesterday. A short but powerful book looking at John 13 & 17 and what he calls is the \\"Final Apologetic\\". He basically asks \\"How will they know we are Christians?\\" And expounds on that. A highly reflective book. A book we need today. A Must Read."},{"Title":"The division of labor in society (Free Press paperback)","review":"Durkheim is sometimes characterized as \\"the sociologist of constraint,\\" meaning that, as he saw it, an unregulated life is devoid of meaning and a source of misery. In a very limited way, one might argue that Durkheim, in contrast to Marx, held that man does have a rudimentary nature, at least in terms of social and cultural needs. People need norms, standards, and social ties to provide them with direction, purpose, knowledge of realistic limits, and a sense of belonging. This is one reason for Durkheim's life-long interest in religion as a social phenomenon. His emphasis on constraint and stability also helps explain why he is commonly regarded as a conservative.Durkheim was less optimistic than Marx with regard to prospects for the variegated development of human potential. While Marx envisioned opportunities for people to develop a broad range of talents in a self-actualizing way, Durkheim was more cautious. His emphasis on an evermore complex division of labor characterized by increasingly narrow specialization held his expectations in check.At the same time, however, Durkheim was convinced that a more complex division of labor and the organic solidarity it occasioned enabled individuals to become more independent and self-determining. As with Marx, however, Durkheim was aware that increasing specialization did not serve all interests equally well.While Durkheim and Marx have more in common than is typically acknowledged, Durkheim did not view the antagonistic character of the capital-labor relationship as inevitable or basic to the structure of capitalist society. In Durkheim's judgment, increasing social and cultural complexity, along with the rise of modern industry and an attendant ethos of reciprocity and complementarity, were more important than the emergence of mature capitalism and the capital-labor dichotomy.In my view, Durkhiem was wrong. Nevertheless, his struggle to find a basis for social solidarity for modern industrial society prompted him to develop the powerful concepts anomie (or cultural de-regulation) and egoism (or social deracination). These, in turn, led to his brilliant work on the social sources of suicide. Perhaps it's a mark of genius that failures lead to new discoveries which give important areas of intellectual endeavor an entirely new and unexpected conceptual direction."},{"Title":"The division of labor in society (Free Press paperback)","review":"A unique thesis: the division of labor is morally cohesive, and inheritance of capital is the flaw of capitalism.

Many of my books wouldn't survive my travels and annotations as well as this one has."},{"Title":"The division of labor in society (Free Press paperback)","review":"Durkheim's book must not be a big seller. This would explain why a new, better translation hasn't appeared. This present translation is, to put it bluntly, horrible. This is really a shame, as Durkheim's thesis is quite compelling (if not flawed).On average, each page of text is missing about two dozen commas.One example:&quot;Without the necessary act of satisfaction[,] what is called the moral consciousness could not be preserved.&quot;Then there are the pedantic (and barely readable) constructions such as the following.Halls's version:&quot;By this is explained why some acts have so frequently been held to be criminal...&quot;Revised:&quot;This explains why some acts have so frequently been held to be criminal...&quot;?Halls's version:&quot;Undoubtedly most of these are not harmful, for if they were, in such conditions the individual could not live.&quot;Revised:&quot;Undoubtedly, most of these are not harmful; if they were, the individual could not live.&quot;Finally, there are sentences that are so obfuscatory, I don't know how to fix them:&quot;In both cases the force shocked by the crime and that rejects it is thus the same.&quot; (I'm not kidding, this is one of Halls's actual sentences.)"},{"Title":"The division of labor in society (Free Press paperback)","review":"A classic in many ways, the Division of Labor is a great starting point for sociology - not because it's terribly sexy or interesting or even correct, but because it begins to lay out what sociology can do."},{"Title":"The division of labor in society (Free Press paperback)","review":"... The Halls translation is quite a good one. If we examine the Halls text and compare it to the &quot;revisions&quot; that the reviewer has posed, we find that the differences are not merely aesthetic, they are substantive. They change the meaning of the sentence, and therefore the nature and meaning of Durkheim's argument.I think that this Durkheim's best work.

I re-read the entire book, and could at last understand the story, the torment, the love, the fury, the power of what Emily had written, a real love story, with the real sentiments that occur when people of different upbringings clash, and somehow, in spite of such brutal hatred and jealousy, love dawns, and it survives the storm of hatred that continues for many years and a couple of generations. This story epitomizes true and unconditional love. For this reason,seven years later, I gladly rate this book five stars our of five."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have no memory of Northern England late 1700's. I don't no if characters such as Heathcliff or the younger Linton actually could exist. But this whole story is so unbelievable that it goes way beyond fiction. Not only that but one of the basic requisites of any successful novel, or movie for that matter, is to have at least one character that the audience likes or will root for. There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top. I just finished this book so maybe my viewpoint will change with time (in five months will this novel have any impact on me) but for the time being this hardly rates as a &quot;classic&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My overall impression of this book is that it is a well-written depressing novel. The characters were well portrayed but the cruel and/or twisted natures of the characters made me feel dreary inside. The abominable Heathcliff is a prime example.

I LOVED (became slightly obsessed) with Jane Eyre and figured this might fall in the same category. Unfortunately, I was very wrong.The writing is so utterly dull. I cannot understand where this great love comes from between Catherine and Heathcliff - they are just in \\"love\\" and we are supposed to believe it. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if it was not told by Nelly's accounts, whom I find extremely annoying, overly motherly and controlling for a servant. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters and just wished they would all die already, as seemed to be the prevalent theme throughout the novel.I also found it somewhat disturbing how easily people married their first-cousins back in those days. I get it - it's the 1800s, but really does Cathy have to go from marrying one first cousin to the next? Is there no one else in this town that she is not related to?!I was really hoping to enjoy this book - especially considering this is such a \\"classic\\".

And I absolutely loved this. I have never read a book told in such a way as this one is, from the perspective of those who aren't really the main characters; it was such an interesting way of telling the story. The characters were all so intriguing: I loved how I could pity and hate Heathcliff at the same time, and find Cathy frustrating yet endearing. And of course, the love story was passionate, heartbreaking, and engrossing.Regardless of your age, I recommend that you read this book. I'm 14, and this is definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read. My only regret is that Emily Bront? did not write more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't think there is another book as famous as \\"Wuthering Heights\\" where the perception of its contents and the reality are so different. The unbridled, doomed and forbidden love between Heathcliff and Catherine would seem to be the original Harlequin romance. How NOT true. Instead of a love story the real \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is conflict, anger, evil, betrayal, loss, mystery, revenge, debasement, regret with a large unhealthy dose of bonding.Having seen the 1939 movie when I was 7 or 8 years old and not knowing what I was watching for many years I was struck by the story. But the producers of that version win the award for most creative re-interpretation of a book in the 20th century. For fun I looked at 5-10 minute clips of the the 1992, 2009 and 2011 versions on YouTube (I read there are 17 screen versions to date). In those short passages it's clear that each film tries harder to reach the emotional pitch of the book by being more true to the storyline. None beyond the first have been commercial successes and I think it's because the intensity of the book is in the narrative not the dialogue. While Heathcliff is increasingly dark and willingly evil with each version the films cannot bring out what he's thinking because - well we don't know what he's thinking. All we know is he's very angry and would really like to have Catherine back. The movies create monologues that don't exist in the book. By filling in the blanks it takes away from the mystery that is forced on the reader to speculate on Heathcliff's character and motives.I found appeal in Bronte's willingness to portray Heathcliff as nearly the devil; a man wronged and willing to exact revenge for eternity even on his own family. It's painful. Heathcliff's bitterness goes on page after page and year after year. No \\"victory\\" seems to satiate him. It's incredibly intense and he only gets worse as he goes after more innocent victims. His villainy has no bottom.I started the book thinking I was in for a more elaborate version of the 1939 movie. I finished knowing I had read something far different, more challenging, provocative and modern. Much is made about Bronte's ability to write this - where did the ideas come from? what was she thinking? If she were a man would there have been as much focus on the writer instead of the book? Fortunately those debates have receded while the freshness and originality of the story have remained."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ). The story would have been better served by a third-person omniscient perspective. Nevertheless, Wuthering Heights deserves its renown as a classic of English literature. It's a shame this is the only novel Emily Bronte ever finished. Let the chick-lit label be damned; real men read Wuthering Heights too!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"(Spoiler)Wuthering Heights is one of the most perfect novels I have read. Here are my thoughts on what makes Wuthering Heights an outstanding read and why it's considered a classic:Characterization:There are no extraneous characters introduced into the story. Each person serves a purpose and is often complementary to another character in the book, like a mirrored reflection or a duality, sometimes the same, sometimes opposing; i.e., Catherine and Heathcliff, Edgar and Isabella Linton, Hindley and Heathcliff, the younger Catherine and Hareton, Mr. Lockwood and Nelly, Nelly and Joseph, the two families at Wuthering Heights and the Grange, the mother Catherine and the younger Catherine, and Isabella and Heathcliff. The relationships among the characters are complicated and evolving. If you were to take one of the characters out of this story, the plot development would be negatively altered. The plot is character-driven and tightly woven throughout the story.Tone:The tone of the story is brooding and dark. The sensuous feeling is foreboding, first exhibited in the setting which Emily Bronte describes in detail. There is an element of overarching suspense and aversion to the characters: the morose Heathcliff; mother Catherine who dies of a brain disorder; the drink of Hindley; the tragic life of Isabella following her marriage to Heathcliff; the delightful younger Catherine who succumbs to depression after coming under the control of Heathcliff. The depressing scene and dysfunctional characters that greet Lockwood's arrival prompt him to ask Nelly to explain the history behind Wuthering Heights.Societal:I was struck by how Emily Bronte weaves the social status of the characters into the story: Joseph and his barely intelligible English; Nelly, the servant and principal narrator, and her portrayal of others from an inferior social position; the many differences between the upper class Lintons and the middle class Earnshaws; the emphasis on social structure with less opportunity for upward mobility, which impacted the \\"heart\\" of the story -- mother Catherine sacrifices her desire for Heathcliff to achieve a higher social status by marrying Edgar. The characters' traits, flaws, and attributes within the structure of society make for believable people that the reader both loves and hates.Multi-generational:The differences between the generations were striking: Heathcliff and mother Catherine seemed unable to change with the passage of time or grow as individuals. They were locked into extremisms that became dead-end roads. Eventually, their flawed natures doomed them to early deaths, providing an opportunity for the next generation in Catherine and Hareton to overcome the past. In contrast to their parents, they were able to adapt and redeem the past, and through their transformation, the reader is filled with hope for the future. The multigenerational aspect of time adds to the completeness of the story--this is a family with a history, a past that threatens to destroy the future.Spiritual/Psychological:Emily Bronte probes deeply the psychological aspects of people's behavior and the ramifications of the dark side of human nature. The story touches on the spiritual nature of the individuals, with references to the small church, the recurring battle with death, the repeated references to ghosts, and Joseph's incessant recitation of Scripture.Themes:The many themes are timeless--love that is forbidden, prejudices that hurt people, the meaninglessness of life without hope, hate that destroys, the vindictiveness of human nature, and the darkness of the soul without God.Setting:Established in the first paragraph, a \\"perfect misanthropist's heaven. \\" Right away, I am told a lot about this story in a unique way which encourages me to keep reading.Classic Author Similarities:I am struck by the fact that many classics, like this one, have been written by individuals who have experienced tremendous suffering. I wonder if there is a relationship between a giftedness to write great stories and the degree to which one has endured hardship. Perhaps the strong emotions that are pent up in a tortured soul find solace in the pen as a healing balm.Risky:Creative, original stories take risks. For instance, there isn't one protagonist versus one antagonist in Wuthering Heights. Ninety-five percent of the story is dark and unsettling; the story reinforces negative stereotypical issues and characters. The orphan is the troublemaker and destroyer of the family, perpetuating a common \\"myth\\" with adoptees. Joseph uses the Bible in a beguiling way to demean people, contrary to the Good Book's ultimate purpose. The submissive role of women and their inability to escape from abusive husbands or families is also perpetuated in Wuthering Heights, reinforcing the long-held notion that women are inferior to men. Despite these risks, Emile Bronte creates a masterpiece.Fictional Dream:Emily Bronte immerses the reader into a world that is vivid and dream-like, with colorful characters and a complex plot. She uses literary techniques that make this is a compelling read, one worth pondering after the last page is finished. It's a shame she died so young--what other books might she have written?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is timeless literature. I read this piece when i was about fourteen, and, although difficult to follow and differentiate between the Cathies and Lintons in the beginning, Bronte unraveled this work very thoroughly and revealed a ghastly and revealing story about two selfish lovers.Heathcliff is truly the most despicable character imaginable, and for his feisty spirit he is one of my favorite characters.Catherine is selfish and a character i feel a strong connection to on some levels.Together these two complete a classic tale, which i would have fallen in love with no matter who the author. However, I am truly impressed with Emily's gal to have written this grizzly tale. For its time, this type of literature is a bold one, and for a women to write? Forget about it! That's a piece beyond the story I absolutely relish.I advise anyone interested in reading this to pick it up and enjoy (possibly making notes, or just trudging through the beginning like i did, ha) But definitely read it twice over, at the very least, for a truly enjoyable (and understandable) read.Anything below five stars for lack of clarity is no fault of the author, and is simply a problem with anyone reading the book. Yes, it is confusing sometimes, but there are pieces to that which complete the complex puzzle of revenge and human indecency."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really liked Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is a \\"little\\" disturbing. When I first started reading it, I was like what? But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down. Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story. Very good, if you like the older, classic style. I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first thing a lot of people who have read this are probably going to ask is \\"Why not 5 stars?\\", and indeed, one may be subjected to stoning for giving only 4 stars to such a well respected piece of classic literature. However, I have my reasons: for one, the book becomes a bit difficult to follow at times- when you have Cathy Linton Earnshaw, and Cathy Earnshaw Linton, and the one who is dead won't stay dead, that gets a bit confusing to begin with. There are a couple of other similar instances when the reader may have to turn back to see just which character is involved in a given encounter. Also, it seems to never be very well established just how Heathcliff went from having nothing upon his departure, to being wealthy upon his return. Perhaps not necessary for that to be fully explained, but at least some explanation would be welcome. Emily Bronte does one thing exceptionally well, which is painting a picture of Yorkshire and The Moors with words. Maybe people who are better readers than I will enjoy this more. I did enjoy it, by all means, thus the four stars, but I was not as enthralled with it as many others have been."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A young lady, 29 years of age, published a book under the name of Ellis Bell. It was so abhorrent to the public, critics wanted the 400 pages of \`pure repugnance' to be burned. Yet as the horror and outrage grew throughout the world, so did the number of copies. How had this young, sickly woman who lived a life of desolation and strife, caused such uproar in our hearts as she led us through hers? Wuthering Heights can be examined through the events, ideas, and personal observations within the text to decipher our own personal experiences with reading this novel.The book begins through the narrative of a man named Mr. Earnshaw. Earnshaw is a tenant for a man named Mr. Heathcliff. From the beginning page of the novel, we find Heathcliff to be rough and with a dark presence in him. The man has come to stay the night before heading down their land to his recently purchased house. Yet the owner of the land makes a very unwelcome first impression on the young Mr. Lockwood. Immediately entering the house, Lockwood get attacked by dogs, and laughed at for his fright. This dreary setting to start off a book happens in a residence named Wuthering Heights. The place Lockwood has recently bought is called Thrushcross Grange; the book will solely revolve around these two houses. Thrushcross Grange is 4 miles away from Wuthering Heights, and Lockwood, returning from his visit from the heights, tries to return to the Grange during a storm. Yet he is unable to make the journey and is force to stay at the Heights until morning.A maid leads Lockwood upstairs into a room that Heathcliff has forbidden. While he lies in the eerily dark room, he finds that names have been carved into the wall next to the bed. Deeply carved into it are 3 woman named Catherine with different last names. A quote on age 35 describes the mood in which the chilling names rang into the night, \\"In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with Catherines.\\" He also finds a diary written 25 years earlier, and with curiosity for the strange inhabitance of the household, he ventures to read it. Within the diary, a girl named Catherine Earnshaw writes about a day she experienced at Wuthering Heights. She talks about how her and Heathcliff must suffer through long sermons and put up with the hatred her brother has towards Heathcliff. We now are aware of 3 major characters--- Catherine, Heathcliff, and her brother named Hindley. Lockwood falls asleep soon after, and has a frightening nightmare in which a hand grabs him and cries the name \\"Catherine Linton\\" and demands to be let in through his window. She will not let go of him, until he continually rubs her wrists on the glass she broke trying to get in through the window. He wakes up screaming, and tells Heathcliff that there is a ghost named Catherin in the room. Heathcliff runs into the room and as Lockwood shuts the door, he is heard crying out for his apparent lover. Following this occurrence, Lockwood asks a maid named Nelly to tell him about these people's lives. The story begins there.Nelly begins by telling us of her own experiences at Wuthering Heights. She is the nurse of 2 young children--- Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw. Their father is expected to come home one day with presents, yet he brings home a young gypsy boy instead. He is quiet, yet with a strong-will. His name is Heathcliff and the father favors this boy above his own children. Throughout the 3 children's childhood, Hindley is jealous of Heathcliff. Yet as strongly as Hindley and Heathcliff hate each other, Catherine loves the boy. The two were inseparable, and their connection went deeper and deeper with age. When their father dies, Hindley is the head of the household and Heathcliff is turned into a slave. This strong connection turns from childhood playmates, to a deep emotional attraction towards each other. They were both alone in the world, trying to only protect themselves and each other. The connection is so strong, that no amount of physical force could drive these two apart. She was the rebellious teenager, eager for adventure, and ignorantly falling for the boy. Heathcliff was a dark character, who was hardened by the cruelty he received, yet utterly infatuated with the girl. The two young lovers plan to run away together until one night, when they sneak over to Thrushcross Grange to spy on the upper-class family. Yet they are heard, and as the two mischievous trespassers run away, a dog catches Cathy's leg and severely injures her. Cathy stays there to heal for months, and Heathcliff is banished from their property. She becomes close to a formal and respected man named Edgar Linton.As Nelly tells Lockwood of these events, she seems to have an eye for every happening, and an ear for every story. She observes that after Cathy returns home, she is changed. She is now dressed in fine clothes, and an air of superiority. A quote in chapter 8 shows the effect of her changing her affections for Heathcliff to Edgar Linton, \\"Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect.\\" The young girl is attracted to his wealth, and reputation. While their relationship grew closer, her and Heathcliff grew farther apart. Eventually it came to the point that Linton proposes to Catherine, and she talks to Nelly about it as she tries to decide her answer. Yet as they discuss, Heathcliff is listening the entire time. Catherine says that she cannot \\"degrade\\" herself to Heathcliff's level; it is then that Heathcliff leaves in a rage. However, he departs right before Catherine says one of the most important lines of the book. She says in chapter 9, \\"would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him; and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same, and [Edgar's] is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.\\" With this reference, we learn that she is literally stating, \\"she is Heathcliff;\\" their persons are so similar that they are the same.Throughout this entire time Hindley marries a woman he is deeply fond of, and she becomes pregnant. However, his wife gets sick and dies while giving birth. Hindley becomes a different man after the death of his wife. He turns into an alcoholic, and vows that if he ever sees that baby he will smash its brain. While a life went out of the world, a new one came in however, and the baby boy was named Hareton. Nelly is the sole caretaker for the baby, and treats him with loving care as he grows up.Yet after Heathcliff leaves, Catherine spends the next few days searching for him and sickening herself. She waits for her childhood companion to return for 3 years, but eventually marries Edgar. Thus Nelly and Catherine move from Wuthering Heights to Thrushcross Grange, leaving behind baby Hareton with his drunken father.While the new couple settles into Linton's beautiful, fresh, and crisp home, Nelly starts to notice some aspects of their marriage. Linton listens to everything Catherine says otherwise Catherine will get extremely upset. He gives her everything, and she constantly complains to him. The entire story changes when one day Heathcliff arrives again. He has a new \\"darkness\\" in his eyes, and is now very rich. We will find that his personality has changed from being a boy with anger towards his oppressors, to a man with a psychopathic idea of revenge and love.Immediately, the two have a passionate connection that Linton cannot even compete with. Eventually it gets so bad that Heathcliff threatens to kill Linton, and he must call in help. Linton banishes Catherine from seeing him again, and she fakes a disease to try to get his attention. Eventually however, Linton grows frightened with his wife's health and nurses her night and day. This causes her to keep up with her illnesses and starve herself.Throughout this time, Heathcliff revenges upon Catherine for marrying Linton so he eloped with Linton's brother, Isabella. Isabella is utterly in love with Heathclifff, however he despises her. When Linton hears about his sister's elopement, he disowns her and vows that he cares nothing for her. Catherine is so utterly caught up with jealously with Heathcliff's action, that she grows into a new person. She would lay in bed and stare blankly at nothing for hours. Within 7 months after Heathcliff's return, she becomes so frail and weak that she can no longer move. She is also 7 months pregnant, but Nelly never mentions that until after the baby is born. Heathcliff finally finds a day where Linton is absent to come into her house and find his Cathy. Upon meeting each other, they are overcome with this attachment and lust that completely controls their bodies. Heathcliff lifts Cathy in his arms, not fully aware of the severity of her condition. This roughness causes blue marks in the lady's skin as the maid observes from afar. They kiss repetitively, apparently not aware of anything around them. Yet as hours pass, Linton makes his way home. Nelly pleads for Heathcliff to leave; yet Cathy pleads for him to stay. He leaves Cathy just as Linton comes into the room, and he is overcome by horror at how rabidly her strength had decreased. She died in her husband's loving arms.While this story ends, a new one begins with the child born in the hour of its mother's death. The baby is name Catherine as well. Edgar mourns for his wife for weeks, yet eventually he welcomes the baby in. Nelly calls her \\"angelic,\\" and everyone loves her at the Grange. Yet during the happy days of the baby Catherine's growth, treacherous things take place at Wuthering Heights. We so far have been unaware about anything that has happened at the Heights. Yet Isabella arrives at the door on a frigid winter day, with a deep gash on her neck. She ventures to tell Nelly her entire story from the day she elopes and onward. She tells Nelly how she was attacked, and banished from sleeping in the same room as her husband. She was made fun of, and kicked around. The day that made her run 4 miles through a blizzard, while bleeding profusely from the neck, was a shocking revelation of events.Hindley Earnshaw had told her on a previous date, that she had better make sure her husband's room was locked, because Hindley would shoot him the night it was not. This chilling experience shook the young lady up, and she tried to stay out of the two men's evident hatred towards each other. Hindley plans to kill Heathcliff, but Isabella warns him of coming into the house. Heathcliff believes she is trying to kill him as well, yet is able to attack and almost kill Hindley. Afterwards, she gets into an intense argument with Heatchcliff, and she tells Nelly of her feelings towards her oppressor. She says, \\"it is better to be hated by him than loved him.\\" As she departs, he savagely throws a knife at her neck. Isabella runs away and gives birth to a baby boy named Linton.13 years later, young Catherine grows into a beautiful lady, loved and nurtured by everyone around her. Yet as she grows up, she yearns to go outside of the walls of the Grange. They hear news that Isabella is sick, and she wants to give her nearly 13-year-old son to her uncle. However, the day he arrives, Heathcliff sends for his son and the frail boy never gets to live in a house of safety and solitude.4 years later, as Nelly is out looking for Catherine, she finds that the girl has escaped and ran up to the Heights. Nelly retrieves the foolish girl, and notices that Linton has become extremely sick and frail. She is very angry with Catherine, yet Catherine continues her interests with the Heights and Linton. Catherine and Linton start sending letters to each other, and become romantically interested.. We find through the course of events that Heathcliff manipulates Catherine into marrying Linton while her father dying. He grotesquely locks Nelly up in a room for days until finally she is released and her and Catherine are able to return to see Edgar before he dies. Nelly is not allowed to follow Catherine to the Heights, and finds a few months later that Linton dies, and Catherine is left trapped into a lifestyle under her insane father-in-law.The story ends here because Nelly has no more information to portray. Lockwood, who has been patiently listening, returns to the Heights to find that Heathcliff died, and Catherine is now in love with her other cousin Hareton. Hareton grew into a strong, muscular, mysterious, and rather illiterate man of 23. Heathcliff had bribed the man burying Catherine's coffin, to attach his coffin to hers--- much to the neighbor's detest. That way, he claims, \\"Edgar will not be able to tell us a part.\\" The book ends on somewhat happy terms now that Heathcliff is out of his misery and the new lovers are now together.In my opinion, the book was harshly realistic to what we live through today. It captured not only my attention, but also my emotions. Heathcliff was such a threat to society within the novel and outside of it that it was shocking to read about how strongly his heart was displayed just through words. When reading along, your entire being went into his character. It was repulsive, and horrific to imagine the things he did, but somehow understandable. When we can truly understand how he loved, then it is somewhat clear how he hated. Our villain of the story is not the man that viciously threw a knife at his wife's neck, or tore a young lady away from her dying father. Instead the true villain lies in what love can be turned into. Young Catherine did not love Linton, she only felt sorry for him. Heathcliff did not have the kind of love that will stay by you always, with compassion and gentleness. Heathcliff only attained the emotion of the past--- clinging on to the deep attachments of the wrongs people had done to him, and the only person that ever treated him right.When Heathcliff forces Catherine to stay at his home, and abuse his son and his nephew's emotions towards their cousin, I saw a similarity in Heatchcliff's own experience. He told Hareton to take Catherine out into their garden, \\"but try not to stare when she isn't looking.\\" Yet while she is out with him, he would try to make the sickly Linton jealous. In my opinion, I saw a pain in Heathcliff that he could only suppress by making others suffer.When examining the author of the book, we find that Emily Bronte lived on the moors of Yorkshire, England. The moors are deserted, stormy, and dangerous. The moors can represent Bronte's own life, and also the characters in the novel. All main characters of the novel can be compared to the bleak yet fierce aspect of the place where they live. It says Catherine Earnshaw Linton was buried \\"in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor.\\" She was neither buried in the church with the Linton family, or in the Wuthering Heights graveyard. This can be taken as the idea that she was caught between her wild childhood lover, and her caring protective husband. In our lives today, we can live two lives and get caught in the middle. Whether it is a person in love with two people, our faith, or our character, we can all struggle with living in two different worlds. Following Catherine's death, both Edgar and Heathcliff followed her to her grave. Edgar lived a life of happiness; he moved on with his life. Heathcliff lived a life of despair and solitude, only finding comfort when the ghost of Catherine haunted him. Our lives can be defined by how we are treated, what we lost, and who took that away. Yet we also can move on, and choose to forget those things--- not living in the moors of our devastated, uncivilized emotions. This brilliant novel can truly open up to one's heart and mind as you allow yourself to experience the words of Emily Bronte's inner being."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"reviewer:alysalovesbooks:)I am 16 and I thought this was going to be pretty boring and just...blah.But it was actually pretty good!I admit I only read this book because I had to do an assignment for my English Honors Literature class.It was slow and uninteresting at first but NEVER GIVE UP ON A BOOK right?Well, as I read on,it became more interesting.

I think one of the most amazing things about this novel is that the characters aren't exactly likable and yet you love them anyway. I love Heathcliff, though admittedly I wouldn't ever want to date him. I think Heathcliff is one of my favorite likable bad guys in literature along with Severus Snape. I would really recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that transcends time and life. One of my favorite things about this book is that it's not just some simple love story where the guy falls in love with the girl and then something bad happens that threatens the relationship but it all works out in the end. I think it is even more tragic than Romeo and Juliet and definitely more complicated. Anyway, I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For the quality of the binding - it's fair at best- the pages at the end sit jagged and uneven. But this was quite inexpensive, and it didn't bother me terribly.The book itself was good. Personally I think Jane Eyre was better, but Wuthering Heights has unusual, headstrong, and not always pleasant characters even in the role of the lovers in the story which makes it very unique."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not what I was expecting. For some reason I thought Heathcliff was going to be a typical romantic construct who had some dramatic character arc. I'm a little misanthropist myself so you would think I would like this novel, relishing along with my kindred spirit, but I was never quite captivated."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was under the impression that I had ordered an actual book. I wrote the seller who provided a link for an e-copy of the book. I appreciated the offer but my daughter needed the actual book for English class in school. Be aware of what you are ordering - if you want the actual book, verify that is what you ordered."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After listening to this unabridged version of Wuthering Heights I am a great fan of Tantor Unabridged Classics. The narrator did an excellent job bringing the characters to life. This is a wonderful story though a bit depressing. Many classics from that time are written with a an overwrought, tradgic mood. If you can handle that, it is a good story of a dysfunctional family, revenge and love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Anyone who is a frequent reader of this blog knows of my aversion to classics. I don't typically enjoy them, I always have to force myself to finish them, and I usually just end up giving up before I finish altogether. This book started out similar - it took me a really long time to get invested in the story and characters, I read it very slowly, and I was pretty sure I was going to hate it by page 50. Fortunately for me, though, I ended up enjoying the story when I (sadly) forced myself to continue on. (Thanks, Classics Challenge, for that little push!) I am SO proud of myself for getting through this and actually feeling like I somewhat enjoyed the book. Someone described this book to me as almost like a soap opera (can't remember who...), and that individual is completely right. There is so much drama in here... it's crazy. I definitely felt attached to the characters, even with all their unpredictable drama, and I'm glad that I finished the book and got to appreciate it. I can't really say that this is one of my favorites, but it is a pretty decent book, and I can see why it is dubbed a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte, I knew I had to read her sister's only novel. Quite an interesting contrast to the love story of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but unique and worthwhile nonetheless. A great classic by a 19th century female writer...read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is an interesting book in that people tend to take it in one of two ways. People either feel that Ms. Bronte is drawing a love story between Heathcliff and the 1st Catherine, or that Ms. Bronte is pointing out the 'terrible truth' of the failings of romantic love. I myself lean towards the latter. For one thing, the 1st Catherine dies 1/2 way through the story.The story is basically this. Mr. Earnshaw (father of Hindley and the 1st Catherine) brings home an abandoned child. (Heathcliff) At the risk of oversimplifying, Heathcliff is basically responsible for rifts in the Earnshaw household. (For one thing, Hindley, with some justification feels that he has lost his father's love to Heathcliff.) Heathcliff seems to bring out the worst in both Hindley and Catherine. While we may sympathize with Heathcliff from time to time, he basically represents vengeance and destruction.Moving on, you will probably notice that while that while certain characters display passion for each other, the happiness DOES NOT last into the marriage. We may be tempted to think that Nelly Dean is in fact Emily Bronte herself scoffing at the characters she created.Moving on, the 1st Catherine (who married Edgar Linton) dies leaving behind one daughter Catherine (2). The widowed Hindley dies leaving behind a brain damaged son (Hareton). The story then switches focus to Hareton, the widower Edgar, Edgar's daughter Cathy (2), and Heathcliff's son Linton. It is interesting that Edgar is the most likable once he is a widower trying to raise his daughter. Heathcliff remains a character of darkness and vengeance bringing pain and torment to the surviving characters. (For someone who is famous for loving the 1st Catherine, he sure doesn't mention her much. Nor does he seem to have any problem treating her daughter wickedly.) There is something called false imprisonment, as well as kidnapping!I don't want to ruin the book for those of you who haven't read it. But there is an interesting resolution that to some extent gives the romantic at heart what they want. However, at the same time, Heathcliff's expansion of character is limited. While many see this as a romantic novel, Miss Bronte is offering us an interesting reality check. (Passions are often short lived, and do not often last once marriage and reality set in)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first started reading this novel I thought it got off to a somewhat of a slow start, and when it switched the narrators I got a bit confused. As the novel progressed and told about the relationships present between Heathcliff and Catherine I got very interested. Throughout the novel I noticed the absence of mothers present in the novel. I found that part of it very interesting and really wonder why Emily Bronte made it so that all of the children lost their mother figure. I recommend this novel to anyone who has to read a \\"classic\\" novel for any type of educational purpose. My only advice to anyone who reads this book is wait like 50 pages before you decide to give up on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic love story between dark, handsome Heathcliff and beautiful, lovable Catherine Earnshaw. The differences they had in life never came between their strong willed love. This is a book for EVERYONE. I believe that this should be read by each person sometime during their lifetime. There were things I liked about the book and things I didn't, but the good outweighed the bad.I loved how Emily Bronte, the author, switched from the point of view of one character to the other because it gave me a better idea of what the story was about. In addition it was nice to know what all the characters thought everything that went on. That made it hard for me not to put down the book, although I had to in order to live my life.My next praise of Wuthering Heights is the way that the setting and the characters are described. With all of the vivid words in this story it made me believe everything that was happening. I really began to see the surroundings and feel the way Heathcliff and Catherine did about each other, and how much hatred Hindley and the rest of the world had towards Heathcliff, with the many astounding words that she used to write this wonderful book.Now to the one thing that I disliked about Wuthering Heights, it was hard to get into. The first, oh maybe, 5-6 chapters were gloomy and not to exciting. It seemed as though it would never get better and more interesting. Surprisingly, it gets better every second you read on.To wrap it up, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a stunning book. I recommend it to everyone to read in their lifetime. This book proves that it doesn't matter if a book was written a long time ago because it will still capture readers for many years to come. The good outweighed the bad in this story because of the vast description and how well it is written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is a brilliant and flowing writer, but there were definitely times when I was completely lost and confused. However, I think it's because of the way that she writes this novel that makes it so captivating. It's terrifying and romantic, it's seemingly unbearable and it's light and easy. It's definitely the best of both worlds. A romantic and thrilling tale of love and evil. Who doesn't love that? Not to mention the writing is second to none.But, regardless of how much I love this story, I did have to take a star away just because of how many times I had to stop and go, \\"wait ... wha? erm ... but I thought ...\\" And yes, in the long run, it makes the book that much greater, but it can get frustrating (especially for one not used to that type of reading) and confusing.But, yeah, a true classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is written with such charactorization, that well after reading the novel, I am still deep in thought about the psychology of Heathcliff, and those that tell their interpretation of their interaction with him (Lockwood and Nelly Dean). This novel is great for someone who has ever loved and lost, and not had their way, as life often does not turn out the way we intend. I love the way Bronte writes, with the deep meloncolic undertones. It makes me yearn to read another of her novels, however, that is not a possibility. That's all she wrote (besides a collection of poetry). My favourite quote from the book is when Catherine Earnshaw confesses to Nelly that she really loves Heathcliff despite her agreement to marry Edgar Linton: \\"So he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lighting or frost from fire.\\"To me this distinquishes the love of soulmates, between the casual love we create in order to socially fuction; fear from remaining single, money, social status. Brilliant novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte didn't live to see her novel gain the success it deserved, but it is fortunate for the rest of us that she at least lived long enough to write it. Wuthering Heights tells a fascinating story that is extremely difficult to put down despite it straying well outside the traditional territory of novels.The story offers very few sympathetic characters, and much of what it relates is horribly distasteful. Yet the characters are so interesting and the writing so skilled the reader sticks with Bronte through all the trials and tribulations of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The story covers about a 25-year period of time in two families whose destinies are tied together by a horrid orphan named Heathcliff. Heathcliff is arguably one of the most despicable villains in literature, as for the sake of his twisted love for Catherine he quite thoroughly and deliberately ruins the lives of almost everyone in those two families, not even sparing his own son his vicious rage. The vengeance he wreaks for his perceived wrongs is thorough and brutal, almost impossible to imagine, yet fascinating to watch.My one complaint would be Bronte's use of phonetic spelling for one of the secondary characters. Joseph's dialogue is virtually impossible to understand in sections, although fortunately his character is not vital to the story. The rest of the writing is quick and entertaining, making the story move quickly and keeping the reader's interest.The reader may assume, as I long did, that a novel written so long ago would be likely to be of more interest in some high school English class than to be read for pleasure. Such prejudice should be set aside, as Wuthering Heights is too good a book to be so ignored."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Jane Eyre is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read. By the way, I strongly suspect that Anne, the previous reviewer who made the speed reading comment about this bookcassette audio recording from Brlliance Audio lisened to this recording without using the adapter or adjusting the balance on her balance control knob on her tape player. If listening to this on a walkman style tape player you need the adapter and you need to read the instructions before using it and if you are listening on a stereo or car tape deck with balance control knob then you need to follow the instructions on how to listen to it that way.

Now many years later I have again found this truly remarkable novel. Its style ranges smoothly from horridly wicked, to loving and caring, to darkly comedic. Heathcliff is perhaps one of the most wretched characters in literature, and his love affair with Catherine is truly unique. This is almost like \\"Jerry Springer\\" for the 19th century. If you skipped this in school, do yourself a favor and pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been on a quest this last year or so to read (or re-read) the ladies of English literature that I so sadly ignored in high school. How could I have been so silly. I started my 'tour' with Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" and quickly went from there to \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\"...and just recently I picked Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". I absolutely loved this. I'm not going to give you a great literary dissertation here. I just have to say I loved it. There was love, destruction, reconstruction, sorrow, mindlessness, drunkeness...all marvelously narrated to the reader. I was truly impressed. I'm forever kicking myself for not reading Austen & the Bronte sisters earlier on. The saddest thing about reading these (and other) classics is that you know going into it that the author won't be writing anymore wonderful works. Take the time to read this..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though 'Wuthering Heights' has garnered a reputation as an overly romantic sentimentality, this is not what the book is about at all - and this nonsensical assumption has pervaded popular culture and discouraged new fans. Though 'Wuthering Heights' is, above all, a love story, it is sordid, melancholic, shocking, and filled with characters that are markedly maniacal, self-centered, and cruel. This is, of course, peppered with Early Victorian verbosity, dramatism, and rambling plot, but its content, and the memorable anti-hero that it creates in Heathcliffe, are far less so. Violent, emotional, yet touching, the book creates its indelible charm in its slightly overblown examination of the darkness, but vulnerability, of the human soul."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story is one of revenge. One day, instead of returning from town with gifts for his two children, the main patriarch instead brings back a \\"waif\\". This street kid, Heathcliff, who is the ridiculed underdog upon arrival, attempts to destroy two families and take their land.I always felt that Heathcliff was an illegitimate child that was claimed one day by his father for some unknown reason (mistress mom died?). For me, this explained the \\"lost soul mate\\" type comments made by his step (or real?) sister and her instinct not to marry him as the right thing even though she did not love the man that she did marry. You decide.Heathcliff is on of the most evil antagonists you will ever read about. He not only wants to win, but wants to destroy absolutely everything that his enemies value.The story itself has three stages which correspond to the three generations of characters. While this in and of itself is not interesting, the way Bronte manipulates the timeline is very effective. Most of the book is told not by the narrator, but by one of the family servants.Also interesting is the prevalence of mysticism versus traditional religion given the backdrop of both when it was written and the time period in which the story was set. The spirit world is front and center.This is not an uplifting book, but the talent of the author should not be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to say that I never would have read this book, had I not read \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" by Jasper Fforde. There's that once scene where Thursday and her boss appear at that \\"Anger management meeting\\" at Wuthering Heights, and the characters originally invented by Emily Bronte all explain why they hate Mr Heathcliff so much. It made me curious - who is this Mr Heathcliff, and why is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in constant danger to explode from the emotions it contains?So I got me a copy, and I was fascinated. Not only have I never read a story that contains so much hatred, and revenge, and wild emotions - the characters all seem so real, and so fatal in their set ways - and Mr Heathcliff surely is a wonderful, interesting, enchanting character. Emily Bronte might not be as well-known or famous as her sister, but this book definitely is almost as good as Jane Eyre.If you're not sure whether you want to read this yet - read !The Well of lost Plots\\" first, and then you won't be able to live without!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In Wuthering Heights the characters and households are so easy to visualize, yet when you get further on your perspective on the novel change dramatically. The relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff and Cathy and Hareton are so similar you'd believe they were the same people. Both catherine and Cathy, although they loved Heathcliff and Hareton, turned to Edgar and Linton for status, which played a very important role in the mid-ninteenth century. Yet Catherine was never able to follow through with her love for Heathcliff, while Cathy was able to wed Hareton after Edgar and Heathcliff's passing. The households of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are extreme opposites. Wuthering Heights is on a bleak, desolate hill, tormented by extremely rough weather. Thrushcross Grange is located in a warm, cozy valley. The inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, most likely due to the morose attitude of Heathcliff, are very gloomy and not welcoming to strangers. Thrushcross Grange is a very open, inviting household, with cheery inhabitants.In a simple page, all your views of the characters and the surroundings can change. When going through the novel, you must feel some pity for Heathcliff. But when the novel begins and ends, he can disgust you with his horrible ways and actions. Upon his death, Wuthering Heights, always a gloomy household, became cheerful and inviting.The relationship between generations is almost invisible. You'd come to believe Catherine and Cathy were the same people, and Edgar and Linton could be brothers. As with Heathcliff and Hareton. You see Cathy follow in her mother's footsteps in her love life, and Edgar and Linton were both frail growing up. You notice those characters have almost everything in common, yet there is always one difference. In Cathy and Catherine's case, Cathy was able to marry the one she loved, but Catherine died before she had the chance. Edgar was more refined than Linton, and was better able to stand up for himself. And Heathcliff, unlike Hareton, had some education, and was smart enough to stand up for himself.I thorougly enjoyed reading this book, it would've been even better without horrible deadlines*ahem*, but all in all I found the novel's characters and settings to be so creative and ever changing. I don't think I could've written this book in a lifetime. Of course I'm a VERY slow writer. Especially when there are deadlines, but... that's another story for another day. Too bad, you might have found it really good. Oh well. It might make you laugh too. But I shall not say anymore. I'm just going to make you ever so sad. Maybe you'll hear it someday. Wow, I'm really managing to drag this out. This should be worth extra extra credit. The suspense is just killing you I'm sure. Anyways, this was an excellent book, and I'm very glad I read it. Not to mention we're going to read Great Expectations next. Yay!? Goodnight, America."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have just recently finished the book Wuthering Heights and have found it is a very interesting book.In the novel, Nelly Dean is telling Mr. Lockwood the story of Mr. Heathcliff, who is the landlord of the houses Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Mr. Heathcliff was a young, poor child when he was adopted into the rich Earnshaw household. As Heathcliff grew up he fell in love with Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of Mr. Earnshaw, and loved her throughout the rest of the novel. Once Catherine is old enough she decides to marry Edgar Linton for his social status (i.e. money, looks), and hopes to bring Heathcliff up out of the power of her brother Hindley. Heathcliff regrets her decision and runs away for three years.When Heathcliff comes back he is very wealthy and wishes to see Catherine after his time away for so long. After meeting with Catherine, Heathcliff is very upset at the fact that she married Mr. Edgar Linton. Heathcliff finds out that Isabella, Edgars sister, has fallen in love with him and he thinks it will be a perfect way to get revenge on not only on Catherine, but also Edgar Linton. Heathcliff marries Isabella and takes her to live and Wuthering Heights with him, where she is quite miserable due to the lack of hospitality. During this time period Catherine dies after she has her daughter Cathy, and Heathcliff is miserable because he never got to show his love towards her. At this point Isabella runs off to Gimmerton, the local village, and has a child named Linton which she asks her brother to come pick up so that Heathcliff could not torture him with the anger he had towards Isabella. After Edgar picks up Linton, Isabella dies and Edgar comes back to the Grange. The next day Nelly brings Linton over to the Heights because Heathcliff says its \\"his property\\". Young Cathy falls in love with her cousin Linton, even though he is always sick and moaning, and eventually marries him. Linton dies one night and Heathcliff taks control over both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy falls in love with Hareton, son of Hindley Earnshaw, and marries him. Heathcliff eventually dies and everyone lives happily ever after.I personally wouldn't have picked up this book myself if it was up to me, but my teacher had us read it in his class and im glad i did.

Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads.

This tale of interleaved sociopaths is the antithesis of Jane Austin. The people of Quality and Breeding are all mentally disturbed, only the female servant is with sense (she declares herself so in Volume I, chapter 12, page 1). Given the continuum: Perfect Family - Normal Family - Dysfunctional Family - ?? (my vocabulary fails me), these folks rate the \\"??\\". Clearly the quality of the literary effort is superb, the writing and characterization is terrific. The story does have a useful function in illustrating the Darwinian nature of life, but don't read it for its ability to elevate. Is this book entertaining? Yes. But it raises a disturbing question about ourselves that this should become a Classic (think gawkers at a terrible car wreck). The story does conclude by throwing a contrived happy ending as one might throw a bone to a starving dog. (November 2012: I gave this two stars? One was too many. What was I thinking?)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I was looking forward to reading this work of her sister's. I was mortally disappointed.

Perhaps an extrapolation. I have not read all of the books ever written. But this book is horrid.If you are a tween girl, this might be a good book for you, though. If your dream fella is one of those dark and broody types, the kind that seems mysterious but turns out to be just a basic kind of jerk. It's a shame that some people find this book romantic. The dark, disturbed guy in this book is called Garfield and he's a lousy person.If you like this time period for fiction, you should try Anne Bronte. She wrote two fantastic books.

She, too, is a terrible writer.Full disclosure: I do not know Emily Bronte, nor would I care to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story about a low class guy (Heathcliff) in love with a rich upper class girl (Catherine) is a classic theme. I could deal with that because it reminded me of a movie. but, after Catherine dies because of giving birth the book just looses interest. It is obvious that Heathcliff is a Psycho! he does so many bad things that you go from feeling bad for him for not ending up with Catherine, to hating his guts and wanting him to die. There really is no protagonist in the story to take on the antagonist of Heathcliff because there is no way that he is the antagonist. There are much better books in British Literature that I would have rather read in high school than this one. Overall it was a very dissapointing book. I was expecting to read a real classic but I was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love the classics as much as anyone but I really can't get into a novel that makes me hate the main characters.

I'm not sure why the novel caught on the way it did, it was 300 pages documenting spoiled, self absorbed people and their unrelenting quest to destory any trace of happiness around them.

You probably don't know I recently made a resolution to read some of the 'Classics'. I had avoided them successfully for decades and then decided that perhaps I was missing out on some really great stories. So, I carefully selected some novels that sounded like great 'Classics' to read. 'Wuthering Heights', 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Jane Eyre' rose to the top of the list.They all sounded like fabulous stories, everyone raves about them, the book jackets make them sound like the absolute be all end all for engaging fiction. And maybe they are for the vast majority of people, but not me. Jane Eyre being the exception of the three.I did LOVE 'Jane Eyre', love, love, loved it. However my strong feeling for both 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Wuthering Heights' swing dramatically in the complete opposite direction.I really strongly disliked (okay, I hated) almost everything about Wuthering Heights. I thought the characters were absolutely horrid and rotten, the only exception being the innocent and unrelated tenant, Mr. Lockwood, who Ellen Dean tells this awful tale to.The relationships were completely dysfunctional, violent, abusive and destructive. I can not comprehend how this came to be called \\"one of the most romantic novels of all time\\". I have no idea who said that but in my opinion whoever it was should have their head examined. If this is what people call romantic it is no wonder that 1 in 2 of all marriages fail.Perhaps, I have some sort of completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to the classics and my expectations set me up for failure...? Perhaps. But I am going to stop searching out any more 'Classics' for the time being.One more hostile note that some of you will appreciate. I swear I wanted to cudgel the servant Joseph who spoke in a northern dialect and could only be understood by reading the notes to the text in the back of the book.I would have to place this book at the top of a list for 'Most Likely to Create Hatred of English Literature'."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am torn on this one but mostly negative. The language and the story were both excellent (though the Yorkshire lines were tough at times) but all but one of the characters were annoying to the point of distraction and the book was not well edited for length. She could have told this story with the same impact, had she dropped scenes and words.She has a gift for darkness and moodiness though, and the book, in general is a bit of an elaborate Victorian ghost story. The opening scenes and set up of the novel is quite masterful but the story rambles and everyone and everything seems just a bit watery by the end of it.Trivia: This book ranks pretty high on the \\"books in which characters catch a chill from wet feet and die\\" list. All the characters sound like my mother not wanting me to swim after eating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i dont know if i would love or hate this book because i couldnt read it because im not the best reader and have to sound things out sometimes and i couldnt understand half the words on the first page alone and so i had to keep looking in the dictionary half the time to under stand and so i gave up and deleted the book but other people tell me its a good book i just coldnt understand it i hope other people like it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although it took me 2 tries reading this to understand who the heck was the narrator, once I figured it out, I loved it!Listening to the stories being told with Heathcliff and Cathy..it's sad yet amazing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I used express delivery and it left the warehouse the same day I ordered it and I received it promptly. Thank you for an exceptional sale. I will do this again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend this wonderful book to almost everyone! I especially love reading novels that take place in the past yet can be related to now. One thing I do recommend - when you start reading this book, as you piece character personalities and profiles together - write them down! Make a family tree! That is the one confusing part of this book but by getting things down on paper you help yourself to enjoy the book more and not worry so much about who is who ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights can easily be compared to a soap opera. Personally, I do not have an inclination towards soap operas, but this novel, written by Emily Bronte, was done beautifully. One of the most complex characters in literature is perhaps Heathcliff. His motives are sometimes opaque but his emotions are so real. The reader can identify with his heartbreak and anguish. The despair created by the love triangles throughout this novel is breathtaking. There is symbolism on every page, making Wuthering Heights an in-depth work of literature. This novel is truly a romantic classic, and personally, my favorite."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think this book evokes controversial responses from readers because of the ending and because of their failure to interpret this piece of literature. Wuthering Heights is not just a love story--it's a story of relationships, class struggles, the angst of the soul, passion, remorse, and regret. It is about everything that makes us human, e.g. the power to choose between good and evil. It is about obsession and how it can kill the soul. The story is masterfully written, filled with symbolic representations. The reader must read between the lines to truly appreciate and understand this great classic!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The symbolizim in this book is great, Heathcliff compared to the moors, the blooming trees at the end are Hareton and cathy, etc. This book has everything, from hate, to the most passonate love! HIghly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Oh my God! This was the most amazing book I have ever read. I cannot express how thrown i was by this classic tale of disturbed love and torturous passion. It knows no bounds!! The most amazing experience for me was to read this book, Cathy is beautiful and ghostly, Heathcliff is dark and still, yet undercurrents of black, storm his character like a great tempest! The relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff could be explained as so: Cathy is Heathcliff's light and Heathcliff is Cathy's eternal darkness, these are two characters who love what they have learned to fear! AMAZING!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I would never have read this brilliant, fascinating, and whirlwind novel had it not been for my English teacher. I can't believe what I would have missed out on! The narrative is not at all confusing - it's simply 1st person limited. The frame narration is wonderful, it adds to the mystique and ambiguity that surrounds the whole situation. Heathcliff inexorably attracts and repels as does Catherine. It's one long huge piece of poetic prose. It disturbs, it frightens, it causes one to look at a darker side in a new light. The book is amazing, Emily Bronte was a woman way beyond her times. I would reccomend this book to everyone - even those annoyed with the characters etc simply cannot argue with the mastery of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is simply the best book I have ever read. You can't just read this book, you have to feel it, breathe it and live it. I simply love it....."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book when I was 15 or16, I think, out of curiosity, I had heard so much about it. Three years later it is still my favourite book. I lost track of the number of times I had read it. To me it is the greatest love story ever written. At first, I felt it strange that the hero of this story should be an unbelievably evil villian, but I later understtod that Heathcliff was not your conventional love-sick melodramatic hero, and how Emily Bronte could make this character appear deserving of sympathy and even a little admiration, is nothing short of literary genuis. I had come to that conclusion years ago- you had to love a man who could love like that. I felt his character was more rounded than any character I've known. Some people might find the book depressing, gloomy, even a bit morbid-no doubt it is, to a cerain extent.I found it to be the most realistic, passionate and romantic love story I've ever read or will read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am writing my senior college thesis (currently) on this brilliant novel and everytime I pick my much-loved copy up I discover something new and fascinating. My copy has notes in the margins throughout, often followed by an exclamation marks to indicate my excitement. This excellent novel is saturated with deep thoughtful symbolism, the colorful beautifully-created characters (despite their cruelty) have our sympathy throughout (if they deserve it). The emotion Emily Bront is able to convey through her words defies description itself. I love this book so incredibly much; I consider it to the best of the Bront novels and I've read nearly them all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I spent most of my life avoiding books like this. Now, nearing 50, I have been finding that many of these old English novels are great fun and can occasionally even be very moving (&quot;Silas Marner&quot; knocked me clean out!). What you will find distinctive about &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is its surprising violence. The title tells it all: Yes, &quot;wuthering&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;weathering&quot; -- we have entered the heights of wearing-down. You will find it incredible the depths Heathcliff sinks to in order to exercise his obsession. Bodily violence, to be sure, but also, and mainly, torture of the soul. You will shake with revulsion and frustration when reading of the wrongs Heathcliff perpetrates. Can anything good come out of this Hell on Earth? Will the violence follow its winding path ever downward? Ah, but that's for you to discover. Hunker down and go for it. This ain't no sippin' novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BOOK, NOVEL ETC, OF ALL TIMES, HANDS DOWN. I RE-READ AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR.

It brought tears to my eyes, which doesn't happen to me often."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If there is a list of one hit wonders in literature, at the top of that list would be Emily Jane Bront's magnificent novel Wuthering Heights.It is a dark, brooding book that never really answers the questions it leaves us with. Why did Mr. Earnshaw bring the boy Heathcliff home with him? Was Heathcliff his illegitimate son? Why does Catherine Earnshaw marry Edward Linton and not her true soul mate Heathcliff?As an English teacher, I am always reminded that sometimes the great novels of classical literature, like Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird, would not get past the inquiry letter to the literary agent stage today. Why? Because both books have horrible beginnings. The reader must persevere in order to get to the meat and bones of the story. In the case of Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird it is worth it.Catherine and Heathcliff are undoubtedly selfish human beings, but their love for each other is so powerful and damaging the story is a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know if I can add much to what has aleeady been said about Wuthering Heights.

I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye. I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story. There was hardly any romance. The characters aren't likeable that I just wanted them to just die basically.

It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up.

Cannot find these classics in the stores and this way my kids will be able to enjoy as well."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first purchased the novel a couple of years ago while I was still a teenager, and the book was difficult at first read. Over the years I've reread the pages again and again, in particular the beginning pages, which introduces us to Lockwood, who is first person narrator. The book is still difficult because of the layers, reading into first person commented. There is also a chronology in the narrating, and a complicated connection between past and present. Also the diction is complicated because two people are telling the story at the same time, because mr Lockwood is listening to Nelly most of the time.Nelly is a clear narrator of story between Catherine, Heathcliff, and always includes the involvement of everyone else (Edgar, Hindley, Isabella, Nelly herself), and also the second generation (Hareton, Linton, the young daughter of Catherine who shares her name).Catherine passes away very soon since giving birth to daughter Catherine, and her ghost lives on, in the spirit of her daughter, and in Wuthering Heights. Her ghost touches Lockwood early in the novel, before he reads her diary material, and he possibly closest sees her in the daughter, whom he says is beautiful. Lockwood has never met the first Catherine, but he has met Heathcliff. Lockwood is intrigued by Heathcliff, and by the story Nelly tells. We find out that Nelly is only two years age difference with the first Catherine, and apart from being the objective story teller, she is also passive narrator, because she is immediately involved with the subplot at the same time. She talks to Catherine and Heathcliff, she doesn't understand their love, but she looks after young Catherine at Thrushcroft Grange since her mother passes away. Also the relationsip between Catherine and Heathcliff is platonic, as told by her, and there is never physical or sexual interaction told by Nelly. Catherine had her daughter with husband, Edgar, not Heathcliff, but she never kisses, sleeps with or has sexual or physical interaction with Heathcliff, and critics sometimes pay attention to that happening when they read the novel. Less of the elder Catherine is told because she passes away under halfway through the course of the book. Most of the connection readers continue to feel is still platonic.The novel is very beautiful, because of the nature described about Wuthering Heights and Thrushcroft Grange. We know it is a world removed, as young Catherine marries Linton first (first cousin through Isabella and Edgar being siblings), then she marries Hareton (first cousin through Catherine and Hindley were siblings), but being married to cousins is still a taboo today. This makes it less surprising the novel was so controversial when it was first released, and critics sometimes still find it difficult to get interpretations around Catherine and Heathcliff's love, but although the novel was heavily criticised when first released, it found a place in critics' hearts over a vast amount of time. Readers can eventually come to understanding the book after reading and retracing, and in the end it was always worth the effort of rereading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Everyone I know who read Wuthering Heights hated it. Said it was sad and the people were horrid. I actually enjoyed it. Yes, they were silly people who held in their feeling until it was too late and concentrated on revenge other than trying to make the best of life, but that's what makes it so great. Plenty of life lessons in this novel. I loved the ending. How one person could find a way and make everything right. Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you, just know that it is worth reading it through to the end to see how Emily brings everything full circle."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I ordered this book, the \\"Bed Book\\" was not clarified very clearly or I missed the point of what the bed book meant.

I dreaded the prospect of reading a Victorian romance. I think I may have even seen the Hollywood interpretation with Olivier. ( A poor pale and distant echo of the novel as it turns out). I read it because I was forced to. I was determined to dislike it. Even after starting the book I continued to criticize the foppish Lockwood wandering inanely about the moors in the classroom.There is no comparable book I have ever read. Its impact stays with you forever. Other reviewers are for more eloquent, but the vivid imagery and violent emotions of the protagonists is unparalleled. I have recommended this book to family and friends over the years, badgering them into reading it. The result is often the same. It was not what they were expecting and simply a great book. Perhaps they were being polite, who knows.If you have yet to read it, I envy you. That first reading is so memorable and surprising.You too will come to wonder \\"how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book last year for my AP English class. That was the ONLY reason that I finished this book. It was a huge task just to finish a page of Wuthering Heights; it was almost impossible to complete it. I enjoy characters that I can care about. I like to be able to really feel like I want something for a character. If that happens, then I want to finish the book; I want to know what happens to the character. I found with Wuthering Heights I hated Catherine and Heathcliff. I wanted them to die. I was supposed to be sad when things went wrong in their lives, but instead I was so happy. They were selfish, cruel, horrible people and I wanted them to DIE! Was I really supposed to like these selfish people? Since when is love a selfish thing? This is supposed to be a marvelous love classic, but where is the love? Love isn't just about what makes oneself feel good. Love is a kind, caring, sharing thing. Catherine and Heathcliff were selfish, cruel people. They deserved each other simply because they would make each other miserable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit that a good half of my personal library is comprised of classical novels and plays and that I read them because I genuinely LIKE them.You heard me right. I LIKE them. I read them for ENTERTAINMENT, not because they were assigned reading in classes (although I've made \\"friends\\" with a great title or two via that route as well).The Bronte sisters' novels enjoy love and hate from readers. I don't think there's a soul who just feels lukewarm about their works. I've read a couple and liked and kept most of them.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" stands out to me as one of the WORST novels I've ever read in my ENTIRE LIFE. Given the number of novels I've read in my entire life that's saying a lot.WH is very well-written. Emily Bronte CAN write. Style/technique isn't the issue. What is the issue is her abysmal failure to engage the reader because of her deplorable characters.Heathcliff and Catherine are frequently cited as one of the \\"power couples\\" of literature along with Rhett & Scarlett, Romeo & Juliet, Antony & Cleopatra, etc. They may be kindred spirits but there is none of their behaviors ever signifies they know a thing about love.Catherine Earnshaw isn't even an interesting character. She is a charming, selfish and silly young woman who fulfills the Victorian stereotype of choosing \\"a good match\\" over wild love on the moors with Heathcliff. This may have been the sanest thing she did. Maybe she recognized H's bizarre fixation on her as unwholesome and knew she'd never live up to it in reality.A lot of women get swooney over Heathcliff as a sort of alpha-male anti-hero. I'm female and I CAN'T STAND this guy! He isn't alpha, he's WEAK as skimmed milk.How psychologically disturbed is he, let me count the ways. Inferiority complex, obsessive attachment to uninterested female (Cathy turned him down whatever her \\"real feelings\\" might have been) that borders upon incest (they're not blood kin but they are raised together); inability to \\"forget the one that got away\\" and MOVE ON; child abuse/neglect with clearly murderous intentions; wife/spousal abuse; kidnapping and coerced marriage and even theft of personal assets...Give me a break this is no alpha male, this is a psychopathic CRIMINAL!If you sigh and say, \\"Oh but he did this all because he LOVED Catherine!\\" I will slap you. Truly I will.A REAL alpha male would be broken-hearted by the rejection of his \\"true love\\"...then he would have moved forward and continued with his life and discovered \\"true love\\" (as in love that was returned to him without bizarre psychological games).Heathcliff is a loser in every sense of the word. If Heathcliff were alive today he'd be in jail or hospitalized as \\"criminally insane\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"So I know that this is considered a classic book, I just assumed that meant it was supposed to be a good read. I cannot tell you how many times I just wanted to kill the main characters and be done with it. I only finished reading the book just to see if it EVER got any better. Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront at the tender age of fourteen, and remember quite clearly that it was my birthday, and my mom and dad took me out to the movies. One glance at the poster and I declared we'd go watch Wuthering Heights starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and that was that. I was transported by the thwarted romance that played out on the bleak Yorkshire moors. Of course I had to go read the book straight after, and while my youthful self probably didn't \\"get\\" half the relationship dynamics or the full depth of the dialogue, I nonetheless knew this is a book I'd need to reread at some point.Fast forward 20 years (gee whizz, it's been *that* long) and I downloaded the book from Gutenberg.org - a far cry from the battered paperback copy I inherited from the family home, and was immediately transported - again.Wuthering Heights is primarily a story about relationships, and of people who wilfully twist and allow others to twist them. We are first introduced to our narrator, a chap by the name of Lockwood, who has rented the grand Thrushcross Grange (complete with its own park lands). I get the idea the chap is a bit of a poseur, who's quite oblivious and gauche when it comes to how he relates to people. Self-absorbed. I missed this in the first read. Kudos to Bront for having a narrator I'd cheerfully slap. I mean, the fool goes blundering in to visit the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights when it's perfectly clear to anyone else with half an ounce of common sense that they do not appreciate the intrusion of a stranger.But Lockwood is our narrator, and it's clear the mystery presented by the relationships he encounters captivates his imagination to the point where he's determined to uncover they mystery that has presented itself. (My inner cynic cheerfully comments: \\"Well, what do you expect? They didn't have reality TV in those days.)Not one to take a hint when he's not wanted, Lockwood plays voyeur, and an ill-timed visit results in him having to spend the night at Wuthering Heights and subject himself to the ghost of Catherine - one of the key scenes.But the story's layers get peeled back. Lockwood's housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange is none other than Ellen (or Nelly, as she's know by those who're familiar with her), who grew up with the main participants in this drama. Her narration of past events is then retold by Lockwood, so once again our perceptions as readers are coloured by the lens of yet another viewpoint. We are faced with not only the opinions of Lockwood, but that of Ellen. Unreliable narrators both, but in their opinions, we view our main players with a degree of separation. We vicariously live out the unfolding tragedy from a safe distance while debating on characters' true motivations.Most often, Wuthering Heights is pegged as a romance and, to a degree I agree that romance is an underlying theme but I prefer to view it as a tragedy, of characters denying their true natures and being destroyed by the prolonged act of revenge.We enter a complex interconnecting web of relationships and the intermingling of two families. Always, Heathcliff is the outsider. Bront suggests that he is dark, perhaps of gypsy stock, and Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw's father brought the foundling home. The lad was closer in age to Catherine than her brother, and the two were soon inseparable. But when Catherine's path intersects with that of the wealthy Lintons, and specifically their son, Edgar, she is soon torn.The unsophisticated Heathcliff is her dark half, an animus as such, wild and unfettered, yet Edgar represents culture and an artificial construct of what \\"love\\" is supposed to be. Catherine is at a quandary, and it is her decision to marry Edgar that sets the wheels in motion for the unfolding drama.Yes, this is a tale of thwarted love, but it's also an illustration of how individuals will consciously choose a path that can only lead to damnation. What I found fascinating was comparing my initial response as a teenager to how I felt about the novel now, twenty years later. I recall feeling so sorry for how rotten Catherine's life turned out. Now? Well, I'd dearly love to shake some sense into the girl. All the characters are unlikeable. There is nothing romantic about Heathcliff's all-consuming passion for Catherine. And Catherine is a wilful, stubborn girl who's used to bending everyone around her to her whims, unmindful of the damage she is causing to herself and those around her.This made me think, however, about the relative ages of the characters in the story. They were but teenagers themselves, who behaved as such. The only difference is that in those days, folks getting married as young as eighteen was not unheard of. Now, you sit back and think about how your life would have turned out had you married your first sweetheart (you're excused if it's two decades later and you're still happily married to your first love).I think about my first love and where we'd be now if we were still together, and probably miserable as all hell to boot. Let's not go there. I'm glad I never felt obligated to marry someone, and that when I did finally get married (yes I married young at twenty-two) I'm still very much in love with the man but glad I'd had experience with other relationships.And lastly, Heathcliff. Wuthering Heights is really his story, if you ask me, and he suffers a bit of a dog-in-the-manger syndrome. He cannot have happiness, and has focused his entire existence on ensuring that no one else will have happiness. Heathcliff is ultimately tragic, but I don't pity him, as he mastered his own fate. In the end, he cannot bring himself to carry out the final act of his schemes, and loses the taste for revenge. Instead, he turns the sickness inward. The world continues without him, in spite of his machinations, and he consumes his own heart.Wuthering Heights falls under the category of the Gothic novel, along with the likes of Frankenstein. Supernatural elements are hinted at, and I suspect it's left up to the reader to decide whether these exist. This is one of the novels that I recommend to all aspiring authors to read. As a study on character development, Wuthering Heights is essential. Yes, the language usage takes a little getting used to but if you can get into the story, you'll gain an appreciation as to why this is one of those classics that has inspired film and music.

Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i was so glad to find this amazing edition for such an affordable price! it was in great condition, exactly as the description said. thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was mentioned in several of the other books that i have read so I thought I would see why it was referenced so much. I really liked this book. Emily creates these characters that have depth and strong emotions. Cathrine and Heathcliff are doomed from the get go, their chilhood spares them no humanity for them to retain in adulthood. Heathcliff is horrible and is often referred to a an evil man, true but Cathrine still loves him. Though she loves him she is so concided and horrible herself she refuses to be with him. I cannot tell you how horrible each of the characters are in Emily's novel you must read it for yourself. Please don't misunderstand me when I say horrible I mean the behavior and attributes of the characters not that they are poorly written or lacking in depth. Even thought this characters are the complete oppsite of good I found that I wished for their pain to stop. Each of the characters were in such a constant state of torture I could not really blame them for acting the way they did. They say that misery loves company and Emily's novel could not paint a better picture. It does take some adjusting to the way it is written the wording and phrasing are not of this era. But once you get started and get a feel for the writting style you will become consumed by the characters and their pain. I thought this book would be just another one of those old dull reads but it is so much more. I know its old and hard to understand at times but is so worth the read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading Wuthering Heights, and I have to admit, it was a slog. It's not that I have anything against novels from that time period; I count Jane Eyre and the works of Jane Austen among my favorite books. But Wuthering Heights did not live up to its reputation. The characters were universally unlikeable and unsympathetic. The story was meandering and ultimately unfulfilling. And the \\"love story\\" - more of a story of unreasonable obsession - did not move me. So count me among the few who did not fall in love with this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a dark book, almost a ghost story - the kind of thing that must have inspired our modern-day Anne Rice, minus the fangs. It is also a great illustration of the ultimate dysfunctional relationship: Intense passion and misery; haunted souls. Love can be very powerful, but don't try this at home kids!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Well this book is was very interesting but everyone had the same name so that made it confusing. But once you figured out who was who it was a very good book and totaly worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought the novel was an excellent classic. I feel that Bronte wrote from the very core of her heart. She uses a humongous use of setting. The way she describes the Heights and the Grange , you can see it and almost feel the difference between the two places. It is a very powerful love story of two people who love so strongly. I love this book and would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was supposed to read &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; for a college humanities class. Well, . . . ummm . . . I didn't.It wasn't until almost ten years later, when my wife recommended this book to me, that I finally &quot;bit the bullet&quot; and read it.&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a dark, sometimes tragic, love story. The characters have a depth to them that causes the reader to become emotionally involved with them. I found that I was cursing Heathcliffe on one page, and pitying him on the next.My only regret concerns myself more than the book. The ever-decreasing attention span of Americans today made me feel at time that the book got a little long. Perhaps if I weren't so distorted by a sitcom mentality where conflicts are resolved neatly in thirty minutes (minus time for commercials), I wouldn't have felt this way. In other words, the fault here is with my reading of the book, not with the book itself. Just be prepared when reading it.But read it nonetheless!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this is a really good book that i had to read for school and i have not finished it yet but i look forward to an ending that is even more twisted then the previous chapters"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering heights is a book whitch everyone should read. it is a facinating love story between two wild individuals. It contains many twist and turns that you would never sucpect. This book pulled me in and made me felt that I was right there. It is not hard to see why this book is a classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"it's a classic, which has got to say something for it, and i never could have written it, but i would have made a few changes. Bront didnt get deep enough into the characters thoughts and emotions because she wrote it from a third person perspective, that of Nelly Deen. And what was Joseph saying?! I just skipped over his infrequent lines. Also, she should have made it longer, she just zoomed right through the lives and loves of Catherine, Heathcliff, Edgar, Miss Catherine, and Linton, who were all very interesting characters. Those characters were so interesting that the reader should have gotten to know them better! But, it is a classic everyone should read. Also, I found myself quite enraged with Nelly throughout most of the book because she was the main hindrance in the loving relationships between Catherine and Heathcliff and that of Miss Catherine and Linton. She was stern and not understanding of the young mind and definitely not a romantic. And, I thought she was mostly exaggerating about Heathcliff, untill the end where I saw how he treated Hareton and Miss Catherine so poorly, and then i saw that maybe Nelly was right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazing book. Truly amazing. The story keeps you gripped until the end, and the dark, driven obsession within the characters (especially Heathcliff) is rather fascinating, as well as the uncertainty it inflicts in the reader of whether to call Heathcliff the protagonist or the antagonist, which makes him one of my all-time-favorite novel characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the most devastating, romantic book ever written. Emily Bronte is a magician, and her magic entraps you through this book. Catherine sums up the meaning of love when she explains to Nelly her love for Heathcliff: &quot;My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be...Nelly, I AM Heathcliff!&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read (and being an English lit graduate, you can believe I've read a lot!). People who hate this book do so because they want a pretty love story with adorable characters. But this isn't a Johanna Lindsey. Heathcliff and Catherine define the terrifying realms of love and hate. They are like rough, hard rocks that epitomize the Earnshaw estate. Neither Heathcliff nor Catherine are heroes--rather they are the villians who want to love each other, but are thwarted by circumstance. This book is too deep and rich to enjoy if you're merely in the mood for a &quot;good read.&quot; Rather, you could devote your life to it..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is my favorite book of all time, every time I even think of the passion in this book, my heart is touched. Emily Bronte does an excellent job creating one of the most beautiful stories ever written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a fantastic novel that explores the complexities of human nature and though some of the characters are evil, they are not far removed from people in real life. Its themes of passion and revenge are conveyed expertly and take the reader on a fabulous journey to the wily windy moors of England"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book's among the best i've ever read. All those who don't like it must be basing their opinion on the dreadful 1992 film adaptation instead of reading the actual book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As I read the book &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; it was easy for me to see why it was named a classic. It is very well written, the plot is interesting and all it wants is a story book ending. Throughout the book the reader finds that the misery of the characters is because of the selfishness and hatred that some of the characters have for one another. One sees that the hatred of one man for a small orphan child carries into the second and third generation of his children and grandchildren. Although Emily Bronte masterpiece can never top her sisters book,&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, it is worth reading, and contamplating its message."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"wuthering heights is a good story, but some things seem to be repeated several times making it some-what boring. it took me a long time to finish because of this."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Just when the book starts getting interesting, someone starts whining and complaining about their illnesses! I was very annoyed in those parts. It took me a painstaking 3 months to finish the book. Although after I finished it, I still thought about the story's point. The underlying theme to the story is powerful and that makes the book good. Yet, the road is very slow and sometimes difficult. Some of the characters are very annoying!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am forever in debt to a teacher that required me to read this book in high school. Ever since, it has been my faveorite book. It's a powerful love story without the sickening sap, a gothic drama without the pretentiousness, an intriguing study on human nature, emotions, and motives without the boredom. It's a timeless book for everyone, combining elements that make it enveloping for both men and women. I must confess I have a hard time keeping myself interested in many classics I have read, but this one was different. The characters are as rich as any of Anne Rice's, the chill as strong as Stephen King's, and the themes on love and hate ring truer than ever in modern times. Read it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i actually enjoyed this novel despite what my fellow students thought or said about it. I went into expecting to hate it but I don't. It is creative, intelligent and in a bizarre way romantic. Heathcliff is a powerful character as are both Catherine's. Unfortunatly for me I do have to write an essay on it. Under most circumstances I wouldn't care but I have to write about the storms in the novel and what they mean. According to my teacher there are 43 but I have not found that many. This makes me detest the book. Which bites because it is a magnificent piece of literature and it is terrible that Emily was not around to know of it's success or that it could have been a success when she was still alive."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Very passionate, a flavor of undying defying love. Characteristic of a very romantic setting and era., embodies the darker aspects of spiritual and carnal romantic engrossment."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was a very good, well written book, though the beginning was very confusing. This book was full of love, passion, and hatred. Not many people get to live the experiece of what Catherine was feeling when she said, &quot;I am Heathcliff, he's always, always, in my mind; not as a pleasure any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.&quot; That was the most powerful quote in the whole book, and it shows how well thought out this book was when it was written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is nothing special. I personally don't see why everyone considers this to be a masterpiece. First off I can't see how Bronte can turn such a stupid story into a 300 page novel. Another thing that bothered me was the narrative. The story was almost completely told in flashback and that flashback often broke into another flashback and a couple of time broke off into a third flashback. Another thing that was bad was the referce to the characters. One sentence she wold call Isabella Mrs. Linton then she would call Catherine Mrs. Linton also. Same situation with Mr. Heathcliff and Linton Heathcliff. Not to mention the fact that there were two Catherines which just added to the unproffesionalism of this book. What the heck was Joespeph saying!!!! Overall I believe reading this book was a complete waste of time and I would defenantly not recommend this book to anyone else. If you are looking for an enjoyable book from that era I strongly suggest you read Jane Erye by Emily's more competent sister Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"No doubt about it, this book is a well written classic that generations continue to enjoy. I did in fact enjoy this book and got absorbed in the story. I was told this book was a love story; however, it is not just any love story. This book had depth and angles not only about love. In Wuthering Heights, as the years went by the Earnshaw's and Linton's became very dysfunctional. It seemed that there was no order in the family households. Most of all, I enjoyed the characters Emily Bronte created. Catherine Earnshaw was such a passionate character, her words moved me like no other book had. I was inspired greatly by Cathy's passion, &quot;It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning,or frost from fire (73).&quot; That paticular passage has always been my favorite. I felt so sorry for Heathcliff even though he became revengeful; however, I believe he was driven by passion himself. Catherine and Heathcliff were my favorite characters, but all the other characters were very important too. Altough the book is 'wordy', I throughly enjoyed the storyline and characters. So I have decided on ranking Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights an eight. Futhermore, I recommend this novel to anyone searching for a good book. SKC@WBHS"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All I could think about when reading this novel is what character am I supposed to be interested in. My answer was none of them. I could not stand anyone of the main characters, and began to rejoice in anything negative that happened to them. Maybe I was supposed to feel that way. In any circumstance I would not say it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a great love story all the characters are well developed. You grow to love and or hate some characters with a passion at one point you want Heathcliff to just roll over and die and the next you are feeling sorry for him. This book may not have been well recived at the time of is publishin but now it is of the greatests books of all time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book years ago after reading Jane Eyre. This is nothing like Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. It does not have the spirite or the heart of those two books. For years I tried to figure out what was wrong with me that I should not love such a classic. But now that I am more mature and a more seasoned reader; ...It just is not to my taste. Sometimes I like books that others do not and sometimes others like books that I dont. This book lacks the hope and sense of awe for life that I desire in a novel. For me the hero and herroine must be worthy of my time and attention. Something good in them must prevail. That just doesn't happen here. This story is really sad because it is a love story writen by a woman who never know what it was like to love and be loved in return. IF she had she would never have writen this abusive version of love. But you know as well as i do that some women truely belive that abuse is love. So like I say to each his own.P.S. Read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall By Ann Bronte instead. It shows the real face of an abusive relationship with a happy ending. Her characters are realistic and true heros of their lives."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is the same and just as wonderful as it has always been. I bought the CD version for a car trip, and was extremely disappointed in the narration. It was read rapidly, and without pause. I found that, even though I know the story well, I could hardly keep up! I have several other books on CD, and have not had this problem. Too bad... it was a waste of money, and a long boring car trip!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a great novel. It is easy to ready but not easy to get into since it is a little bit slow and dark from the first page. However, the story evolves and slowly grows on you.I found the book a great description of one perspective of love, an unsatisfied love that keeps growing until it finally consumes the lovers.Some of the paragraphs are great to read in the way they explain the emotional struggle of the characters.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There's no redeemable quality in either Heathcliff or Catherine. The more I read the more I despised them, the more I didn't really care what kind of havoc they wrecked on each other or their relationship. Their relationship is the epitome of codependency and somehow this is supposed to be regarded as one of the great love stories of our time. How masochistic are we?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A whole genre of literature came from this book. Emily Bronte wrote a Gothic novel full of revenge, passion, evil and romance. In fact, the novel was so controversial for its time, that publishers did not want to take the risk of publishing it at first. The book is a masterpiece with unforgettable characters and a great and swift-moving plot. I bet that anyone who has read this book has not forgotten Catherine and Heathcliff. It is the type of book that stays with you for a very long time. The book is violent and emotional, but it mercilessly probes the psyches of its two protagonists as it follows their ill-fated lives."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a tragic love story that has bitter and vengeful aspects to it. I dislike this novel because of the characters Catherine for her \\"I'm beautiful everyone must love me\\" attitude and Heathcliff for his \\"Catherine doesn't love me so I must become bitter and ruin everyone else lives.\\" But this story has its good parts it shows raw and everlasting love. Even though the years have passed Heathcliff's and Catherine's love will last forever. This novel shows the darker side of love. It shows how love can put together or destroy people. Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest gothic novels like To Kill A Mockingbird."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is spell binding. It takes you on a journey of love and passion as well as jealousy and hatred. She writes about human nature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A dark and visceral piece, shocking, frightening, at the hands of a great story teller. The love story between Heathcliffe and Cathy is only part of Heathcliffe's tragedy. I was not prepared for the second half of the book, which is where the devilment of the hero is displayed. There is nothing in current literature with which to compare it. A compelling read, but hold on to your hats."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This may be my most favorite book ever!!!!!

I saw bits of the story enacted on PBS, but I couldn't always understand the why for different characters in the book. Now I will be able to understand in depth the whys and wherefores."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My interest in Wuthering Heights was spurned when I learned that the authoress was the sister of Charlotte Bronte,one of my favourite authoress of all times.And I am definitely pleased to learn that Emily Bronte parallels her sister in depicting love,passion and vengeance.The revenge that Heathcliff exacts on the Earnshaws and the Lintons were slow and tortuous,but one may have to reconsider his wretched childhood ,full of humiliation and degradation.There is also an element of mystery present:did the tenant really see Catherein's ghost?And did Heathcliff murder Hindley?(The details of his death seemed somewhat ambiguous)Overall,I'll say that anyone with an appreciation for good literature will thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book haunts me. I have read it countless times. It is ingrained in me now as part of my own personal myth. I carry Heathcliff and Cathy inside like some people carry The Virgin Mary or Allah inside of them. I read it when I was young because I had to for class and hated it, then years later, I was about eighteen and read it again, and this time Cathy and Heathcliff blew through me and knocked me down as surely as if I were a Linton. Years later it still exerts its strange force over me. People are right, it is not a 'nice' book: its emotional terrain is pitted with violence and terror, brutality and abuse. Wuthering Heights isn't about star-crossed love or the endurance of love over death, Emily Bronte was not concerned with such trivialities. It is about what happens to a person who feels intensely, about how a person who endures such intensity of feeling survives. Heathcliff and Cathy respresent two sides of one thing that Bronte was trying to tell us about. She tells us in such a way that we come back to her only novel time and time again to seek the meaning. Not to be confused with 'Jane Eyre'. Jane Eyre is the tale of an insipid who finally gets her man (big deal) despite puritannical hardship, and though its crie de coeur touches the heart, it never sets it alight. If however, you are interested in being burned, and if some teacher isn't force-feeding you this text, Wuthering Heights might just be the book for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was a little boring at first.

I remember at the time being captivated by the star-crossed lovers Heathcliff and Catherine. I decided recently to reread the story because it had been so long and I had forgotten what had drawn me to it.If this had been my first time reading the story, I would probably give it no more than 2 stars. It is definitely a mood piece. As an angst-filled teen, I can understand my former attraction to brooding characters and missed opportunities. As an adult, with much less angst, I have grown to pity the characters I once held in admiration. To say it plainly, Heathcliff is a d*ck. He was so hell bent on his own vision of revenge that he not only wastes his own life, but ruins the lives of others. The bad boy I was so attracted to 20 years ago is in actuality a loser. So is the story of the teenage girl.I have given this book 4 stars due to sentimentality. If you're looking for a happy ending fairy tale, this is not the book for you. If you're 15 years old with a chip on your shoulder, then this will probably become your favorite classic of all time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Gotta love this classics.

It's kind of understandable that it received a lot of negative reactions when it was first published, because the lead character, Heathcliff, is one of the nastiest characters ever devised. And the second most important character, Catherine (Sr.), isn't all that nice, either. Still, this is one of the best books of its time period and a must read for anyone interested in 19th Century literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Wuthering Heights, my love for litarature and the &quot;classic&quot; books have increased impressively. No, i did not read this for school, I read it to broaden my list of vocabulary words. (my ideal goal in life is to be an author, and i will be one). It pains me to see the thrashing reviews of a great book by high school students who simply shouldn't be reading books like this, not yet, or perhaps never. You can't really call this a romance. or, not a Traditional Romance anyway. The love affair between Heathcliff and Catherine is obviously doomed from the start. People continously say they hated the characters. I didn't. I loved them! Heathcliff and Catherine the most. Not that i didn't hollar at them when they did the idiotic things that became repetitive, as I've seen happen in real life. In fact, the only character i disliked was Nelly Dean, who seemed determined to ruin the already corrupt relationship Heathcliff and Catherine shared. This story is so true to real life. It's so bitter, so gothic. There's not a happily ever after in this novel, folks. I love tear jerkers, and that is what this book is. One thing that Emily Bronte is marvelous at, is her description. Her words plant a vivid picture in my mind. And she doesn't need to go on and on with describing either. She can make a place seem real with one paragraph! Read this book. For whatever reason, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I LOVED Wuthering Heights. Although the book gets bad reviews for its crudness, I liked that the characters were real. It is refreshing to find a book that has the main characters with tons of flaws. This is a classic and a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My 13-year old daughter loves this book so I thought that I would try it, fulling expecting to put it down after 30 pages or so. I couldn't! It's not perfectly presented, but the novel does entice the reader into the bizarre world of Wuthering Heights. I normally read war novels (lots of blood and violence) and honestly, Wuthering Heights in some ways is as violent as they are. It is both disturbing and satisfying. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,_ you will probably want to swallow twice and pony up for this facsimile of the original edition of the novel. There's something breath-taking in seeing it as Emily Bronte, with only a year or so to live, saw her own work in 1847. The crudeness of the text--typos abound--somehow corresponds to the roughness of the sensibility that produced it. And since the original publisher wanted to spread it out so as to sell thicker book, it's easy on the eyes.The book is sewn in heavy, orangish cloth and feels substantial; in these days of flashy, cheaply produced volumes, this two volume set is a happy throwback."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is, with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" my alltime favorite book. I've read it several times, beginning at age twelve. Even when I was too young to understand all of its complexities, I still appreciated its highly atmospheric qualities and the magic that makes it timeless.Over the years, I've asked myself, time and time again, just what it is about \\"Wuthering Heights\\" that gives it such power. I've finally come to the conclusion that \\"Wuthering Heights\\" endures simply because its characters dare to feel things and act in ways the rest of us don't. We all have times when we're tempted by obsession and revenge, but most of us don't act on those temptations. At times, we all feel driven almost to madness and we all have a wild side (some of us more than others) that finds perfect expression in the character of Heathcliff. In this book, the characters are always threatening to break the bounds of respectibility and civility.While some people see \\"Wuthering Hieghts\\" as the ultimate love story, I've never found much love in this book, not even between Catherine and Heathcliff. What I have found are obsession and revenge. Love would have watered this story down; obsession and revenge crank it up. Love is an acceptable (even prized) emotion; obsession and the desire for revenge, though felt my many, are definitely frowned upon. The fact that Emily Bronte allows her characters to give in to obsession, to go mad, to exact revenge, gives her novel a distinctly disturbing, unsettling power.There are many criticisms of this novel that attempt to analyze what Emily Bronte was trying to say. Many compare the domesticity of Thrushcross Grange to the isolation and wildness of Wuthering Heights. These ctiticisms don't interest me in the slightest. No matter how educated Emily Bronte was or wasn't, she certainly didn't study psychoanalysis and she certainly didn't write her novel keeping the finer points of analysis in mind. Emily Bronte was, by all accounts, a highly imaginative girl who cared more for the world of fantasy than for reality. Approach her book as literature; enjoy it and don't attempt to \\"pull it apart.\\"Many people have said that the \\"second generation\\" in this book redeems the one that preceded it; i.e., Cathy and Hareton redeem Catherine and Heathcliff. I can't agree with that assessment. All of the characters in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" show themselves to be capable of violence and obsession (even Edgar). I think, in seeing the \\"second generation\\" as restorative, we deny many of the passions inherent in this book. Catherine and Heathcliff are the characters most given to wild emotions but they are not the only ones; all of the characters can and do resort to violence when it suits their needs.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of those rare books: a truly inspired masterpiece. It has a very unsettling, disturbing, even fascinating quality about it because it touches the darkest regions of our soul. Heathcliff is the dark side in all of us; the side we don't enjoy even acknowledging and Catherine's failure to deal with her obsesion reminds us that we, too, can fail, we all are vulnerable to Catherine's fate.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a stormy, unsettling, often violent book that explores the darkest side of human nature. Its beauty is raw and savage; its emotions spill over the constraints of civility and common sense. It's a powerful book (one of the most powerful in all of literature). It's a work of genius that's truly unforgettable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before I put in my two bits, I made a point of reading other reviews and most of what I read I agreed wholeheartedly with, But for the other 10%, I was extremely dissapointed. For those of you who complained, and said that Wuthering Heights was a dull and boring book, maybe the book isn't the problem, and you are. Could it be possible that you need to open your narrow vision and broaden your veiw of this worlds literature? I am fourteen and I totally understood this book. I was wrapped up it the whole time, and there was never one part that I thought was boring. I admit, at times it was confusing, but never boring.This book is without a doubt the best written peice of work I have ever read. The description blew my mind, and as for the characters, they were fully developed and I was able to bring them alive in my mind as easily as I ever have in any other book.Brontte made it so easy to imagine Heathcliff that I had to make no effort whatsoever on my part to bring him to life. As for Catherine, she was developed so well that I can honestly say I saw her as a real person.This novel left me wanting nothing more but a sequel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's strange that as a lover of literature (it was my major in college too), I haven't previously read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. I'm surprised that it wasn't assigned for any of my classes. I've read and loved Jane Eyre by Emily's sister Charlotte multiple times and Wuthering Heights has literally been on my shelf for years waiting for me to read it.Last week I decided to cross Wuthering Heights off my to-read list.I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. You can't not have some expectations about Wuthering Heights. It's often a favorite novel of other literary/pulp fiction characters. A well-written, darkly romantic ghost story. That's what I was expecting. And in some ways, that's what the book was.The writing is really good once I got past the strange and sometimes confusing model of narration--the servant telling the story to a boarder who writes in his diary. This style removes the reader from some of the inner dialogue and thoughts of the main characters. However, if it had been narrated by Heathcliff, like Lolita's Humbert, I might be even more disturbed by his character. And who else could have narrated it? Cathy II, Hareton and Linton have no idea why their lives are being constantly manipulated by Heathcliff.There is a ghost. Her appearance early in the novel is the only moment of intense emotion and romance that I expected from the novel. It is the only reason I was compelled to continue reading. I was eagerly awaiting another such experience.The characters are either reprehensible and completely without merit or sniveling, abused pawns in Heathcliff's demented game of revenge.Needless to say, I was disappointed. Lovers of Wuthering Heights will no doubt claim that I have missed the point. Perhaps. Maybe you have to be younger to read and appreciate the immature and ridiculous passion of Heathcliff. Maybe I missed my chance to appreciate this novel. Still, I don't understand why so many teenagers actually like it. How is this an example of true love? How is abuse and vile retribution against others romantic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel, is very different from her famous sisters', and critical opinion in the last few decades has decided it is the best of them, which truly says much. It first got mixed reviews but has continually risen to the point where it topped a recent poll of the greatest love stories, showing that it is one of the few classics with true mass appeal. Wuthering is indeed a masterpiece with a thrilling story, superb characterization, stunning prose, and more than a little sociopolitical relevance. Its power has enthralled readers for over a century and a half and shows no sign of lessening.The story itself is one of the most immediately engrossing elements. Tightly plotted and deftly executed, it draws us in irresistibly and never lets go; those afraid of classic literature because they think it boring, pretentious, or portentous should know this is a striking exception. It is the kind of tale that does not come off well in summary, as the blank faces staring at me when I gave a college presentation on it prove. Though short for a Victorian novel at about three hundred pages, the complex multi-generational plot is told via flashbacks, nested narration, etc. Suffice is to say that the action is intensely dramatic and highly emotional; it is drenched in pathos and runs us through a gamut of other emotions. It reaches a fever pitch quite soon and hardy lets up - a story of true immediacy and intensity. With its time jumping and non-linearity, the complicated delivery creates significant suspense, and we become supremely interested.The key to the book's success, though, is surely its characters. Many are vividly and memorably drawn with stunning realism and often with great sympathy; we truly feel with and for them. Catherine, the initial female lead, is one of Victorian literature's more striking heroines; an essentially unconventional woman stuck in a time and place where convention reigned unchecked, she has great passions that find no vent. She loves Heathcliff but cannot bring herself to defy society enough to marry him. Her character thus subtly critiques Victorian society, showing how oppressive mores were detrimental to many, especially women, crushing their spirit and denying them happiness.Heathcliff himself is of course the most famous character and the one most attractive to many. As a heterosexual man, I have never been able to see his appeal; he seems overwhelmingly selfish and cruel with almost no redeeming qualities. However, I have seen women discuss him as if he were not only real but the Sexiest Man Alive - even ones who have never read Wuthering! He seems to be among many women's favorite characters ever and, I suspect, is a large part of the reason the book topped the poll. What makes him so attractive is a very interesting question; I assume it is a combination of his profound passion - along with its consequent romantic and sexual potential - plus his bad boy status. He is in some ways the prototypical bad boy, living by his own code and not caring what others think - bravely and boldly original. One may well wonder how or why women excuse his sadistic qualities, but he certainly stands well above the drab gentlemen populating most Victorian fiction. They are stuck in a time warp, but he is distinctly alive, as much a part of our day - nay, any day - as his own. Even putting subjective attraction aside, though, he is undeniably fascinating, if far from traditionally likable. This is in one sense because, like Shakespeare's Richard III, he is upfront about his villainy - nay, positively revels in it. He does not try to hide his nature, and there is something perversely admirable in how he carefully meditates and follows his plans. More fundamentally, he is more sinned against than sinning; his detestable qualities surely stem in great part from his brutal upbringing. This not only makes him a sort of sympathetic figure - and certainly one of pathos - but also raises very currently relevant questions about parents and guardians' responsibility for their children's actions later in life. The topic received almost no mainstream, much less legal, attention until the last few decades, showing just how far ahead of her time Bronte was here as in many other ways.Of course no one can discuss the book without mentioning the love story, which in its way is one of the most monumentally engrossing. However, that it was ranked first truly surprises because it has nothing like a happy ending and is indeed a thwarted love tale; Catherine and Heathcliff do not even get as much time together as Romeo and Juliet. The depth of their passion despite this is surely a large part of the attraction, but it may very well be that the lack of consummation - not just in the physical sense - is precisely what moves so many. Love is perhaps the most universal feeling, but the rarity of its being requited - much less reaching full mutual fruition - is truly tragic. The sad truth is that, whatever happy love stories' escapist value, far more people can relate to unhappy ones. Wuthering's is bitterly familiar to the countless people who have loved only from afar, displaying the wretched phenomenon's broken feelings and often fatal consequences with stirring verisimilitude and extreme emotional vitality. The many who have been in similar situations will feel a great personal connection, but even those who have not will have great sympathy for this unfortunately common dark side of human experience.Some of the novel's social criticism clearly comes into play here, and it is to society's credit that things have changed to the point where very few would disdain a Catherine/Heathcliff union. Yet some of the love's story's other fundamental elements remain just as relevant - are indeed as old as humanity and will surely last as long as we do. It shows the dramatically high pitch that passion and other emotions can reach even - or perhaps particularly - when they have no release. Many works show love's greatness, but Wuthering is remarkable for showing its dark side; the heart has terrible truths hiding just beneath ostensible calm that can storm out at any time - often with dire results. The novel does not flinch from displaying how our most primitive emotions can easily have savage effects; if love brings out the best in humanity, it can at least as easily bring out the worst. Perhaps no classic love story is less sentimental or otherwise traditional; this made it stand out distinctly amid many superficially similar Victorian tales, but it would be unusual in any era. Critics did not like to see the unadorned display of mental and physical cruelty, but less prudish later eras have seen its terrible truth. Bronte seemed to have a profound understanding of elemental feelings and stark knowledge of the beastly facts about men and women in love, which seems near-preternatural considering her sheltered life. It is almost enough to make one believe her muse was truly inspired in the external sense so often described by artists but so hard for others to even conceive. No one can read this without a sense of the incalculable loss to literature when such a genius was cut off so early; that she did not live to write more novels is truly regrettable. However she did it, she clearly drew inspiration from a well at human nature's very heart, which is why the book continues to strike such deep chords so powerfully.The younger generation's love story is of course far more traditionally placid. It is nearly as compelling in its way and introduces important poetic justice and irony issues but takes a definite backseat. Those not as responsive to - or who repress - stormy passions may find it more relatable, but it serves primarily as a useful contrast for most readers. If nothing else, it proves Wuthering is more nuanced and subtle than one might think given its melodramatic reputation.All this implies a strong realist perspective, which the book certainly has, but it also belongs to the gothic school so common in the nineteenth century with all its associated supernatural overtones. Requisite ghost aside, we get among other such elements an immense storm that is not only a pathetic fallacy but seems to have some kind of paranormal, perhaps divinely-controlled, significance. The vivid North England moor setting contributes substantially to all this; the novel imbues the strongly, if unconventionally, picturesque setting with a near-magical air, describing it with great believability and stunning originality. Wuthering is one of the main reasons that the area has long had great, near-occult sway in the popular imagination. As all this suggests, the book also has more than a dash of Romanticism. Like most great works, it is hard to classify, the mix of genres and styles forming a magic all its own.A final noteworthy aspect is the deceptively simple prose. Despite the relative conciseness and lack of the florid description that turns so many off to Victorian fiction, Bronte manages to describe her setting at least as clearly and memorably as authors with far thicker works. The landscapes and manors are drawn with stark beauty; no one who reads Wuthering will soon forget them. The narrative, especially in the direct first-person segments, impresses with a spare yet lush style. Bronte knows exactly what words are needed to make her points not only clear but memorable - and, in the case of the immaculately worded and brilliantly portrayed last paragraph, simply unforgettable. Hard as the book is to summarize, it is easy to read in the best sense; those who have had trouble getting into other classic works may be at ease, as this is one of the few books as great as it is accessible - which removes the final excuse for the small number who have not already read and loved it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a well-red audiobook- the pacing is good, the enunciation is clear and the reader varies the vocal color enough to make individuals identifiable during dialogues. My only quibble is that a few characters (most notably Joseph) are rendered in dialect so authentic as to be hard to understand."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though this may be a romance, it isn't one in the Nora Roberts sense of the word (thankfully). Rather, it is a romance in the Shakespearian sense that it is neither comedy nor tragedy. It does have romantic aspects sprinkled throughout, but that is not the most important aspect. Rather, it is a dark, brooding novel that focuses far more on loss, revenge, and the deterioration of the human soul than it does on love or anything else the average person might conceive of as \\"romantic.\\"In many ways, it parallels Milton's Paradise Lost, if in a metaphorical sense. We have Heathcliff as the devil (as he is often referred to throughout) and his fall from grace. We have both Catherines as Eve-type characters in slightly different ways, and as I explain below, it is their choices (often under the infernal influence of Heathcliff) that determine the future of the narrative, much as Eve's choice determines the future of humanity. We even have the loss of paradise toward the end, but with the hope of eventual salvation and a return thereto (i.e., as Paradise Regained is suggested in the last book of Milton's epic).The characters of Wuthering Heights are a generally unlikable bunch of flawed human beings provoking and being provoked by each other. Strikingly realistic for a \\"romantic\\" novel. It is the strong, independent women of the novel who are the foundational characters around which the book revolves. They are the focus of attention, and it is only through them that the male characters are able to accomplish whatever ends they set out to accomplish. In fact, one of the main struggles of the book can be seen as the attempts of the women to remain independent of the male characters' repeated attempts at subjugation and control. Interestingly, it is always the women who end up with the choice as to result will prevail in each battle of this war.In this sense, Wuthering Heights can be seen as a feminist novel, but not as a preaching one. Rather, Bronte seems to strive for the reader to understand the strength and resiliency of her women through their subtle control of the narrative and their resistence to the constant pressure that the male characters exert from attempting to take that power away. One final example of this is through the framing of the narrative itself. Though superficially told by Mr. Lockwood, he is initially relating Ellen Dean's story verbatim through the first half of the book. However, halfway through, he discards Ellen and \\"summarizes\\" the story she told him off-screen. In other words, he attempts to dominate the telling of the narrative as Heathcliff, Edgar, Hareton, and Hindley attempt to dominate the women of the novel at various points. Yet, like all the other dominations throughout the novel, this narrative domination fails as well. Ultimately, Ellen is able to reassert herself as the official storyteller over the last few chapters, but what was the effect of losing her immediate voice for the intermediate period, I'll leave up to you to interpret. I'm still working it out myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to say it: I did not like the book. I willingly admit that Emily Bronte had heaps of talent and writes beautifully, but I couldn't bring myself to like any character in the book. They all seemed, rude, selfish, and insane to me, and there were very few or no aspects in which I could relate to or sympathize with them. In short, I have nothing against the writer, and her style, but the plot and characters in this story, are in my opinion, overdone and stretched beyond believability."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow! I may be only twelve, but this is a wonderfull book! I enjoy reading classics, this one especialy. Despite the author growing up with an excentric father in a house far removed from the rest of humanity, she was able to create a wonderfull book of friendship, love and tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what people see in this book. I found it irritating from the start -- all the characters are thoroughly unlikeable. After slogging my way through a quarter of the book, I found I still couldn't care less what happened to these people.The writing is also painfully verbose and florid. For a better story, I would have been willing to cope with it, but here it was just another reason to put the book down and never pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought I was going give this a bad rating because I hated Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw so much that I couldn't bear to read any more, but that's the reason why I gave it high marks! It's been awhile since a novel has brought out such feelings in me! Frankly, Cathy and Heathcliff deserved one another; I hated Cathy because she was so selfish she did not deserve to be loved by anyone with a good heart, like Edgar; I hated Heathcliff because he was such a monster with no heart towards anyone else other than Cathy. I was sick to my stomach the way he punished those around him. I don't know why Heathcliff was so fond of Cathy either. There was nothing about her to love! I loved Missus Dean though. She had the strongest spirit and I found her a refreshing character amidst the madness of all the others. This book was incredibly tragic and even hard to get through because it is such a downer. It's like when you think it couldn't get worse, it does! I didn't give the book 5 stars, however, because I found the ending weak and abrupt. Other than that, a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend the novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. The plot is clear and simple to understand but it is charged with energy throughout the whole book. When Emily Bronte writes there are no questions as to what she means about scenes that she describes. She does this through her choice of words. She always gives a clear description of places and people. Heathcliff and Catherine are her most passionate characters in this novel. She expresses their love and devotion to each other by their actions through out the whole novel. She does not come out and tell the reader things, she makes them use their imagination and interpret scenes and characters themselves.One of the negative aspects to this novel is the ability to understand the vocabulary. Bronte uses a lot of extensive vocabulary through out the whole novel and this makes some of the sentences and scenes hard to comprehend. This is because Bronte knows exactly what she wants her readers to get or see out of Wuthering Heights.One of the main themes in this novel is love and hate. Catherine is a prime example of this theme. Her feelings for her husband, Edgar, and her feelings toward Heathcliff should be in reverse. Through out the whole novel she loves Heathcliff. The hate comes into play because Heathcliff hates Edgar because he with Catherine and he is not with Catherine. He hates anyone that tries to come in between him and Catherine.The characterization of the characters by Bronte was very excellent. She lets the reader know certain characteristics of the characters by scenes and background information. She demonstrates certain connections between different sets of characters very well. For example the scene when Heathcliff and Catherine went to see the two Linton children it compares both sets to each other.Overall this book is interesting and has many different themes and interesting topics. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading and likes different characters and plots. Although the vocabulary at times is hard to understand it can be dealt with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of all the things committed to paper, why on Earth was it this? Having been forced to read this tripe under penalty of death in high school, and then once again in college, I must say that death is welcome. Oh poor poo-poo Heathcliff the Brooding and Catherine the ill fated strumpet. Yawn. Emily Bronte lived one of those lives like that of the other Emily, you know, Dickenson, who is another pile of rubbish altogether. Lonely days and cold nights with her father, and no hot little encounters with a horny gardener from Spain. All Emily Bronte needed was a good tango, but I fear that she was too chaste. And so the world must bear the weight of this tragedy, of its endless reprints which will mark the end of Time. Of course you can love this book and curl up with it at night as if it were your secret lover, or teddy bear, (Even if your teddy bear is your secret lover.) and listen to that song by Michael Penn, or whoever wrote that piece of yack. I don't care. I believe that this book sucks, and it is not worthy of being in the Canon. It should be banished to the realm of Cheesy Teeny-Bopperazzi Romance Goo in the back of a used book store somewhere in Northern Alberta."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was put through this 'book' when studying Higher English. It is undoubtedly the single worst piece of literature I have ever had to read. What is worse that I had to read it twice, take notes, answer questions, memorize quotes, and in 9 days am sitting an exam in which it will feature rather heavily. You cannot truly hate a book until you have studied it in detail. The problem with it is the fact that about half the words in the book are adjectives. E. Bronte spends so long lavishing useless and totally superfluous descriptions on every scene that I dozed off and missed any point that the events may have had. Then there is Heathcliff, who actually does very little, but merely has circumstances favour him about a dozen times - and he's supposed to be one of the most evil characters ever? The rest of the characters are not much better - they are flat and predictable, although I can't imagine why anyone would be interested enough to wonder about what's going to happen. By the end, I was wondering if I'd fallen asleep and missed the climax - which would have been possible - but I could account for every excruciating page and therefore I can only conclude that the trivial, unsurprising non-events that the narrative lurched between were supposed to be climactic. If this is a classic story, then so is an eight-page picture book that's only strength is very detailed - but not well-drawn - pictures.

Since then I have read literally thousands of books. And of them all, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is my least favorite. The characters are so unpleasant and cruel to each other that reading the book is a seemingly endless nightmare. It seems that almost everyone in the story eventually dies some physically or psychologically horrible death, and the two major characters other than the two first-person narrators get engaged to each other at the end in an attempt to give the book a bizarre happy ending. About the only good thing about the book is its intriguing narrative structure, in which a man sets down in his diary a long first-person narrative told him by a woman who sometimes repeats briefer stories told her in the first person by others, such as Catharine. Even this, though, is rendered irritating by the fact that the diarist is such an boring and annoying character. I would never have continued reading this book beyond the first few chapters had it not been a school assignment, and I felt a greater sense of relief when I finished it than on any other occasion in my life. To quote what C. S. Lewis once wrote on the last page of a book he had read (I forget which one), &quot;Never again.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Don't buy this book without reading carefully the description.

I first read it when I was 15 and hated it. I couldn't understand what the appeal was about these savage, ruthless, selfish characters. I was obsessed with Jane Eyre, but Wuthering Heights seemed a distant, incomphrehensible world. But now, nearly 20 years later, I have a better appreciation of it. It really is worth reading - just persevere through the first 50 pages or so, and you'll be sucked in.I haven't seen the Laurence Olivier film, but am curious now to see how this bleak and twisted world is portrayed on screen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is not the creepiest classic in existance, but it is delightfully morbid, what with insane make-out sessions with corpses, and still has a beautiful ending and a bit of happiness in the last chapter. However, I have heard so many people call it boring or difficult to read that I have become apalled and have lost hope for the future of the human race.The characters of Wuthering Heights are the element of the book most frequently attacked. But Heathcliff is NOT evil!! How would anyone feel, never wanted by anyone in their entire life but one woman, and then to be cast off by that same woman? How would anyone feel in his shoes? He is a git and he is a dreadful person, but he is a complex and layered character, deeply troubled and very well written. As for everybody else, not a one is really likeable, but not a one is evil. They are only what they world has made them, Cathy the younger spoiled and Hindley abused. And if you still don't like them? Well, take comfort that most of them die.My second point is that this book is NOT hard to read. The gamekeeper's dialogue is, granted, impossible. But he hardly talks anyway. Also, the family tree is equally difficult, but it helps to draw your own as you go along. However, other than that the text is simple and the plot-line straightforward. The beauty is in the descriptions.This is a love story of epic proportions. It doesn't illustrate the beauty of love until the end, but also incorporated is platonic love of family and friends. Yet nevertheless, love triumphs upon the finale, and it does truly tell of true love. True love isn't perfect, but it is, in essence, everlasting. And this book tells of nothing if not everlasting love: \\"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.\\" - Catherine Linton (once Catherine Earnshaw), relating to Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a Morose book this is! This is the first book that I have read by the Bronte sisters. I was really looking forward to it. It begins with the story of Mr. Lockwood entering the house of Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) and the reader finding out that the people inhabiting the house are just nasty. This includes Heathcliff, Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Some have indicated that this is a love story. I am not so sure of that. It is clear in the story that Heathcliff was in love with Catherine (the elder) and was deeply hurt when she married Edgar. He goes off for three years and returns with money. However, where and how he got his money is never explained in the story.Now that he has returned, it is Heathcliff's intention to get revenge on those that he believed have wronged him. This includes Hindley, Catherine's brother, Edgar, Hareton, Linton (his own son) and Isabella. If he cannot get his revenge on those that wronged him, he will get it on the children of those that wronged him such as Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Shortly after he returns, Catherine (the elder) dies but not before giving birth to her and Edgar's dauther Catherine. By this time though, Heathcliff has married Isabella, Edgar's sister. Heathcliff wants to get his hands on Thrushcross Grange since this is the home of Edgar and Catherine. On the day after he is married to Isabella, he basically tells her that he married her to get possession of Thrushcross Grange.It is at this point that I realized that Heathcliff was an evil person. It is also at this point that I no longer considered the novel to be a love story. Heathcliff's love has now been turned into hatred. He has one thing on this mind and that is to make those around him miserable.When he returns to Wuthering Heights, Hindley is a drunk and an gambler. Hindley's son Hareton will inherit Wuthering Heights but Heathcliff gives money to Hindley and now becomes the mortgagor of the property so that when Hindley dies Heathcliff becomes the owner of Wuthering Heights.If Edgar dies without Catherine being married she will inherit Thrushcross Grange. When Edgar gets a letter from his sister, Isabella (remember that is Heathcliff's wife) that she is dying and wants him to take care of her son, Linton (Heathcliff's son too), he goes and gets him from near London. On the night of their return, Heathcliff sends Joseph to get him. The next day Linton leaves to live a Wuthering Heights. Given his condition, he gets Linton to correspond with Catherine but since Nelly and Edgar are standing in the way of their marriage, he forces Catherine to marry Linton. Therefore, when Edgar dies Thrushcross Grange becomes the property of Linton. Linton, being sickly through the whole bood, soon dies and wills the Thrushcross Grange to Heathcliff. At this time, Catherine, Hareton, and Heathcliff are all living at Wuthering Heights and he rents Thrushcross Grange to Mr. Lockwood.At the time Catherine (the elder) dies, Heathcliff asks that her ghost haunt him. In the last couple of chapters, it appears that Heathcliff continually sees Catherine's ghost. Heathcliff fails to eat and eventually dies. At that time, Hareton and Catherine are falling in love, which is the only happy part in the book (other than Heathcliff dying).All in all, this is a very dark story. This is a story of love (at first) and then hatred. This is a story of how hatred can destroy a person as well as those around him. It is a good story but I don't consider this a love story. Heathcliff is an evil person that never changes his ways of making other miserable. He enjoys making other miserable. I liked the book but it is just a little too dark for me to give it a five star rating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was recommended this book under the theme of Love and Romance but its so not Love....hate or greed would better describe it.This book is beautifully written however,among the best I've read.

This book has been on my mind for quite some time after reading it.If you like good drama...this is the book for you...love, hate, obsession,abuse,marriage,separation, death,.....yes...this is DRAMA. I loved it.Some points I wanted to stop because it was evoking too much emotions but the suspence was too much. Its that good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this book as a part of a literature class I took. When informed of my assignment, I was neither enthused or diappointed. I am always interested in reading something new, however I was unfamiliar with Wuthering Heights and did not know what to expect. I started reading it and by the third chapter, I was hooked. This book it probably the most painfully romantic novel ever. Unfortunately, the emotions this book arouses are unable to be put into words. Like a previous reviewer said, this book \\"has a certain something.\\" That it does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the sad tale of thwarted love between two soulmates destined to be apart. Cathy and Heathcliff were one in being, but two in person and this was a torture neither got over.It's bitter sweet and painful to read at some points, but the love of Hareton and Catherine in the end makes one wonder if THEY were the ones destined for happiness, not Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS was the most amazing book I have ever read. It's characters are so unique and unlike any displayed in any other novels. The characters are so realistic; so flawed, so horrible, yet able to be sympatized with by the reader. They leave us wondering why they take the actions they take while still making us feel emotion for even Heathcliff, the cruel revenge-seeker who spends many years divising a plan to ruin the lives of the people whom he hates. Emily Bronte is a genius and her book should not be insulted just because certain readers can not appreciate the beauty of this intense story of love and revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you've always wanted to read one of the great works of literature, but was intimidated by the lengthy volumes, long-winded sentences and complicated language, then you may want to direct your attention toward \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Perhaps the most famous novel penned by one of the three Bronte sisters (though Charlotte Bronte comes a very close second with \\"Jane Eyre\\"), \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is reasonably easy to read, with straightforward narrative, fluid pace and of slim length. Though the content will definitely not appeal to everyone, it is an approachable novel in terms of readability.The story is predominately a love story, though a love story that is haunted by revenge, jealously, hate, greed and death; all the juicy stuff that people are magnetically drawn to. Heathcliff is a young foundling boy, brought to Wuthering Heights by his foster-father Mr Earnslaw. Mr Earnslaw indulges the small boy, but his wife and his eldest son Hindley are repulsed by the half-wild creature and treat him no better than an animal, though they are held back by Mr Earnslaw's influence. But it is in Cathy that Heathcliff finds his soul mate, and the children spend hours together, roaming the wilderness like gypsies, utterly inseparable. But the two are not angels: masters at manipulation and conniving, Cathy and Heathcliff are experts at shaping their household to suit their own tastes with total disregard to anyone beyond themselves; Cathy in particular delights in tormenting her father by doing \\"just what he hated most, showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do her bidding in anything, and his only when it suited his inclination.\\"But when Mr Earnslaw dies, the disgruntled Hindley returns to Wuthering Heights and immediately relegates Heathcliff to the servants-quarters. From here stems the rivalry and hatred that marks the central tragedy of the book, as Heathcliff and the two predominant families of the area: the Earnslaws and the Lintons, fight amongst each other in a bitter feud for power, love, the land and the estate, in a struggle that continues down into the next generation. Each individual seems to achieve a sense of power and control over others briefly, only to loose it again via a marriage or death, and the plot twists and turns though many intrigues and mysteries.It is Heathcliff in the centre of this storm, determined to avenge himself against those who have wronged him: \\"I don\`t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last\\", and though he is the main character of the book, he is certainly best described as an \\"anti-hero\\", and many new readers are somewhat taken back with the idea that he is the central figure. In one shocking moment, he saves the life of his enemy's son - almost accidentally - and immediately regrets taking such action. He's an enigma that's for certain, as he has no last name and nothing is known of his past before he's brought to Wuthering Heights; his personality is unintentionally captured in the name his foster family bestow on him, reflecting the wild atmosphere of the setting: \`heath' and \`cliff'. Heathcliff and Catherine are a \\"heathen pair\\" as the narrative would say, and the reader is not expected to like or admire them; but as characters they are utterly fascinating and one can't help but envy the extraordinary bond between them.In terms of the narration, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is indeed unique. Not told by an omnipotent third-person voice, the tale is told to a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange - Mr Lockwood - by the former housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, Mrs Dean. This makes the levels of storytelling quite complex, for at some points (for example) we are hearing Catherine's testimony, as told to Mrs Dean, as she narrates to Mr Lockwood, who then records it for the audience. Anyone's whose played Chinese Whispers will know that stories change in the passing on from one person to each other, and the reader is challenged to untangle the gossip of Mrs Dean and the blandness of Mr Lockwood's records to uncover the true passion of the lives involved. It is a challenge you should relish.In terms of genre, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" can almost be considered the \\"poster-child\\" of Gothic literature, as almost every component of it caters to the \\"dark and stormy night\\" mentality of the Gothic style and narration; from vivid nightmares to the rugged landscape to the almost insane desires and fears of its characters, this novel is the very definition of \\"Gothic\\". Whenever you're in the mood for a dose of the twisted and heavy tones of the Gothic, then you should definitely have \\"Wuthering Heights\\" at hand. The critic Richard Chase says it best when he says Bronte was inspired by: \\"the sheer romantic exhilaration of escape from culture itself, into a world where nature is dire, terrible and beautiful, where human values are personal, alien and renunciatory, and where contradictions are to be resolved only by death...\\" No other critical quote I've read better describes the sheer melodrama of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" than this.Ultimately, the book is about opposites and extremes, and the very fine line that exists between them; between light and dark, man and woman, humanity and animalism, the wild and civilisation, and love which exists to both heal and destroy people. In gentle comparison to Heathcliff's soul-consuming love that prays Catherine's ghost will return to haunt him, is Catherine's quiet but absolute declaration that: \\"whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same\\".Wow. I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the best novels I have evr read. The passions of which were intwined within the characters' was described so deeply that I could feel the pain so strongly as if I were the character myself.When Catherine and Heathcliff were blaming each other for breaking each other's hearts, I cried hysterrically. The love and friendship between the couple was so intimately written that you could feel the different melodies of their ongoing reasonings. Cathy accused Heathlcliff of murdering her, for having wanted her to choose between himself and Edgar. Cathy told Heathcliff that she did not care how he wold suffer without her for he broke her heart in such a way, that he did not even care for her sufferings. Heathcliff fired back exclaming that instead Cathy had killed herself for vowing to be with Edgar. He also said that forgetting Cathy would be forgetting his very existence. \\" I love my murderer, but yours, how can I?\\" This would have to be one of my fvorite quotes from the novel. Even thought that line is so short, it means so much. This line revealed the intensity of his feelings torwards Cathy; that it hurt him so much to see her in such a state of illness and emotional sufferings, felt for him.I hate to say it, but what made this story so interesting was the evil doings accomplished by Heathcliff. The vigorating acts such as the enforcing of the marriage of Cathy and Linton was thought out by Heathcliff so cleverly, that it amused me, in it's own devilish way.This novel touched emotions of passion, love and hate that it made me think deeper about the \\"inside\\" of a relationship between a man and a woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My high school students liked this edition of Wuthering Heights because of the slightly larger print and the glossary and vocabulary section in the back of the book. They felt that this edition was easier to read and, because of the additional information in the back of the book, understand."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although some of the plot elements seem preposterous today the story remains a great read. What a love story! A great tale of people sometimes setting in motion awful events due to their desire to do what they see as right in their own eyes. Recommended. Well-written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Instead of focus on sad love story, I have quite differnet perspectives to approach. I have a view that their tragically unfulfilled love was something that they could have overcome sufficiently by themselves although there were a lot of psychological and social pressures. Those external factors were merely a word 'pressure'. True obstacle was existed in Catherine itself. Even after she married to Edgar, her fluctuations of mind was psychologically abnormal and very egoistic in some point of view. For fulfillment of metaphysical areas, she was always craved the Heathcliff and for materialistic basis she wanted the Edgar. It is a typical ambivalent feeling that we should avoid. In addtion, it is pretty romantic but these excessive histronic characteristics of this prose made me tired partially. Thus, we should not only focus on sad love story affairs but also about implications that truly inculcate matters between human being throughout this long fable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In addition to the complete text of Wuthering Heights, this volume contains selected poems of Emily Bronte and articles of criticism by such noted authors as E. M Forster and Mark Shorer. Shorer's essay is an introduction to another edition and provides background information on Emily Bronte and her family, a valuable \\"family tree\\" of the characters in W. H., and a perceptive interpretation of the novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"bronte's story of life on the moors in england revolves around the earnshaw and litton families. the \\"adopted\\" son of the earnshaw's, heathcliff, and his passion (i'm reluctant to call it love) for catherine, the legitimate daughter, is the centerpeice of the novel.heathcliff is probably one of the most evil characters in literature. he destroys everything in his path, including catherine. his motivation appears to be revenge, but his actions go well beyond a reasoned response and continues thru subsequent generations to innocent offspring. the imagery surrounding heathcliff and the moors helps create the ominous setting. heathcliff actually appears to be possessed either by the devil or by catherine as she exclaims, \\"i am heathcliff.\\"the story ends somewhat ironically in that all that heathcliff has achieved in his revenge is overturned by the next generation.the shortcoming of the story is that heathcliff is beyond the pale. how can catherine love him when he is the devil incarnate? the story which takes on a ghostlike quality particularly at the end, would have been better as a haunting of heathcliff rather than a tale of revenge. heathcliff could have been a very sympathetic character and you would have then cared about what happened to him.but then again who am i to challenge a classic. read it on your own and decide."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is my favorite book. The characters in this book truly touched my heart. The characters, the story, the setting, are all so realistic, gripping, profoundly touching, it's hard to even describe the range of emotions one goes through when reading this book. I've read a wide variety of books: modern, classic, mystery, romance, suspense, drama; this book stuck with me more than all others. The last time I read it was several years ago, but I can still picture the scenes and hear the dialog. It is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is truely a classic novel. Bronte's wonderful tale of Heathcliff, mainly, is an excellent though provoking novel. It contains everything, and a reader who indulges in any genre of novels will no doubt love this story.This novel takes place on the moors in the late 1700's into 1802 England. Heathcliff is taken in by Mr. Earnshaw, owner of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff, becomes beloved by Cathrine Earnshaw, but despised by her brother Hindley. Catherine, however falls in love with Edgar Linton, heir to Thrushcross Grange. She denies Heathcliff's proposal, for she claims it to be too much of anm embarassment to marry him and marries Edgar Linton.

There is no doubt that Wuthering heights is a master piece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The writing is descriptive yet very structural, which, in turn has a lack of smoothness. The Yorkshire accent could have been better but all in all the story was a turn since quite a few that told me the story is sad. Sad indeed, but it didn't trigger my emotion. A story pleasantly told, it lacks little. The characters are brilliant; they're realistic and very human if not humane.It is a story to remember and a story to remember is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book filled with many complex characters, ranging from a self-righteous servant, to a dishonest housekeeper, to a saucy young lady, to a bitter old man. Emily Bronte did an excellent job of creating interesting characters and a riveting plotline. The book starts out in the \\"present\\" which is in the early 1800's. A couple chapters in, Mr. Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange asks his housekeeper what the deal is with his landlord, Mr. Heathcliff, and the others that Lockwood has met at Wuthering Heights. His housekeeper, Nelly, proceeds to relate the story of all that took place, going back three generations in time to begin the story. The book is filled with characters that you both like and hate at the same time, and the story is also an interesting study in betrayal, revenge, and forgiveness. The only negative comment I have about the book comes about the character Joseph. Joseph's speech is written in the dialect of the hills area of 19th century England, and is extremely difficult to read or understand. Many times, you as the reader will be able to infer from the surrounding text the general idea of what is being said, but it is often difficult. Overall, I think Wuthering Heights is an excellent book, and definitely worth a buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale of romance, bitterness, and forgiveness. It is a story that will leaving you feeling sorry for some characters and even bitter towards others. The beginning of the story introduces Heathcliff, a young boy who has had a hard childhood and been left alone. Bront leads you to feel sorry for him. Much of the book is the story of Heathcliff's life, and how it plays into the lives of the other characters. I see through Heathcliff's life a life lesson: through our difficulties in life, we have two choices. We can let these things make us stronger people, or we can let the troubles ruin us. Let's just say that Bront doesn't choose the \\"storybook\\" path for Heathcliff's life.This novel is one I would recommend reading. On this note, don't get discouraged reading the first few chapters--they were the most difficult of the book. Once you get past these, and begin to understand the story line, Wuthering Heights is an enjoyable book. If you don't like a typical romance, read this book anyway! There's nothing typical about it. Bront filled her pages with anger, passion, romance, and various emotions. She will capture your attention as you become entangled in the web of confused relationship between Edgar and Catherine, Catherine and Heathcliff, Cathy and Linton and others."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale filled with love, hate and the unexpected on every page. Three generations of characters are portrayed, each having a distinct personality and story. The main character, Heathcliff's situation and position as a young child causes the reader to have sympathy. It may even leave the person with a sense of grief and sorrow for the child who seems to be the victim of the plot. Don't be fooled! Heathcliff deserves not to be seen as a victim but rather a villain for the agony, grieve, and heartache that he inflicts on so many lives. The novel picks up rather slowly and takes a number of chapters before the reader is best able to understand the major characters. The plot twists and turns and is filled with enticing details to keep the reader engaged.I would highly encourage reading this only work by Emily Bronte. While this book will cause the reader to feel a mixture of emotions it is definitely a must read. Determine for yourself whether you feel sympathy for Heathcliff or you think he is the heinous villain who causes the unease and chaos found in almost every chapter. This work left me cringing at many of the terrible details but all and all it is a tremendous piece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book about love and forgiveness. Emily Bronte keeps our attention through the passion of the main characters and powerful quotes such as, \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be.....Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in mind: not as a pleasure......but as my own being.\\"Bronte's book starts out kind of slow, but as you continue reading through, the story picks up and captures your attention. The dynamic of the characters and their relationships with one another brings such enthusiasm to the story that as you read through, you find yourself becoming a part of the story- you find yourself wanting to tell Nelly Dean to speak up and stop withholding information and you want talk to Catherine and tell her to give Heathcliff a chance and you want to tell Heathcliff that he needs to forgive so many people in his life so that he can have a chance at a real and peaceful life! Bronte does an excellent job bringing her characters to life.The story also has an element of surprise woven throughout- which keeps you coming back to continue reading through each chapter. Bronte goes through three generations of this particular family in a way that is captivating and exciting. As the story unfolds you get to see how each character is related to the other while discovering why they are like they are- you realize why Heathcliff is so bitter and why Hareton is so under-educated and why young Catherine is living with her father-in-law and cousins.The ending is not as satisfying as the rest of the book, but it does end in a uniquely mysterious way.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&nodeID;="},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first time I heard of Wuthering Heights, was honestly when I was reading one of the Twilight series novels and the main character was reading it. So, I was glad to have the opportunity to read this and see what it was all about. After finishing it, I still would recommend reading this book. It is truly an interesting love story. Now, even though it is a love story, I bet you have not read about this kind of love. It is a tragic and dark story of a passionate and consuming devotion. Emily Bronte had the ability to intertwine the love between Catherine and Heathcliff in every scene and relationship the characters shared. Bronte uses great description of her characters as the narrator, Nelly, tells the of the lives at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. What you should know before you read this, is that some of the language of the servants is hard to understand. However, try to push through it and you will be able to get a rough understanding of what the character was trying to say. Besides this, Wuthering Heights will keep you entertained and wondering who's love is true and how the novel concludes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteI wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I picked up Wuthering Heights to read from my one college course, but I was, over time, pleasantly surprised. The first five chapters proved, for me, to be the most challenging, simply because I was adapting to Bronte's writing style. Honestly, if you frequently read literature from this time period then you will have no problem settling in. It took no time to realize that Emily paid close to attention to the development of her characters. After finishing the book I felt extremely acquainted with each character, and felt almost a loss when I had to say goodbye. One of the things I struggled with was Joseph's dialogue throughout the book. He was hard to follow, and I can't help but say that it almost distracted from the plot in comparison to enhancing it. Bronte told one of the strangest love stories in relation to how each individual expressed their affections. It's a story that leaves the reader at times a little bit baffled at the outcome, but it also creates unprecedented twist in turns throughout the book. It's also a book that I believe has a huge amount to say about forgiveness, and can shed light on its importance through learning from others who make poor decisions. To be honest, there are very few books that transport you directly into the world of the writer like Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I would definitely classify Wuthering Heights as one of the best books I've read. Packed with drama and intrigue, this piece of art will keep you riveted throughout. Written in old English, it is absolutely fascinating how Emily Bronte pieced this intricate storyline together. Besides the slight difficulty in visualizing Joseph's speech, with a strong Yorkshire accent, I found it relatively easy to read. The chaos and insanity that pursues throughout this novel kept me coming back for more, with sadness when I reached the end because it was over. The characters are developed well through different circumstances, depicted through the eyes of the housekeeper, Nelly Dean - a conniving participant in the drama. Be prepared to have your emotions run away with you as you get caught up in the action. It's a great book to sit down and sift through on a cold, winter's day. I found the story very realistic in the portrayal of everyday choices made through these diverse, strange characters, and could even relate to them in some senses. This controversial book would be a great choice to use in a book club where you would have the opportunity to discuss the outcomes and potentials Bronte confronts."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Passion for the passionless: A battle of the hearts!Emily Bronte, though only in her 20's, manifested one of the most unforgettable dark love stories of all times. Though her book was not well received after it was first published, the volume and the positive feedback she has received hundreds of years later speaks in volumes for the masterful quality of Wuthering Heights! Standing in stark contrast with a fairy tale love story, Bronte embarked on a difficult quest of being realist lessons and qualities into the passion she was skillfully gifted with.Bronte developed and heighted this sensational love story through numerous characters in the story and throughout three generations. Such love unfolds with a girl named Catherine, raised in the moors of England, and a gypsy boy named Heathcliff, a homeless starving boy that was saved from death by Catherine's father. Through the years, their affection for one another turns into a wild passion that will stand through the tests and the trials they create. At the ages of 16 and 17 years old, a misunderstanding occurred between the two lovers and created a permanent wedge between them forever. Heathcliff had disappeared for three years and Catherine had married a passionless man, Edgar Linton. Tension picks back up when Heathcliff suddenly reappears on Catherine's doorstep, eager to rekindle the passion that he is so determined that they both shared. From this encounter, Catherine's heath declines and she later dies, but the last kiss she bears is Heathcliff's. Through her death comes life, as Catherine's last contribution to this world was a daughter named Cathy. During this time a young boy, Linton, was born to the wife of the miserable Heathcliff. After Catherine's death, Heathcliff becomes more revengeful and manipulating than ever. Though his aching from his heart adds fuel to his actions, Heathcliff soon masters in manipulating young Cathy to marry a sickly Linton when they get around the ages of 16 and 17. Though one can see the parallels in linking this relationship to the first, one also sees the difference of a selfless love that goes deeper than just emotions.As you read this novel, you will encounter many of the symbolic and realistic themes that are embedded throughout this novel. The forgiveness theme from this novel has impacted my life, for one can see that the revenge, bitterness, and hurt that Heathcliff lived under this whole life only put him in his grave faster and did not allow him to produce anything successful or hopeful. In addition, one can see a glimpse of what true love looks like. True love is not an emotion, an appearance, or even an action. It a selfless love that penetrates one's soul, like that of young Cathy and Hareton walking in the moors that looks beyond the faults and seeks to better the other person involved. As a fellow Christian, this love reminds me to that of the Biblical love in a marriage that we are too represent. Though I liked majority of the book, I disliked how Bronte used the old dialect for Joseph. I would highly encourage readers of this amazing book to get a published form that will have side notes at the bottom revealing what Joseph is talking about. I found that he didn't have a huge role in the book except for stability, but he does make some key statements that I felt the dialect lessened the importance of their intended impact. I would encourage anyone who is interested in this book to buy a copy and read it! It truly is a classic on every level. It gives a whole new light into the human depths of a romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the name of the house where the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine takes place.

It's really hard to explain without spoiling the book. The best way that I can explain, is that a rich girl falls in love with a servant, and is \\"not allowed\\" to be with him, because of the standards of the time, (the late 1700s). The story follows the lives of these two individuals and what happens to them in their lives.Like I said before, this was an interesting plot.

Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier.

A must read!If you love the book, the best movie version is the 1939 one.I don't get the people who didn't like this book--what were the words too big?But all in all, there is a reason why Wuthering Heights is called one of the greatest love stories and pieces of literature of our time!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know it's a classic, and I appreciate that it's well written; however, the characters are just not awful, especially the protagonist."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i have read it before but enjoyed it just as much the 2nd time.

These hoary old classics such as WH or JANE EYRE or Thomas Hardy's output or Dickens along with hundreds of others have withstood the test of time for a reason, and although they may not be to everyone's taste, they won't need any help from me to keep their place on bookshelves. My problem has always been one of 'familiarity with a book's cover breeds contempt'. I've seen copies of WUTHERING HEIGHTS for about as long as I've been able to read; I've seen it so often there comes a point where I convince myself that I already know what the novel is, since I know (from dust jacket material) what it's _about_.WUTHERING HEIGHTS also suffers from the image of its film adaptations (none of which I've seen). Still, it's hard to have lived anywhere but under a rock and not have seen at least snatches of Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier in the 1939 film, or any of the more recent remakes. Those glimpses have always made me consider WUTHERING HEIGHTS as a ghostly gothic romance, although it is really nothing of the sort. Instead it is a wildly fierce tale of obsession and revenge, implacably engineered by the monstrous Heathcliff, who seems more a force of nature than simply a human. And yet, the revenge motif - while guiding the bulk of the tale - is in itself only part of what constitutes the power in the novel. The mix of primal emotions and the veneer of civiliation together standing out in stark relief agains the unearthly backdrop of the moors suggests mythic archetypes in the mold of Tristan and Isolde. To think that this novel came from the mind of a twenty-nine-year-old 'reclusive spinster in a rural Yorkshire parsonage' (from Diane Johnson's introduction), is at once baffling and intimidating.For those readers who may have looked at this book over the years and passed by from a mistaken idea - as I did - that you already knew the contents, I would highly recommend taking a few days to actually crack the covers. While it isn't a perfect book, there's no question of its forcefulness, and even if it doesn't exactly strike your fancy, you'll know for sure why it is that you've avoided it. For other, younger readers, I would also recommend it as an excellent addition to your reading list. In my few years of reading, I don't think I've read anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Who knew the classics could be so entertaining!

I purchased this to read it again. That should tell you how much I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"RIVETING PLOT. HARD TO PUT DOWN AND WHEN YOU DO YOU WONDER WHAT WILL BE NEXT SO STRONGLY YOU HAVE TO START READING AGAIN. I LIKE THE THIRD PERSON STORY TELLING FORMAT."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I found this book quite confusing at first, as you are just thrown into the situation and most of the story is disclosed through a narrative by the housemaid to a new tenant. I'm also just starting to get used to the way people were referred to back in those times. One character can wear many names: Miss Earnshaw, Miss Catherine, Missy, Cathy, Mrs. Linton; makes it appear there are five characters right there instead of just one. Although I did eventually figure out that Cathy was actually Catherine's daughter, but I still have a hard time keeping characters straight in classic books.While I probably wouldn't classify this book as a page turner, when I do set it down, I don't set it down for long. I often can't wait to pick it up and hear more of the story, hoping it will all makes sense eventually. One is told the characters at the present time of the book, the housekeeper starts her story with a completely different situation, and as the story unfolds I cannot help but wonder what could possibly transpire to get the cast of characters where they are \\"today\\".I'm torn between hatred of Heathcliff and pity. Was he heartless because he was a scoundrel or because his heart had been broken to bits?I still find it hard to understand dialogue when it is spelled phonetically based on the character's speech patterns. Mark Twain is also known for doing this. I find it easiest to read these passages aloud and pray my family doesn't think I am nuts. But still I found that I couldn't understand a word that Joseph said. The gist of what I did get from him, he probably wasn't saying anything very nice anyhow. It doesn't seem that he had ever heard the adage \\"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\\". I'd have sacked his sorry butt and sent him packing if I had been lord of the manor.Is it just me or were people more apt to fall ill back then? The housekeeper/narrator had been out in the rain and gotten her feet wet. As a result she was bed ridden for THREE weeks. Jane Bennet, in Pride and Prejudice, was sick for months after getting caught in the rain. One could argue that we have better doctors today, though I'm not sure I would agree, or that they didn't have Nyquil back then. Personally, I often get caught in the rain without need of either a visit to my general quacktitioner or over the counter cold medicines. There were other illnesses where the cause of which seemed strange to me, but I don't want to go into specifics for fear of giving away too much of the book.One thing I found humorous, the main female character compares a situation in her life to a passage in another book which I just finished."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I disliked this book thoroughly--it was completely different from what I thought it would be. I couldn't even find a character that LIVED that I liked and was rooting for. By the end, I really disliked them all. If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book. I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that. I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic, indeed. For someone not too fond of reading, this book has recaptured my interest in the activity. It is a significant and profound notch on the belt of the ever-enrapturing theme of the tragic love triangle. The 1992 film version of the novel is what first captured my attention. After seeing that film I had to pick up the book. It was the first book I've read in months and I'm glad that this was the read I chose. For some, the language may be a bit of a stretch to understand at first, but it quickly becomes 2nd nature (it's no \\" Nadsat,\\" courtesy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The archaic punctuation and diction, as well as the unwarned flip-flop of narrators may lead to some turbulence in the read, but that's nothing a good dose of patience and willingness to reread the page won't cure. A plethora of the more critical reviews have pointed out that many, if not all of the characters are unlikable at least part of the time if not continuously, but I argue that it's their flaws and the causes of their flaws which make these same cruel characters interesting and worthy of our sympathy (sometimes). The novel draws upon very human emotions and very human reactions to those emotions which should satiate any readers' unconscious internal hunger for the exploration of human depth and dynamics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because is a must read and I heard it mentioned in many movies/shows that I thought I had to give it a try. I was not interested in the beginning but it turned out to be a page turner although I was disappointed at how it ended, not sure there was any other way to end it but while reading it I wondered if there was a movie about it (never searched to see)...some how I kept picturing Gerald Butler as Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story. The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness. Its a cautionary tale. I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've always been a sucker for reading the classics and finally got a chance to read this one. The language takes time to get used to if you haven't read any old literature in a while, but just like most classics - definitely worth the read! And, how can you beat free?!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After the first two chapters, the book takes off. You are thrown into the hectic lives of the inhabitants of the Grange and Wuthering Heights. The language is beautiful, and the plot takes you on many twists and turns."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"first, allow me to say that i am quite enjoying these puffin classics editions of some of my favorite novels!'wuthering heights' is full of mystery, romance, and winding ghost stories; atmospheric moors and the winds rushing over them. you can practically feel the english countryside and its beauty and harshness (it is a character unto itself). i would love to delve into the plot, but would hate to give away any plot points.a bonus here with the puffin classics is the addition of backstory included at the end of the book. here you can learn more about the author, the story, the characters, and so much more. what a delightful thing to include!i have purchased most of these puffin classics editions, and will certainly look for future additions to add to my collection."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is always an interesting experiment to read a book some 40 years after the first time one read it as I did with Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. My recollections of the great love of Cathy and Heathcliff's turned to impatience with the angst filled duo and a shocking realization that I did not like either of these individuals well.But that being said, I found I appreciated the second half of the book much more than my first read which I must have barely skimmed with the great love being physically impossible. Nor did I forgive Heathcliff as I once did, because my enthusiasm for bad boys has waned over the years.But the question remained for me, when I was forced to rebuild my thoughts regarding this classic novel, was what made it so, what did it have to offer over the centuries to us today? It is a truly atmospheric novel that presents the cold and cruel world of the Yorkshire moors, which seems to shape people in its own fashion. But the value of the book perhaps, is a look at the many faces of love, and what people will do in the name of love.Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a true classic in that each reader can take a lesson from it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is depressing and confusing, if you are to believe the adaptations. If you are to believe the 1978 one, also tremendously long-winded and boring. The book, however, is not long-winded and it's not confusing either. It's got decent pacing, good characters (even though there are a number of DSM-IV labels that can be distributed liberally amongst them) and passion. Lots and lots of passion. Not necessarily of the bodice-ripping kind, but passion and fury. Especially the latter.Problem is, as much as I enjoyed reading the book and Emily Bront's writing, which is a lot more succinct than her sister Charlotte's, I don't like any of the characters and I have no sympathy for any of them, save for narrator Nelly/Ellen, because they're all a bunch of b*st*rds who deserve a good slap! I know, I know, it was written a long time ago, but I get the feeling that Emily didn't particularly like the people she wrote about either. They're either violent, drunkards, narcissists or just plain emo. But yes, aside from wanting to give the majority of the cast a good shake and yell \\"wake up and smell the coffee!\\" at them, it's still a good read. Yes, even though it's a little bit depressing and everyone hates each other and people die. Some people you're quite relieved to see the end of.The edition I have (Wordsworth Classics - cheap and cheerful!) comes with a glossary to be able to interpret ye olde English. Some of the words feel a bit unnecessary, because they're either fairly common knowledge or you can grasp the meaning by the context, whereas others ... well, any time poor old Joseph opens his mouth, you need a translator. Yorkshire dialect, 18th/19th century, oww. English isn't even my first language, so it was a tad bit difficult to read. The rest of the book wasn't a problem, just the bits in dialect.The book is actually a lot better than any of the adaptations I've seen. Emily's prose is atmospheric and timeless. Some of her words keep being repeated in the adaptations because, well, they're worth it. Notably this one, which is very passionate:\\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\\"See, that's goosebumps right there. How profound, how passionate, how... obsessive and bordering on deranged! But that's what I like about it. It tells a compelling (and rather violent) story of a couple of star-crossed lovers who live miserable ever after. What would it have been like if Cathy and Heathcliff had decided to get married? That's what I'd like to know.Anyway, it's a book that exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd just be weird and confusing like the adaptations, but no, it was actually pretty good. It was well written, and to think all of that came out of a parson's daughter living a fairly sheltered life in a small Yorkshire town. Just shows how good her imagination was, and her skill with a pen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was recorded by Ruth Golding for librivox.org and is available free, gratis and for nothing at that site - as 80,000 people have already discovered."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I had to teach it in a literature class about three years ago. The novel is poetical in nature, but it uses simple words to unravel the romantic twist in the novel. Catherine who is the center of the novel is in love with two men in her life one who she loves dearly and the other who she married for money. The two men in the novel Edgar Linton and Heathcliff are definitely in love with her. Edgar Linton shows his love for her by staying as a widower even after Catherine's death. By contrast, Heathcliff seeks to revenge his treatment by the Earnshaw family. At the end of the novel the two men who are in love with Catherine are buried close to her.One theme that stands out in the novel is that of love. What does it mean to love someone dearly? How does loving someone manifest itself in the lives of women and men? Is it possible to carry out nefarious act because of love? The responses to these questions are answered in the way the plot of the novel turns out. Through her prose, Emily Bronte answers these questions. Love to her means to be faithful to a partner despite the person's flawed character. Love can be seen as delicate subject which can lead to someone conducting baneful actions, as well as conducting acts of kindness.In a sensational group of compound sentences, Bronte shows her readers how love can be convoluted sentiment in women \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I bought a set of these books for my 7th grade English class. The book is designed perfectly for the young readers, especially girls. My students were very excited about reading the novel when they saw the cover of the book. The font of the novel is quite large and because of this the book is almost 500 pages; this put off some of the students because they were worried about reading such a large book. However, I explained that it made it easier to read and to take notes in because of the larger print and margins. There is also a pedigree chart in the book and a character reference section that certainly made it more understandable to my students. Also, as we read it, they got more and more excited when they saw how far they would get in just one reading. This book has a Lexile reading score of 880, which is a 6th grade beginning reading level, however, it is quite a difficult read for younder audiences because of the period grammar. My students read quite far above their grade level and most had difficulty with comprehension. I don't know if I will read it again next year because of the grammar, it does suit an older reader, but I do love sharing the story. After we completed the novel, they did complain about the words, but they really loved the story and were sad when we finished the novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"SummaryWuthering Heights is a dark tale of enduring passion and violent love. Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries--even death.Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is expectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite Heathcliff's clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine's ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley's cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father's death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.When he returns, he has mysteriously acquires wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine's post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.AnalysisDespite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly's narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!Nelly's judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.I found Wuthering Heights to be an enjoyable read; even more than Jane Eyre. Such a powerful story of love and loss ages well, and the unconventional use of an unreliable narrator had an interesting effect upon my view of the characters and story.The very subtle addition of Catherine's ghost, which could be interpreted as real or could be read as merely a figment of Lockwood's and Heathcliff's imaginations, does not diminish the credibility of the story. On the contrary, the supernatural elements throughout the novel only serve to add to the dark, intense feelings between the two lovers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is like nothing I've ever read. Beautifully written yet filled with hateful characters and depressing scenes. Yet...yet, I loved it! Emily Bronte does what few authors are capable of doing successfully; compelling you to care for people and situations you otherwise would not. So unlike her sister, Charlotte, who created a likable, strong character in Jane Eyre, Emily creates Cathy, Heathcliff, and the rest of this brooding, spoiled, and somewhat selfish cast of characters driven to depression and madness by the pitfalls of love--both familial and romantic--and makes you want to never stop reading about them. A true classic and one that everyone should read and keep in their library."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Book arrived very speedily and was in excellent condition, would certainly purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow. I actually really liked this book. It wasn't flawless, but was certainly enjoyable for a classic.The Things I Didn't Like:1. The narration. It was just a mess. It would be a narration inside a narration inside a narration. I had no idea who the \\"I\\" was whenever it was mentioned. And I just find it a tad bit unbelievable that Nelly Dean was a witness to it all. I kept cracking up because I would imagine Nelly hiding under tables or behind doors, listening in on all these intense conversations. I would have preferred it in third person.2. The names. I can't count how many time I was confused because I lost track of which Catherine, Linton, or Heathcliff, Bronte was talking about. I think I ended up guessing more than once.3. Joseph's accent. Oh, Lord. His dialogue was practically in another language. I ended up kind of skimming his parts because it wasn't worth the five minutes it took to decipher one paragraph.The Things I Did Like:1. All the characters. They were just so crazy, flawed, unlikable, dramatic, and awesome. I loved them and I hated them.2. When it was written. It just blows my mind that this was written 150 years ago. Besides the language, it just seems so modern to me. Not the setting, but the plot seems like something people would enjoy today.3. Romantic but not romantic. I loved how every action and conversation was so filled with passion. It wasn't a romance in the traditional sense, and that made it seemed more realistic. Heathcliff was both the antagonist and protagoninst. He definitely wasn't swoon worthy like the other heroes of his time, but he was darker, more coplex.I'm really surprised by how much I liked this novel. I wish Emily lived to write another one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte must have had a great imagination, yet a brilliant sense of reality when writing Wuthering Heights. I say this because so many real problems are apparent in her slightly modified storybook characters. Problems that are faced all the time-orphaned children, undying love, and more than once characters are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Bronte's characters are unlike any I've come across. They are multi-dimensional, and unpredictable; they can be shady and suicidal.Events can unfold in the novel abruptly, or very slowly. At the turn of the page, the main character could be dead, or a new one brought into the world. Nevertheless, the events of one hour could take up two chapters, at the least. Some can be surprising, and quite disturbing, others awaited and welcomed. But, these events are almost never predictable.Many things are repeats of volume 1 in volume 2, but Bronte somehow manages to make a totally different story of the second volume, and you are not bored. There are parallels between the houses, characters, and events. Some of which will most likely be talked about in your language arts class. :)In conclusion, everyone should read Wuthering Heights at least once in their lives. Yes, it's fairly difficult to read and the tests may lower your grade substantially, but you will have attained something from reading it that no other novel can come close to. So whether you read it on your own time, or for a report, along with someone, or all by yourself, just read it!~ L ~"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh. Heathcliff is not satan, but he does possess many demonic attributes. I have to say that he is what dragged me through this story. His evilness is nearly absolute and bent on destruction of everyone in his life. But I still have to ask myself why, which may go to say that he is unsatisfactorily explained in the novel. I understand his love for Catherine and the hatred inflicted on him by Earnshaw, but I still can't grasp the depth of his cruelty. The moral freedom he possesses is also astounding, as he worries not about heaven or hell, only about his own personal heaven, in the ground, with Catherine by his side. To me, that may be where his true strength lies.My next favorite character would probably have to be Ellen"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How could a girl with little or no contact with the outside world write a novel such as this?

I looked all my life for a love like these two shared. I was told more than once that it is just &quot;fiction&quot;...real lives never have emotions and dramatics such as this. They were wrong.

Truely lovely."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Ah, Heathcliff and Catherine. Literature's first twisted, truly dependent couple, coming together in one of the most original books in the english canon. What a treat.Emily Bronte's first and only book details the generational struggle between the Earnshaws, a poor farming family, and the Lintons, a wealthy group at Thrushcross Grange. The tragedy's catalyst is Heathcliff, a dark and rebellious boy of unknown parentage whom Mr. Earnshaw brings home and raises as his own child. Earnshaw's son, Hindley, hates Heathcliff with a fierce passion, but young Catherine is immediately drawn to the boy. As they grow older, they realize they are soul mates, but Catherine, attracted to the power and wealth at Thrushcross Grange, marries foppish Edgar Linton, incensing Heathcliff so greatly that he leaves Wuthering Heights for years, traveling the world and becoming a wealthy man. When he returns, it is for revenge, and soon his hatred tears apart the lives of not only Catherine, Edgar and Hindley, but their children as well.This has to be one of the most intense, fiery novels ever written. Bronte describes her wild, moorish surroundings with such vigor and passion that the moors themselves become a character. She also steers clear of nineteenth century melodrama and typical characters; there is no 'winsome heroine' or 'dastardly sneak' or 'good guy.' Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Though Heathcliff and Catherine are the primary focus of the novel, you will find yourself rooting for them one moment, then rooting for someone else the next. Bronte makes her characters real people, with a psychological depth and acuity uncommon in most nineteenth century literature; indeed, in literature in general. Everyone has their faults and their virtues. You will feel anger and sorrow for everyone at least once in the book.Bronte's dialogue burns with passion and intensity. When Heathcliff and Catherine allow themselves to finally express their love, it's with as much scorn and fury as adoration. Heathcliff seems to be straddling the line between embracing his soul mate and strangling her. Catherine, even at her most vulnerable, is still an impassioned and taunting lover. Each character has his or her own distinct voice; Nelly Dean, the childhood nurse of Catherine and Heathcliff and the story's primary narrator, immediately comes across as a pleasant, solid and mundane creature, while the villainous Hindley makes you want to black his eyes at least twenty times before the book's over. Bronte created characters of flesh, blood and SOUL. These are real people, really real people. You don't see that often. The characters and the brilliant description and evocation of the Yorkshire moors drench the story in a gorgeous, wild, dark mood. This book gets the heart racing.Emily Bronte wrote one of the great novels of all time on her first and only try. Wow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For some reason I expected this to be a Pink novel. Much on the contrary, it's rather black. It is a little masterpiece with no true Romanticism (or maybe yes). It is more of a Gothic novel, at least in tone and atmosphere. A man recently arrived to the Yorkshire moors is told, by his maid, the story of neighbors Earnshaw and Linton, and the Earnshaw's adopted and misterious stepson, Heathcliffe. The story spans decades of pure hatred, envy, horrible offenses and revenges, as well as despise for the human race. Each character lives immersed in their own bitterness and pain, with very little communication between them. BUT, beneath this surface there is love, the love between Catherine Earnshaw and her step brother Heathcliffe. In a way, it is a pure love, but it is also somewhat twisted and inevitably star-crossed. Out of this ill-fated love, a more normal and hopeful love will be born, but that you'll have to find for yourself.For me, the best thing about this novel is the creation of an environment, the handling of the medium within which the tormented characters live. It is constantly tense, brooding, foreboding, with periodic explosions of anger, agression and grief. It is somber, macabre and rainy, like the place where it occurs."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Opion of Book:The book was pretty good, but a little confusing. Her language was a little out dated and hard to understand, but nothing to bad. The writting style is sort of informal because she has a narator and they lived and visited Wuthering Heights but a little hard to understand though.Support of Opinion: It was confusing because there were two Catherines and many people came from the Earnshaw family or were related in some way. She used very big words but ones taht went with what she was saying. It was about true love and more so romantic so that was a plus. Nelly helped narate the story and she was Catherine's maid so that was a little informal basis.Personal Preference: I like this book because what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. Some parts were sad though that was the only bad part..Recommendation: YES! I would recommend this book, exspecially to anyoe who likes romance and believes that true love will win out no matter what."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To those who wish a first contact with the British literature, I invariably recommend reading the novel Wuthering Heights. After readind such book, one grieves the excessively early death of Emily Bront, and, yet, wonders seriously whether she would have been capable of producing another masterpiece to equal her first, had her fate been different.The characters of this incredibly intense story acquire so vivid a uniqueness as the narrative goes on that the reader, sometimes, even becomes unable to distinguish the characters from the \\"real people\\" around him, for he is inevitably beguiled into feeling for them all kinds of sentiment; from love to contempt, from pity to hatred; in a wild kaleidoscope of feelings which no sensitive reader will ever forget.But probably, the greatest triumph of this story is the character Heathcliff. Emily Bront creates a being singular in all its ways, especially its revengeful impulses. She renders Heathcliff something more than human, a true entity!, as she describes his life in that ingeniously exerted gossip fashion. By revealing to us only as much information as the closest person to his whole story (Nelly Dean) has, the writer presents him more as a legend of a superstitious countryside place than an ordinary person.Besides the gossip fashion used throughout the book, there is another element that helps make Heathcliff rather inhuman: his emotions; the consuming love he feels (which becomes more than idolatry for a godess after Catherine's death; she becomes the whole purpose of his \\"unlife\\"), the savageness of his worst outbursts of anger, the malignity he had to infuse to his personality in order to endure the harsh live that succeeded his misterious being born, and other traits which the heedful peruser shall most certainly divine from the many passages of the book.I just entreat that the new readers beware calling Heathcliff essencially evil; you try to analise the life he was forced to bear since his beggning, even before his being rescued from the streets of Liverpool by Old Earnshaw, ere trying to draw any unfair conclusions about this quite unfortunate being.Not only Heathcliff, but all the other characters call our attention in this heartfelt romance: It is quite impossible for Catherine Earnshaw's fierce wildness to pass unnoticed to us; she is the true representation of the unbridled spirit of those moors in her fits of passion, and her actions can reverberate as a thunderstrike on the people who love her, thus casting on them shadows of despair and sadness as swarthy as the ones that dwell in her soul at the moment. It is also interesting to perceive that the fact of her being a woman, a simple wife, and therefore having no great pihsical or social power of which to avail herself, does not render her harmless to the hearts of those who dote on her, for she has, and knows how to use, the power to hurt them in the most grievous way anyone could ever hurt; by degrading the greatest idol and reason of their lives, which is herself. Curious indeed is to notice that both the whole of her hate and the whole of her love are always bestowed upon the same people; another trait that leads back to her main one: her heart brimful with wildness.Actually, one could make thorough analyses concerning each of the rich and allegorical characters of this book; the puritan curmudgeon Joseph, the sweet younger Catherine, the noble - hearted rustic Hareton Earnshaw, the standard good - natured housemaid Nelly Dean, and so on; this is only a space for a brief review and recommendation however, and thus I ought not to indulge with composing an extensive critique on this amazing and unforgettable work of art; even because I would refuse to consider any article I could write in the moment completely worthy of being bestowed upon such a masterwork due to my having less time to spare for the performing of so important a task than I should now.Finally, i wish to praise and call the readers' attention to the skillfully written end of Wuthering Heights; with Heathcliff lying as an unearthly, unnamed interloper beside Edgar and Catherine; as what he had always been throughout his hapless life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Let's admit it, as good a writer Emily Bronte was, she wasn't as good a writer as her sister, Charlotte. Her only major work, WUTHERING HEIGHTS clearly illustrates that. The writing is superior to most fiction that one reads today and the story is rather interesting. Yet, it failed to catch my attention as easily as JANE EYRE did. There are very few likeable characters in the story (the young Catherine Earnshaw, the housekeeper, and the narrator) and the ending seemed rather hasty. Nevertheless, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a classic and for good reason. It examines a love that defies death, how important our relationships with other people are, and the value of words. It takes awhile to get into the book, but once one passes the first few chapters, it's hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is exciting and interesting, a good combination. If you have ever seen the movie, it doesn't tell half of the story. It stops just as the book gets better! I thought that reading this book would be a burden and a bore. I was wrong, it is now one of my favourite books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, was a book that delt with much older situations. The novel was good, but it didn't interest me. The relationship with Catherine and Heathcliff wasn't a relationship that I appreciated. She was treated bad as a young child, and had to live with a man who loved her, but miss- treated her. So in my opinion, the novel was too mature for me and I'll probably be interested in the novel when I get older."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love this classic story by Emily Bronte and loved reading it on my ipad.

The basic story was good, the characters complex but most were not likeable. The moors where it took place were so isolated, there wasn't much interaction with any others except at W. H. and at the Grange. I felt everyone was mentally afflicted in one way or another. The ending was suppose to be a happy marriage but it didn't seem joyful, just thank goodness the story ended. This was over many years proclaimed as the greatest romantic novel, the love was too painful for me to be appreciated."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"THis was a great book.

The movie version of Wuthering Heights was deceptive in regards characteristics and behavior of the characters.

Aside from that, however, I found it quite lacking. I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant. I generally have no issue with unpleasant characters or unhappy endings, but aside from the writing style and Bronte's ability to hold the story together in a clear manner I found nothing enjoyable about it, and pleasant or not books are meant to be enjoyed, elsewise you're wasting your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book in high school. That was 34 years ago. I wanted to read it again because I remembered loving it in high school"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is only one way I can understand this story, and it is to read Wuthering Heights as a parody of all other romantic novels. Just think about it: what would a typical romantic hero look like in real life? What would dark, intolerable passion look like in real life? What kind of ends would said hero be willing to go to in order to satisfy a love so intrinsic to his being IN REAL LIFE?Trust me, if you read the book from this point of view, you're going to want to continue reading just to see how far Heathcliff is willing to go to satisfy his desire.YMMV."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had always heard about the 'classic' love story in Wuthering Heights, but I never thought to read the novel until a few months ago. The main character Catherine Earnshaw is an idealistic, strong willed girl on her way to becoming a well-respected lady. One day her father brings Heathcliff, a brooding and mysterious orphan, into their home, and Catherine is immediately drawn to him. After her father dies, Catherine's brother Hindley takes over their home, Wuthering Heights, and Heathcliff is forced to be a servant. Heathcliff is in love with Catherine, and Catherine apparently feels the same way until she betrays Heathcliff to marry Edgar Linton. Outraged and hurt, Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights.Heathcliff returns a year later with the intellect and money of a gentleman. Heathcliff stays at Wuthering Heights with Catherine and Edgar. Heathcliff elopes with Edgar's sister, Isabella, finally getting his revenge on Catherine and Edgar. Isabella eventually regrets the marriage because Heathcliff really doesn't love her and abuses her.Catherine become pregnant, but she dies while giving birth. Before passing away, though, Catherine talks with Heathcliff, and they forgive each other. Catherine gives birth to a daughter who is named Catherine after her mother. The young Catherine grows up with Heathcliff planning a romance between her and Isabella's son Linton.As I was reading the first few chapters, I couldn't figure out why the book was a classic. However, I continued on and became completely engaged in the description, the characters, and the intense love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. Once I got past a fourth of the book over a few weeks, I hit the fascinating part that starts with Catherine's betrayal of Heathcliff and his subsequent revenge. I finished the rest of the novel in less than a day because I couldn't stop reading until I knew how it ended. The language sometimes is a little heavy and hard to follow, especially in the beginning, but once you read about the tumultuous relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, you'll be sucked into the story. The characters are all well-developed and realistically flawed, so that you can really imagine this story taking place in another time and place. The love story with Catherine and Heathcliff is probably the strongest and most significant love story I've ever read, for there are so many thing wrong with their relationship -- Catherine can't embrace Heathcliff for who he is even if she does love him, Heathcliff is set on getting revenge on Catherine for marrying Edgar -- but the thing that is the foundation of their whole relationship is a fateful, unbreakable bond."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did you, or did you not, want to kick Heathcliff and bite Cathy? Because I did. Yes, indeed, I did. No other book people have irritated me half so much, by just doing what I didn't want them to do. Kudos to Miss Bronte for such engaging characters, but one star off for spite because I like happy endings best. ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"They might as well call it a Soap Opera From Hell---Heathcliff's married to the sister of the woman he loves, Catherine. Catherine loves Heathcliff, but couldn't marry out of status, so she marries this Ergar guy for the money.Then, Heathcliff goes nuts and plots vengeance on everybody, taking the kid, Hindley, and teaching him to hate his father, making everyone alcoholics, chasing his wife off in tears and fits of misery, ruining the half dozen lives of the people around him.How can they call it a romance novel?! Days of Our Lives has better plotlines, Dante's Inferno had more heroic characters.This book's great---interesting to English Majors and Gothic [people] alike."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did it ever occur to you Heathcliff might be the illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw, the 'surprise' he comes home with. Didn't it cross your mind how awfully coincidental it must be to join two complete strangers who are in fact, in no time, 'soulmates', at one point Cathryn even says: I AM Heathcliff. In fact, they feel so much alike mentally, they therefore love eachother beyond the grave. There is never a scene where they actually love eachother physically. I think they are half brother and sister. It would explain so much.....For why would a middle-class farmer come home with a boy, an orphan? And his strong feelings for him, he must be treated as their brother...Well people, that is because HE IS!! They look alike (mentally) too much to be coincidental,unaware they recognize eachother, and not as lovers but unconciously as real family. The extent of their resemblance can only be genetic. The book itself is a masterpiece because it leaves everything in the dark and the reader may guess the real circumstances. When your book is finished, it still 'haunts' you. Please read it and have a nice time with it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am sorry for even hearing about this novel and i am very upset that it was required reading in my high school. It is horrible out-of-date novel about a guy named Heathcliff, and that's where i fell asleep. The description of things in this book take up 8 lines at a time and are unecessary! I don't reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recently read the novel Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte. As a student, I would not recommend this book to other readers. Unless falling asleep after every chapter of a book classifies it as good, Wuthering Heights is only good as a bedtime story. In the novel, it is said that Heathcliff and Catherine are in love, if this is so they wouldn't have spent their times together trying to hurt one another for pleasure. Heathcliff would have not wished that Catherine not rest in piece because she didn't mention him in her last breaths of air before dying (even though she was unconscious). This relationship that the author portrays as love, really is not love. It is more of a hate than anything. Another thing about this novel in which, I did not quite enjoy was its exaggeration in descriptions of everything. It is great to describe things well enough for the reader to create an image on what is happening in the story, in their mind, but don't push it overboard. For example, Liam O'Flaherty an author of short stories and novels uses great descriptions in his works. In his stories, he was able to create a mental image of the story in reader's imaginations, without letting the story get boring, and without over doing it. The thing is in Wuthering Heights, Bronte explained things out far too well and made the story less interesting. So coming from a student, I would not recommend this book to another student."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is supposed to be \\"one of the most famous love stories in the English language\\" (this is what the back flip of the Oxford University Press edition says), but where is the love? The characters are all selfish and self-obsessed, especially that monster Heathcliff, who even tortured his own son to death for he is hellbent on his imaginary revenge. The other characters are not much better, they are all psychologically immature and unstable, relishing on mentally and sometimes physically abusing others. As a book it also has little about the social institutions of the period, the story takes place within two households, which eventually merged into one with a couple of (I would say incestuous) marriages. The characters are also not very believable (for example, how do they earn their living? How did Heathcliff make his fortune in a short three years? The author does not say). They die far too easily from grief and anger. They have just one thing in mind: to hate and torture others around them. They have little interactions with other people except within their shrinking inbred gene pool. They seem more like the manufacture of a mentally ill social recluse, which I think more or less fits the description of the author herself. It is altogether a very dark and sordid story.I think Emily Bronte could actually write, but what a waste of her gift!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because after having read it 1 week ago I'm still thinking about it. I still can't decide whether I loved it or hated it. Many people think this book to be about love but I think it's about the opposite...hate. Pure evil takes shape in this book in Heathcliff. Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine is palpable and turns him mad with hatred for everyone and everything in his path. This book is dark, cold, unfeeling and wicked. The death can almost be felt and smelled from the pages. If you enjoy books about death, illness, hatred and obsessive love then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"actually, i didn't find this to be the book that it is pumped up to be. I braced myself for an exciting deep love story, tragic..instead i was bored. The style was not for me, I found it difficult to read, and in the end was just plain dissappoited. Maybe my generation is too tained by TV, James Patterson and Danielle Steele for us to appreciate the finer works."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked this book up again some 35 years after reading it in high school, and what I found was quite different from what I remembered. Our &quot;cultural&quot; memory of this great English novel is that it is a story of romantic, wild passion, and unrequited love. No doubt our preconceptions are heavily influenced by the famous film made many years ago. The reality is quite different. Catherine is a rather vain and willful girl who rejects Heathcliff because of differences in their class and upbringing. Heathcliff is full of hatred and resentment despite the great kindness shown him by his master in adopting him literally off the street. There is nothing romantic about the relationship between these two--they hurt each other constantly despite their almost spiritual bond. After Catherine's death, which occurs only halfway through the book, things turn bleaker still, as Heathcliff wreaks revenge on all around him. The wild, harsh countryside and climate, beautifully evoked by Bronte, echo the violent emotions that drive the lives of the characters. How cruel these people are to each other--how hard is Heathcliff's heart that he hates Catherine's daughter most of all. I confess that I found the unrelieved bleakness hard to take at times, and the redemptive conclusion a bit contrived, but it's a great work of English literature nonetheless--and to imagine this book was written by a young woman with virtually no experience of the world!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS is without a doubt the greatest romance novel I have ever read. Anybody who has ever had a hopeless love for somebody else will understand the torment that Heathcliff and Cathy went through. The love shown here is everything that love involves: infatuation, lust, longing, and even hatred. Simply put, this novel is an absolute masterpiece! You owe it to yourself to read it! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazing book. I have to admit when I first started reading it for my British Lit class I wasn't at all interested. I found the beginning slow and tedious. But once I got into the flashbacks from Nelly I was engrossed and couldn't put it down. The book is dark but a great read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the best book ever. I absolutely love it. It has so much feeling and passion in it that you can't help thinking about it long after you finish reading it. And, odd as it sounds, I think that Elton John's song &quot;Original Sin&quot; fits it very well. I love it so much and definately recommend you to read. Definately."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book is written wonderfully, you may call it gothic romance, but the book's really got a style and genre of its own. Now, I only say this for GREAT romance novels, like the Brontes. The language greatly affects the way the story is expressed. It is told in a subtle and bumpy manner, going way ahead of the reader, its many pauses for the narrator gives the reader time to think the thing over, like the guest. Basically, the style and format is a fascinating one, it truly does intrigue the reader to a certain level. Now, it is hard to say if Heathcliff is the kind of man a girl would want( not that I'm a girl ), he is, if you want someone who truly loves you, he's not if you don't want someone to go CRAZY over you. It is--I think--clever of Emily Bronte, to leave this question for readers to consider as they sit comfortably in their beds reading this romance. But if you read it carefully, you will see that the narrator does not form a very high opinion of Heathcliff, yet the latter did deserve the revenge he got. Now, here we have another controversial point for us readers. Thus the novel is a quick one, without all the slow( at least very slow )descriptions and it forms different points of interest as it moves along just pulling the reader in. As the reader gets to the end he/she will feel a shocking yet not surprising end. The ending is a satisfactory one after chapters after chapters of points pointing toward the end. After all, the end is a slope for the way the novel is going. All in all, the book is satisfactory, and something that will--in a way--haunt the reader in later times. It is a masterpiece with all those interesting formats which I will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I see Bronte's classic novel as the celebration of imagination and the boundless possibilities that dreaming and strongly believing in the make-believe of dreams, as children can only do so well, presents to the reader. Heathcliff and Cathy were happiest when they cast off all of the pretentious cares, and embraced the simplest of things together. As with most classic novels, death is misunderstood; Death was only symbolic of that passage into a reality they both shared all along- a realized spirit of happiness. If anything, it is a strong and encouraging message that the flawed things we most trouble over in life are the very things not all that important. As one modern book puts it, &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff. It's all small stuff.&quot; One might argue that even in death, the romantic flaws would carry on; the distractions still beckoning. To the contrary, this classic novel is the celebration of whatsoever things are beautiful, gracious, carefree, simple, and worthwhile in right here, right now living. In biblical terms, Except ye be as little children..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm thirteen years old, and a HUGE reading fanatic. So one day I pick this up, and start reading. At first, it's pretty hard, but then you start to get along with the writing style. This took me a LONG time to read, but it was definately WELL-WORTH it! It's hard to explain what it was about, but I'll help you best I can. So there's this guy(Mr. Lockwood) and he is the current tennant of Thrushcross Grange. Through the whole story, a servant named Ellen(Nelly) Dean is telling him the history of the people who lived there, and in Wuthering Heights. I'd say that the story is mostly how Heathcliff ruined the lives of the Earnshaw and Linton families, but that is just my point. The story basically starts off about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Then, to the point after that, it comes down to start about Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine Linton. It's really good, and really hard too! Consider it a big accomplishment to have read it, cause it is amazing!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember that I was entranced by it. It's a wonderfully tragic love story. I found it very romantic and a suprisingly easy read. Once you begin it you won't want to put it down. However, my only complaint is that some of the characters have the same name so it's harder to keep track of who's who."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All of the novels of the Bronte sisters exhibit a genius of passion well surpassing their age. Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS, however - though perhaps not quite so endearing as the novels of her sister, Charlotte - possesses the most adeptly pondering prose, egregiously fathoming the terrifying extremes of love and hate.Born amidst the feral landscape of England's Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaw family and their ramshackle farm estate, Wuthering Heights, are at the center of this manifestly heartrending story. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw, with the help of several servants - most notably their poignantly observant maid Nellie, and their pious and stoic manservant Joseph - are raising two children: a son, Hindley, and his younger sister, Cathy. On a cold and drizzly evening, when Hindley's but a teenager and Cathy still a very small child, Mr. Earnshaw returns from Liverpool carrying a young urchin he'd found starving in the streets. Despite wary opposition from his family, he adopts the four or five year-old child and names him Heathcliff. Mr. Earnshaw, over the next several years, develops a fond affection for Heathcliff that surpasses even that which he feels for his own son. Mrs. Earnshaw dies not long after Heathcliff joins the family, then Mr. Earnshaw dies several years afterwards. From thereon, Hindley relentlessly vents a deeply embedded bitterness borne of jealousy upon his adopted younger brother.Hindley's hatred of Heathcliff is the force that drives this story on. His sister Cathy, however, from a very young age is as drawn to Heathcliff's quiet thoughtfulness, as he to her flighty impulsiveness. The two of them nurture a very deep friendship as children, which grows to an almost otherworldly love as young adults. This tempestuous love gets devastatingly shaken not only by Hindley's efforts to keep Heathcliff in the drudge, but also by wooings for Cathy from a wealthy blue-eyed suitor from Thrushcross Grange, a neighboring estate. This young strapping is Edgar Linton, and he as well as his sister Isabella cut a very severe contrast to Heathcliff. The Lintons are fair-haired, refined in manner, and have very openly expressive countenances. Heathcliff, on the other hand, casts a dark, gloomy aspect: intensely handsome despite dirty, messy hair and thick-browed brooding eyes. Truly Cathy's audacious, tempestuous spirit, wild as the blustering wind on the Yorkshire moors, is pure soul mate to Heathcliff's moody, devil of a gypsy, hot-blooded heart. \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods,\\" she says, \\"time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\\" Never - in all of the novels I've ever read - have soul mates been so intensely, so uncannily written.The only fault I find in this story is the utter lack of endearing qualities in either Cathy or in Heathcliff. Each displays, at turns, some form of careless frivolity or ruthless cruelty in either their actions or their words. And though I certainly cannot help but feel for their struggles and their pain, neither are the type individuals with whom I would possibly want to become a friend. They are amazingly self-absorbed, and wholly blinded by the radiance of each other.Mistake me not, though - reading WUTHERING HEIGHTS was indeed a wondrous experience. The writing interweaves the earthly elements, the people, and the landscape haunted by their ghosts with a deftness that's extraordinary. There is undeniable genius here - a brilliantly intense story of a love that refuses to be thwarted, coursing through the heart and soul of the next generation, thence onward, and beyond the grave."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte is one of the greatest romances in history.\\"-Kristen Murphy.Within the text of this book, Emily describes events that take place revolving around a romance. The main characters of this book are: Catherine, Cathy, Edgar, Linton, Hareton, Hindley, Isabella, and Heathcliff. Isabella is very spoiled, and soon has a son that dies (Linton). Heathcliff's love life turns into a mess and turns into a lonely old man. Hindley is a jealous and rebellious child that soon becomes jealous of Heathcliff. Hareton is Hindley's son that eventually marries Catherine.Throughout the book the characters run into a lot of problems and adventures. For example, there is a tremendous amount of tension that burns off Heathcliff. My favorite character in the book is Heathcliff. The reason that I like him so much is because he keeps your eyes open. He is always changing, his appearance and his location.The themes that are reveled within the book are: Good vs. Evil, Revenge, Crime and Punishment, Passion vs. Rational Love, Ignorance vs. Education, and Selfishness. The characters display these themes in many different scenes and emotions.My overall opinion of this book was excellent. I would not change anything at all, and I believe that the ending is perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone that in joy's romance novels. It is a novel that keeps you wondering and not knowing what is going to happen next. You may think that you know how this book is going to end, but really you don't. This book sits way ahead of all the other romance novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story, driven by an undying love. The two main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are in love with each other; not in an earthly form but rather there souls are united as one. Heathcliff loves Catherine not for her body, her apperance, her money, her status but rather for her soul. He is one with her in a way every soul desires to be understood. In this novel love is shown in forms and extents that are so much of what people in our culture are deprived of it makes for a wonderful read. One often longs for a soul mate to connect with and be loved by for being them and when Heathcliff shows this affection towards Cathy I believe it draws in a person and captures his or her heart.Wuthering Heights isn't just a fantasy though. It isn't a fairy tale everyone knows will never come true. Wuthering Heights is very much now and here. Heathcliff loves Catherine with his heart but she denies this love and tries to suppress her own feelings toward him for she thinks it will receive her scorn from society to which she is right. This is so heart wrenching because it is so much of a reality. Many times we meet our soul mate yet let them slip away because we are to worried about what others will say. Wuthering Heights shows picture and makes you think about when you might have not loved someone only because the culture didn't approve of him or her.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful book because it illustrates a love people yearn for so dearly. If you have the chance to read Wuthering Heights I would definitely say take it because it will speak to your heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel Wuthering Heights may sound like another cliche book of love and hate. The general audience would think this book would follow the same romance plot. Man falls in love with woman, woman feels the same, something terrible happens and in the end they solve the problem and live happily ever after.When in all actuality it is about a man whom driven by pure love for hatred on a path of vengece. The man known only as Heathcliff. *Don Don Don!*The novel starts out in an unusual manner of telling the end of the story in the beginning. Surprisingly all the substance plays right in tune with the style of writing. The characters of all very complex and intricate to the point of instanity. The story is all centered around a man who is rejected from society from adoption and is only loved by a one soul. Unbeknownst to his step sister Catherine, Heathcliff has fallen madly in love with her. Heathcliff ,since rejected from society, has developed deep hatred for everyone who maltreated him or loved Catherine.Heathcliff's revenge is so cold and rotten to the point were you want to rip the book apart and burn it. Later on Catherine finally confesses her love to Heathcliff whom after this was overjoyed with passion. Sadly this Catherine,Heathcliff's only true love in life, dies a most unusual death.Heathcliff plans to make Catherines daughter the puppet or weapon if you may to take revenge against Edgar the one who stole Catherine from Heathcliff's reach. To do this he tries to force Catherine's daughter to marry his own son.Although the book is very entertaining I highly suggest this for and audience of some background knowledge of the Victorian era. Another tedious thing of this book is it is not intended to those of an average vocabulary so at often found myself having to grab a dictionary. Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights novel shows how love can eventually turn into hate by just adding a few essential ingredients.[Redsponx5]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Don't read the review from Monika \\"equestrienne_23\\" below.I have never read this book and was looking at the reviews online to see if I could get an idea of what it was about. Then I read that one review that gave away the whole book. That was quite a dissapointment.IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE AWAY THE STORY IN YOUR REVIEW AT LEAST SAY IN THE TITLE \\"CAUTION: SPOILERS\\"Not right"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The plot and theme of the book have been reviewed many times. The power of the book is that it evokes the entire gamut of human emotions and contemplative introspection from its readers according to each individual's inclinations. It is for the reader to label. I for one, see it as the most tragic and powerful love story ever written. No reader will be left unmoved by the story and will for years, as in my case, always refer back to it as a focal point of interest. A must read for all!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One - Three"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights makes Jane Eyre (more popular, but untimately predictable) and Austen's book look like schoolgirls wrote them. Everything about it is bitingly real. Though most of the novel is bent on Heathcliff's revenge, it is more about how far a person would go acting on the powerful love they feel for another. Some might say his character shouldn't exist (absurd! He is more real than the pining Edgar or the dashing men of what I call 'heaving bosom' stories).Cathy, the heroine, who never acts like the typical one, does a typically human thing: she marries a man she has mild feelings for because he's rich and Heathcliff is MIA.But her death scene: all I can say is read it! Haunting.It is a little awkward because we are removed from the story, hearing it from a maid's point of view and the parts about Cathy(Jr. her daughter) and Linton and Hareton are not as moving as Cathy and Heathcliff's destructive love, it's still absolutely amazing! I've read it three times and I still get chills at the end!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have always considered Wuthering Heights the best offering from the Bronte brood. It may be a soap opera, but WHAT a soap opera--and besides, the writing, dark and Victorian though it is, is superb and more than a little mad.The two most over-used adjectives used to describe this book are \\"dark and brooding.\\" So I won't use them, but it will be hard. Because out of the ashes, almost literally, of a dark, dreary, oppressive estate on the English moors flames the love affair of all time: the daughter of the house, Catherine, and the wild foundling brought into the family as a child--Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff have a special bond, even as children, but when adulthood arrives, their bond flares into unbearable passion.Tortured Heathcliff wandering the moors calling for Cathy; married Cathy dying in her bed for love of Heathcliff; ahhhh. Nothing better. One wonders, of course, what forbidden thoughts churned beneath the genteel breast of Emily Bronte as she wrote of this unmistakeably sexual and erotic relationship. I have also wondered more than once if Heathcliff was modeled on the Bronte Sisters' wild and untameable brother Bramwell. But I am no literary historian. I am only a lover of books, and this particular one resides on my all-time top ten. If you have never read it, or if you consider it one of those dreary required assignments you fled in high school, give it another chance. There is nothing else like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Why? Because it sickens me to death.Can't stand false reviews.I'll just say one thing- if you ever wanted to have a perfect black pearl, flawless and completely spherical, with beautiful glow and precious value, read this book. The pearl's there for you, waiting for someone to take it out and absorb it forever.It might be a hard reading, but it will move you deeply and make you pound your chest and cry out."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a novel that oozes with romance. It is a story of unbridled love that has no boundaries and no restraints. The love that exists between Catherine and Heathcliff is an all consuming almost maddening love. The way Emily Bronte attacks your senses and emotions is both exicting and devastating. Her style of describing the surroundings and landscape is gothic in style. It is rugged, isolated and atmospheric. It gives you a sense that the Earnshaws and Lockwoods are the only two families in existence. The landscape seems to be a direct reflection of the personalities of the characters. It is a clever way to describe the families in a atypical way. Because of the unusual style of this romance novel, it may be hard to dive into at first, but it will soon capitivate your attention. It is hard to determine who you should hate and who you should pity.Healthcliff is a dark and mysterious man who you absolutely want to love, but every word he speaks and every action he makes drives you to despise him. Catherine whom you want to side with, drives you mad with her selfishness and snobbery. It leaves you with a feeling of desperateness for a happily-ever-after ending, yet a sense it may never happen. Wuthering Heights is a passionate, all consuming pyscho-romance. It made me want to jump into the pages and set things straight. I really enjoyed the use of love and hate and how it is able to bind people together in a circle that never ends. Once a wrong has been committed, it is so hard to break the cycle. Once someone has been hurt it is so hard to forgive and forget. Healthcliff's emotional side had been trampled on at such an early age that his whole life was soon consumed with revenge towards anyone that was involved in the mistreatings. I despertly wanted Catherine or at least someone to break through the shield that Heathcliff had built, but if someone does want to be loved they never will. The saying goes, you must love yourself before you can love someone else and Healthcliff was not able to accomplish this.The combination of love, love lost and love denied makes Wuthering Heights a romance that I fully recommend. It is a mixture of life and death, twists and turns and vengence that would attract all genders and all ages. It leaves you confused and frustrasted in a way that books do not do anymore. It may have you puzzled in the beginning because it does not follow the norm of a modern romance, but by the end you will feel that every romance should have this quality. I feel that everyone should sample the taste of a tragic romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I can't recommend Wuthering Heights enough. It tells the story of the doomed love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by her father. There is an implication, which not everyone may have picked up on and in never confirmed, that their relationship is inscestuous and that Heathcliff is the illegitimate son of Catherine's father. This idea is based on the fact that it seems highly unlikely that Earnshaw would have picked up a strret child to adopt without some sort of motivation. The gothic genre was also fascinated with strange relations etc and whilst authours would not have been able to look at inscest openly they would have been able to get away with subtle undertones that many people would not pick up on.There is an immense sense of landscape within Wuthering HEights and I feel that the title and setting reflects the unbridled passions of the characters within the novel. Emily Bronte's beautiful descriptions of the rolling countryside reflect her love for her home at Haworth. The plot can be a little confusing because of the way the characters all seem to have the same names (two Cathys, Edgar Linton, Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff etc) so if you can get hold of a family tree it'll really help you to follow the plot. Like all classics, Wuthering Heights takes a bit of time to get into but keep going and you won't regret it.:)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Fresh off of reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I was interested in reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; because I had heard it was this great romantic story. Could it surpass &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I thought? Hmmm... I went in search to find out. Well, after reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, I have this to say: If you think that &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is about lovey-dovey romance, think again. If you are expecting it to be in the likes of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, think again. If you think Heathcliff will be like Mr. Rochester, think again. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a novel filled with a fitful, satisfying romance. It is a beautifully written novel, and Mr. Rochester will always be my favorite hero, and Jane, my favorite heroine. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is, on the other hand, a complete 180 from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a disturbing novel filled with disturbing characters. It is a gothic tragedy which is very dark and depressing. Not one single character is likeable, although you hope that Heathcliff turns around at the end and turns good. It is about obsession and it makes you wonder if you can define love. What is love? I did like how the author is completely distanced from the novel, and that a lot of the story is left up to the reader's imagination, but there were times when I was thinking, &quot;What is the point of this novel?&quot;. Yet, at the end, I realized it was a good story-- very spooky and it sucked you into their own world. I think this is a mood-novel. It will make you go into a very dark place, and leave you kind of depressed! I suggest watching the movie adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, featuring Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff. I know that I actually gained a greater appreciation for the novel after watching this film. Then after that, go read &quot;Villette&quot;!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is little I can add to the body of work devoted to this excellent novel. But who doesn't love Healthcliff - the prototype for all tortured, romantic souls after him. A wonderful read that should be required for all. Bronte, like all great authors, is as much psychologist is she is an artist, and her writing could even be placed quite neatly, if one so wished, under the mantle of the attachment theories that came after her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"First of all, this is one of my all-time favorite books. Wuthering Heights in general gets 5 stars from me, and there are plenty of other opinions about the story for you to read. I just want to add something about this particular edition, because it made me laugh in surprise when I opened up my package. This edition is very elegant, but it's very different from your average hard-backed novel. It's very compact and the pages are very thin, like a pocket Bible. The only reason I don't like it so much is that since the pages are so thin you can see the ghost of the words of the preceding page through the page you're reading. You get used to it as you read, but I prefer a print of more substance. Other than that, the cover is pretty, it's hard-backed, the pages are edged in gold coloring and it comes with an attached ribbon bookmark. The print is also average sized, so it's definitely readable, and the small size is advantageous if you want to carry it with you in a purse or on a trip."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"These books are wonderful! I love feeling like not only am I reading a delightful classic but I am doing so with a piece of art. They are truly treasures on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not only is this book gorgeous, but the content of the book is very good.

It's hard to explain the way the pages were layed out. It was a style used for bed ridden individuals that promoted comfortable reading in any position. Really like nothing we had ever seen.

Don't hesitate to add these books to your collection."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I found this book really intersting. the book takes many turns, very tragic. Some find it hard to read, the servants have poor english so its written in some parts in broken english, which makes sence they had no education. over all its a perplexing book to read, looking back it seams no one in the story had a mother figure for very long, very sad"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I never had to read this in high school, so I thought I'd give it a try now. It was pretty good. I think it may have been better if I read it in high school so we could all dissect the passages, but I think I managed fairly well on my own. I thought it was a good book. I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"So I'm definitely a fan of the romantics, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and this book by Emily Bronte was by far my favorite bookwise. I was completely submerged in the world that she created and tangled in the emotions and desires of its characters. While I prefer the story of Pride and Prejudice, I wasn't as steeped in the story when I read it as I was with this classic novel about forbidden love. Just don't watch the movie adaptions they are bleh. Even with the handsome Matthew MacFadyen who plays Hareton in one movie and Mr. Darcy in the p&p movie with Keira Knightley. But this is a classic for a reason, read it! I read this paperback by the way"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange, visits Heathcliff his landlord and the latter says \\"walk in\\" in a manner that sounds like \\"go to the deuce\\" to Lockwood. When Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights for the second time the area sees heavy snow and he is marooned there over night with Miltonian ice and snow around him, his hades complete with a half dozen four footed fiends like the hounds of hell inside. Catherine is even pretending to weave some black arts to tease Joseph. So we see that Bronte has painted us a picture of hell at Wuthering heights with, as we shall see later, Thrushcross Grange it's polar opposite. Dante Rossetti said of this novel: \\"The action is laid in Hell, only it seems places and people have English names there.\\"After retiring for the night Lockwood reads the names Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff, Catherine Linton written on a window ledge. This series of names tells the story of Catherine Earnshaw to her relationship to Heathcliff and then to marriage to Edgar Linton, read in the opposite direction it is the story of her daughter Catherine Linton who marries a Heathcliff and ends up an Earnshaw. Lockwood goes to sleep and dreams of going with Joseph to hear a Reverend Jabes Branderham preach on Seventy time seven and the first of the seventy first which was in a book he had been reading, and that Catherine had scribbled in. In a truly funny scene Lockwood is exposed as the first of the seventy first sinner: \\"'Thou art the man!' cried Jabes ... Brethren, execute upon him the judgement written. Such honour have all His saints!' With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me\\".Bronte paints in Heathcliff as a goblin that digs up graves and torments the living but she also lets us look a little deeper and we see his torment at the loss of Catherine. Symbolically, I suppose, Wuthering Heights represents Romanticism in decline while Thrushcross Grange depicts the emerging Victorian values. Bronte gives us two main narrators Nelly Dean and Lockwood and we see most of the story through their eyes. Virginia Woolf said \\"It is as if Emily Bront could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.\\" Emily Bronte's numinous and gothic Wuthering Heights compasses a literary zenith as the finest English novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps it is the signature of excellence that the character reviews of this novel are varying but the accolades given to the novel itself are not.I think the essence of the novel is in the housekeeper Ellen herself who tells most of the story. She herself had a hand in the senior Catherine's death. When Catherine was gravely ill, Ellen believed her to be a hypochondriac. Again and again Ellen speaks as negatively of the senior Catherine as she does fondly of the junior Catherine. Like all the characters, even the storyteller Ellen needs further examination. I, for one, found Heathcliff to be a sad, depressed man with many regrets.This novel is not an easy read, but an incredible one that has some of literature's most intriguing characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights By Emily BronteThis book is mainly about a love story.A servant,Heathcliff,falls madly in love with a woman that lives in the house,Ms.Cathy.

Wuthering Heights is a work of genius, and a work of art. It is a well-written novel with an original, unique and solid plot, extremely well-done setting, good action, dialogue, etc. All these aspect alone would give the book 5 stars.What makes me say it needs an extra star are the characters. No other novel I know of describes its characters better, or makes them more realistic and belivable. You will never forget Heathcliff. He's a person so set in his cruel ways as to be almost unbelievable - it's hard to imagine someone like that could exist. And yet Emily Bronte pulls it off with her writing. She makes you BELIEVE. And as far as I know, that is the primary purpose of a novel.Don't be fooled by the fact that it's old and a classic. Reading it, none of that is noticeable. The writing is fresh, original, and beautiful. You won't be able to put it down. And when it's finished you'll wish it had lasted just a little longer, like you do when all great novels are done."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the most shocking 19th century novel I have ever read! And even though if the story happened today, the principle characters would probably end up on a talk show, I found it to be highly articulate as well as entertaining!I'm not sure why many people said this was a slow paced book, I found it to be quite the little page turner! The only thing that slowed me down at all was trying to decipher Joseph's speeches, but even that adds a bit of comedy to the story.I feel as though the narrative is being told as one sits eagerly in a sewing circle awaiting juicy details about their boss. I found that even though the double narrator makes me wonder greatly about the reliablity of the story, I also think it adds a great deal of the entertainment! I don't trust the condescending and conceited Lockwood, nor the flighty, biased words of Nelly, but they are what makes this story so great!It's fabulous to see a book that still holds a reader's interest today, (instead of just spouting off long tangents of philosophical thought) to be in the canon of great literature!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved the story. It is truly a classic. The story focuses around 2 lovers, Heathcote, a gypsy orphan who is mysterious and Catherine who is bubbly, bratty, spoiled, pretty, and rich. They make a true odd couple.However things don't always turn out as planned. Hearts are broken, hope goes, and mystery surrounds. Read this book and prepare to go into a world of deceit, love, joy, hope, and mystery."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Actually I was not assigned to read this book. But I felt that if I was going to be an English Major I should have some knowledge of this book. This is not the drum I march to. Also, this book does not really match &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Nevertheless, it is still an important piece of literature. Emily Bronte presents us with very beautiful images. She also offers us deep psychological insights into human nature. She also makes the characters fairly convincing. Emily Bronte also does a pretty good job in helping us to see why the characters act the way they do, and she does keep us in suspense. I can not say I cherish this book, but what I can say is that I am glad I took the time to read it even though it was not assigned."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book must be considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. Each character is so unique that I felt drawn into the story. Although one cannot identify easily with these characters, their desires and pain are shown clearly throughout the book and this is part of the reason it is such compelling reading. So compelling, in fact, that I almost couldn't put it down until the heartbreaking, yet very fitting, end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Really liked this book. It has the strangest characters but in someway, I liked them. I reccomend you read this book. In fact, You've got to read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a fantastic book!

I have only read one of the books (Wuthering Heights) and I liked it. I was planning on giving these as gifts, but now I am going to keep them! My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a no frills original classic. Its so refreshing to read a classic as it was originally written. Great value."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One of my personal criteria of a \\"classic\\" novel - and a reason these certain books are read and re-read throughout the years - is some kind of illumination of our human nature. 'Wuthering Heights,' in my opinion, is one of these novels. On the surface, it is a love story. But deeper than that, the characters could be any of us. How many times have we been our own worst enemy? In this story, the characters make decisions that we, as the reader, know are the wrong decisions. Yet it is easy to identify with the mistakes that the characters make. Any of us could (and have) made those same wrong decisions. Perhaps this is why this novel has resonated with so many readers and made the story so timeless.Read it for a good story, then think about it later and put yourself in the character's shoes. I think you'll find it illuminating and something that will stick with you a long, long time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is almost unique among classic literature for the point of view from which it is told. Various people who are not principal to the story are telling what they saw to a man new to the area. So the amount available for telling is much less than were the story told from the all-knowing point of view of most novels or the first person point of view. It is astonishing how well the author uses this limited point of view to relate the passions and fears of the principal characters. Anyone who has not read Wuthering Heights as an assignment in high school or college should read it for the enjoyment. It well deserves its reputation as a classic of English literature. The book has been made into movies a number of times, so many people who have never read the book are familiar with the story, or at least to the end of the first generation. Even if you know the story, you will enjoy the beauty of the book as literature. The book is also a powerful statement against the limitations in legal rights of women at the time. It is this powerlessness which produces the tragedy in the second generation. So the book can be read as a women's lib argument; I have no idea if the author intended to make such an argument; it's not being in any way a polemic makes the point in a very matter of fact way, but the reader is aware nonetheless.Read Wuthering Heights if you can; you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to disagree with previous reviewers who called Heathcliff evil. I dont believe so at all. He is a driven man full of passion and emotion. And when his life is shattered he scrambles to find some dignity, pride and content. It is through unfortunate circumstances surrounding him that he never finds them no matter how hard he searches for them.Heathcliff grows up with Catherine. They share a special connection throughout their childhood and adolescence. Catherine is the only person who can talk him out of a mood, cheer him up and make him laugh. He shares his dreams and secrets with her. Heathcliff is deeply in love with her and for a time believes that love is returned.But Catherine is a foolish and sometimes cruel girl who is a product of her upbringing. She knows Heathcliff is a poor nobody of dubious lineage and she doubts that he will ever amount to much. She wants to marry someone who is her social equal, someone who will keep her in style and give her social standing. So she selfishly marries Linton without even once giving a thought to anyone or anything else. The fact that Linton is Heathcliff's sworn enemy doesnt bother her for a second.Heathcliff is completely devastated by the marriage. Not only does the love of his life becomes completely out of his reach, she also becomes the wife and the lover of the man that he hates. His heart and innocent youthfull illusions shattered, Heathcliff leaves and doesn't return for many years.Catherine meanwhile realizes her mistake. She is completely bored in her marriage, more she is a very strong woman and runs roughshod over her husband. Her husband's weak character disgusts her, but she is trapped. There is no way out of the loveless marriage. She has made her bed and now must lie in it.Heathcliff spends years yearning money and accumulating a fortune just so that he could prove to Catherine and to everyone else that he is in fact worthy of her. He comes back to rub the fact in her face. He wants to make her hurt as she made him hurt, to show her the kind of a mistake she made so that she could regret it for the rest of her life. Heathcliff comes back a harsh and a bitter man bent on revenge. He wants to get his back after having his heart ripped out.But revenge does not bring him any satisfaction, for Catherine is near her deathbed. She dies giving birth to her daughter. And now Heathcliff is left with nothing. His life has no more meaning without Catherine in it, for the second time in his life he has the rug yanked out from beneath his feet. He vows to bring revenge on the Lintons and that becomes his only reason for living. The hate and the anticipation of revenge sustain him through years.Many years and many deaths later, Heathcliff has achieved no satisfaction. His life is empty and he is all alone. He lives with Catherine( the daughter) and his knephew. He hates them both, Catherine because he blames her for her mother's death and Hareton because of his father. All of his attempts at revenge have brought him no solace. He is just a shell of a man, sustaining from day to day with no real purpose. All of the people he hoped to bring revenge against are all dead and he is tired of living. And so ends a life full of passion and volatile emotion, anger and hearbreak. Only in death does Heathcliff finally achieve his peace.There are no words to describe how much I loved this book. It took me on an emotional roller coaster from page one and until the bitter end. I could not help but symphasize with Heathcliff and experience emotions as he was feeling them. The book is incredibly powerful, emotional, dark and brooding with some light relief at the end. Its heartwarming to know that Catherine's daughter at least found some happiness. But the thought remains, Catherine and Heathcliff never did..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is often unfairly labeled as a &quot;Gothic romance.&quot; Well, obviously that is one way of looking at it, but I don't see what &quot;romance&quot; has to do with it. The main characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, have one of the most twisted and obsessive relationships I have ever seen. I wouldn't exactly call it a romance;more of some bitter love that the orphaned Heathcliff cannot let go of when Cathy marries another, has a child, and dies. He spends eternity taking out his revenge on the later generation, making this one of the darkest ideas of love that I have ever read. But then, that's why I like it. It shows that sometimes romance is not that pretty. In fact, it's pretty darn self-destructive. A great read, my favorite out of any I have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a surprisingly modern novel given that its authorship predates our modern understanding of psychology. Like many modern novels, Ms. Bronte has also explored the darker side of human passions and psyches more thoroughly than the sunnier side. Heathcliff will remind you of classic characters whose lives were twisted by fate like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, Erik in Phantom of the Opera, Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and the mysterious prisoner in The Man in the Iron Mask.If there were ever two star-crossed lovers who have captured the world's imagination since Romeo and Juliet, they must be Catherine and Heathcliff. Yet, unlike, many such pairs, their unhappiness is heavily influenced by themselves.As you contemplate their story, you are constantly drawn to the thought, \\"what if\\" thus and such had occurred differently? That's part of the great power of the story because it has so many unexpected twistings and turnings. A reader's expectations from a love story are turned upside down, sideways and diagonal from where those expectations normally rest. As a result, you'll probably decide this isn't a love story after all . . . but a tragedy. Taken from that perspective, you'll find yourself hearing echoes of Lady Macbeth and King Lear as you contemplate what occurs when the natural order is disturbed. Few English authors since Shakespeare have captured that sense of what can happen when the universe is disarranged.What's great about this story? It's pretty simple: Emotional intensity in the writing; deeply memorable characters; doomed lovers; and a haunting glimpse at unshakeable obsession.What's not so great? The story development itself is pretty awkward. Much of the story is told in flashback which steals power and immediacy from the narration. If ever a story cried out for being told in the first person (by Heathcliff, Catherine, Edgar Linton, Hareton and young Catherine), it's Wuthering Heights. The transitions from one key moment to another are often very abrupt. Sometimes it is 150 pages later before you get the full sense of what Emily Bronte meant to convey in some of those transitions.What's less than great? The characters aren't nearly as appealing as those you'll usually find in a novel dealing with these issues. In that sense, the novel is more realistic than fictional . . . which helps create some of its immense power. It's probably a worthwhile price to pay.Whatever you think of Wuthering Heights, you owe it to yourself to read one of the most moving tales that has ever been written. Pick a time when you're feeling reasonably happy to start the book. Otherwise, you may find your mood to be more than a little darkened for a few days."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As the editor of this volume, I wanted to point out its differences from many other editions of Wuthering Heights. This one contains the short story, &quot;The Bridegroom of Barna,&quot; believed to be the most influential source for the novel. It also collects essays about Emily Bronte that are not published elsewhere with the novel. I may be biased, but I think this is a great edition of the novel and is particularly good for college classes on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How do you define a classic? Some might say that which stands the test of time. By that definition alone Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" merits the designation of classic. To the best of my knowledge it has been made into four films. I've not seen them all but would surely recommend the version starring Sir Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon and David Niven. It has been assigned reading in countless high school and college classroom, and printed throughout the world in numerous editions.Now, Penguin Audio gives us the opportunity to enjoy this story of love not meant to be in a superb audio edition read by Prunella Scales and Samuel West. Fans of the incredibly popular BBC series \\"Fawlty Towers\\" will remember Scales as Sybil. Here, she is Cathy incarnate and a prime narrator when assuming the voice of Nelly Dean. A popular actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, West brings both pathos and drama to the hopes and final bitter heartbreak found in Heathcliff.As we hear in the voices of Mr. Lockwood and housekeeper Nelly Dean, Heathcliff was an orphan with no home to call his own so he came to Wuthering Heights where he is not only given shelter but also friendship by Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of the wealthy owner. But, eventually Heathcliff asks for more than friendship - he proposes marriage. When he is cruelly rebuffed his love turns to a desire for revenge.How sad that Emily Bronte lived for only 30 years. How fortunate for us that her legacy is the incomparable \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, considered a defining work of Gothic Romance literature is essentially the narrated story of two individuals at the end of the 19th century, Catherine and Heathcliff, and their passionate love for each other which is never consummated. The story takes place basically in two estates in Yorkshire&iexcl;s moors, and its intricate plot involves two generations of characters living in these houses.I found Wuthering Heights to be very a very enjoyable book mainly because of the unbridled emotional intensity present in the story. Each of the characters are bounded by love or hatred, often to a very twisted and irrational extreme. The passions of these characters eventually lead to great acts of cruelty and vengeance, creating a very vibrant, tragic, and intense storyline.I also liked the fact that there very few actual characters in the book, however Bronte manages to make them very vivid, and their personalities and relationships with other characters consistently changes throughout the story as a result of events. Often I would really pity certain characters, or feel shocked and angered at many of their actions; it&iexcl;s simply very hard to not be almost pulled into the book&iexcl;s setting. Until the last few pages of the book, it really seemed as if the anguish and torment of the characters would continue endlessly. Therefore I was quite amazed Bronte managed to create a tranquil, satisfying ending, however I do feel that the ending was just a bit TOO satisfying, since it didn&iexcl;t leave me with very much to think about.Overall, it&iexcl;s a very beautifully written book vivid even in its descriptions of the beauty of the Yorkshire countryside, and one that really stirs the reader&iexcl;s emotions and feelings. This is definitely a great read for anybody in high school or above."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Published in 1847, WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public, many of whom condemned it as sordid, vulgar, and unnatural--and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure. It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership. And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back. Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers. It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness. It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant. And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights. It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a \\"Gipsy\\" child who he named Heathcliff. And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she. But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station. She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to \\"get into;\\" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting. But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations. Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself. Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe. Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Rather than delve on the contents of this strangest and strongest of English novels, so intensely poetic in its haunting darkness and otherness, I'll comment briefly on the best editions available for a good first contact:A) Text oriented editions (that is, editions with few materials added: normally an Introduction, annotation, and perhaps Charlotte's Peface and Biographical Notice and some bibliographical indications).1. Oxford World's Classics: authoritative text, good annotation,excellent introduction.2. Penguin's Classics: same as above, everything looks a little shorter but is excellent nonetheless.3. Wordsworth Classics edition. This would be a rather fine edition as befitting this collection, if it had a good 1847 text and not the heavily tampered-with Charlotte's 1850 edition. The text itself reflects accurately that of the 1900 Haworth Edition -a careful one-. The wording changes aren't perhaps so worrying nor is the toning-down of the dialectal tirades -although funny and useless-. What is worrying is the disappearance of more than six hundred paragrapph entries (I mean just the paragraphing, not the contents itself!), that makes for a different -and worse- reading experience. Very good and full -if brief- annotation. Mass-market, glued paperback.4. Heather Glen's for Routledge. One of the finest text-oriented editions, especially for the excellent Introduction and Epilogue together with its good annotation, out-of-print for rather obscure reasons. If you find still a very good to fine copy at amazon Canadian branch (or at abebooks.com, it would be a good buy.5. Orchises two-volume facsimile reprint of the 1847 edition. No notes nor any additional material. the books are well produced if a little expensive. Very interesting item, but only suitable for textual scholars or would-be scholars, or otherwise for fetish-oriented WH-maniacs.B) Study-oriented editions (i.e. editions that contain additional contextual information: early reviews, selection of Emily's poems, critical essays, chronologies of the novel or of the Bronte family...).6. Norton's Fourth Edition (current item): OK, the text is still a little idiosyncratic, but the notes are much improved, and so is everything else (with the anthology of poems, and the critical essays). A very fine study edition but also suitable for a first contact, although annotation is still on the scarce side. Good paperback production without flaps but signature-sewn (or so it seems) and good paper and printing quality (albeit with a rather small type).7. Broadview edition by Beth Newman: it's one of the best study editions overall. There are some minor textual foibles and the annotation is decidedly scanty (to make amends for Heywood excesses) but good and accurate, and both Prof. Newman ecellent Introduction and the selection of the additional contextual material is, arguably, the finest ever (including the very interesting document on \\"Brain fever\\"). Materially speaking, it is a good paperback without flaps with good paper and printing quality (like Norton Critical, although I can't ascertain without tearing apart my copy of Beth Newman's that it be signature-sewn instead of glue-only \\"perfect binding). In any case a very good buy.7. Alison Booth's for Longman Cultural. Other of the very best study editions available. The text is deadly acuurate -except for some 1850 unobtrusive detail- on theClarendon 1976 reference critical edition, although the punctuation -like Norton Critical, Broadview's Newman and Oneworld's one- has been silently lightened and modernized throughout. It looks like glue-only \\"perfect binding\\" paperback, but perhaps it is signature-sewn. Paper and printing quality are good enough. The only misgiving I have is the overdone fragmentation of contextual material (good and relevant material though it is): there are 40+ items, many of them very short or they wouldn't fit into 430 pages. One of the best possible buys.8. Onewold's Classics edition. A fine paperback edition with flaps, very good paper and printing quality and (I rather surmise than know for sure) signature-sewn. The text looks like 1847 in paragraphing but it takes in toomany of 1850 \\"improvements\\" and is wrong at some places: it's short of a disaster, but rather non-reliable (in spite of the well-meant efforts by the almost anonymous editing panel who perpetrated it). Annotation is good and comprehensive enough, but the contextual material is rather scanty and run-of-the-mill non-commital.9. Barnes&Noble;'s Tatiana Holway edition (hardcover). To say it promptly the only fault with this lovely edition (but, as stated above in wordsworth Classics edition, a really big fault) is its accurate and reliable 1850 Haworth Edition text. Other than this, it looks as a popularly oriented edition, but with quality marks. The Introduction by Daphne Merkin is good enough, the annotation by Holway is really excellent. Supplementary material is very scanty: the \\"Charlotte's prefatory materials\\" of 1850 (prefixed to the text, which is a pity), and some comments about film and TV adaptations as well as some chosen excerpts of reviews. Material production is outstanding: nice hardcover with dust jacket, good paper and printing quality, the only good available edition in a becoming format (Clarendon Edition is very hard to come by nowadays: say one to three years to pin it down). Don't forget the Franklin Mint editions of the sixties and seventies if you are interested in a very beautiful book with a reliable 1847 text and illustrations by Alan Reingold (and nothing else)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights,\\" Emily Bronte's only published novel, is a saga of two Yorkshire families who live in the remote Pennine Hills of England's North Country. To me the book has always epitomized the best of gothic fiction. The narrative is filled with intensity of feeling, especially Heathcliff's passionate love for his Cathy and hers for him - a love which endures beyond the grave. More than would be lovers, however, the two are soul mates and have been since their childhood. Cathy once told Nelly, her servant and friend: \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being.\\"Yet, the novel is more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, obsession, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Both Linton and Earnshaw families are considered gentry. However, the Linton's are a more educated, cultured group and appear to be of a higher class than those who reside at Wuthering Heights. Some of Catherine's most crucial decisions involve moving up in society.The story is told in a series of narratives, none of which are entirely reliable. During the winter of 1801, a gentleman named Mr. Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He has a natural curiosity, and in time visits his neighbor and wealthy landlord, Heathcliff, a grim, forbidding man who lives at Wuthering Heights, a few miles from the Grange. Lockwood also makes the acquaintance of Heathcliff's housekeeper Ellen Dean, called Nelly, and asks her to tell him about her employer and the history of those who reside at Wuthering Heights. He documents her narrative in his journal, and his written recollections make up the main portion of the novel. Much of Nellie's tale consists of memories from years before, her observations of life with the Earnshaw family, her recollections of the Lintons, and her own conclusions, which are subjective. Lockwood, gets his information second hand, from Nellie's perspective. He continually interprets, and misinterprets the relationships and actions of the characters who play such major roles here. So, it is up to the reader to make sense of it all - which is what the author intended.As a young girl Nelly worked as a servant at Wuthering Heights for Mr. Earnshaw, the owner, his wife, and their two children, Hindley, and Catherine. Earnshaw returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy-like urchin, a dark-haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the lad, a quiet, stoic child, and names him Heathcliff, after a son who died. Earnshaw decides to raise him with his own children. Catherine befriends Heathcliff almost instantly. They share a love of nature, and an emotional intensity unknown to most people. They are able to communicate with each other easily, even as young children, and both possess tremendously creative imaginations. The two roam the moorland wilderness, where they're most at home, like wild creatures of nature, and become inseparable friends. Hindley detests Heathcliff from the first. He is jealous and goads the boy constantly. Eventually, after the death of his wife, Mr. Earnshaw begins to show preference for Heathcliff over his own son, which exacerbates the hostility. Finally, Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at home, at Earnshaw's side.Hindley comes into his inheritance some years later, at age twenty, when his father dies. Cathy is eleven years-old, and Heathcliff about twelve, when the heir returns to Wuthering Heights, and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched boy from the slums with no means of his own. Obviously Heathcliff cannot defend himself and is totally dependent on Hindley. He is forced to work as a laborer in the fields, and is treated harshly, as less worthy than an animal. He and Cathy maintain their closeness. They still wander the wild North country and she shares her studies with him. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange, home of the Linton family. Cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella live there. When a dog savagely bites Cathy, it is discovered that she and Heathcliff have been hiding in the brush spying. The girl is seriously injured and is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. During her time with the Linton family, Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Needless to say, her relationship with Heathcliff deteriorates significantly, as he feels he is losing the only person he ever loved.Edgar pursues Catherine relentlessly, and eventually, the young woman's desire for social advancement, and an inexplicable fey, self destructive quality about her, prompt her to accept his proposal. However, she really does not love her fiance. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. On the other hand genteel women of this period were supposed to have neither \\"passionate\\" nor intense feelings. \\"'Here and here!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast: 'in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\\" Thus Catherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by Hindley. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire\\". Her powerful connection to Heathcliff is always present, no matter how annoyed she becomes with him. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man. He knows that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self-possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is more adept at exacting it than Hindley ever was.Nelly continues her increasingly complex tale, (which I won't spoil for you), of three generations: of births, marriages, deaths, traumas, complications, a second more hopeful love story and redemption. The most recurring theme is the great love and friendship, the everlasting connection, between Cathy and her Heathcliff, whose difficult nature is almost impossible to understand and to accept - unless, of course, one thinks about his unknown origins and early childhood as a homeless waif in Liverpool. One can only imagine the horrors he experienced wandering the streets of the rough port town, with neither protection nor kindness. What cruelty and meanness of spirit did he learn there? His terrible, inhuman treatment at Hindley's hands certainly played a part in Heathcliff's lust for revenge and lack of mercy, as did Catherine's decision to marry Linton, which must have been devastating for him. Heathcliff remains a dark, brooding, cruel man throughout his adult years and never reforms. He is an anti-hero, at least in my eyes, as he also possesses good qualities, along with a terrible sadness, an emptiness and longing which he shows to Cathy alone.Emily Bronte's extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. Miss Bront spent most of her short life at home, in Thornton, Yorkshire, where she was happiest. She loved the surrounding moors - the wide, wild expanses, unsuitable for cultivation, and full of danger. There are bogs and wetlands on the moors, which can go virtually unseen, and where one can drown. It is also a place of great beauty. The author spent much time walking there with her dogs and was terribly unhappy when she was away. The similarities between the author's natural environment and that of the area around Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are obvious. Ms Bronte drew inspiration from the regional Yorkshire architecture also, as well as her own personal experiences and her amazing imagination, a gift Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell Bronte shared - with each other and with us. I have read a few Bronte biographies and always felt that the character of Catherine Earnshaw, certainly her intensity and love of nature, was based on Emily Bronte.Keep a box of tissues handy throughout your reading of \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I wonder if this is the first tearjerker?JANA"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm 16 and fall into the vast catogory of Wutehring Heights readers who had to finish it for a highschool english assignment. If I hadn't been, er, forced to read it, I never would've encountered this amazing book. The themes that it encompasses, love, hate, revenge, isolation, are so masterfully blended in this book that I found it extremely powerful. True, it is not a romance - it is so much more. I didn't find it confusing, although Joseph's lines had to be read allowed several times before they were actaully understood. The doubling-up of names just increases the sense of isolation within the book, something which I think is rather important to the story. I hardly find this book boring at all, it's passionate and full of action, something which took me completely off guard. Please, give it a chance. And even though he was a complete jerk, my favourite character is still Heathcliff. *G*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Is there anybody out there who hasn't heard of Heathcliff, the dark villian/hero of this high pitched and utterly committed work of madness? Oh, I love it. It was difficult for me at first. I'm a writer, but not a natural reader. But once I was into this book, once I stopped asking questions of the narrative and just entered the shadowy world of Catherine and her doomed household, I was quite literally spellbound. Bronte died believing this book was a failure. What a dreadful irony that this quiet, disciplined woman who lived out her life in a cold parsons' house with her brilliant sisters, her drunken brother and her eccentric father (The man memorized Paradise Lost: imagine. And outlived all his children!) never even had an inkling that this outpouring of her heart and soul would become a classic, overshadowing even her sister's highly successful Jane Eyre. Both Bronte sisters had the capacity to create archetypes -- to imprint upon the culture seminal patterns that endure to the present time. One last point: the father was Irish. Madness and genius in the blood, indeed. Enjoy it. I read it over every year or so, sometimes twice in a row. I study it; I watch all the film versions. I just love it, the way it works, its strange cruelty and enchantment."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The fact that this novel was written when Emily Bronte was only 28 years old, two years before her death, makes one wonder what she would have been capable of had she lived longer and continued writing. I must admit, this was one of those books that I appreciate for its literary merit more than enjoy for its pure reading pleasure. But if the true test of a novel is how visceral of a reaction the reader has to its characters, then this is certainly a fine novel. Each of Bronte's characters is exquisitely developed in his or her own way. And each evokes powerful emotional responses from the reader - mostly negative reactions of anger, frustration, disgust, etc. - but reactions, nonetheless. A well-written character, remember, does not have to be a character that you admire or love; pathetic, self-centered, cruel characters can be the product of exceptional writing, as long as they evoke genuine feelings of revulsion from the reader.And this novel is full of characters that will earn little admiration from readers. Indeed, the only character that was really \\"likeable\\" was the temporary tenant of the Wuthering Heights estate, to whom the story is recounted by Ellen, the servant. Ellen gives her account of the events that she witnessed as the domestic employee of Catherine, a self-centered, melodramatic eccentric who falls in love with Heathcliff, the gypsy who under somewhat mysterious circumstances is brought by her father to live in their home. Despite her love, Catherine marries Edgar, causing Heathcliff to devote the remainder of his years to exacting revenge for her betrayal. What follows is a dark, brutal, sometimes frightening tale of a pathological love affair and its tragic consequences.Bronte certainly did not view the world through rose-colored glasses, if Wuthering Heights is any indication of her personal world view. It can be a difficult read at times, only because the few redeemable qualities of the main characters are so powerfully overshadowed by their flaws, their cruel intentions, and the bleak outlook that Bronte portrays. It certainly deserves its place, however, among the classics of English literature, and its characters, despite their shortcomings (or perhaps because of them), will live long in the readers mind after the final page."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Jane Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights not to show what love IS. But what love can DO to those who are encompassed by desire. This novel is simply brilliant and by far the greatest novel of the Brontes and (in my opinion) the greatest novel ever written. I say this because Emily laid aside all the conventional types of victorian writing and imbued her novel with persons and events that are not ordinary, but utterly fascinating. Almost completely unrealistic at times, yet perfectly sound in their meanings. Some say to me that Wuthering Heights is impossible to enjoy. While others say they dislike the characters so much that they had to stop reading. I also hear that they cannot figure out all the plot twist and turns. But I say, is this not what REAL-LIFE is? There is no certainty of happiness in the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff. Certainly there is no certainty of happiness for ANYONE in the novel. (Which goes the same for all of us.) As wretched as this seems, Emily (in my opinion) did not write a full blown epic of true romance, despite what many say they love about this novel. She took humans and turned them into what is surprizingly MORE realistic. Emily filled them with faults and turned Cathy and Heathcliff into selfish and undeserving people who destroy each other, not out of love, but out of greed and their own unharnessable animal-like behaviour of what love was TO THEM. What they do and say isn't romantic, but a sign (or even a warning from Emily) of what self indulgence and obsession can do to people pushed beyond their limits of common sense. Cathy and Heathcliff brought themselves to believe that their love was REAL, when in fact their grasp of love was (as Charlotte said, PERVERTED.) Unrelenting in it's destructivness, thus leading to the various calamities their actions bestowed upon the (somewhat) innocent people surrounding them. As brilliant as this novel is, the greatness lies in the story telling of the many different characters we meet. The many different view points from Nellie to Edgar to Isabella and Hindley, spread across the pages and show you how they interact and react with one another as they expierence the situations which seem so very wild and incredible yet ring so very true. This (to me) is not exactly a novel about unbending love. But more of a study of the weaknesses that is stored in everyman. Emily gave us a written guide to show that following your instincts and passions is not always the best path to take. And Emily accomplished this with the most brilliant and unsurpassed written novel in history. It's pages burn with life and it's characters speak in tongues which, even now, I cannot always fully understand. Wuthering Heights can be looked upon as a fascinating study of a particular human race (at what could be any time frame) covering the ground of but a few persons, admist the many open miles... Thank you for your eyes..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As with other Wuthering Heights editions, I will not delve into the depths of this strangest and strongest of novels, with its haunting poetical intensity, its everyday realism, its display of physical and psychical violence, its metaphysical contents and its eerie beautiful otherness. As the noted critic C. A. Swinburne put it in 1883:\\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".By the way, whatever the edition you end up with (or none), don't forget to havea try with Emily Bront&eacute; poems, or a sensible selection from them. I realize that this review is by far too long: so, if you are in a hurry, I think that you can skip safely to the last paragraph (\\"SO WHAT?\\") for practical recommendations.The real issue that we face now is: how much does THIS PARTICULAR EDITION of Emily Bront's novel measure up to its intended goal? How does it compare with other editions currently available?Beginning with the bottom line, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST \\"STUDY\\" EDITIONS EVER, together with Beth Newman's one for Broadview Press and Dunn's one for Norton Critical (4th edition). By a \\"study\\" edition (in roughly the same sense as a \\"study\\" Bible), I mean one that is richly annotated, with an interesting Introduction and a variety of context-oriented documents, such as critical reviews or essays, biographical or chronological items, a selection of poems or other writings... Such an edition must be evaluated firstly by his handling (more or less scholarly or careful) of the TEXT(s) involved, then by the choice of supplementary materials (whether interesting or not, balanced or else), in third place by the quality and accuracy of the Introduction and notes, ending with very important issues of design (user-friendly, beautiful) and material production (durability, paper and print quality, binding).IN SUMMARY, lest I get too long and formal, this is a well cared for, accurate and reliable 1847-type text, springing out of the University of Virginia electronic texts, but tightly controlled by the 1976 Clarendon Edition one (by Hilda Marsden and Ian Jack), and silently adapted as punctuation is concerned (resulting in a friendly version, which the scholarly reconstructed punctuation of Clarendon is not).THE INTRODUCTION is short (11 pp) and well planned so that it opens ways for understanding, but can be read before the novel without spoiling anything.It sounds a bit like run-of-the-mill material, but this is a deceiving image(Alison Booth's command of the material is always there).THE ANNOTATION IS VERY GOOD and extensive enough, with full and right glosses of the dialect tirades, and accurate, to-the-point information on biblical or literary references, or contextual ways and means.In that most elusive of references, the one about Milo (of Croton) in Chapter IX, however, Alison Booth edition slips a little, like many other good ones (with Clarendon doing a little better, the ones getting the story right if not in full are Barnes&Noble;, Wordsworth Classics, Penguin/Nestor, Broadview/Newman, Oneworld Classics and the excellent but ill-fated Routledge edition by Heather Glen). According to the Geography of Strabo, Book XII, which is the only source for this story, Milo in his old age tried to tear apart in two a tree half split and with a wedge to retain it open. He then exerted all his force with his hands, opening the gap wide enough for the wedge to drop off; the tree closed (it requires an ever increasing force to continue opening the trunk -this is Hooke's Law in physics-) and trapped the hands of Milo, who was then devoured by wolves.It is regarding this story that we read in the novel:\\"Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo!\\" (who also tried unwisely and deadly to SEPARATE something). Saying in a note, as Booth does, \\"In the classical fable, Milo, an athlete, tried to pull a tree up by the roots\\" is a little misleading (not only do we lose the \\"separation factor\\", but also accuracy. Milo is neither a fable nor a myth, but a real human being with a place both in time and on earth, mentioned with consistent witness by two of the best historians of the time, other than Strabo. As to the stories connected to him, nothing is known for sure when we go into the details, and so the label \\"legend\\" is most appropriate).The CONTEXTUAL MATERIALS are well chosen and presented. The only problem, and I think THE GREATEST PROBLEM with this otherwise excellent edition, is that there are 40+ items of this material and only 130 pages to fit them in: it looks hopelessly like a motley medley of maddening fragments, with, say, ONLY FIVE OF EMILY'S POEMS, which is both a pity and a blunder. There are interesting curios as the \\"Table of the average yearly wages paid to domestics... according to their rank in a household\\".More important are the pages devoted to Yorkshire dialect (too scarce) and ballads (very good). There is also a fair amount of space (11 pages) allotted to \\"cultural dissemination\\", that is, works of art (songs, theatrical or musical adaptations as well as TV or movie ones, sequels...) deriving from or related with the novel.The data included are very good and complete except for the chapter on translations in which, just as an example, only two translations into Spanish are listed, and only one in current use although it is barely acceptable: there are by now no less than TEN Spanish translations easily available; some are very good, some are rightly annotated, none is both things together and none is based on the 1847 text (but on the 1850 one).MATERIAL PRODUCTION is... fair enough, as far as I can tell without ripping apart my copy. A not-too-bad paperback, perhaps even signature-sewn but without flaps (with cover corners and even front-edge vulnerable). Paper quality looks good (time will tell) and printing quality is excellent. Design is clear and user-friendly(I will not comment on the typeface they use for big headlines, perhaps somebody will love it).SO WHAT?If an accurate and reliable text and a rich annotation are a must,then stick to this Longman Cultural Edition (by Alison Booth).If you can make do with a generally reliable text with a few errors, some idiosyncratic readings and inconsistencies and, besides, you don't mind a scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you will appreciate the finest choice ever of contextual materials (but with only EIGHT OF EMILY's POEMS) as well as a MOST INTERESTING and thought-provoking INTRODUCTION (29pp), then choose the Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman (be sure not to pick their earlier one by Christopher Heywood!).If, on the other side, you may accept a generally reliable text and a very scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you would appreciate the best presentation ever of early reviews and similar materials (Charlotte's prefaces for 1850, and some letters by Charlotte) and you would enjoy a really good and wide enough selection of EIGHTEEN EMILY's POEMS, then don't miss the elegant and no-nonsense Fourth Edition of Norton Critical (by R.J. Dunn, with almost the same text, for good and worse, of the late and mourned William M. Sale 1963 1st edition).Have a haunting reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is not for people that like happy endings or people that don't appreciate the works of Poe and other \\"dark\\" authors. This is probably my favorite book. What I loved about it? Everything. This is a book about unresolved passions and how they managed to ruin everything and everyone around them.Heathcliff is a \\"dark\\" solitary man whose only interest is winning the eyes of Catherine Earnshaw, a beautiful young girl, who is also his best friend. When she marries Edgar Linton, Heathcliff is resolved to (literally) make their lives hell. And he does, but also destroys himself in the end. It's sad, tragic, passionate, a perfect book really."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i had heard mixed things about Wuthering Heights, but decided to give it a try on daily lit to see if it could hold my attention. since i've been busy with school i haven't had the chance to read any other way, so it's been a good way to at least feel like i'm reading something.anyhow, the first half or so was rather boring for me, with lots of background and overly descriptive passages. i was definitely glad to be reading it in the daily lit format. i don't think i would have stuck with it otherwise. but, after that, it really picked up, and i found myself clicking for the next installment often.in the end, i can definitely say i enjoyed it, but the dull beginning lent the lower rating. it was quirky and fun and the character development was wonderful. i particularly enjoyed the style of narration and will be much less leary of picking up another bronte book in the future."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had already known that 'Wuthering Heights' was going to be a dark love story. Therefore, I was unsurprised when I read it and discovered that it was THAT twisted. However, it was also gripping and very interesting. You do not expect a woman in the 1800s to write a book with such romantic passion - because that is where the darkness comes from, the passion that two of the characters have for each other.I really enjoyed this book, though I must admit I was feeling a bit down after I read it. This book will definitely have you re-think Romance. Do you really want that all-consuming love? A love that causes anger, hatred, even death?If you are a fun of romance and old-century books, do not hesitate to pick this book up. If you like gloomy moors, and tales of strife, you shall like this book, too. This is a perfect combination of the two genres.Good reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I especially enjoyed the add-ons at the end. Teens will find this fun and interesting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I both love and hate this book. I've read it twice and every time it breaks my heart.It's wonderfully written and a must read for anyone that hasn't had that pleasure yet."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is beautifully written. I fell in love with Emily Bronte and her cadence of language from the very first chapter.Sadly, I loathed the characters. I sympathized with Heathcliff in the first half of the book and was disappointed to find myself hating him in the second half. I despised Catherine Earnshaw from her introduction in the story until her death. The only character I liked at all was Hareton, and I was happy for the way things turned out for him.Reading Wuthering Heights made me appreciate Jane Austen so much more than I already did! Emily Bronte's female characters continually made me wistfully think of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, and long for her to inhabit Thrushcross Grange instead of Catherine Earnshaw. The difference between Austen's female characters and Bronte's is shocking. I definitely take the existence of strong willed women in modern fiction for granted, and this reminded me how ahead of her time Jane Austen really was. I would love to read a piece of Austen fanfic in which Elizabeth Bennet bashes Catherine Earnshaw over the head with a frying pan, usurps her as mistress of Thrushcross Grange, and gives Heathcliff AND Mr. Linton a sound thrashing.I was surprised that some describe this story as romantic; I didn't find one word even remotely romantic! I appreciated the Gothic and supernatural elements and the wonderful, descriptive writing style. I have a beautiful image of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights in my head; I can picture the houses and their rooms, the landscape, the gardens and the hills. Despite the personalities of the characters, I really did enjoy this story and I'm glad to have finally read it.I especially love this new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition. Ruben Toledo's cover is even more gorgeous than the Amazon picture portrays, and the pages and binding are high quality. I definitely plan to purchase the rest of these Deluxe Editions that Penguin has released."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I will refrain from giving a plot outline. Many have already done this and it is such a well known story that many people are familar with it having not even read the book. It is one of the greatest stories of love between two people that are too much alike to really understand each other in the English language. Is it an easy happy read no is it a realistic view of a violently passonate love that is doomed yes. You don't read this book for moon light and romance you read this book for the complete realism in it. We all want happy endings in life. Wuthering Heights gives us a more realistic view of what we all live through. Emily Bronte was over a century before her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new. It loosens as you read.There are more titles available, though some are still exclusive to the UK. I truly hope Amazon and Penguin make all editions available in the US and keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is about the relationship between two people named Heathcliff and Catherine. Now, from everything I knew about this book before I read it, I thought the novel was going to be a great love story full of romance and hugging and declarations of devotion. Boy, was I wrong. At the heart of the book is a revenge drama carried out by a man so consumed by hatred that he makes Palpatine from the first Star Wars trilogy look like a nice guy.Heathcliff was raised from childhood with Catherine Earnshaw and her older brother Hindley, but Heathcliff was not related to them. Mr. Earnshaw brought Heathcliff home with him one day after finding him living the life of an orphan on the streets of London. I kinda suspect that maybe Heathcliff was a secret love child Earnshaw had with a mistress in the city. But that's just my take. Heathcliff rapidly becomes Earnshaw's favorite, even more so than Hindley, much to the son's disgust, which fuels an intense hatred and jealousy that only gets worse after the elder Earnshaw dies. Up to that point, Heathcliff had always been treated as a member of the family, but afterwards Hindley treats him as nothing more than a common servant to be abused and made to work his hands to the bone. And by abused, I do mean actual physical beatings. Catherine, the great love of Heathcliff's life, decides that he has nothing to offer her and instead marries Edgar Linton, the son of one of their neighbors. Hindley too, gets married. The only one left out of this whole lovefest is, you guessed it, Heathcliff, and he leaves the windswept moors only to return years later to exact his revenge on both families Monte Cristo style.I was really caught off guard by this book. Like I said, I was expecting a romance instead of a Shakespearean revenge tragedy. That's not to say there isn't a happy ending, but that it takes a long and convoluted path, wrought with broken lives and bittersweet death. What turns Heathcliff into such a monster is that both he and Catherine know that they were meant to be together but she makes the decision to reject him based solely on improving her social standing. And let's be frank, the supposed social mobility she craves doesn't amount to squat when you live out in the middle of nowhere in some backwater Gothic swamp. To me, I can almost see precursors to Faulkner's decaying nobility. Something else that really struck me about the novel was its haunting theme of sexual frustration. What Heathcliff and Catherine feel for each other is very sexual. There isn't any idealistic or poetic flowers growing out of each other's imagination. They see each other for what they are and love each other for what they are. Neither of them were cannibals but I almost felt like if they could find a way to eat each other, they would have.Bronte does a virtuoso job of moving between time periods and showing different generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons as the children of both have to deal with the legacy left them by the destructive failed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. The main narrators of the story are not the two main characters. Instead, the tale is told by Nelly, a maid just a little older than them who was a witness to everything that happened. She tells the story to a certain Mr. Lockwood, a man who is renting a house from Heathcliff many years after all this has gone down. Emily moves from present to past to future and back again during different chapters that really seems a more postmodern way of looking at things. This book was far ahead of its time in terms of novelistic technique.Bronte even takes up the issue of racism in Wuthering Heights, as part of the reason Hindley and the Lintons look down on Heathcliff is because of his \\"dark gipsy skin\\".I look at Catherine as a coward who recognized that Heathcliff was who she was meant to be with, but in her superficial thinking, she was more worried about marrying well (weren't all women of that time the same) than marrying for love. Marrying for love was for peasants. If you had money or land you had to marry an equal or someone higher than you. She chose wrongly and a lot of people had to suffer for it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover.

When I recieved one such email asking me to review Wuthering Heights my first thought was that I would not dare to even try to say anything about such a classic book. But I have just finished reading it again after many years and I had forgotten how wonderful and musical it is. The words flow on the pages like music to your ears. The characters are so engaging, even those you love to hate, and the settings are so real. I feel like I have spent the last few days in an eighteenth century manor house, in the kitchen, near the fire, listening to an amazing story being told by a humble house keeper. I think that sometimes today we forget how inspired beautiful prose, can really make us feel, for hours at a time I forgot all my modern day worries and my hectic work load and just enjoyed a truly wonderful reading experience. Do yourself a favour and reread this book, and if you have never read it then do so you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring, although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a beautiful tale of love and hate. It's a powerful novel, full of emotion and thought. It is a true insight to the human mind and soul. The story begins with Mr. Lockwood, a tenant for Heathcliff to live in Thrushcross Grange. Mr. Lockwood sees Heathcliff and goes home, only to ask one of the servants, Nelly, about Heathcliff's past. The story then is told from her narrative until she decides to end the story to allow Mr. Lockwood to sleep. The story continues in this manner, with Mr. Lockwood going back to Wuthering Heights to see Heathcliff, getting stuck there, etc, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte brings forward the true masterpiece of her era in this novel. While many consider this novel to be one of hate, it is really the story of a love that cannot die, even in the grave.Catherine's slight of Heathcliff is one of the great moments in all of literature. He then goes about making himself worthy of her love. In so doing, he makes many enemies, but anything worth achieving is going to come at some cost. He hates Edgar Linton; he avenges himself through him. His entire purpose in the novel is to prove that he is indeed the true soul-mate of Catherine. All the destruction of earthly morals and customs is indeed okay if only he can be with Catherine for eternity.The ending of the novel also comes to bear. Showing young Catherine, who has the best traits of both her parents being married to Hareton Earnshaw. The story ends in light rather than the bleak atmosphere at the beginning. This point is in keeping with the importance of setting in the Gothic novel.The narration is well handled. For all the people who ascribe nefarious motives to Nelly, I say pshaw! She tells the story from the only point of view possible to a maid in her situation. Lockwood handles the beginning and the end with verve. What makes Emily Bronte so good is that she actually changes the characters in the narration. Nelly is not confused with Lockwood at any point in the story.I highly recommend this novel. I think it is the Masterpiece of English fiction of its era. I think you will like its many layers and its timelessness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a novel you will not be able to put down once you started reading. It's very engaging!

Emily Bront&#1105; masterfully illustrates how love can dictate human emotion, devotion, and action in everyday life. Through Bront&#1105;'s use of juxtaposition between life and death or heaven and hell, we are introduced to the how love is one of the strongest metaphysical emotions humans acquaint with. This metaphysical passion transcends Mr. Heithcliff's daily routine and drives him to rash decisions of revenge, as well as producing an idea of active and passive forces throughout the novel. This includes the ideals of nature and society being such a force in the development of Catherine as she is unfairly controlled by the forces of Mr. Heathcliff. Bront&#1105;'s use of diction throughout the novel only reinforces the theme through an elegant Yorkshire style. Hefty English accents are thoroughly used, even to the point of confusion. This can most pertinently be noticed with Bront&#1105;'s character Joseph, who carries a heavy accent. All of these devices accumulate to form the imagery of underlying passion that is threaded page by page. Personally, her ability to use such complex and yet detailed imagery to advance the plot astounds me. I would wholly recommend this novel to any individual seeking an understanding to humans' mysterious and controversial collision with love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Recommended by several friends & was well worth the effort!

And although that proves to be true, it's far more complicated than that. Filled with hate, revenge, and anger, you can expect to find very little happiness in this book. As for the characters, I found it impossible to like any of them except for Hareton. You have characters who are so self centered and filled with rage, that in their time of weakness you can't even pity them for they're that despicable. But don't get me wrong, each character has their moments that make you want to forget all their flaws, but those moments are limited.Emily Bronte created a book about love and hate, and what they can do to people. Driven with love and hate, people do crazy things and this books goes to show you that. And although this book had it's slow parts, I still found it to possess a well thought out story. And as for the ending..well that part I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read WUTHERING HEIGHTS as an assignment in 10th grade English class and was struck by how emotionally twisted the characters were. I also wondered if I was reading the book the right way, because I found a lot of the story very funny.So I decided to pick it up again recently and realized what a timeless, brilliant book WUTHERING HEIGHTS really is. It's as emotional and labyrinthine as any soap opera -- but so much more worthwhile. These are some of the most strongly-drawn characters in literature, and they will pull you right into the story with their caprices, turnabouts, fripperies, and cruelty.First-time readers may find the beginning a bit slow, but please don't be discouraged by that. A really wild, romantic -- and, yes, after all these years, still pretty hilarious -- story awaits you. This is a book that can move you to tears and make you laugh out loud.First-time readers may also have trouble keeping track of the two Catherines and who's married to/in love with whom. Even while rereading it, I had to remind myself who was who, who's the child of whom, who's the mortal enemy of whom -- but it is absolutely worth it. So many people go on about how romantic this book is, and it certainly is, but let's not overlook the sheer drama and insanity of this book.This book is more about obsession than pure romantic love. There, I've said it. This book will make you glad that your life is not like this. But any time you need a shot of histrionic behavior and violent obsession, Heathcliff and Cathy are waiting for you at WUTHERING HEIGHTS."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"...when you have nobody to love you...lonely like the devil and envious like him...nobody will cry for you when you die!I don't consider &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be a love story or simply a book about love, hate, and revenge, as it is often wrongfully described by many. I dare not say this is a social work either, but it is somehow concerned with broad issues such as social and familial oppression, the subordination and the disadvantaged nature of female lives at that time, the brutality of the patriarchal power, the unjustices of the inheritance law, etc. The most striking thing about this book is that it is concerned with extremities like love and hate, human and animal, life and death, masters and servants, earthly and divine.Of course the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is maybe one of the main things of, at least, the first part of this work: they're like almost two waterdrops, both showing a fondness for freedom and nature. But their relationship (I don't know why I hesitate to call it love) is kind of dysfunctional, for lack of a better word. Maybe it's because of the lack of a mother for both of them, maybe because of their upbringing in an atmosphere of patriarchal brutality.And maybe it's not a pure coincidence that Heathcliff's origins are obscure: when he first appears at Wuthering Heights he is dirty, ragged, starving and houseless, ill-treated by the patriarchal and he is refused education. As a critic simply put it, Wuthering Heights can hardly be described as a social novel, but it deals with many social themes, as Heathcliff might be seen as a representative of, maybe not the dispossessed, but at least of the oppressed; on the other hand Edgar reads a great deal, but his reading seems more a means of escape from the emotional turmoil which surrounds him rather than a pleasure per se. Besides, towards the end of the story, Cathy begins to educate Hareton, which later leads them to falling in love, as preposterous as this might seem earlier in the book: their previous enmity and hatred has been forsaken in favour of union through learning. Interestingly, as this is happening, Heathcliff, formally the force for energy (not a positive one), now acknowledges the draining of this energy and the lost of his faculty of enjoying their destruction and his being too idle to destroy for nothing (I have to remind myself to breathe-almost to remind my heart to beat: conscience has turned my heart to an earthly hell).If the first part of this work depicts a fierce and passionate but also binary view of the Yorkshire moors society, the second part of it is about reconciliation, education, development and, thus, progress. At the end of the book the powers are much more balanced, the relationship between sexes more egalitarian, as E. Bront seems to emphasize the need of the society to develop and move forward with necessary cohesion.Or at least this is the way I see this novel, much more a social work rather than simply a book about love, hate and revenge, and that's what makes it, in my opinion, one of the best of its time. But hey, every reader may see and interprete it his or her own way: I guess this too is the beauty of literature, as that of music and art in general."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this in my senior year of high school and found that I could NOT put it down. I would linger after class to talk to my teacher about it, and finally she told me I could keep the school's copy for my own use. She could tell how much I loved it! I practically have tears in my eyes when I reread the first few sentences. This is the saddest, and yet the most hopeful book I have ever read. It's so beautiful, and Bronte has taken cares to describe the human condition of loneliness she doubtlessly felt during her own lifetime. These are some of the most realistic characters in all of literature, and YOU WILL NOT REGRET PICKING UP THIS BOOK!!! I can't even fully describe how much I love this book. Honestly, it changed me. The story is unforgettable, and exquisitely profound. I urge you to open your heart and let this book move you too."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before reading WH, I knew its reputation as a dark novel but was taken aback a bit by the grinding dreariness and cruelty of the story. Noone who has read Jane Eyre will confuse Emily with Charlotte. I had also heard it described as a tragedy but, while it certainly has its tragic elements, it lacks the defining element of a truly gripping tragic story--sympathetic characters. In short, WH seems to defy easy classification and I suppose that's an important part of its allure.While I found the first three chapters, which establish the odd and mysterious inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, to be a bit slow in gathering momentum, the remainder of the book heightened my interest as the narrative of past events unfolded. I disagree with some reviewers who found the prose to be overdone and difficult to read; I enjoyed the narrative style and diction and found myself immersed within the wild moors setting. The story itself is compelling and, if one can stifle the desire for a hero in shining armor to alleviate the persistent suffering found within the pages, the flawed characters are fascinating.Putting aside some very minor problems such as the plausibility of the detailed recollections of Nelly Dean which constituted the bulk of the narrative, my primary issue with the book is the ending. In particular, I found the Cathy/Hareton union to be a bit difficult to believe and, more importantly, the potential suspense and suprise around the death of Heathcliff to be an opportunity lost by the revelation of his passing before its description within the narrative flow.Taken as a whole, WH is a very enjoyable read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know that I will be tarred and feathered for denouncing the &quot;20th Century's favorite 19th Century novel&quot; but I have my reasons why as you shall see. Most of the novel rests entirely on Bronte's ability as a weaver of words, and not on her creation of characters. Bronte tried to imitate the passion of Lord Byron's characters and succeeded only marginally. Out of all the characters in Wuthering Heights only Heathcliff is strongly developed in the sense that although we may despise him at certain times, we always feel a sense of empathy, even compassion at times. For the character of Catherine Earnshaw/Linton one feels only contempt, with a thin veil of sorrow. It is the same feeling one has for Miss Havisham in Dickens Great Expectations. Catherine senior is a deceitful, destructive force who almost succeeds in passing on her vices and moral depravity onto her daughter. Unlike Dickens Great Expectations however, we see no reason in her madness, which is one of the failings of Bronte's novel. To most readers she is just a spoiled little rich girl who wants to have her cake and eat it too. This is never expounded on in any great length and Bronte, while not explicitly saying it, seems to condone it as a perfectly good reason to go to Edgar and not Heathcliff. It is at that point in the story that we have nothing but total contempt for Catherine senior and nothing else. But there are many morally bankrupt characters that populate great literature and they do not take away from the story, Dickens Miss Havisham and Estella, come up once again. The difference between Catherine senior and these characters is that Bronte's character is shown as a weak, whining woman with no clear direction either in her life or in the plot of the story. She is in short the airhead of the story. It is a very negative portrayal of women and I'm surprised that Bronte devoted so much time to this character. Her daughter Catherine junior is a much stronger character in every way, but here again is another downfall of the book. The characters of Catherine junior and Hareton Earnshaw are cast out of the spotlight in favor of concentrating on Catherine seniors whining. These characters, along with those like Nelly Dean and Lockwood have far less substance than they should. Bronte should have devoted more time to Catherine and Hareton than she did. Overall, I think that Heathcliff saved the story from bombing terribly, and Bronte's prose also contributes to the beauty of the book, but she was no Lord Byron. Bronte simply did not understand plot and character well enough to make this the novel it could have been, which is a terrible shame. Although some people indict this book as just being a 19th Century soap opera, its fault rests not in the plot being too unrealistic and trite, it rests on the fault that the reader only gets to know a few characters really well, and of those characters only Heathcliff is given the attention he deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Charlotte Bronte is a great writer. I read Jane Eyre twice and comprehended every word, every nuance. Wuthering Heights was another matter. So much of it was obtuse. Just a little while ago, I read a very helpful review here by an English teacher no less, who said he had trouble comprehending the story the first time around, but he has read it again and this time it was a completely different and positive experience for him. I certainly have benefited from this particular review because now I am going to read Wuthering Heights again with a different attitude. It is not easy reading; it is a deep book. You have to concentrate, but I know I can do it, and I am going to do it! Even though I saw the movie before I read the book (I thought the movie starring Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier was outstanding), parts of the book were still obtuse. If I hadn't seen the movie, I suppose the book would have been a total imposssibility. I don't mean to seem so negative about Wuthering Heights, but I have never in my life read a book where I had to concentrate so much; it took the pleasure out of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Enjoying a great novel sometimes requires a willingness to accept confusion, at least initially. Many readers who have trouble appreciating &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; are put off by the work's first 50 pages. The novel begins with a focus on a fastidious hypochnodriac who is not actually the main character and who never even has a first name: Mr. Lockwood, a tidy little man who enjoys observing love from a distance but is terrified by its proximity. He has no idea what's in store for him. Urged by his doctor to rest his over-wrought nerves, Mr. Lockwood rents a beautful manor in the apparently idyllic Yorkshire moors of northeast England, a decision he will soon both deeply regret and enjoy. In the novel's opening pages, Bronte successfully integrates Mr. Lockwood's mistaken conclusions with the reader's: 1)Mr. Heathcliff must be a gentleman [He isn't]; (2)The young lady by the hearth must be Heathcliff's wife or perhaps that of the coarse young man who also lives there [She's neither; she's actually a widow, and the coarse young man should be the house's master]; and (3)Catherine Earnshaw is a spectral demon with the power to return to earth in order to continue terrorizing those whom she once loved [Maybe she is; maybe it's only a dream], and so on. All of these errors in judgment are completely understandable, and during the course of the novel they are all satisfactorily explained. But initially, the situation Mr. Lockwood, as well as the reader, encounters is very, very confusing. Mr. Lockwood gets nearly everything wrong, and to a reader accustomed to lucid foreshadowing, Lockwood's mistakes are perplexing. What IS going on in this strange, strange house? Confusing the reader, however, is actually part of Bronte's strategy to transport Lockwood, and the reader as well, to a world of pure imagination, a realm of stormy passion where all thoughts are expressed in poetic speech (regardless of the damage they may cause), a world where one character is another character as well (&quot;Nelly, I am Heathcliff&quot;)--in short, a world that would be utterly abhorrent to the reader's rational faculties but proves irresistibly attractive to his emotional and aesthetic dimensions. So the novel's first few pages deliberately disorient the reader, encouraging him to abandon an everyday world where the apparent equals the reality, where most sane people restrain themselves, spending most of their days and nights in balanced, rational pursuits. Bronte's novel, restricted geographically to the Heights and the Grange, is a buttonhole in reality, through which the reader slips without fully realizing it from a more or less rational environment into a world where ghosts are not entirely unexpected, lovers dig up the corpse of their beloved, drunken louts drop their babies from stair landings, middle-aged men repeatedly curse--even brutally batter--younger women, and lovers punish each other to prove the depth of their love. &quot;Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore!&quot; Bronte's world would disintegrate if it were evaluated by generally accepted rational, moral precepts. Bronte instinctively realizes this fact and, within a matrix of purposeful confusion, seductively transports the reader from an everyday world of clearly articulated right and wrong where love is primarily a dalliance into one where love consumes entirely, lasts well beyond mere physical death, and is not the least bit concerned with traditional concepts of right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate, acceptable or unacceptable. With meticulous attention to specific details and complex time frames, Bronte ultimately explains away all of Mr. Lockwood's and the reader's initial misunderstandings. If the reader--allowing for some intentional confusion in the novel's opening pages--continues reading, he will be rewarded by Bronte's ability to transport him into an utterly fascinating but repulsive, familiar but impossible world that is the essence of imaginative literature. Bronte's novel--populated by comic and tragic characters, set in beautiful but deadly landscapes, focused on restrained civility juxtaposed with passionate intensity--undoubtedly deserves its rank among the world's greatest romances and imaginative literary creations."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is not as well-known as her sister Charlotte who wrote Jane Eyre, that, it must be said, far surpasses Wuthering Heights. I'd like to think that every book has a good, universal element we can relate to. And they do. Wuthering Heights is a story of revenge, passion and metaphysical love. It is a Gothic novel set appropriately in the bleakness of the Moors in England. Emily Bronte brings out a gorgeous narrative. It is confusing because it has the points of views quickly shifting from one personage to another. Nelly tells it for the most part. But the love story is incredible. Heathcliff and Catherine, as selfish and cold characters that they are, share a love that binds them even when they are apart in life and in death. It can be romantic. But the reason they teach this in school is because of the scholarly attention it receives, being a Bronte product. I think Jane Eyre may be of higher calibre but Wuthering Heights has its brilliant moments. It is a classic. I say it has many colors because we can be disgusted by the course actions of Heatchliff as he orchestrates his revenge on the people around him. We can also dislike the snobbish personality of Catherine and her choosing money over true love. But we can also sympathize for the lovers as human beings. This is a drama that can take place anywhere on earth. It is human drama. Bronte is as much in the same line as other universal writers including Dante and Shakespeare. Yes, Emily should be proud of her masterpiece. At times boring but worth reading on your own. I highly recommend this great work. Try to see beyond the boring parts and into the love and universalities !"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just finished reading this book like ten minutes ago. This was one of the strangest novels I have ever encountered. At times I dislike it, at other times I was compeletely captivated by it, and now that I'm through with it, I am utterly haunted. There are more detailed reviews on this site about Wuthering Heights but I'll go into what I liked and didn't like and you'll forgive me if the story description that I give isn't 100 percent up to par with everything that happens because frankly alot of stuff occurred and it would be impossible to fit it all here. Catherine and Heathcliff are two people destined to be together as they have been inseperable since they were children and Heathcliff was adopted by her father Mr. Earnshaw. But as they grow older, people try to keep the two apart. The neighbors, the Lintons, have a son named Edgar who Catherine becomes friends with also and this will bring trouble in the future. Also, Catherine's brother Hindley hates Heathcliff because his father doted on him. This will bring more trouble. And finally, once they are fully grown, Heathcliff overhears a part of something Catherine says about how it would be degrading to marry him. Intensely hurt, he leaves for years and years before he can hear her proclaim how much she loves him with a passionate love if ever there were one. She marries the Linton boy Edgar and Heathcliff returns. A tragedy occurs and he uses every fiber of his being trying to get even. To say more would be major spoilers I think, so I'll leave it at that. Now to the good and bad. The narrative is told by both Catherine's nanny and by this other guy who came to rent a room from Heathcliff and sometimes I had trouble telling who was speaking. Also, I felt that it could've been cut shorter in some places with the dialogue, but these are minor problems really. So what's good about this novel? CATHERINE AND HEATHCLIFF. These two deserve to be together and you can feel that whenever they are in one another's presence. I have never read a novel that made me feel so strongly for two characters. Many times I became physically ANGRY that things were happening to drive them apart. Never has this happened. I found myself silently seething about some of this stuff. You really have to read it to fully understand what I'm talking about but so much happens against Heathcliff and the entire world is stacked against him and then Catherine goes and marries Linton. I felt betrayed by that, by a CHARACTER IN A NOVEL. Then later on when there is no longer any hope for the couple to be together at all, I felt such anguish for Heathcliff. It was a real anguish that he was being denied, even as he did despicable deeds to exact revenge. And I'm a guy, not some 16 year old girl. Another thing that was great was how Emily Bronte crafted her characters. Each and every one of them at some time or another does something shameful or mean or just plain evil. But I always understood their motivation and could not hate them for what they did. I felt compassion for some of them as if they were actual flesh and blood. Lord have mercy, why couldn't they just be together? There is something about this book. It is filled with such anguish, such unrequitted love, that it lingers and stays with you. It is the saddest book I have ever read and it will stay with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book is mainly narrated by Mr. Lockwood and Ellen Dean.Mr. Lockwood is renting Thrushcross Grange near Wuthering Heights. A man named Heathcliff is his mysterious and rude landlord. Lockwood asks the housekeeper, Ellen Dean, to tell him the story of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants.She goes on to tell him the story of Heathcliff and Catherine and Wuthering Heights. The first part of her story is of how Heathcliff came to live at the Heights, the seond half of the story is about how Heathcliff takes his revenge as an adult.It's the depth of love that I really like in the book, that timeless love that Heathcliff and Catherine possess. The woman is dead for God's sake, and Heathcliff continues to love her and she haunts the Heights unwilling to leave her soulmate behind. That's what I call true, enduring love. Catherine and Heathcliff's love affair affects everyone they come in contact with. There's no escaping it.Bront creates these imperfect and passionate characters, some of whom are borderline evil. I love the drama within the story, the setting of the dark and stormy Yorkshire moors sets the mood just right. This is a story about love, revenge, family and grief. It's a classic gothic love story that is not soon forgotten. Thank you Emily Bront for creating one of my favorite anti-heroes in literature, Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"But it's not a love story... I really wish people wouldn't call it a love story. Its a story about thwarted passion and what happens when almost obsessive love is taken to extremes.I started to read on Monday and I have now finished it.. I loved every page but I am completely at a loss as to why Heathcliff is so adored. He isn't a romantic figure especially not in the latter half of the book and Cathy is so selfish and spoilt that they can't be together.Brilliant examination of passion gone wrong but not a romantic novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic of English literature has certainly stood the test of time. From the commencement of the novel with moody images to its likewise saturnine conclusion, Bronte's work with tone and characterization sets the bar high for authors of all kinds. The raging zealousness of love that so possess Heathcliff and Catherine melts off the pages in molten waves - truly, has a romance so deluded and inherently doomed ever been described so well? The passions of Romeo and Juliet seem lame in comparison. But never have protagonists been so unlikable. It is hard to sympathize with either one of them, which is the major disappointment of the novel. It is with relief, then, that the romance between young Catherine and Hareton is established. Innocent and true without the sadness that is a trademark of Heathcliff's obsession, the reader begins to glimpse the true meaning of love. The book is intensely readable and page-turning, accessible and unique. The bulk of Wuthering Heights is a psychological exploration of what the past does to a person - it does not so much examine a passionate affair than it does the consequences of actions undertaken by the abused and misguided. Surely Bronte's masterpiece of the human soul will linger as long as Heathcliff's intensity for his lost idol."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The outdated writing style takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it's good. It's incredible to me how the author, with her unusually limited experience of the outside world, who probably never had a boyfriend or lover in her life and lived a secluded life in a remote part of Yorkshire with her sisters and died a virgin, could have created such an incredibly realistic and well-drawn character like Heathcliffe. I love the fact that he's flawed and I love the chemistry between him and Jenny. It's just amazing to me that so much passion could lurk in the heart of such an isolated and inexperienced soul as Emily Bronte. I don't suppose she and Charlotte got any real romance or sex as governesses. Emily's poems are full of originality and vision, but it is her novel that's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Told in alternating flashbacks from the perspectives of two narrators, Wuthering Heights is the gothic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff. Their doomed love has tragic repercussions for them and both of their families.I absolutely loved this when I first read it as a teenager. It's like a creepy soap opera."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of course, I'm not referring to one of the best novels (I don't say \\"best-loved\\" novels, because it's not a lovable reading, but an all-important, soul-searching and unforgettable one). As the noted critic A. C. Swinburne said in 1883: \\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".So it has been for more than a century. Nobody should miss this strangest and strongest of English novels, so hauntingly beautiful and intensely poetical in its dark and eerie otherness. By the way, don't miss Emily Bront's poems, or a good selection of them.The issue now, is this PARTICULAR paperback edition (Wordsworth Classics, 2000). What do we get and what not, how does it compare to the other editions in the marketplace.To begim with, it's ONE OF THE THINNEST EDITIONS EVER, light on your pocket and cheap as airborne luggage (6/8 inch vs., say, one full inch for Penguin Classics edition). The mass-market paperback, is as bad as you fear, and then some... for its paper quality and binding. A bit surprisingly, printing quality is good enough. The Introduction (18 pp) by John S. Whitley is not bad, perhaps one bit askew for the intended readership (I don't feel myself at ease with those Freudian interpretations). The Bibliography is good and so is the annotation at the end of the book, three pages in small type that aren't user-friendly, specially in the handling of the dialect tirades.So, it looks like a good edition, were it not for the outrageous material production; but then, Penguin's and Oxford's aren't so much better as paper quality and binding go, although their type is easier on the eyes and the printing quality a little better. And, mind, when I speak of bad quality paper, it's a matter of Penguin browned pages in only five years, and Oxford's little better behaving of slightlier browned pages in ten years. Wordsworth Classics pages haven't got brown so far but they sure will do (when you make paper out of whole timber logs, it always happens).The worst thing, by far, is the text itself. It's a careful and accurate 1850-type text, that follows that of the by then very distinguished Haworth Edition (1900), the same text used by Barnes&Noble; Classics noteworthy hardcover edition. Of course, there are texts far worse than that, namely Modern Library, Chatham River andTime-Warner ones, not to mention Gutenberg Project's most corrupted electronic text.As you probably know, the 1850 text was edited, or more precisely, in all good will tampered-with, by Charlotte Bront (who didn't like her sister's novel at all). The changes in the text from the 1847 edition were pervasive, and detrimental: there were some hundred of small stylistical or grammatical \\"improvements\\", now as useless as then; a toned-down, sweetened version of York dialect paragraphs that looks decidedly funny and almost as hard to understand; the punctuation was brought in line with Victorian practice (which isn't ours, anyway): professional, light and discrete, syntactical in concept, instead of Emily's rather inconsistent usage, rethorical in concept, as 18th century's prose and specially poetry had been. Even WORSE was the urgent need to save printing space at all costs, which resulted in the disparition of more than 600 paragraph beginnings (I mean just the paragraphing, not the paragraph contents!). Overall, it makes for a worse and distorted reading experience. Many of us (I don't know HOW many) think 1850 is a no-go textform, and would like to see it no more in the intricate textual history of this work.TO SUMMARIZE: I recommend strongly NOT to buy this edition, in spite of its real merits. And then what?If durability is not a must and budget is tight, go for either Penguin's Classics (Pauline Nestor) or Oxford's World Classics (Patsy Stoneman).If durability is a must, and budget is not so tight, then go for one of the best context-oriented, \\"study\\" editions: Broadview Press (Beth Newman),Longman Cultural (Alison Booth) or Norton Critical (Fourth Edition) (Dunn).If what you are after is a nice hardcover edition, the options are greatly reduced:you may try Barnes&Noble;, with the selfsame ignoble text as Wordsworth Edition, or go for a good copy of the 1978 Franklin Mint edition, the one with the Alan Reingold lithographs, with a very good 1847 text and no Introduction or annotation other than Charlotte Bront Preface (NOT to be read BEFORE the novel) and full and right glosses as footnotes for the dialectal tirades (the first edition to do so, as far as I know)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This purely wonderful novel is indisputably a classic, with many wonderfully unique and complex characters that are, at the same time, very hard and very easy to relate to.

Not a book to skim by any means."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have always meant to read \\"Wuthering Heights\\", but, until recently,never got around to it. Following a recommendationI read \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" by Diane Setterfield. After being quitedisappointed with that book, I followed the advice of other reviewersto read Emily Bronte's original. I have to agree that \\"WutheringHeights\\" is incomparably better than Setterfield's effort. Readingthe two books together so closely was actually quite enlightening.While both are dark, Bronte's book is so with reason.

If I could I would have given this book 3.5/5 stars for the excellent use of language and talent for create a setting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It took me a few days to get over my initial distaste for the main characters, and this book in general, before writing a review. This book was not well received in its time and I understand why. Victorian England was not interested in perusing books with such irascible characters, as it didn't fall within their idea of how ladies and gentlemen of the period should behave. Heathcliff and Cathy are two people who are as twisted and tempestuous as the moors in which they live.Heathcliff is brought to live in Cathy Earnshaw's family as a small child by her father. He is greatly disliked by Earnshaw's son, Hindley, because he regards Heathcliff as an upsurper, and does all he can to torment the newcomer. Cathy takes Heathcliff on as her playmate and from that moment on the two are inseparable, running as wild and unchecked as the windy moors surrounding them. Heathcliff grows to love Cathy fiercely as he becomes a young man, but Cathy begins to take an interest in the quiet, refined way of life at Thrushcross Grange, the home of their wealthier, more respectable neighbors.Upon returning from an extended stay at Thrushcross Grange, Cathy is transformed from the wild, ill-mannered and incorrigible girl, to a seemingly calm and civilized young lady. She has caught the eye of her neighbor's young son Edgar and has designs to marry him. Cathy confides this to her servant, Nelly, who asks her if she does not care then for Heathcliff. Cathy expresses disdain for Heathcliff and remarks that she could never marry him. Unbeknownst to her, Heathcliff has heard this conversation and quits the house. Cathy continues to elaborate upon her feelings and reveals that though she finds Heathcliff coarse and unrefined, she loves him deeply to the extent of proclaiming herself to be Heathcliff. She cannot see herself ever separating from him because loving him is like loving herself--both are as one person. Nelly is exasperated with her talk and tells her that Heathcliff has overheard their conversation. Cathy panicks and stays up all night waiting for him to come home. He never returns and does not come back to Wuthering Heights for another 3 years.By then Cathy has married Edgar, but pines for Heathcliff. She is immensely happy with Edgar until Heathcliff comes back bent on revenge. He takes that revenge by running away with Edgar's younger sister. Despite the fact that both have hurt each other deeply, Heathcliff and Cathy continue to love one another with a dangerous, wild and destructive passion. That passion consumes and destroys everything around them and when Cathy finally succumbs to her end, Heathcliff continues his embittered path of hatred and destruction, revenging himself on his wife, his brother-in-law and their descendants.This was such a hard book to read because I internalized all the horrible feelings Cathy and Heathcliff exuded. I didn't like Heathcliff, I resented his love for Cathy. How is it that he can hate in such reckless abandon with the same heart that he uses to love Cathy and then treat her daughter with such contempt? How dare he profess to love when he hates and despises so cruelly. He has no compassion and, by God, I would have shot him if I was Cathy Linton.Emily Bronte wrote a book that breaks convention and draws comparisons between men and women, society, religion and class. It is superior to Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" and Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" which though well written, are products of convention."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I should probably like this book more than i did, but every page felt like a labor. Later, a professor told me that it was spoof/commentary on Jane Austen, and that made me like it more. Because who wouldn't like to see the nicely fitted, happy-endings of the Austen chick-flick genre of romance turned upon the issues and emotions of the real world, and with real world effect?Unfortunately, there are far more Heathcliffs out there than there are Mr. Darcys, and the sooner they are confronted, the more likely the Heathcliffs will be called to task.Thanks for the read, Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteThis book is dark, despairing, passionate, and breathtaking from first page to last. This is a true classic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel is far from what I expected.I had listened to many of my friends judge Cathy and Heathcliff very harshly, and I went into the book expecting to explore the evilness of human nature. Instead, I found that Bronte broke barriers by producing two very real characters.Cathy and Heathcliff's story explores the consequences to the character's decisions. Bronte does not gloss over the reasons for the decisions (money, greed, breeding, retaliation, etc), but those reasons play a minimal role. Instead, she chooses to show how a human reacts to a good/bad decision, and when life doesn't go his or her way.My suggestion for reading Wuthering Heights is to place yourself in Cathy and Heathcliff's shoes and figure out if there was another choice for their behavior."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"(Like the curmudgeonly CAT in the COMIC...get it?)Great old-style classic novel. One of Henry Miller's favorites; that's what attracted me to it.I liked the style of the narrative, largely told through the reminiscences of the housekeeper Nelly. This is one dysfunctional family!Like many novels from this period it's all about the interpersonal relationships; there isn't anything external happening to anyone here of any particular consequence. But the masterful storytelling and imaginings of the authoress really do make this a worthwhile and rewarding literary journey.Read it! Classics rule!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. While it's a beautiful book, and I will probably read it again, I could not stand the story! All of the characters are horrible people, in my opinion, and the only thing that kept me from throwing the book across the room was the last two chapters. If I had not had to read this for class, I would not have finished it at all - though I am certainly glad I did finish it.If you're looking to read the Classics, definitely do read this. Same goes for if you're looking to read a classic romance, or one of the Gothic classics. However, if you're looking for a \\"good\\" book, one that will leave you happy or going \\"aww,\\" you're at the wrong book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Okay, everyone has heard of this book so I probably don't need to give a review, but I will anyways.=) Some have seen the movie adaptations of this book as well so some already know the storyline and what this book is about.I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't stop reading until I reached the very end. I had seen both the 1939 and 1992 movie adaptations of this book so I already knew what happened, but the movies don't capture the essence and emotion of the story as well as the book can.Heathcliff is the gothic romance hero with traits that I think many romance writers use in their own heroes: brooding, mysterious, darkly handsome, and harsh (though of course, not so tortured and brutal). Cathy is gay-hearted and a wild beauty, but also selfish and manipulative in her behavior and actions. Both characters are so realistic in their human emotions and failings that you can't help but empathize with them and hope for that happily-ever-after you know will not occur (as the story is told in flashback so you already know their love was doomed). They are two people that are meant for the other, and each hold flaws and are not always the most likeable of characters.I found myself going through the \\"what-ifs\\" scenarios: What if Cathy hadn't spurned Heathcliff for the more wealthy and civilized Edgar? What if Heathcliff hadn't left to make his fortune to win Cathy? What if Heathcliff hadn't decided to seek vengenance and revenge on those who prevented their union?What made this book so tragic to me was the fact Cathy knew instinctly what she was doing (by accepting and marrying Edgar for position and wealth) was so wrong! She was going against herself by rejecting the fact that they were indeed soulmates and meant for each other. One half of a whole:\\"In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!\\"\\"I love him; and not that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire\\"\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath--a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind--not as a pleasure, but as my own being\\"Despite her confessions of the heart, she goes through with her folly and dooms herself and Heathcliff and all those they encounter, and this passes on to the next generation. Her actions causes obssession and borderline madness in Heathcliff that continues long after Cathy dies. Even though he becomes so cruel and unlikeable in the second half of the book, I couldn't really hate him, knowing what he went through in the first half of the book. Although what he went through doesn't excuse his behavior and actions, you still understand the reasons behind them. You can hear the pain and anguish in his soul when he asks Cathy why she did what she did:\\"Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy?\\"\\"Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it.

From the classic scene of Lookwood encountering Catherine Linton's ghost, I was hooked. Though the plot is not always fast-moving, it is strong and compelling. It is fun for readers to draw parallels between the two generations outlined in this novel. The atmosphere of the novel is one of mystery, set up early in the first few chapters. Though most of the characters are despicable in some way, hearing about their lives through Nelly's eyes is irresistible. The novel is littered with violence, and the \\"moral\\" of the story is unclear to the reader, as it possibly was to the author herself, yet it does make a few important points. Love is not everything, for example, is stressed from the moment that Catherine Earnshaw becomes a Linton. With vivid imagery and extremely psychological characters, Emily Bronte created a classic truly deserving of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If one wants to be bored into tears, one should invest in this unreasonably terrible. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that it cured my sleep deprivation problem. At the end of the book, nothing has happened other than a bunch of funerals.

For example, someone will get married and then Bronte just leaves it at that. Just because they fight with each other later on merely shows that self absorbed people don't get along. Dear Bronte, if you're going to write a book, add more to the characters and don't just state the obvious. Also, why did you include that dream about Cathy Linton in the beginning and not have any more supernatural stuff later? You should involve the supernatural and not just mention or include it.

I read this book as a Freshman in High School, and let me tell you, unless you want something to prop up a wobly table (and with abouuut 400 pages, it does a very good job), don't even consider buying this wretched novel. I'd rather read Jane Eyre again before even attempting to read this terrible piece of literature.

I was sorely disappointed. True, the violent love between Heathcliff and Catherine is heartwrenching; however, the most difficult part of this novel for me was that there was no character that was lovable, or sympathetic. Just when I started to think that Heathcliff was not so bad after all, he would commit another shocking deed of horrific cruelty. Catherine was just annoying. I also found the plot hard to follow, what with a third person telling the story, and then swinging back to first person narrative. If you want a really powerful, uplifting love story, read Jane Eyre, or The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For someone who spent her whole life in a churchyard, Emily Bronte had an astonishing amount of imagination...but, why waste it on this horribly pathetic, melodramatic garbage? I read it when I was thirteen, didn't like it, and was forced to read it again in high school. Do yourself a favor and read Jane Eyre instead."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights great example of mid-18th century literature but lacks the hook needed to engage the reader. The overly dramatic love scenes and long drawn out sections provide the periods of ennui. The characters are poorly developed, and the lack of minor characters leaves the reader wandering. The novel seems to start off sluggishly, and then it picks up, only to be followed by the slowness again. If anything, Wuthering Heights shows the destructiveness of love and revenge through the character Heathcliff. The novel seemed to be one long drawn out soap opera, where the characters rarely changed and new characters were rarely added. Overall, this novel does not meet the adoration that it is constantly given."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"And just why would Ms. Bronte write a book with not a single likeable character? In fact, everyone in the novel would be rejected by Jerry Springer as being too degenerate for his show. No doubt the writing is facile enough, but by page 5, the story itself descends into what has to be the most turgid potboiler imagineable. It's all there: lynching a litter of puppies,hanging a springer spaniel,unceasing child abuse, the brutalization of women, and pretty descriptions of the seasons. Highly recommended for the budding mass murderer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a waste of time, precious time in my life that I will never be able to get back.

It's style is unique alright, if by unique you mean a brand new alternative form of euthanasia. Nevermind the fact that Bronte's \\"paragraphs\\", which are actually composed of one or two extremely long sentences, have superfluous clauses slapped on top of each other repeatedly. The syntax of these sentences is not stiff or constipated, but in fact, it is just the opposite. It is more like the imbibement of heavy laxatives, and the resulting inducement of loose and watery diarrhea that runs across the pages, unpredictable in its rampant tides that sends everyone over the hills. When do the prepositional phrases stop Emily? When? Unfortunately, this was a book that I was required to read for school, and I managed to read a grand total of half of the book before I shut it, never to bother it again. However, what do I know, I'm just a high school student that is just following his personal intuitions about Wuthering Heights. For a more thought-provoking and relevant book in modern-day society, go read George Orwell's 1984. You'd be surprised at how its content trumps the romantic trainwreck that is the brainchild of Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i wrote my full review on my test mr matta im just lazy because i dont want to type it allWuthering heights is a good book.

Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid &quot;classic.&quot; Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading public of America. The only consolation the non-preteen girl reader can get form this sack of slumber is the final realisation that &quot;wuthering&quot; is British slang for &quot;your eyelids are getting heavy, why don't you just nod off?&quot; I really have to say to Miss Bronte that I did not find Garfield's antics convincing in the least."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know this is a classic loved by many. I, however, did not enjoy reading it. I read it through to the end, but it was tough. I did not like any of the characters except for Nelly, & Cathy (the daughter). When the dialogue was of Joseph, it was extremely difficult to read. I had to force myself to read it aloud just to figure out what he was saying. I don't like to work that hard when reading a book. For its time, I know it was a grand book. The writing was fine, but it was depressing and almost all the characters too flawed for my taste."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Brilliantly written; I'll give the novel that much. The plot masterfully contrived, characters well developed, settings enigmatically constructed, the novel as a whole was from a literary standpoint a success. However, the language is consistently dark throughout. The wording carries heavy negative overtones and a depressed, pessimistic and even evil mood pervades from the first to the end. Relief from the darkness finally breaks through only in the end when one character steps beyond herself and assists another in elevating himself. Otherwise, bitterness and selfish ambition drive the story. The depravity runs rampant from bad to worse as characters systematically use, degrade, and abuse one another to work out their bitterness stemming from one father's mistakes and failed parenting.If you love unique, dark characters, twisted plots, and the study of the effects of family dysfunction on a multigenerational level than the novel will not only be worthwhile, but also enjoyable as few would disagree with Emily Bronte's genius as a writer. However, I would caution that the book might not best be read in the dead of winter or over a prolonged rainy spell as it is rather depressing. But on a sunny, warm day, with ample positive diversions, the novel may not only be a challenging companion, it will likely make you very thankful for the companions you personally have that are altogether so unlike the characters in the story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"'Wuthering Heights' by Emily Bronte is a dark, brooding novel of unfulfilled love. Most everyone dies young and unhappy. Everyone seems to fall in love with first cousins, which has me believe their strange behavior is in part due to in-breeding. And there is our lead male character, Heathcliff, who leads a vindictive and sadistic life after losing his honey, Catherine (..she was also a bit loopy, and died young). This book is whole-heartedly depressing, and not at all romantic ... unlike the famous film adaptation with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier.So I really cannot see why this book is so highly rated. Oh, the prose itself is okay. The dialogue is fine. But the story is so narrowly focused (the romantic failings of two intermingled families in rural Yorkshire circa 1800) and the characters morose. Healthy amounts of anti-depressants and a Majorca vacation are needed for these fools.Bottom line: almost laughably dark and twisted. Emily Bronte must of been one very unhappy woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"&quot;It is as if Emily Bronte could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.&quot; -Virginia WoolfDamn straight, sister!

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, read this in the gloom of winter, as I stupidly did.The epic story of Catherine and Heathcliff plays out against the dramatic backdrop of the wild English moors, and presents an astonishing vision of fate and obsession, passion and REVENGE.This classic book is a bummer. Not that it's bad writing, but my oh my.. it makes you so sad! Your heart just goes out for Heathcliff and the depression he faces. But also, the um... &quot;inter-breeding&quot; (*blush*) is quite disturbing!! One cousin marries one other cousin and they have kids who marry their other cousins, I was just surprised that the whole lot of them weren't, &quot;messed up&quot;.I really wouldn't recommend this book for happy people.

I bet Geraldo could get them to confront each other about thier problems."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this novel when I was a junior in high school, and I really did not enjoy it. I was an avid Jane Austen fan and usually read the sweet, courtship novels. Now, as a college graduate, I decided to re-read this classic to see if I might enjoy it more now that I am older. I must say that I was really taken by the spectacular writing, and the poignant view of human nature at its worst. Although Heathcliff and Cathy's romance is disfunctional at times, the extreme hold that they have on one another (even after death) is compelling. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to all of you who have a dusty copy sitting on your bookshelf.

Lacks the crackling wit and sparkling satire of Miss Austen's works, and focuses on a love between Heathcliff and Cathy (neither of whom can the reader relate to, for they are larger than life and their peculiarities are never explained)which is, of course, doomed. Lockwood is the only character whom we can possibly hope to understand, for he tells the reader about himself (he is the narrator, except when Mrs. Dean is telling the story to him) during the course of the story. Maybe it's just me, but I found it depressing. Now, I can cry over a realistic novel like Sounder or Bridge to Terabithia, but these dudes and dudettes (forgive the modern Yank term, I do that sometimes (&lt;:) are acting really stupidly for no apparant reason.

Finally, about halfway through, Cathy dies (thank God) and the book really takes off. I could not put the book down as Heathcliff returns to carry out his revenge, and destroys the lives of basically everyone.

First of all it was hard to keep up with because the author jumped around to many differnet characters. Secondly, the old English used was hard to understand and having to jump back and forth to the foot notes made you lose your train of thought. It also wasn't the type of story I though it would be.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For starters, with apologies to women-studies majors everywhere, Emily Bronte was a generally weak woman in poor health who wrote stilted poetry and a horrible novel- Wuthering Heights. Far from being the romanticized feminine icon she is portrayed to be today, the real Emily Bronte was a very lonely and timid young woman who lived 39 years on this planet and accomplished nothing- leaving behind no friends or family to mourn her short time on this earth. She WAS however a precursor to the modern liberal movement in that she too lived in a fantasy world, the only difference being Ms. Bronte actually named her's. She called it \\"Gondal\\"- and described it as a magical place where everything worked out just the way Emily liked and no one could say or do anything she didn't agree with. Yes, this the hero of feminism... If ONLY there had been a literary critic in Gondal, we might have been spared the Wuthering Heights! I usually enjoy \\"classics,\\" those books that, as Clements so astutely pointed out, everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read. But Wuthering Heights? Ach- I hate this book with a passion. The characters are almost all either pathetic, melodramatic, overly hateful, stupid, incredibly annoying, or some combination thereof. Women have a strange tendency to have babies with no prior warning. Live dogs are randomly hung from hooks, apparently to die. And the plot becomes ridiculously predictable once the simple premise is accepted that the hero has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was an awful, hateful book- I spent almost the whole time hoping the characters would die of syphilis so I wouldn't have to read about them whining all the time. On the plus side- Wuthering Heights could make a good movie...if they totally changed the dialogue...and reworked the characters completely. Basically, they would have to film an entirely different movie and just keep the setting (and the name) the same. By the time I finished the book I wanted to take my soldering torch and burn it. My only fear was that if I did, Catherine might be resurrected and proclaim her love for Heathcliff profusely as the book burns away. Actually, that would have been a better ending to the story. Alas I suppose I'll just end up using the book as a clay pigeon."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought Wuthering Heights was based on a great romance. That is how people had described it to me. I honestly don't understand what is so classic about this book. It was too dark and I couldn't enjoy it.I hated Heathcliff and Catherine. He was spiteful, miserable, and menacing. Of course this wasn't his fault. He had a tough upbringing and Catherine made it worse, by choosing to marry someone for convenience knowing that Heathcliff loved her and she loved him. Catherine was whiny, selfish, and spoiled. She was such a witch,I really hated her. I hated her more than Heathcliff. She married Edgar and had a happy marriage until Heathcliff re-appeared. It was all downhill after that.After a three year hiatus, Heathcliff decided to come back for Catherine. He made everybody lives miserable. I didn't understand this romance that existed between Heathcliff and Catherine. It just seemed like an obsession. I didn't understand the connection and what they saw in eachother.The only part of the book that I enjoyed was the romance that blossomed between Catherine's daughter, Cathy and her nephew, Hareton.I wouldn't recommend or read this book again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Bronte subtlely presents to her Victorian audiences a condemning social commentary, and asks them to consider that the struggle between the good and the bad is not black and white. While Heathcliff seems the obvious steward of evil and badness in the novel, after careful introspection, the reader discovers that immorality and badness seep into the hearts of many other characters. Though perhaps not as insidious at the outset, most of the major characters experience a moral deficiency and by the completion of the novel, have acted in a way that makes the distinction between themselves and the clearly wicked Heathcliff more nebulous than before. Bronte startles the reader into the realization that regardless of conformity to Victorian social mores, each person nurtures a seed of immorality within themselves. Though there may be people who are excessive in their depravity, Bronte skillfully reminds us that an image of evil exists within everyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read.

Many people relate the theme and character interaciton in this book to the modern day soap opera, daytime talkshows or MTV reality shows and thus deaming the book to have some sort of everlasting social message. The problem is that for the most part all those things stink and always have so what are these comparisons saying about this book.

Several months later I picked it up and gave it a try. I'm not sorry I did. Thinking about it now I start to realize what is so good about the book: it's author's compassion for humanity. All characters in this novel suffer a great deal (partly because of their own stubbornness) but retain their essential humanity: they still need to be loved. And while reading it you can feel the author's longing to be loved herself. So this is what made me read through the book: it speaks directly to your heart in a way you can not ignore."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm very partial to the novel itself, but this treatment of it in the Norton Critical Editions leaves much to be desired.1. One big advantage of the Norton Critical Editions is that they have footnotes. This one, however, is extremely sparing of its footnotes, only giving one every fifty pages or so -- and that's usually to clarify a Biblical allusion. You're supposed to know a lot of other things, such as that \\"bairn\\" is Scottish dialect for \\"small child.\\" Terms like that pass by unremarked on, so don't think this version is going to help clarify all those dialect words you've been wondering about.2. The font is small and uncomfortable to read.3. The essays in the back, the other reason to buy a Norton Critical Edition, are somewhat absurd. Part of the mystery of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is that its author seemed to have zilch for sources: the whole composition seems to have sprung whole from her fertile mind. So what do they do? Print her juvenalia poems, her sisters' writings, etc. Not much that will actually help you achieve a deeper understanding of the text.The only advantage I can cite of this edition is that the footnotes (praise Heaven!) translate the ramblings of that screwball Joseph into plain, readable English.Boy, do they ever need to come out with one of these for \\"Wuthering Heights\\":The Annotated Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is an amazingly dark and twisted romance novel containing the most repulsive characters you'll ever meet in all of Bronte fiction. . . . And I absolutely LOVE it! The Bronte sisters seem to have had real talent when it came to dark fiction romance and are quickly becoming my romodels in the genre.The story is about love -- but above everything else, it is about revenge. Heathcliff's revenge to be precise. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?::SPOILERS::::LOCKWOOD:: Lockwood is, well . . . a bit of an idiot. He's the sort of idiot who's exceedingly cheerful and can not strain past his own nose to see that his company is unwanted. He is new in the neighborhood and has moved into Thrushcross Grange, an estate not far down the road from Wuthering Heights. His landlord is the master of Wuthering Heights, a sour, grumpy, very cross man named Heathcliff.Lockwood presses his company upon his grumpy landlord and is introduced to a number of startlingly unpleasant people. When a snowstorm settles in on the Heights, Lockwood is forced to remain among his grumpy hosts, whose sour dispositions are so frightening the tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Lockwood can not understand why everyone is so cross, snappish,and rude, and attempts to make several weak jokes at supper that fall into a miserable silence on his part.When everyone present refuses disdainfully to accompany him home, Lockwood wanders home himself and comes down with a bad headcold. At Thrushcross Grange, he enquires after his landlord and his sour company. His maid, a woman named Ellen Dean, is more than happy to tell Lockwood the unpleasant tell of love, revenge, and death. This is how the narration of the storyof Wuthering Heights really begins.::HEATHCLIFF:: I absolutely love Heathcliff. He is the dark villian but also the sad hero of our tale. No one knows precisely where Heathcliff came from. He was found by Mr. Earnshaw, the man who owned Wuthering Heights and happened to have two children already of his own. Mr. Earnshaw took the dark \\"gyspy\\" orphan Heathcliff home to Wuthering Heights and favored him so much that his son, Hindley Earnshaw, was roused often to violent jealousy and set out to make Heathcliff's life a living hell.Mr. Earnshaw's daughter on the other hand, a wild pretty girl named Catherine, found in Heathcliff the playmate and soulmate she didn't know she'd been waiting for. The children ran wild together on the moors and were as close as if they'd grown together in the womb. Both had short tempers and wild dispositions and were nasty, unpleasant people to cross.Heathcliff was very in love with Catherine, and she with him. But when the two of them grew up, Catherine decided that she could not marry Heathcliff: his station was too low. Therefore, the stuck-up girl reasoned that the best thing for her to do was to marry Edgar Linton (the young man who happened to own Thrushcross Grange just down the road) and by this young man'sriches so help Heathcliff rise on the social ladder.Heathcliff was so stung by this rejection that he disappeared into a storm one night and did not return for many years, at which time he exacted his revenge against Catherine and her overbaring elder brother, Hindley.Yet not only does Heathcliff later in life mistreat his decieved wife (he throws a knife at her face, I believe), but he also treats his son, Linton Heathcliff, with open scorn and distaste. For Linton has none of his father's looks, but his uncle Edgar's instead, and is very sickly and poor.Meanwhile, Heathcliff is so tortured by Catherine's departure that he thinks he sees her everywhere. He even returns to her grave and attempts to dig her body up with the intention ofholding her close again but decides that he will defy everyone and be buried beside her. Thus, the rest of his life is spent exacting his revenge on those who harmed him and their children.::EDGAR LINTON:: Tall, blonde, effeminate Edgar is as weakminded a fellow as can have been invented. He knows full and well that Catherine Earnshaw is in love with Heathcliff, that she brags about how wonderful Heathcliff is, that she stood outside in the storm all night when Heathcliff disappeared and called his name -- but Edgar Linton wants her anyway. It's like he's dying to be used and abused. And moments after Catherine has flown into an appalling rage and even proceeded to beat him violently about the head with her fists --Edgar asks her to marry him and she accepts. Oi.::CATHERINE EARNSHAW/LINTON:: There's only one way to explain the tantrums and absurd pleas for attention -- Catherine Earnshaw is an obnoxious brat. She drove her father to drink as a child and frequently commanded her way with tantrums that followed her straight on to womanhood.When Heathcliff returned from his travels to visit her, she bragged tactlessly of her love for him to her husband and even proceeded to go on long walks with Heathcliff alone. When Edgar finally got the guts to banish Heathcliff from Thrushcross Grange, Catherine flew into a rage and deliberately made herself ill. But her true love for Heathcliff was confirmed at last when the lovers held each other prior to her death and wept miserably cheek against cheek. Such a tender love scene I've never known until I read Wuthering Heights. I don't think even Jane Eyre compares.Catherine was angry that Heathcliff had married her brother's sister (Isabella Linton) just to get her back for marrying Edgar, and Heathcliff was angry that Catherine chose Edgar over himself. But they forgave each other just before Catherine died and Heathcliff was ever after half a man without her.::ISABELLA LINTON:: This girl is as much a fool as her absurd and abuse-loving elder brother. She falls headover heels in love with Heathcliff without the slightest encouragement on the latter's part and \\"provokes\\" her future husband with fond looks and sighs. Heathcliff, seeing opportunity for sweet revenge, leaps on it and has soon run off with Isabella and married her with the intention of horrifying Edgar (whom he, needlessly to say, hates with a passion) and his lover Catherine.Like most fools, Isabella Linton gets exactly what she deserves. She is treated very poorly by her husband, who curses at her and calls her by unkind names, and laughs with scorn in her face as he watches her realize he is not the \\"gallant\\" and \\"noble\\" creature she had imagined. Isabella soon learns that handsome men are not always kind and finally stands up for herself. Her sharp tongue is rewarded with a knife in the face, and she flees Wuthering Heights, the unhappy home of many by now.::HINDLEY EARNSHAW:: Hindley, of course, lives to see adulthood and even marries. His wife, however, dies giving birth to their son, Hareton. Hindley falls into a miserable state and begins to drink heavily -- so heavily that on one occasion he nearly kills his son by accidentally dropping him from an upstairs banister. He is still a dismal drunkard when Heathcliff returns to Wuthering Heights intent on revenge. With Heathcliff returned, Hindley (like most of the people kin to him) loses his mind and paces every night with the intention of shooting Heathcliff dead in his sleep. For Heathcliff has taken advantage of Hindley's drunkeness and has won over the whole of Wuthering Heights in several card games.The doctor of revenge has checked in!I've never been so astonished, so happy, so moved by any story than by Wuthering Heights -- and I've read some good books!This is an awesome novel full of romance and despair, and I recogmend it to anyone who could sit through my bantering and actually read my review! Enter the dark recesses of Heathcliff's mind and see what it's like to be the devil!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read this book at least three times. It seems to get better every time I read it. I read it for the first time in 8th grade. The novel is about a dark romance. I love the way Cathy's and Heathcliff's relationship is portrayed. They have a love that can never be because of Cathy's stubborn pride. There is a lot of suffering for all of the characters, but the book does end on a happy note. I highly recommend that everyone read this book at some point in their life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic only in the sense that it was written in the 19th century. But it is a compelling story w/ dark, violent passions, and emotions of love and hate. Heathcliff's only goal in life is to seek revenge on anyone associated w/ the Earnshaws and Lintons. His love for Catherine is evident, but his hate is chillingly cruel and violent that touches everyone between the two estates. Only when he is w/ Catherine is he pacified. Catherine is torn between her true love Heathcliff, and her duties to marry someone of her station in life. But she doesn't understand her love and emotions for Heathcliff. (Which makes me believe she's too childish, spoiled, and bratty to handle her emotions rationally or she's a manic depressive). It's a dark passionate story that is compelling to read. Unfortunately it's also hard to follow in the third person narrators. The long winded descriptions makes the book drag (which explains the 300 pages). And what in heaven's name is Joseph saying? Are most uneducated people of countryside England so hard to understand? This book isn't for the light reader. If you want something easier and more light hearted, go for Charlotte Br&ouml;nte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Or books by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bront happens to be one of the three famous Bront sisters and also the middle of them. She had led a dark life without parents but managed to get by with her siblings and each made it to literature fame in different paths. With \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Emily Bront had created a shocking romance that's been unimaginable and has been read for around 165 years.In 1760, we are taken to the title farm and meet a poor gypsy boy from the streets and is taken by a farmer named Earnshaw of the place and then makes him a part of his family and renaming him Heathcliff and while trying to be use to his new life. While his new family is uncomfortable with a poor boy in the family and mostly with his stepbrother Hindley he begins a relationship with the farmer's daughter, Catherine which goes off good. Some years later, Earnshaw and his wife are dead and Hindley is now married and plans to take over the authority of the family while Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship continues to grow. But as they grow into their adult years, more troubles fall into their lives and their romance is left in a tragic bind and will leave both of them in darkness.It's no Hamlet, Jane Eyre or even Romeo and Juliet. It's a novel completely in it's own creativity. The story takes many twists and turns that you'll probably find yourself lost in. The characters are very vivid and lifelike and the plot is so surprising and will shock anyone. It's a shame Anne Bront only wrote one novel, since we would've able to see what other novels she would create. But \\"Wuthering Heights\\" will always be a novel that will show a truly tragic tale of romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book mainly because it was talked about a lot in Eclipse. I was shocked by how dark and Gothic it was. I can't imagine what people must have thought when it was published. If I could pick two words to describe Wuthering Heights it would be \\"passionate\\" and \\"bizarre.\\" I've never read anything like it. I knew as I was reading it that I wasn't supposed to like Cathy. She has a passionate temper that was very unlikeable and yet I couldn't hate her. In fact, I related to her in a lot of strange ways. I kind of agree with Edward Cullen's assessment of the book that it's not a love story but a hate story. The ending was what made me like this book. A lot of the characters are run madly by their passions and I thought for sure the ending would be nothing but a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. If Eclipse has made you curious as to what happens in this book, give it a try. You might actually like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Re-reading this novel after 20 years I am still struck by its primal power, as if it erupted from the depths of Emily Bronte's soul and devoured its creator in its wake. This is the anti-Jane Austen novel. It is even the anti-Charlotte Bronte novel. Charlotte flirts with the darkness while Emily jumps into its chasm. The bond between Cathy and Heathcliff is forged in Earth, Heaven and Hell and cannot be sundered by all the efforts of humans or their institutions.Although never stated in the novel, the implication that Heathcliff is a bastard son of Mr. Earnshaw and, therefore, Cathy's half-brother has been hinted at more explicitly in at least one film adaptation of the novel. Even if such a thought entered Emily Bronte's mind, she was straining the limits of decorum and literary taste even without another scandalous level of meaning. She wisely omitted such a possibility. The Heathcliff/Cathy bond is so powerful that it frightens even the family that first witnesses it. Heathcliff's obsession is akin to Ahab's for Moby-Dick, created just four years or so later. Love/Hate are merged into one emotion that transcends boundaries of Good and Evil and this force runs roughshod and heedlessly destroys all the victims that happen to stand in its way.Like her doomed heroine Cathy, Emily Bronte died at a very early age, within one year of the novel's publication. One wonders what kind of follow-up novel she might have written had she lived. Would she have reigned in the primal inspiration and tailored her creations to suit the prevailing customs of her society? It is futile to speculate. The early death of the creator is perfectly matched to the dooms of the creator's characters and the one-of-a-kind quality of this wild novel.Although the novel bears a sophistication and complexity of narrative structure, especially for a first time novelist, there are certain weaknesses. The dialect dialogue of Joseph is a hindrance and absurdly out of place alongside that of other characters who speak without so many apostrophes. Later schools of realism might cast aspersion on the florid language of relatively uneducated characters. The power shines through the weaknesses, however, and this is a unique novel. There are echoes of it in later novels but few, if any, other contemporary novels exhibited such boldness of subject and structure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights may be my all-time favorite novel. Heathcliff and Cathy's relationship resists - or defies? - categorization. It's as elemental and everlasting as the moors themselves. Love isn't a sweet confection in this book and is the all the more appealing for that reason."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love is very painful and it is full of lust, want, and the things that made you go standing up in the morning when your mother introduced you to your future husband. It is very French, and it said, everything under the bright burning sun causes more money than you can shake a stick at. And it creates even more chaos than you wish for, still, no fond memory there. All said and done was a walk together in the grave undisturbed. Just once. It made an example of all those who loved must suffer a loss of conscience, and all that sweets and whatever the people who works must be driving all the tenants of Wuthering Heights into a crack wooden planck of a ship that is full of water 3 inches deep. When they do decide to take a chance on life, and fall for love, it does not catch them, but leads them into the most unromantic ideals of commitment ever. To be in faith with their long lost friend full from the beginning, end, and with no lacking in the middle. How was it possible, but that these people have no contacts with the outside world of travels to the continents, and little words such on this and this day, does not suffice. It is said lover takes in the shape of all form and shape, but it takes generations to heal a broken promise and mend the wounds. [Please, to have breath for a day, and to let escaped chances slip buy once again means that whatever your parents have gone through was not as romantic as you would imagined it. That seems to be the central message, beside peering through the soul.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This should be the \\"Book of the Year\\" for every year from 1847 to today - 154 years worth! It was absolutely fabulous. Cannot brag about it enough. It is now my all-time favorite book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Among the propertied classes of Georgian England, life was never simple. This is the tale of Earnshaw family, and those they touched. It's a tale of love and tenderness, and also a tale of greed and cruelty. It's a story as complex as the times it explores and the people who inhabited it.This is an excellent book. Correct, if you want an up-beat book of happily-ever-after, then you will be disappointed. But, if you want a complex book of human lives and loves and passions of all sorts, then this is a book you should read.(Review of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really wanted a hard back copy of this book, and it got here quick and it is in great shape i love the book such a great story, def recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I was 15 I liked fluffy- predictable- rose- colored romances. Then I read Wuthering Heights. The idea of a love story being so filled with hate seemed like a contradiction, but this novel opened my eyes to the truth of human nature. And yes it is rather bleak, but powerful nonetheless. The love of Catherine and Heathcliff transcends all concepts of earthly love and their deep soulful connection is rather more of a curse than a blessing for them.People either love this book or hate it, but don't pass judgement until you read it on your own. And I recommend NOT judging it when it is a school assignment. Chances are good you will hate it that way."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Why spend the money for a hardcover edition of a book that is public domain and therefore available for practically nothing in either electronic versions or from a low-cost print-on-demand publisher?I guess you have to be old fashioned, but I personally wanted to have a physical copy of this great book in my library. The Everyman's Library edition is, to me, one of the very best for readers who love books. I purchased it not just to read and enjoy, but to have for my family and to pass on to future generations.High quality printing, acid free paper, cloth bindings, silk ribbon marker. It is quite simply a beautiful book whether or not you leave the dust jacket on, or remove it.Additionally, there is the 15 page introduction, written for this edition by Katherine Frank (A Chainless Soul: A Life of Emily Bronte); the bibliography of other works; and a chronology listing significant events in the author's life along with corresponding literary context and historical events.If you want a top quality edition of Wuthering Heights, this is the one to get, in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was definitely what I expected! I had always heard about the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine as being one of the greatest love stories of all-time.

My reasons are my own but I have to say - neither disappoint. Though it's no surprise that the two stories are different in many ways - the book version is so visceral and touching. It's no wonder that since it was first published in 1847, it's never been out of print."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The Bronte sisters have always seemed to come up as respectable classical female writers and as story telling goes, I will agree that they can tell a story. I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity. Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a different type of story. It follows the developments of two generations of families and the family dynamics within from the point of an outsider being told the story. It almost reads like a family history if not for the love story thrown in. For the time period, the portrayal of certain scenes was quite graphic, and it's interesting to try to gain that perspective from our current time period, where violence and sex are pretty much societal norms.A great book! I would suggest making a family tree as you read; it does get a bit confusing!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is known to a number of people but reading it over allows one to experience it from a different perspective as we grow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't have the opportunity to read American Literature in HS and to be honest,I doubt I would have enjoyed this one as much back then. I feel when you reach a certain age,you understand more about life and,of course,there's nobody telling you to read it NOW! This is a well written love story and is about how tangled up love can become when you are denied to follow your heart. It's a sad tale but I enjoyed every minute of reading it.

I hated the story and mostly I really hated the characters. I wanted every one of them to die and wished they had done so sooner. And, honestly, I don't think it's very good writing.The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heathcliff is cruel and vindictive, and Cathy is petty and weak. They are both so selfish that it's hard to believe that they're even capable of loving, and it's impossible to want them to be happy. This takes the angst, tension, and hope out of reading their story, and there's nothing to replace those key aspects of reading a novel like this but disgust. Most of the secondary characters are equally unlikeable or at least unsympathetic, so there's no one a reader can identify with in the real story. It's hard to believe that so many people's lives could be ruined so dramatically and irrevocably, which makes the book seem pathetically melodramatic and more than a bit ridiculous. It's unrealistic but not at all fantasy, it's tragedy with no one to feel sorry for and romance with no one to love, it's gossip that no one wants to hear. Furthermore, while reading this I was disturbed and surprised to find grammatical errors!I expected to love this book, and really wanted to, because Emily Bronte's fantasy world from her youthful writing really appeals to me and I wanted her to become a favorite author of mine. But this is just awful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The Bronte sisters were extremely remarkable women. They have left a literary place in history. Charlotte Bronte was the most popular one; she wrote Jane Eyre, one of the most popular fiction novels in history. But there is definitely room for Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights, Emily's only novel is -- without a doubt -- the work of a genius. The tragic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff is one of the most memorable ones I have ever read. Also, I love the backdrop of the story. The story took place on the untamed Yorkshire moors in England. It symbolizes their wild love -- or more specifically, Heathcliff's wild ways. I love a story with symbolism. It saddens me to know that this is the only novel of Emily Bronte. She would have written other books if she hadn't died the way she did. I am consoled with the fact that she has left us this incredible book, a book that will be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This edition is the first i have ever read, im sure there are better ones out there.

It was a little hard to understand the text as im not used to way things were written back then, but overall it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I stumbled upon a song called Wuthering Heights a month or so ago. It's an eerie, etheral composition speaking through the voice of Cathy to Heathcliff. The first time I listened to the song I thought the singer, Kate Bush, was speaking a bizarre and foreign language. I cannot say I enjoyed the song initially, but I admired how the singer had crafted such a haunting, vivid, and singular melody. You should listen to it--I must warn you that you may dislike it.I read the novel, Wuthering Heights, years ago in middle school and have forgotten most of the story. The song piqued my interest in the novel, and I began reading it yesterday. It has been described as, perhaps, one of the most original novels in the English language. Its wild and untamed story, written on the windswept canvas of the moors of northern England, is written in an excited and lyrical manner. Heathcliff and Cathy are so vivid in the imagination of the author they they violently spring to life in the conciousness of the reader--at least that has been my experience. I wonder if I will ever experince such overwhelming passion, though I guess it's well that I haven't, as it borders on the psychotic. Even the fundamental boundaries of one's own being are broken down in the cyclonic relationship of Heathcliff and Cathy.It has been a long while since I read any fiction, and I am truly enjoying this fine example."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a haunting story of love and hate, where human emotions and passions are presented through a range of excellently developed characters. The story is taut, the narrative is engrossing, and the novel has all the drama to make excellent movies. The novel is an underrated study of human psychology, of love, of jealously, contempt, revenge and of character and how it transforms through time and relationships. People call it the greatest novel of unrequited love; it definitely potrays love, hatred and melancholy in the same vein. Perhaps Heathcliff, who loves and hates with all the harshness of his character, leaves a lasting impact on reader's fancy, to make a memory of this novel as one about only hatred and unrequited love. Read it to discover the passions that makes this Bronte novel a classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The movie American Beauty reminds me of this book. Both pull off the near impossible task of presenting the reader (or viewer) with horrible nasty people and then at the last moment making us see them as simply angry human beings fully capable of redemption and understanding, even if its too late to do anything with their lives.The book starts out with one of foppiest of English fops touring the Manor with a utter contempt for these people and their ways. The stories that he hears from the servants only confirm his view, but they are intriguing. No one tells what they want to tell and there are times when you want to strangle the servants telling the stories (especially the one that PURPOSELY hid a note that would have eased some of the tensions because she didn't feel that it would be right. How many interfering old bitties like this are in the world? Probably more in the Victorian era.)The love between Heathcliff and Catherine might have worked out in different circumstances, if Heathcliff had not been the hated adopted gypsy child, if Catherine's brother hadn't been an idiot drunk, if Catherine hadn't been pledged to marry the idiot next door. Of course, then it wouldn't have been such an intriguing novel. Heathcliff comes back the conquering hero to find that Catherine is married and her idiot brother is still a drunk and he can't have her so he plays dangerous games with people's hearts and gears everything to his twisted revenge. Included in his schemes are the marrying of Catherine's sister-in-law and the corrupting of Catherine's nephew (the son of the drunken idiot).It's pretty rough going and you want to like Heathcliff at least more than the rest of the people in this book, but he gives you no room to excuse his actions. He's just horrible. Then like Kevin Spacey at the end of American Beauty, he reveals himself and comes to a point of self-reflection and repentence that fulfils the hope you had for him at the beginning of the book. It's very rare that this happens and its believable, but in this case it's very believable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte was well ahead of her time in writing this incredible love story. The plot was very complex, yet the intricacies of revolving a story within a story within another story never created an error. The author wrote on some very specific issues of the day and one would need to formally investigate the book in order to find any mistakes. This is a story by Mr. Lockwood who really comes in at the end of the story. He meets his new landlord Heathcliff and is able to discern some very strange happenings at Wuthering Heights. His servant, Nellie Dean, narrates most of the story as she lived it. She and Joseph are the only people to live through the three generations and the only one able to recount first hand knowledge. This is a love story, ghost story, and story of oppression all in one. Emily Bronte was able to describe the ill-effects of English property law in the 19th Century. Primogeniture--the law of inheritance, where only the eldest male child could inherit family estates without a contrary will, often could result in the younger siblings being turned into mere servants. This is how Hindley came to own Wuthering Heights and why he was able to ruin Heathcliff. There is much effort from various forces to keep Heathcliff and Catherine seperate. There is also much symbolism regarding various images such as locks that represent keeping people prisoner, or of dogs that demonstrate the character of their owners. Much forshadowing is accomplished with great sophistication. This was written from a &quot;Realist&quot; perspective and yet there are elements of &quot;Post Modernism&quot; included as in the case of ghosts and supernatural happenigs. One might question whether or not Emily Bronte Believed in the Supernatural and considered it as real and natural, which would then relate it back to Realism. There are many twists and turns and the symmetry is flawless. We have two seperate parents who are neighbors. Each have an elder boy and a younger girl. Heathcliff is a foundling who is regarded as a &quot;gypsy&quot; (possibly a slave child or illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw), The son of the Lintons (Edgar),marries the daughter of the Earnshaws (Catherine), and they have a girl named Catherine. Hindley, the son of the Earnshaws marries outside of the family and produces a son, Hareton. This helps to keep the incest down a bit. Heathcliff who was raised in the Earnshaw home marries the daughter of the Lintons (Isabella) and they have a child Linton Heathcliff. This child ends up marrying the younger Catherine and when Linton dies, Catherine marries Hareton. So in effect she has married two first cousins. The characters grow up in a very oppressive atmosphere. The servants are actually treated better than the children who are often whipped or starved. This is &quot;Gothic&quot; like in the dark, dreariness that seems to envelope the families and the frequent use of punishment. Even the environment is unfriendly often times. The moors are dangerous and the weather is often rainy or cold and snowy. It is a sad story with the only hope coming in the end when Hareton and Catherine marry and reclaim rightful ownership of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, which had been taken from them by Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am repelled by the absurd peregrinations of Bronte's spiteful, petty-spirited, self-absorbed characters. The character of Heathcliff is that of a nightmarish beast, and Catherine isn't much better. And yet Emily Bronte wants us to LIKE these people. I read this book at the same time as OTHELLO, and to be honest I found my self liking even Iago better than these shallow fools -- at least Iago probably deserved to be a lieutenant! If this is a classic, then so's the phone book. It's ludicrous, witless, and excessively overwritten to boot. At one point, the reader of WUTHERING HEIGHTS will realize that there have been five (or so) mawkish death scenes, some fights and scuffles, and countless effusions of absurd and overblown emotion. And yet one is less than halfway through the book, and Bronte's still wuthering along as if the reader were yet awake. Again, I must compare it to OTHELLO, and find that in all respects it comes up short -- Othello even has better Moors. It's not a classic -- it's a really old British romance novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I throughly enjoyed this work of Emily Bronte's (which I believe to be her only novel). I liked Wuthering Heights much more than her sister's, Char.'s, Jane Eyre. The love and hatred which paint this plot make the reader love and hate every character at different points in the book. The only thing that I did not like is that I felt that having finsihed the book, I was never quite able to find a character whose motives I thought I truly understood--but perhaps this ambiguity is what adds an element of psychological intrigue to the plot."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I throughly enjoyed this work of Emily Bronte's (which I believe to be her only novel).

The emotions contained in this novel are so real. Bronte created a masterpiece with Wuthering Heights!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a novel full of love,hate and revenge. This is a story about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff and the strange love that they share. Their love changes in many ways, taking many different forms, from anger, to happiness, to violence. Their love changes because of people who come in and out of both of their lives, making them different. Through the book though, Catherine and Heathcliff find ways to share their love. Wuthering Heights was an interesting book that I found getting stuck in, and I never wanted to stop reading. Bronte twisted the plot a lot so I found that you had to pay close attention. It kept me reading it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. There were lots of twists to it, and I felt there was always something happening. There wasn't a bunch of unnesscessary descriptions. I really like Emily's style of writing. It isn't the victorian style, and it is basically an easy read. I don't like reading a lot of the 19th century books like Pride and Prejudice because the woman are all proper, but this story could have just as well been written today. Some of the characters horrified me, but unlike a lot people I did find a few characters that I could accept. I say give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to admit in high school when I was forced to read it I waddled through it and basically endured it. Years later now I've re-read it and I couldn't put it down. I'm glad that I picked it up again. It was a completley spellbinding novel. I don't think anyone in the story was likeable except young Catherine Linton, but it was definitely a fascinating story and worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think Breadsticks and Blessing Places written by Candy Dawson Boyd is the best book ever written.

Or more acuratly I see something in a different light. This is a book about pure emotions, passions, and the cosequenses of feeling so strongly. It's a book where anybody can relate to at least one characters at least one time in there lives. Who wouldn't want to be loved the way Catherine was loved. Or how Heathcliff could have been. This novel is filled with &quot;what-might-have-beens&quot;. However it ends wonderfully, and the reader is satisfied. It will bring out the passionate romantic in you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm forever indebted to my mother for convincing me to buy this book. I thought,&quot;Another boring 'classic'.&quot; Boy,was I wrong! Although it's long and sometimes confusing,I soon couldn't put it down. It's deep,delving into human emotions. Many of the characters have love-hate relationships with each other,and I felt the same way about them. Heathcliff and Catherine were evil,but who can't identify with their romantic feelings? The book showed how deadly obsession can be and how far-reaching its consequences are. It's one of the greatest books of all time. If you want to read something that changes the way you think and expands your horizons,get &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't not like this book, but I also didn't like it very much either.

It's the best!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tragic tale of lost love, rage between men, and the sorrow caused by broken hearts. Its author, Emily Bronte, led a reclusive and private life, much of which is revealed through the events and characters of the novel. I feel that it rightly belongs among the great novels of British Literature, due to the controversy and interest it caused upon its publication."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this book for my high school English class. Although I took the easy way out and read the &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot;, I found them absolutely enchanting. I later took time to read the book for myself. Bronte uses such magical words and compellingly tragic sentences to blend this book into a masterpiece of Victorian Literature. Through Heathcliff and Catherine she proves that hate, no matter how strong, will always be defeated by love in the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The best the millennium has to offer as the greatest tale of star crossed lovers. Also includes my favorite literary character, the tortured, sardonic, passionate, dastardly, impossible-to-imitate Heathcliff. The relationship between him and Catherine, who is herself a pretty unusual tragic heroine in that she is a selfish, bitchy girl with little to redeem her, is one that still grabs my guts after reading it so many times. I can see people getting confused at the beginning with Mr Lockwood/Nelly/Mrs Heathcliff, all that, but come on everybody, are we all too lazy in the 20th century to read a page twice if we don't understand? You'll get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As a high school junior, i was skeptical of reading an old book by an even older writer. I thought that it would be as dry and bland as all the other books presented to me in class. What 15 year old would look at a book called &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and presume that inside it was every emotion and feeling that someone could ever experience? Now, as a senior, I have re-read it several times over. It has become a part of my permanent literary collection and a part of me. The words and emotions of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; have taken over my soul. As cruel and painful as some of the emotions of the book may be, I need them. They are a part of me and I will never let them go."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I began reading and I couldn't stop! A wonderfully, well-written book"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte sure knows how to write about destructive love! I thought both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff the stupidest people ever! I could hardly understand Joseph's tongue...perhaps because my language is too polished:)Ok, maybe I'm being too harsh. Wuthering Heights really isn't that bad. I actually understood it (for a thirteen year old, you've gotta give me credit)It was written nicely as Ellen {Nellie} Dean for the orator of Heathcliff's complete past. Catherine is pretty stupid though. And Heathcliff stupider for not trying to convince her to marry him BEFORE she married Linton. But I felt pretty sorry for Heathcliff when he called for Catherine the night that Lockwood spent the night. My favorite character was Hareton because i loved his speech! It was funny when almost every time he spoke, he sweared. I have to say that I hated Linton for being such a weakling, even though he could hardly help it. Despite Heathcliff's trickery with Isabel and hatred for Cathy, I couldn't help liking him a teeny bit, because he's just so unique! I really wanted Hareton and Cathy to make the match, and i positively despised Heathcliff and Linton for making him look so stupid. And i just loved Hareton's &quot;thundercloud&quot; face! Go ahead and read Wuthering Heights. You'll probably both hate and love it. It was a rather exciting and tiresome novel. Then again, I may be to young to criticize this &quot;great classic&quot; novel :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is tale of deceit an forbidden passion.

The reader finds him/herself loathing each and every one of them. The only non-loathsome character is the doctor, and he's minor to the extreme. Heathcliff is of course abominable. Edgar Linton is appallingly stupid. Hareton Earnshaw is animalistic, but at least he's got the excuse of Heathcliff's abuse. Catherine Linton (the elder) is absolutely disgusting, easily and by far the most evil character in the novel, surpassing even Heathcliff. Even Nelly Dean is a waste of humanity. If it were not for her constantly making a hash of her meddling, none of the tragedy would have occurred to such a great extent. Whether her meddling is malicious or just through sheer stupidity is immaterial; she remains an awful character.That said, the story is absolutely riveting. Emily Bronte's one substantive work is truly a masterpiece. Her descriptions of the moors are wonderfully evocative, but it is her characters who are her main triumph. Despite the sheer horridness or stupidity or weakness of her characters, she nevertheless makes each of them - and their motivations - utterly believable. Even Heathcliff's excesses are believable, and the elder Catherine's petty maliciousness is also totally in tune with the selfish nature she is depicted as having. The younger Catherine Linton's stupidity is easily accounted for by her protected childhood and Nelly's inexcusable lapses. Everyone has a perfectly plausible reason for doing what they do, given the natures given them by Bronte. Is it then their fault that their actions create such misery?The only flaw with this book is the ending. One character has triumped utterly, and then inexplicably collapses with hardly a struggle. Another character overcomes a strong antipathy to a further character and changes attitudes utterly. Unlike the rest of the novel, the motivation is not believable. It is inconceivable that such a complete adjustment could have happened in so short a time. Perhaps it is true that the novel has come full circle, but I can't help but think that its grip on the reader would be still the stronger if it left us with the vision of the horror which appeared to be the future for its well-deserving characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a classic! It is strong drama that captures your attention. It is worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Who of us hasn't wanted revenge on someone else in our lifetime? That is Heathcliff's main goal in WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Despite his love for beloved Cathy, Heathcliff wants a desperate revenge upon her family. After all, it was her family who supposedly ruined his life.Personally, this was a book much closer to real life than would be preferred. The main goal of a book is to transport you into another time, place, or dimension--a life beyond your own. However, this classic by Emily Bronte manages to bring to mind one's own everyday troubles. The writing is technically superb, but the story could be better. However, after more than a century of being a noted classic, the opinion isn't likely to change."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am another one of the huge group of students who had to read this book for a Literature class, but unlike many, I loved it!

Moreover, through the character of down-to-Earth, jolly Nelly Dean, Bronte makes plausible a story that would never be believed otherwise.It's a pity she had to waste her talent as a writer on a such a pointless story, centered on an incoherent, cruel, mean character like Heathcliff. Hopefully she was not pointing him out as the perfect lover!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is easy to understand why Emily Bront's first (and only) novel was ill-received upon its first publication. Perhaps the ultimate Gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is a far cry from the simple tale of ill-starred lovers one might expect from the pen of a Bront. Dark, sordid, even vulgar at times, the story of anti-hero Heathcliff - a gypsy child adopted, but never accepted, by the Earnshaw family of Wuthering Heights - teems with all the basest passions of mankind.Befriended only by the younger Earnshaw child, a girl named Catherine, Heathcliff grows to hate all those who dare tread upon him because of his low birth. He grows obsessively attached to the beautiful, wild-spirited Catherine, and when her pride forces her to marry another rather than stoop to Heathcliff's own station in life, he begins plotting the grand revenge that will send all of them to their graves.Few - if any - likable characters populate this book. It is a tale of love, but it is not an uplifting tale. It is a story of cruelty, selfish passion, vengeance, and finally madness. Despite its depressing theme, however, Bront's exceptional writing raises it to the deservedly lofty height of a classic.Told mostly through the first-person narration of housekeeper Ellen Dean, the story progresses through Heathcliff's tormented childhood, Catherine's marriage to Edgar Linton, Heathcliff's elaborate revenge against the child of Catherine and Edgar's marriage, and finally his strange departure from the world of the Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Seriously hated every page of this book. Not that it matters, but I read a lot of classic literature, and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. The characters were mean, vile and had no redeeming qualities.

I know it's supposed to be a classic, but there are hundreds of really good books in this world, and this just isn't one of them.We always try to compare the Bronte girls to Jane Austen, but each of the Bronte sisters published her first book in 1847, and Jane Austen's books were published between 1811 and 1817, so they aren't really contemporaries. Austen's books really describe everyday family concerns, mostly relating to marriage. Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights both described families and their connections, but the stories were more out of the ordinary; these are almost more like soap operas than like Austen novels. This book contains some references to a ghost and lots of cruelty and intrigue, none of which exist in Austen's books.Another huge difference between this book and Austen's is that none of the main characters are likeable: Hindley was mean to Heathcliff, Heathcliff is a jerk to everyone, Catherine and Cathy are both a little spoiled, Hareton is proud and rude, and Joseph is just annoying. There are only three characters who aren't awful, and one dies pretty quickly.English teachers will probably still force their students to read this, but I'll stick with Austen myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My only complaint with this Oxford version is that the explanatory notes are all at the very end of the book, not on the individual pages (ie, footnotes).

'Wuthering Heights' is amazing. The story is intense and passionate. It makes a bold statement on bi-racial love, class and cultural barriers, and revenge. My most favorite character is the most evil of them all - Heathcliff. His story just shows how much damage resentment, pride and revenge can do to a human being. It is a timeless lesson. The only negative of this book is that the relationship between Catherine, the younger and Hareton feels underdeveloped. It just happens too quickly. Otherwise, I think the ending is appropriate. The younger characters don't repeat the mistake of their elders. Too bad they're cousins. It gives the story a twisted, perverted edge. In the end, though, this book is most certainly worth the read. The story is captivating, suspenseful and intense. When you read it, you don't know what's going to happen next. You just want to keep reading to find out. A genuine treat.

Emily Bronte's novel was controversial at the time because of the lovers who defied social mores,and that Heathcliff was an anti-hero. It's the original gothic novel. Stephenie Meyer claims to be an heiress to Bronte,even having her heroine Bella read \\"Wuthering Heights\\",but can't hold a candle to the classic.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" has a simple premise. Catherine's father adopts a gypsy boy,Heathcliff. The two have a bond like brother and sister,but as they grow older it becomes more romantic. Catherine marries the gentle,kind,aristocratic Edgar despite the fact Heathcliff passionately desires her. Their love remains ambiguous. Did they have a mutual longing for death? Heathcliff is abusive to Catherine,avoiding her when she pines for him,wishes she were in Hell after she dies,and abuses his children. Did their love have a sexual element,making the lovers at the end unknowing half-siblings,the children of the same mother but different fathers? Some have argued that Cathy&Heathcliff;'s love is so metaphysical they never shared the bed,and that Cathy despises sex anyhow. Cathy's passion for the moors drives her to mental,then physical illness.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is as beautiful and fierce now as it was back in the 19th century. Bronte powerfully evokes the wilderness,as well as the cruelty,obsession,and passion between her leads. The moors remain as wild today."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i came across wuthering heights while i was reading the twilight series,specifically \\"eclipse\\" as it was mentioned in it..i was curious as to what the book was all about so i read it..in my opinion, it is tragically beautiful especially the catherine-heathclif's moments. true, both of them are horrible, horrible human being but when it comes to their relationship, you can't help but to root for them. One of my favourite part was when catherine was deciding whether or not to marry linton and had explained what heathcliff meant to her to her housekeeper. My favourite quotes from that part: \\"my great miseries in life has been heathcliff's\\", \\"he is more than myself than i am\\" and my favourite which was mentioned in eclipse, \\"if all else perished and he remains, i should still continue to be. but if all else remained and he were anihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger\\"Another favourite part was when both of them were reunited before catherine died. there was a speck of humanity in them when they were reunited and you somehow forget how horrible they were.Another favourite part was when heathcliff learned that catherine died and the way he handled the news, it was devastating and for that moment, i feel sad for him and again, forget for a moment of how rude and vicious his character is. that one small paragraph was a mix of love and grieve all together which was written with so much power that I had to stop reading for a minute to digest it.the story is mostly about the consequences of the love between catherine and heathcliff..their love affected a lot of people and i guess it shows the dark side of love and obsession."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've tried to read a number of Classics, and usually think people must have been awfully bored before the electronic age to slog through them and enjoy it. This was the exception. These people are so weird (and savage) it's practically like reading science fiction. A fascinating, and compelling, glimpse at what life might have been like at one time, rather than the white-washed image we usually get -- spun to our current sensibilities."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what else to say beyond that. How can you not love a classic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As an English teacher as well as parent to several kids having gone through high school, please recognize that boys (even Honors level students) are turned off to reading even such beloved novels as Wuthering Heights. Classic novels primarily about love and romance can be offered but should not be assigned to 15-year-old boys since, generally speaking, they are not interested in this type novel and tend to avoid reading it at all cost. There are so many wonderful novels (Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies, for example) that will engage even the most reluctant readers, and can be offered as a choice to the more girl-oriented classics. Teachers, please be conscious of assigning these books without offering an option. Otherwise they do the opposite of that which you hope to instill in them . . . deterrents to reading! To those choosing to read this book for its classic value, this version of Wuthering Heights is very reader-friendly. I liked it the best of the many versions, especially for younger readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a good version, the whole book is there (some versions have made it two volumes) with space between chapters to write your notes. Short, concise and helpful notes on the themes and motifs in the front of the book.As for the book itself, it has old-fashioned language though it is poetic enough for anyone to enjoy. The tone is dark, but en-capturing and exiting on a social psychological level. It can teach you a thing or two about the effects society and upbringing have on people."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The romantic, passionate epic love story where no one gets out alive. This charming little tome of dysfunctional love could also have been easily titled \\"I'm Not Ok, You're Hareton, That Broody, Murderous One is Heathcliff\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Written by Emile Bronte in a time where love was astute, bare, controlled, even calculated - Wuthering Heights is a book that is full of unruly passion, sweeping romance, epic betrayals and vengeful drama. It is no wonder that during the life of the author, she never received the satisfaction of knowing what a classic she had written - it was only after the reprinting of her novel, posthumous, that Emily Bronte received the praise that she deserved, for a book that deserves much more than a praise.I read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" often - not because I believe in I believe in the dramatics of love, but simply because I believe in it. Love, that is. Wuthering Heights is full of characters who are morally bankrupt, and despicable to the core - but you cannot help but feel for them anyway. One moment you feel sorry for Heathcliff, and with the turn of a page, are filled with such hatred for him. But that an author can create such convincing characters, that they can evoke such emotions in you, is what makes this book so special. For me it's a lesson, that when one finds love, one must look past the color, the creed, the caste and the credentials to embrace what you have found - for if you let it go, you will break your own heart, and in the process, bring pain to all hearts enjoined with yours. A classic tale, about love, friendship and betrayal - a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The basic premise is about two children growing up in the same house- clever and mischievous Cathy and enigmatic Heathcliff. They soon go beyond normal sibling interaction and enter an obsessive an disturbing love affair with one another, but due to Heathcliff's status as an adopted street arab and Cathy's death, they can never be together. Gradually, Heathcliff is driven to near insanity, and the story continues from the eyes of Nellie, a maid, and Cathy, the first Cathy's daughter.*** SPOILER ALERT***A little warning to anyone who was expecting a happy story- this isn't one. Cathy and Heathcliff's \\"love\\" can best be described as creepy attatchment, and the ending gave me nightmares for a week.That being said, there are some genuinely touching moments in Wuthering Heights, such as when Cathy 2 makes peace with her cousin and tries to teach him how to read. Cathy 1's and Heathcliff's childhood interactions are also sweet.But at first glance, there is little that's likeable. The characters are fairly unpleasant and cruel to one another. What redeems them is that they're interesting; even if you were rooting for their deaths at the end (hi, Heathcliff), you still want to know what happens to them.What really makes this book soar is a gorgeous and dark writing style. Emily Bronte manages to pull off a very difficult piece with flying colors. The details make the book come alive and the sense of urgency was beautiful. It's hard to describe, but there's a dreamy lyrical quality, almost as though you're in a seductive nightmare. What makes me give her even more props is that everything about Wuthering Heights is balancing delicately- a wrong chapter or so and the story would collapse.The overall method of telling the story is also great. Told through Nellie's careful first person PoV, Heathcliff and Cathy are allowed to remain enigmatic and seem as though there's more than what meets the eye, like a veil over everything.I would recommend this, but not for most children. It's more of a psychological thriller than anything else, but wonderfully written and a compelling story with beautiful development."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i was made to read this in high school and hated every word of it...how could i like a book where i despised every character, right?? then i read it again in my mid 20's and i still despised every character...but absolutely loved it! it's now one of my fave novels and i've read it many times over. i think the style and subject matter is a little beyond the reach of most teens and it's a shame it's offered to them as it has probably put many off trying many of the classics later in life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Such a dark love story that started from two people but affected everyone around them. Filled with anger, obsession, revenge, and pride."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In my opinion, Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest classics of all times, ranking up their with Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice! The way Emily Bronte wrote of the unending love between Heathcliff and Catherine is captivating, especially when you read the story of Ms. Bronte and how she came to create the story. A must read for all lovers of classic novels!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book, Wuthering Heights is a classic love story set in the time period of the 1700s. Emily Bronte focuses on the sad and tragic unforbbiden love between Catherine Earshaw and Healthcliff as well as the even more heartbreaking story of Catherine Linton. The story of the two young women is told by Ms. Nelly Dean, who is relating the story to a character by the name of Mr. Lockwood, who lives on the propety owned by Heathcliff, the major antagonist throughout the book.The setting of the book is set during the 17-1800s, which is stated by Mr. Lockwood in the beginning of the story. He starts out by describing his \\"days as a tenant at Thrushcross grange in the year 1801\\" (chapter 1, page 1). Healthcliff is relating his adventure to Nelly Dean telling her that he and Catherine wanted to get \\"a glimpse of the grange lights,\\" (chapter 6, pg 46). This is a clue because grange lights are lanterns and it shows that electricity was not invented just yet, so it can't be anything after the 1800s. Another clue came from Heathcliff again when he states, \\"or reading sermons, and being catechized by their manservant, and set to learn a column of scripture names if they don't answer properly?\\", (chapter 6, pg 46). Religion was prominent all throughout Europe in this time era, so the setting is appearant in the beginning of the book.Conflict is a major reappearing event that is found throughout this entire novel. The first and the most significant is found in chapter 9, pg 78. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; and he shall never know how I love him...he's more myself than I am.\\" This is the beginning of the love triangle that develops because Catherina loves Heathcliff more than anything else in the world, but they can never be together, (while they're living). The next major conflict in the story arises from Catherine and Heathcliff's offspring. \\"And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love...,\\" (chapter 24, pg 243). Linton's declaration of his love for the young Cathy is shown, which signifies the beginning of their love and the horrible revenge that is exacted on them by Heathcliff. The interesting and tragic conflict that occurs between Heathcliff and Catherine comes when she passes away from insanity and a broken heart. I adore the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, aside from the turmoil and havoc it brings. \\"She has disturbed me-incessantly-remorselessly-till yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil\\", (chapter 29, pg 275). This quote showed me something different. A conflict felt within Heathcliff's heart about loving Catherine and being haunted and agonized by her soul for 18 years while still loving her and withstanding the pain.Wuthering Heights was defnitely a book I'll always hold dear to my heart. Emily Bronte knows how to write an epic book that kept me raptured from beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A young girl by the name of Emily Bronte delivered the world a story. Although 'love' is contained in all aspects of this book, this is not a love story. Wuthering Neights is the tragic and heartbreaking story of two lovers destroyed, and the outcomes that follow.From beginning to end, this novel was a page-turner for me. I simply did not want to put it down, and at times, I couldn't. We begin our story with Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant in the manor of Thrushcross Grange. Throughout the story, he writes in his diary, documenting the life of the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange. Though Wuthering Heights is told through the viewpoint of more than one person, everything is documented by Mr. Lockwood himself. The setting is in England, 1801. If you are a fan of the Bronte sister's or tragic British literature, then this is the story for you! We have our resident of Wuthering Heights: grumpy Mr. Heathcliff, the landlord. The state of the manor is unacceptable to our newcomer, but he leaves determined to make a better impression than his first. His sights of the manor are atrocious as he describes it on page 9 as, \\"the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment, 'Go the to Deuce', even the gate over which leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words.\\" As rude as the atmosphere was, he returns for more, to write a story.On our new day, we meet Joseph, our very own illiterate and unhappy servant. Following, we meet the beautiful but pale young man, Catherine Linton and a young man by the name of Hareton Earnshaw. The names confuse Lockwood and he recognizes the tension and mystery within this 'family'. After a strange and frightening encounter that you will read about, he retreats to his home.Meeting up with his servants, we are introduced to Nelly, who has great ties with the residents of Thrushcross Grange. The story unfolds into a mess of tragic love, as we are whisked away to 20 years in the past, as told by Nelly. She was a servant to the Earnshaw family, whom we meet early on. There is Catherine, Hindley, Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw. One day, after returning from a long trip, Mr. Earnshaw brings back a boy rather than a souvenir. His name is Heathcliff and he is a gipsy boy from the streets of England who comes into their family, and leaves them changed forever. There is tension within this household, but only towards the two young boys who you will read about. Heathcliff and Catherine hit it off early and are the best of friends. However, society would have things different.As I mentioned before, this is not a love story. As we progress, we find this to be more of tragedy, failed love and revenge. So much evil doings and rebellion unfolds as you read on, that it will make your heart burst! Every harsh and cruel decision made through rude intentions causes you to be ripped apart, but it gets better! I cannot even put to words the way that Wuthering Heights will mess with your emotions, but it is definitely worth it! Catherine and Heathcliff find love, but the standards of the world would prove to be stronger than they could handle at such a young age. The bond they would create is soon left to wither away and haunt them forever. The legacy they leave is known by all. I encourage all readers to not underestimate the tragedy of these pages. It is gripping, heart-wrenching and unforgettable. It has personally moved me and I could not ask for more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have just finished reading Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. It's probably safe to say that this was about the millionth time I have read this classic. Forget the Twilight Series and Edgar! When I was a teen, I thought it was all about Heathcliff's brooding devotion to Catherine even 20 years after her death. With that in mind, I was curious to reread Wuthering Heights now as a middle-aged mom. The verdict? Well, the dysfunction of the whole clan was a lot more uncomfortable for me than it was when I was younger, but overall it really is a great book and I still love it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love It!

If you thought this was to cool, may I also suggestThe Illustrated Jane Eyre (Penguin Illustrated Classics)Dame D'arcy and Charlotte Bronte in one package..it's all too beautiful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic has a reputation as being a grand \\"love\\" story. It is more about dark obession than \\"love\\". The characters are all psychologically damaged people (nuts) who seem to thrive on making each other miserable. I cannot figure out what Catherine had that made two men fall madly in love with her--she is spoiled, selfish, and extremely stupid. Edgar is a spineless wimp who certainly knew he had a rival--but refused to deal with it. Heathcliff is a sadist who is obessed with (not in love with) Catherine; he is willing to harm even himself to cause suffering to other people. Who could love a man that nasty? Isabella is another silly woman who could not see what was going on around her and falls in \\"love\\" with her imagined version of Heathcliff. And on and on...Nelly Dean is the only sane person in this novel, and she was crazy to stay around these looney families as long as she did.The atmosphere saves the book from complete ruin--it is as dark ,moody, and brooding as the characters. Even the houses seem to snarl and brood and take on the personalities of characters. One is compelled to continue in the book just to see how much more crazy things will get with every body being so dysfunctional and obssessed with having their way. The writing is poetic, and the final scene between Catherine and Heathcliff could be touching--if you can forget how absurd it is.Maybe I am too much of a realist to get carried away with this type of novel. I would not touch Heathcliff with a ten foot pole and can't imagine what women see in the character, other than dark good looks. I cannot imagine what a man would see in Catherine. Or how any of these crazy characters' actions spell l-o-v-e."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If I were a contributor to a dictionary and was asked for a definition of the word passion, I would simply write....\\"See Wuthering Heights\\". All the basic human emotions- love, hate, jealously, pride, are on display in this novel but at their penultimate height. Cathy just doesn't love Heathcliff- he is part of her very being. Heathcliff just doesn't hate his son Linton- he must fully destroy him. In real life, no one would want to meet, let alone spend any time with any of these people (except perhaps for Ellen Deane, a housekeeper who recounts the story to her new employer-good eye for detail as she spins her tale). But to live with them through the pages of a novel-pure heaven. No other book I have read from this time period even comes close to the modernity of this novel. Heathcliff and Cathy are not destined to be together, because Cathy is unable to forgo the warm pleasures that money can bring. She marries Edgar Linton, a good man devoted to Cathy and for a time Cathy settles in to this life. But as soon as Heathcliff re-enters her life, she is determined to possess him as she did before and Edgar must just understand. Why should he be jealous? Cathy asks. There is not hint of a sexual relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff but something deeper, deeper than even love. Edgar, like most human beings, feels unable to share his spouse in this kind of relationship and being thwarted in her desires, Cathy pines and eventually dies. But this happens in the first half of the book-what are the remaining 150 pages about? Since Heathcliff can never be happy since Cathy is gone, then he decides that no one will be happy and he takes his revenge. And what revenge! Just from general knowledge, I knew what to expect in the first half of the book but the second half was a revelation. Emily Bronte has created a character in Heathcliff that breaks almost every moral code of the time and yet the reader sympathizes with him, no matter how monstrous his actions. I can't think of another writer alive or dead who could have pulled off this feat so well. The writing is beautiful and the dialogues between Cathy and Heathcliff are richly poetic.If you haven't read Wuthering Heights, do yourself a favor and run to find a copy. Reading experiences such as this are rare- a perfectly written novel with characters you will remember forever. The world lost a great novelist with the death of Emily Bronte after only one novel. It makes the reader wonder what else she could have produced."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This edition is just the last aesthetic overhauling of Oxford World's Classics ones with just the same picture (by the Pre-Raphaelite master John Everett Millais) on the cover (see my reviews on them or the global vision I offer in the Norton Critical Fourth Edition review).The cover has been the main object of redesign and looks good, even showy. The only complaint I have, with this as well as with previous editions, and Penguin and some worse ones (like Wordsworth Classics), is the very bad paper quality and the outrageous mass-market paperback with glue-only binding. The book looks like it were to be destroyed BEFORE reading. This just can't be the only format in which to get this absolute classical masterpiece of world-over novel writing, in one edition in which the best scholarly efforts have been spent to get a pure text with adequate annotation. At the very least it should be offered as a quality paperback, with flaps, acceptable paper and, of course, signature-sewn.As far as the contents and not the vessel is concerned, and summarizing: the best 1847 reliable and authoritative Clarendon critical text (due to Hilda Marsden), even with over-conservative details for a mass-market edition, like a rather heavy and outdated punctuation and the unbelievable two-volume implied structure, with its clumsy independent chapter numbering.Ian Jack's annotation is yet one of the very best, even if its Yorkshire dialect support is scanty and a bit difficult to follow (most good editions offer by now fullfoot-of-page glosses of the dialect tirades -glosses that are sometimes wrong and misleading-). The Bibliography is very good, selected, sorted and annotated (I don't know if updated, suppose not). The long Introduction by Patsy Stoneman (30 pp) is excellent, even if a little scholarly (and, as with most of other Introductions, please don't read it BEFORE the novel but after it, just as the \\"Charlotte's materials\\" of 1850 provided at the end of the volume).This edition is a really good buy, that should be compared to the best text-oriented editions:A) Penguin (Pauline Nestor),B) Routledge (Heather Glen, very hard to come by, try Amazon Canada).You may also consider the good context-oriented editions (that is, \\"study\\" ones, rich in contextual materials and/or critical essays), namely,C) Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn), with rather scanty if good annotation and a bit eclectic and even idiosyncratic text (but with very good punctuation);D) the NEW Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman, with scanty notes (very good as they are) and full dialectal glosses like Norton Fourth (both sets of glosses neither wrong nor misleading). Some textual foibles or little blunders are not worrisome (with the best punctuation in town). The overall selection of contextual materials is, arguably, the BEST EVER, with a very interesting document on \\"brain fever\\". The brief and original Introduction (21 pp) is excellent and thought-provoking.Not to be forgotten in this class isE) Longman Cultural Edition (Alison Booth), featuring good if more conventional Introduction and good annotation that includes a little blunder about Miloin Chapter 9, with the authoritative Clarendon text (I will inform you if there is any hidden foible with this), and a too vast array of almost dis-arrayed contextual pieces (more than forty of them), interesting but too brief to be really meaningful.I stand by what I have written, but don't forget that this is one of the very best editions available!Oneworld Classics is a worse choice, in spite of his good paperback making, with good paper and printing quality and covers with flaps. With its good annotation it would challenge the top positions, were it not by the bad quality of the text itself, that was carefully edited but keeps many blunders and too many of Charlotte's 1850 \\"improvements\\". Wordsworth Classics edition is also a worse choice, with a reliable 1850 text (that of the Haworth Edition of 1900: that is, a reliable edition of the wrong text!), adequate notes (even if brief and not user-friendly) and a fair Introduction by John S. Whitley, in one of the worst material productions ever.If you are looking for a beautiful hardcover volume, your choices are much more limited. You can wait for two or three years to get an used copy of the Clarendon 1976 (or 1995) Edition, or you can get the nice volume in Barnes&Noble; Classics (that has the reliable Haworth Edition 1850 text, which is really a pity), or rush to get one nice copy of the Franklin Mint edition of 1978 (see my review) with the beautiful if not daring double-page lithographs by Alan Reingold and a very good pre-Clarendon 1847 text, but with no modern introduction and no annotation whatever, except for the well-done footnotes glossing correctly and in full the dialect tirades (the first edition ever to do so)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and I can say without a doubt that I loved Wuthering Heights just as much. The Bronte sisters are so talented! I hope to read something by Anne Bronte, the less well known sister, too. Wuthering Heights is about a destructive and consuming love between Heathcliff, an orphan who comes to the mansion of Wuthering Heights, and Cathy, the daughter of the wealthy family that takes him in. They are drawn together as soon as they meet. The novel is narrated partly by Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who meets Heathcliff many years later. His housekeeper, Mrs. Dean, tells him about the events that happened years earlier, making for a gripping, suspenseful, and sad story.Wuthering Heights is very complex, especially the character of Heathcliff. He's not \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"; he's conflicted, a multi-layered character. At times, I sympathized with Heathcliff; at other times, I really hated him. Wuthering Heights is difficult to put into any category. It is realistic, but it also has supernatural beings, with ghosts and graves and a love that transcends time. But it also is a mystery, asking complicated questions. The writing is very old-fashioned, but it's not too overwritten, though I did have a little trouble with some of the Yorkshire dialect. But that occurs very rarely; there's just one minor character who speaks that way.You can read all of my reviews at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I downloaded Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" to my Kindle and read this gothic novel for the first time since I was a teenager discovering 19th Century novels. I remember liking \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as well as Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I'm sure as a young girl I enjoyed the lyrical, descriptive writing, the mysterious, dark setting, and the passionate but impossible love. But now, forty years later and perhaps wiser, I saw so much more in the characters and the relationships, that it was almost overwhelming to read. I now definitely prefer Charlotte's Mr. Rochester to Emily's Mr. Heathcliff. Such a conflicted, tragic character, Heathcliff only gives small glimpses of human warmth. Yet those glimpses kept me reading and wanting to hope for him. Every character in the book is tragically flawed. But like water springing in hard, rocky soil, love breaks through in unexpected places (as with Catherine and Hareton at the end)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love this book and have read it multiple times. To call it melodramatic is to misunderstand the period in which it was written, is to oversimplify it without critically assessing it, and is to mistakenly compare it to current novels. It's apples vs. oranges! One thing that I've always admired is Bronte's use of the letter-within-a-letter framing device; it helps establish the multiple voices of the novel and must've been quite innovative for its time. Admittedly, my appreciation for this novel has been enriched by the 1939 film starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, though I don't think any film can really do this book justice. It's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"3 out of 5, only because it's a bed book. The book itself is in good shape, and it arrived quickly.

I wasn't fond of Catherine or Heathcliff, but i enjoyed the book. It took me a little while to really get into but after that i couldn't put it down! :] But if your looking for a happy story with a good fairytale ending this book is not for you. For me I really did like this book but I don't think it's for everyone.&lt;3"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was kind of skeptical of this book in the beginning, after all, a book that has like three generations of families, half of them with the same name is really confusing. In addition, it seemed that I could find any good characters in this book. Even the main character has faults that I would look down upon. This book centers around the revenge of the main character Heathcliff. After trudging along several chapters I found this book to be quite interesting.This book incorporates a lot of gothic elements within the book. Emily Bronte conveys a deep horror and arouses our morbid curiosity with this. One will find many supernatural elements and suspenseful atmosphere within this book, and even a ghost! Because Bronte writes this book through the eyes of several characters, it is hard to judge the objectivity of the story, forcing readers to determine for themselves whether or not certain actions were justified. In the retellings through one character who used to care for Heathcliff's lover, she consistently paints him as the antagonist, emphasizing his faults and his actions against the family. This makes the book that much more interesting to read.The story of Wuthering Heights is a really complicated love story that focuses mainly on Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Through Bronte's appeal to pathos, she is able to convey and build up the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine. When she dies, Heathcliff, literally becomes a monster mentally, and Bronte applies this to a figurative level, describing him as a monster too. This also reveals the inner turmoil he experiences upon her death.Emily Bronte definitely writes on par with her sister Charlotte Bronte. Emily's work on Wuthering Heights, with her use of pathos and figurative language definitely makes it a classical gothic romance novel with a novel storyline.It is a beautifully written book that is full of human emotion from the seemingly cold and calculating Heathcliff. After the death of Catherine he burns for revenge. It is a great book, one just needs to get through the first couple of chapter to realize this. The conclusion is also satisfactory and provides for a good release of tension and an epiphany-like ending.I find this book to be a good read, because it has some adult themes, I would not exactly advise little kids to read it, but I am sure that anyone who appreciates literature would be \\"wowed\\" and amazed by this book. Give it a chance, and you will find that this book is worth every single penny!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story. But it is not your typical, love conquers all tale. It is a dark, twisted story of obsession, greed and lust that spans beyond the grave. What really strikes me about the story still is how dark it is. And I don't mean 'given the time it was written' because the story is legitimately dark no matter what era it is set in.In the story Bronte perfectly frames two very different kinds of love. There is the healthy love that the tragic heroine of the story has for her husband. There is a fondness in that love that seems destined to grow and flourish. But, there is also an unhealthy, all consuming fiery love between the heroine and the devil of the story, our tragic hero, the scoundrel Heathcliff. So consuming and obsessive is the love between the two that it becomes dark and twisted. Their love is so unhealthy and obsessive that it consumes and devours both of them. It all sounds so amazingly romantic but what it drives the characters to: insanity, murder, captivity, and revenge makes even their proclamations of love to one another macabre.On a side note, Heathcliff, the center of the story for most intents and purposes, is so damned intriguing. I haven't really encountered a character quite like him in literature. You find yourself wanting to know more about him and can't helping thinking that a man who could love so deeply could be so damned evil! But oh, he is...Far and away, Bronte succeeds in the book in creating characters who are both sympathetic and intolerable. None of the characters are entirely loveable, save for the story teller herself. Otherwise there is a pathetic air among everyone save for Heathcliff who seems the only one in the novel who can exploit this weakness. It makes for a lot of moments of cringing as you can almost see the gears of evil genius working in Heathcliff's head.My only complaint with the book is the conveinance of pregnancy. Never is it mentioned until the child is born and never is the mother said to be or appear pregnant. It wasn't enough to entirely take me out of the story but I did roll my eyes on every instance. That is really the only hard argument I can make of Bronte taking an easy way out in her plot but given this is her first and only attempt at a novel, I can let it go as it truly is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario.

One can read this novel over and over, and still not be sure of Emily Bronte's intentions (btw, she had a wonderful, witty style). She seems to have been portraying the detrimental effects of social class rigidity (the mal-treatment of the waif Heathcliff, ideas of what constituted \\"proper behavior\\" for girls/women, among many other things), of violence on children, and of poor parenting.One problem with the book is the all-too-convenient (and nearly perfect) character of Nelly the Narrator. She is the most likeable character in the story but not very realistic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before posting my review, I always read several other reviews. I swear, some people would write a review that says, &quot;drinking water makes my mouth wet&quot; and then give water one star. The Victorian novel typically isn't your light hearted, Erma Bombeck-ish literature. Yes...it is dark, brooding, mysterious, and long. It is supposed to be that way! I think it is sad that Emily Bronte died at such a young age, leaving only this one novel. In my opinion, the Victorian novel is the pinnacle of great literature and Wuthering Heights is among the best.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the language of Joseph was too difficult to understand. It took great patience for me to &quot;translate&quot; those passages. Bronte obviously wanted to describe that character by his speech and it was very effective, but it was too much."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a good book and another one I had to read for senior english in high school..It had a good plot and a captivating love story between Cathy and Heathcliff....The action went at a good pace and WH was a page turner for me...good job Bronte! While it was quite depressing, it taught me a lot about love and hate, which are two important things in life. I would recommend this book to everyone that likes classics and love stories"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte should be on the next Oprah. There is so much love and deception in this book it would make a great topic. This is the second time I have read this book the first time was in high school and I hated the book. It was partly to do with all the Cathy's. Once you get passed who is who in the book and you understand the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff you begin to understand the book better. I found that is easier to map out the families so I knew who was who and what family they belonged to. This is truly a great novel of love and deception and is now off my bad list and on my good list."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte died so young. Her novel is fantastic. The characters may be hard to accept for someone who lives in middle america suburbia and thinks no evil exists. This book deals with love, jealousy, revenge, hatred, dueling neighbors, and more. This novel is a must read for a lover of the classics. ... I am not going to recap the story as many as done, I would just like to say if you love a torn romance novel, this one is a must."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a well-written book. The style and language are impressive. However, this book is not for the faint-hearted. It was written as a gothic novel and is faithful to its genre. I honestly felt very depressed and angry at several of the characters throughout the course of the book. It is valuable to increase the reader's awareness of English literature, but if the object of one's reading is pleasure, I would recommend reading a book by either of her sisters, Anne or Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I thought it would further my knowledge in vocabulary and because my mother absolutely loved this book. As I read through it, it was hard to understand who was speaking and what was going on. Towards the end of the book I caught on but I still thought the book to be depressing and not at all uplifting. I think you should read it because it is a classic, but if you're looking for a light, romantic book, you've picked the wrong book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i hated this book.

No passion and pain like Charolotte's JANE EYRE or LUCY SNOWE of Villette, and unlike the flighty creations of Anne's novel, this one was rather hard to finish. All in all, another over rated book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i hated this book with a passion! i felt no sympathy for any of the characters and i thought that it was pointless and boring."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If Jane Eyre is free on Kindle, then why isn't her sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" free as well?It is a classic that should be available for free like so many other classics that are available for free as an eBook.Shame to the person that is making money off this eBook. (This goes for all the other \\"authors\\" on DTPAmazon that are selling this eBook here.)This book deserves all 5 stars, but the fact that they are selling it for a profit, brings it down to one star (I would have put zero, but it wouldn't let me).As soon as I can get my hands on a computer document for this book, I will be putting up on the Kindle store for FREE!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you had a feeling that this book was written a long time ago, well, you're right! The novel, Wuthering Heights by Emile Bronte, is along the lines of most romance/drama novels out there. It has a very familiar story and plot twits that will not keep the reader occupied. When I tried to invision the settings and characters all that I could invision is a grey bloob with generic settings and overly used characters. The same generic plots may suit some people fine but it seems to me that the average reader may want to move onto something alittle bit more innovative and interesting.Now, onto the characters. The three main characters in the beginning of the book are Heathcliff, Catherine, and Edgar. Heathcliff is a poor waif that has been friends with Catherine seince they were little children about the age of 6 and is now madly in love with Catherine. Secondly, Catherine has always loved heathcliff but her greed gets in the way of thier love often. Edgar, who is ALSO in love with Catherine, is a very rich and well educated individual. As the plot continues Catherine marries Edgar for his money, not doing what her heat deisred by marrying Heathcliff, which turns out to be her biggest mistake.Although this book has its \\"up's\\", it also has a large share of \\"down's\\". And the lacklust enviorments dont help one bit. The lack of plausable discription takes its toll on this could be great story. At one point in the book while discribing a trellus of flowers it was depicted as follows: \\"I noticed that there were flowers surrounding the barn.\\". Not to be rude... but... What kind of barn was it? was it old, or new, or red, or green? Flowers? What kind? What color? This very bland discription of what MAY be a older barn that MAY have help horses, and that MAY have had flowers the MAY have been yellow creats no mental image of the area that MAY exist. Wuthering Heights was once descibed as a gloomy building. I mean, excuse me? A gloomy building? Is it 2 stories high, or maby 3? What color is it? Surroundings?Over all the only thing that this book did for me is show me how NOT to write a book. I would not recommend this book for anyone unless you have read EVERY OTHER BOOK in the world. The only reason that this book did not get 1 star is because it is not a total loss of reading. It does have its good points. I would like to talk more about this book but I am pressured for time at the moment. In conclusion I wouldn't reccomend this book and think that it is almost a waste of time. If you are extreemly into classic liturature then go pick this novel up. But besides that then no."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This review is on the \\"other\\" Wuthering Heights Penguin Classics edition (Corot's \\"Gust of Wind\\" on the cover), 1995, reprinted with a new Introduction, Chronology and Further Reading 2000, Reissued with revisions and a new Preface 2003.Forgive me as I have read only 38 pages. But I find it necessary to say now it has been an extremely frustrating experience. The novel is oddly laid out, with tricks of the flashback filling in details that should have been straightforwardly presented at the beginning, such as WHO IS MRS HEATHCLIFF? Honestly, I went back and scanned over the first 38 pages several times and just could not figure out who she was, despite consulting other helps. Was she (is she) Heathcliff's wife, his son's wife, some other wife? Heathcliff says she is my daughter-in-law but then it is stated later his only son died. WHAT? Maybe the \\"Harleton Earnshaw\\" is an adopted son. Some of the characters have the same name or nickname such as CATHERINE versus CATHY. There's another Cathy (Linton) that is different from CATHERINE EARNSHAW but CATHERINE is also called Cathy, which just causes unnecessary confusion and is indicative of slipshod writing.And then there's the ghost story and the dreamscape which is a cheap trick (many movies include the nightmare scene you think is real but the oh so clever movie scriptwriters cause the malignant balloon to pop, the protagonist waking up! and you are tricked once again). At least I am thankful the local Yorkshire \\"Wuthering\\" dialect is not overused, but thankfully there ARE frequent footnotes you'll have to look up to make any sense out of some of the text and dialogue. Perhaps the book will improve; I'll be glad to report on it if it happens."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I bought this as one of my collection of Classics. Everyone knows that the novel itself deserves a five star. However, the poor paper quality does not match the quality of the content."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I finally sat down and read this book. It was a fairly easy read, and the English was not hard for me at all. I did refer to the notes at the end of the book but for the most part it was stuff I already knew, which surprised me. This isn't a book that shows people always making the best and right choices in life. Over and over everyone makes the worse possible choice, choosing to be evil rather than good. But I feel that helps us as humans to look at ourselves and acknowledge that we do get tempted to make bad choices."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I used to love Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice was my favorite book; I've read it so many times that I can quote Elizabeth Bennet in my sleep. I know every single word of the movie Emma by heart. So, naturally, I felt compelled to read it. I love the flowery language, how Emma and Mr. Knightly converse so eloquently. However, still being a student, I am subjected to the whims of my teachers. When Mr. Sneeringer told us to have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights read in a week, I groaned. How it pained me to set aside my precious Emma! I was especially greived because I recognized the author's name. About a year and a half ago, another honors English teacher commanded us to read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. That book is definetly not reader-friendly. The vernacular of the Victorian era that completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel worked completely against Charlotte Bronte. It made reading a difficult novel all the more tedious. I feared that I was in for another dose of the awful stuff when I received Wuthering Heights. I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised, but that doesn't even come close to my feelings. The mystery was too much for me; I couldn't put it down. Wherever I went, Wuthering Heights came with me. I took it to class, to my meals and to bed. I literally fell asleep reading the two nights my book lasted. I found it to be extremely powerful and compelling. I aspire to become a great writer someday, so I have studied many things necessary to a great novel, including plot and character development. Emily Bronte is a master at these. Her characters are so complex, and, yet, I can still identify with them. They are so well developed that it makes an intriguing story impossibly compelling. She is truly a master of the Gothic novel. I am still in awe of the graphic description of all the dark forces surrounding the Heights. I became part of the whole story when I read this book. Yes, I still love Jane Austen, but now I readily admit that there is definetly room for Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"And it must be a fine something indeed, for it kept me, a fairly discerning reader, going all the way through despite the dated language, occasional impenetrable dialect, and characters who as grown adults behaved precisely the way I remember behaving when I was about 16.Part of the 'something', I think, is the surprisingly modern psychological insight underlying the book. Today we all know the people who cry 'I'm in love' while inflicting only pain on the loved one, or who destroy children and families because of some perceived wrong. But at the time this book was written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks. The way Bronte alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of the dominance of the alpha male.In passing, I must also mention that between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never hurts from my point of view.The other part of the equation is that (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense high throughout the book. Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy, waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.I must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it. Hence, only four stars."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although I read Wuthering Heights years ago, I enjoyed rereading it. When I was younger I thought Heathcliff was just plain mean. Now that I am older, I understand loss, and frustration a little better and the book took on new meaning for me. I think everyone should read this book at least once, and if like me you read it years ago, it is time to reread it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I won't talk about the book because it's a classic and it is wonderful. This edition is so nice. It is cute and small and very pretty. It won't take much space, and it could be joined by several in the Gramercy Classics series for a very nice display. I recommend this book as a gift and I recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The only novel of Emily Bronte, published a year before her tragically early death, was met with considerable critical scorn upon its publication in 1847, but became successful in the following years, and it remains a masterpiece of literature to this day. The novel's central characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, are the ones that stick foremost in readers' minds, but the book spans two generations, opening with an embittered Heathcliff having wrecked havoc on the offspring of himself and his wife,the now deceased Linton, Cathy's daughter, and her brother Hindley's son, Hareton. The first narrator, Lockwood, arrives at the Heights, witnessing the strange, dark dynamics of his master's home. He falls asleep reading the papers of the late Catherine Earnshaw, and then encounters her childlike wraith, frightening him, and he overhears Heathcliff crying out for her. Lockwood makes the aquaintence of Nelly Dean, the Earnshaw's original housekeeper, and implores her to fill in the blanks of the bizarre oasis that he has found himself in. It then flashes back to what set it all in motion. Heathcliff is a gypsy boy found abandoned on the streets of Liverpool and is taken in by the Earnshaw family. The daughter Cathy is immediately taken with the mysterious lad, while her brother Hindley openly resents him. Cathy and Heathcliff are inseparable, roaming the moors, seeking adventure in everyday occurances, living their isolated lives in relative tranquility. Their bond, while not incestuous techincally because they are not blood relations, is disapproved of :\\"She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him, yet, she got chided more than any of us on his account.\\"When the elder Mr. Earnshaw (who favored Heathcliff) dies, Hindley takes full advantage of this and relagates this \\"filthy, swearing boy\\" into a servant and goes out of his way to make Heathcliff's life hell. Cathy meets the weathly Edgar quite by chance after she and Heathcliff stray onto the Linton property: she is attacked by the family dog and they take her in until she heals; she contracts a fever which kills Edgar's parents. When she returns to the Heights, she has been transformed into a lady, upsetting the volatile soulmate that she so dearly loves but does not feel that she can marry. The rejected young man disappears from his beloved's life for some years, returning a very (inexplicabily) wealthy man, returning to wreck havoc on all who have wronged him. Cathy has married Edgar; Hindley has become a gambling drunk. He torments his former love with his courtship and marriage to Edgar's sister Isabella, his dark motives that ultimately drive everyone to misery, Cathy to an obsession that will cost her dearly. Their tender reunion at her deathbed (she is weak, soon to give birth to her namesake daughter), heartbreaklingly expresses their longing for one another and the negative choices they have made. \\"Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living! You said I killed you - haunt me then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe - I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh God! It is unttuerable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!\\" After her death, Heathcliff becomes even more embittered, despising his effeminate son, Linton, nuturing Hindley's son Hareton in hatred with cruelty and abuse - both young men court young Catherine's affections. Despite his efforts, Heathcliff is unable to put a stop to Hareton's obvious love for young Catherine after the death of Linton, and so there is hope for the next generation when Catherine realizes that her heart lies with Hareton. The significance of that is unmistakable, even to Heathcliff, who sees in the budding relationship before him the parallels of what he once had with Cathy. Heathcliff remains obsessed with his lost love, hearing her voice calling to him, seeing her apparition out on the moors - the taboo subject of necrophilia is hinted when he digs her up the day after her funeral, and some years later longs to crawl in the coffin with her. When he finally meets his maker, and his ghost joins Cathy's, he has left a very unpleasant memory in the ones who remain; he endeared no one to him with his selfish, cruel and dissolute ways.Heathcliff is appropriately named; although it is acknowledged in the novel that he is named after an Earnshaw son who died, it serves as both a first and last name - his lack of a personal history, mysterious reserve - he is wild, just like the moors and the heath that grows there; he is unpredictable and volatile, like the wind that rips through the countryside, he drives others often to desperation - both Cathy and Isabella are extreme examples of this - leaving them devastated and inclined to self-destruction, as a cliff overlooking the sea can symbolize. He is almost unknowable in a way, making him almost a blank slate that others can project their own views and desires on. Cathy is self-absorbed in the way of an infant, and her love for him is both mature and childlike - the bond the formed from those early days is in her mind, always:\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath . . . . I am Heathcliff - he's always , always in my mind - not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself - but as my own being.\\"The shifting of narrators can be mildly confusing at times, but the story is powerful and probes into the depths of human psychology, very daring for a novel of its time. Emily Bronte's poetry is also in a class by itself - some of her poems, which she wrote while composing the stories of her imaginary world of Gondal, seem to foreshadow the theme of Wuthering Heights. I recommend strongly the poems, \\"Remembrance\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\" in particular.A classic on every level, as long as you can handle dark human depths and romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Every month my teacher makes us write a book report. I had a 300 and something page book that I was going to read but of course I put it off because I HATE READING! I decided to read this book because it was shorter and it had been on my bookshelf collecting dust for years. Once I started reading, I read a quarter of the book and the only reason I put it down was because by the time I looked up it was two in the morning! I think everyone needs to read this book. I was also amazed when I found out that it was written 150 years ago!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up this book with a great background history of the Bronte sisters. Emily was the most sheltered and out of her came Wuthering Heights which is an intense story of love, hate, and passion. The book criticizes society at the time and really holds nothing back. There is no real happy ending here but the book does take you along an interesting path that deals with race, class, and religious issues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As you begin to read this novel you will almost certainly feel a sense of confusion. I have heard many people complain that the first four chapters are among the most confusing and boring chapters they have ever read. Do not, I repeat, do not stop reading this book in the first four chapters. Although the story does not make sense at first and especially because the names of the characters sometimes appear more than once, continue to read the book because it is worth it in the end.The story focuses around Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The main theme of the story focuses around the mysterious powers of love and hatred and how this played into the lives of two families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons. The reason why this novel has been considered such a masterpiece is that it encompasses every human emotion from love to hate, forgiveness to revenge and everything else in the realm of human understanding. As one reads the novel it becomes apparent that Emily Bronte is very skilled in her ability to weave everything into this tight-knit story with countless parallels and subtle symbolism. There is incredible symbolism within this book that I would encourage readers to try to pick out. On the surface the book is a treasure in itself, containing the most memorable love story in all of literature as well as managing to encompass so many universal themes, but understanding the symbolism gives this novel so much more depth. Understanding the symbols is the only way to truly appreciate the genius of Wuthering Heights and Emily Bronte herself. If you do decide to read this book, it becomes too irresistable not to read again, and absolutely impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a disturbingly dark book about love, obsession and revenge. It is a romantic novel full of twists and turns that nearly requires the reader to keep a running dictionary of characters, especially since names have a tendency to pop up in different places and on different people throughout the novel. I read this novel for a class assignment in Victorian Literature but it is helpful to know that the book employs many themes of the Romantic literary genre as well. Victorian ideas of social class are brought up as well as the fantasies of adolescence. Some of the Romantic ideas found in the novels include the idea of the tragic landscape. The landscape of the novel is foreboding and isolated, borrowed most likely from the gothic novel. The characters are extreme in their varying passions and the concept of the dream is used in a type of ghostly communication. One of the story's narrators has a dream of being visited by the ghost of Catherine, which causes a startling and dramatic reaction in Heathcliff. The belief that the reader cannot fully hate Heathcliff because of how he was mistreated as a child is also a Romantic ideal.The story contains a great deal of darkness and some cruelty, which may turn readers away. Love is often extreme to the point of violence in the novel while the romances themselves are nearly incestuous in tone. Cousins marry and adopted siblings hold lifelong affections and obsessions for each other. The novel also illustrates an element of cruelty that can be slightly disturbing at times. Heathcliff, the novel's antagonist, goes as far as to string up the beloved dog of the young woman he courts after Catherine rejects him.The main focus of the story is the rather twisted love story element that develops between Catherine and Heathcliff. Heathcliff is adopted into Catherine's family at a young age and the pair become close, though Catherine rejects him because he is poor and instead marries a rich neighbor. Though throughout the novel, other romances develop between the two highly inbred families, they are side stories in comparison to the main romance.The love of Catherine and Heathcliff eventually develops into an obsession that lasts, and in fact becomes even stronger with the eventual death of Catherine. Her spirit seems to haunt Heathcliff and further fire his obsession. Even before Catherine's death this obsessive love broadens to include an equally obsessive drive to ruin the lives of all the people who mistreated him and stood between him and Catherine, including her husband and older brother.These obsessions eventually lead to the last of the major themes of the novel, revenge. A good part of the book is spent upon Heathcliff's attempts to destroy the lives of anyone and everyone who mistreated him or got in the way of his relationship with Catherine. His need for revenge does not lessen as the book moves on and Heathcliff continues to take his revenge even upon the next generation, including Catherine's daughter and his own son. Whether or not Heathcliff succeeds in his attempts I leave to the reader.Personally, I enjoyed this book a great deal, if for no other reason than the simple fact that it was quite different from the usual school assigned reading. I was pleasantly surprised by how well woven and engaging the book was. The calculating lengths that Heathcliff goes to in order fulfill his quest for revenge are nearly reason enough to read the book. The old style language of the book, which I expected to be a hindrance, was hardly noticeable. In short, if you can handle (or enjoy) the book's darker aspects, then I highly recommend this classic to you. (And I'm not just saying that because I have to! ;))Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WARNING: reading this review will spoil some of the plot of WH.I grinned when Sis, back in high school, told me I reminded her of Heathcliff. I remembered from the (old, old) movie that he was some evil fellow. Then I read the book. And stopped grinning. I'm amazed this book would ever be assigned to high school 'kids.' It's humorless and ultra-realistic. Every page reeks of evil and has selfishly evil (meaning normal) characters. Heathcliff was a tortured being but hardly innocent. Cathy was a solipsistic, driven fool. Even the Cliff Notes booklet for WH is surprisingly short (I read The Notes after burning through the book in a week) as if Cliff's was horrified to study this book! Cliff's good observation about Heathcliff is that his sole emotion is actually pity/affection for Hareton and that his 'love' for Cathy is, in fact, an animal possessive jealous rage. I changed after reading this book. For the better, I don't know. There is a point in the book where Heathcliff's every action evokes disgust and hatred, and then...as a man...I began to feel what he felt. For whatver his faults, I began to connect fully with his insane rage, and that his ideal of 'love' for Catherine--however warped--had been stolen from him forever. I understood his ruthlessness and love for no person or thing after Catherine's death. By the way, not to parrot the critics, but it is true that the marriage of Cathy and Hareton is NOT some kind of full circle, happier ending. It's more like holding hands in Hell. I left this book sadder than when I started it. After reading it, I doubt anyone anywhere is getting 'wiser.'"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One of my favorite class reads.

It's quite the downer and the characters make you frustrated, but I LOVE it. You really feel what the characters feel. You get frustrated for them. You pull for them when you really shouldn't. You want it to work out for them even though you know it's impossible. It's a love story without a happy ending, but also a twisted happy ending at the same time. Twisted is a good way to describe a lot of this book. But I loved it with all it's twistiness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Read this story a long time ago.

Well worth the price, this is a great buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is not a love story. It is about all consuming passion. Anyone who says otherwise fails to understand the true meaning of the novel. I'm not going to waste time stating the general plot premise. This story is a classic and the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is well known.Wuthering Heights is about classicism, torture and religion. Heathcliff is a representation of the devil. The entire story focuses on getting into Heaven or Hell and being smiled upon by providence. The love between Cathy and Heathcliff is the quintessential abusive relationship. The main characters are not likable; they are repulsive and cruel. The estate of Wuthering Heights (and by virtue of its name) is the focal point of the ever changing social dynamics (from Heathcliff and Catherine to their respective children).It sounds like I hated this book but in fact I loved it! It shows the raw and sadistic elements of human beings and the need for kindness and compassion. The writing is exceptionally eloquent, although it takes the reader forty pages to get caught up in the characters. Wuthering Heights is a moving masterpiece. Please read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I accept that it is one of the great books of all time but I find it too dark, too depressing, too bleak... I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a well-structured, inspiring literary classic that is very deserving of its place. I found it to be a little slow to begin, and a bit hard to follow, but it picks up fairly quickly. The story is partly love story and partly tragedy. All the tragedy that occurs in the novel makes the reader feel a little depressed at times, but it is well worth it for the ending. Heathcliff is an unlikeable character initially, but as the story unfolds I can almost be sympathetic towards him. In the beginning Heathcliff appears selfish and greedy without cause, but his behavior is not unjust. True, he is still vengeful and unlikeable, but at least he had a reason. The characters portray the downside of humanity, the not-so-good aspect of ourselves, but also explains the why not just the what. Emily Bront did a wonderful job of pointing out humanity's imperfections while still providing readers with a good story. Given the era she lived during, it seems to me that she was far ahead of her time when she wrote this. The novel holds great power over the reader, and once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down until I had finished it.I didn't particularly like the fact that almost all the characters were self-destructive, but I was pleased with how Hareton Earnshaw turned out. Of all of the characters, my least favorite was Joseph, who just seemed like a bitter old croak to me. Indeed, Lockwood says this of him, \\"Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy [...] vinegar-faced.\\"To me, a good story has emotion. Wuthering Heights left me feeling appalled at some of the actions the characters did, and saddened at times, and angry at others. The story is filled with vivid details and depth, making it an awesome read. It is a dark novel, but absolutely stunning. If you're looking for a fairy tale ending, you won't find it here, but that doesn't mean this isn't a good book. I highly recommend this, even if you only read it once."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is one of those authors who has an extreme grip on the English language, and I just loved having this on my Kindle to read at my leisure. This was a great buy for the price, and the fact is that Bronte is always good to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was hard to read. It is just amazing to think that a woman that died at 30 (just 2 years after this book was written) could come up with something like this. It makes you wonder what kind of life she had.I enjoyed the book but it took me several tries and quite a while to get through it.A classic worth reading but not easy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this book is my favorite novel of all time, even though I have read virtually thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of novels of all types. I have several printings of this book, and have re-read it no less than 5 times, and I am never disappointed in the novel itself, although sometimes the edition might not be that great. I prefer a book as close to the original (unedited) as I can find, but don't mind extras included (articles, thoughts, essays, poems, etc), as long as the story itself is untampered with. this novel is about love, in all of its many forms, and about the vital importance of truly knowing yourself, and living your life accordingly. Not by other people's standards, nor how others might wish you to be, or even by who you may wish you were (instead of who you really are). If you do not do this, your life will always be a misery for you, and probably for everyone else around you as well. I have never found another novel to take it's place in my heart or my soul. I \\"am\\" this book, and it is me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been reading and re-reading Wuthering Heights for 45 years, and each time I open this novel I find something new. From my first reading at the age of 12, I was and remain intrigued by the format of the novel: told by a rather dim-witted tenant intrigued by his decidedly odd neighbor/landlord named Heathcliff after he hears the tale from his housekeeper of Thrushcross Grange in remote Yorkshire during two lengthy stays. It's a complicated and elegant structure that serves the reader very well. As a 'tween I was captivated by the romance of Wuthering Heights. In my 20s and 30s it was Catherine Earnshaw Linton, who chose respectability over passion, who interested me. In my 40s, I looked again at Heathcliff, who is just about the most diabolical and evil man in literature. And now in my 50s I find myself especially interested in Catherine Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff's chosen victim for his revenge of the supposed sins committed against him by her parents. She is the daughter of two weak parents: Catherine Earnshaw, whose mind and body broke before she reached the age of 20, and Edgar Linton, who lacked the physical vigor to fight Heathcliff or protect his daughter. Yet though Heathcliff chooses Catherine Linton Heathcliff for his revenge, she is no victim, and it is Heathcliff's inability to destroy her that leads to his ultimate despair and death. To many readers, the story of the second Catherine feels tacked on (and many movie versions leave it out altogether), but in it resides Emily Bronte's message. The second Catherine and second Hareton offer a new start for Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a new kind of masters -- not a pampered and privileged pair who've been protected from the harshness of the world, but a couple who've survived the worst treatment that Heathcliff could devise for them and have emerged with their humanity intact."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All time favorite classic.

I have a very short attention span and have always had difficulty with the verboseness of 19th century literature. But I was finally required to read this for a class so I was left with no choice.I am incredibly grateful I took that class. Once I got through chapter 1, I could not put this book down. Bront has a way of making your emotions go to war over even the most wicked characters. Wuthering Heights is daring, disturbing, and captivating. The psychology in this book is extraordinary and the plot will have you hooked.It is rare for a book to wrap up so flawlessly that you're left 100% satisfied, but Wuthering Heights was that book for me. Even my most cherished stories left me disappointed in some way or another. I couldn't describe the feeling I had when I finished reading Wuthering Heights. It really will test you, but if you want a story that doesn't play it safe, I say start reading this as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Classic story, love it each time I read it. Highly recommend everyone, especially the ladies to read this story. The Bronte sisters never wrote a &#34;typical&#34; romance...always a dark side before the light!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Once required reading for many English classes, this book too often has been cast aside as supposedly too archaic in style and point of view, which is a shame."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Every time I read this book I love it more. I am always surprised how lost I get in the the story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you ever find yourself trying to read this novel, please do it with an open mind. I started out with some very narrow tunnel vision and gradually, I accepted the fact that this story is about 18th century British Hicks. And when you figure this out, the story unravels into something absolutely amazing. You find yourself drawn to Heathcliff, even if he is troubled and deranged. You find yourself wanting a happy ending and wanting a little more from the characters. AND, Heathcliff does surpass Hamlet or Othello as the most troubled romantic lead character of all time. Long Live Heathcliff!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story was a bit hard to follow. It skips around a bit and if not followed closely, can become confusing. Wuthering Heights is set in the late 1700's to early 1800's. It is centered around two people madly in love. Catherine puts her love for Heathcliff aside to marry the wealthy Edgar Linton. Heathcliff cannot deal with this rejection and runs away. A few years pass and he returns. Upon his return their lives are turned upside down because of their unyielding love. Heathcliff brings revenge upon anyone that had wronged him prior to his leaving. This story shows the destruction that can come from uncontrollable love. Revenge, jealousy, and death are all results of a love that was never given the chance to fully grow.There are some similarities between the author's life and the story as well. One that is immediately recognizable is that the female characters all die after giving birth, as Bronte's mother did. Another similarity is the drug addictions. Bronte's brother was addicted to opium and had a drinking problem. Hindley, Catherine's brother, takes to drinking after his wife dies."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought this book was tragic in that two people who obviously love each other very much and have so much in common that they actually refer to themselves as the other person, end up spending most of their lives in other relationships trying to make the other lover jealous or hating their choices. Ultimately, Heathcliff's desire for revenge was hard for me to understand because I suppose I have never loved anyone enough to go that far. And the end was especially tragic because he actually begged Cathy's ghost to haunt him for the rest of his life: &quot;...drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this dark alone where I cannot find you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the story of the impossible love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. Wuthering Heights is the name of the spacious dwelling of the family, located on the desolate moorlands of England. After the death of Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff finds himself constantly humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley. When Heathcliff assumes wrongfully that his ever growing love for Catherine is unanswered he sees no reason to stay and leaves the moorlands in search of better luck. Returning years later as a wealthy man he sees an opportunity to get revenge on his stepbrother, but neglects the intolerable pain he causes to his one an only love. Caught in a spiral of vengeance Heathcliff ruins everything once dear to him.The sole novel Emily Bront (1818-1848) has written in her short life will undoubtedly continue to stand the test of time. Although I myself am not a big fan of novels that write Romance with a capital, this story has touched me in a way that very few have succeeded in before. The powerful description of the unrecognized energy between the two main characters is simply overwhelming. Although Emily was -in the true spirit of Victorian novelists- clearly not afraid of adding an enormous list of extremities to the character of Heathcliff, this embodiment of boundless revenge and pure fatherly despotism is one of the strongest characters ever created in English literature. The fact that not a lot of people will classify this novel as \\"the greatest love story ever told\\" is most likely due to the never ending grimness of the tale. This darkness is nicely illustrated by the high number of deaths weaved into this family epos. But then again, love is not always as nice as in the movies... or is it?For a real romantic this is truly a book to be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had avoided Wuthering Heights because I thought it was purely a love story and a corny one at that. Pleasantly surprised is a tremendous understatement. This was fantastic. There is no scene - in the book at least - with Heathcliff and Catherine running into each other's arms across the moors. That must have been from a sappy movie version. In fact, there are no scenes like that - no mindless romantic drivel at all. The preface of my copy actually said that the book was not that successful during Bronte's time because the characters were altogether \\"too odiously and abominably pagan to suit the tastes of even the most shameless class of English readers\\" (as stated by the Quarterly Review).It is certainly dark. Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff who, spurned by Catherine, wreaks havoc on the lives of everyone who has ever had anything to do with him, covering three generations. Is it a love story? Well, yes ... sort of. Catherine did passionately love Heathcliff (as he did her) but nothing ever comes of that, at least in the traditional sense. The extent of Wuthering Heights being a love story to me is the inevitable question of \\"If Catherine had married Heathcliff would things have been different?\\" Given the almost demoniacal personality Heathcliff bears throughout the book, I hardly think so.If you have only ever seen the movie, you have only heard half of the story - literally - and that is extremely \\"brightened\\" from the novel's intrinsic dark and spooky overtones. This is one of those books when finished, I found myself wandering around saying, \\"Wow, that was a good book\\". I even waited a few days before starting another."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's literary masterpiece proves a Gothic novel of classic proportions, with characters whose twisted passions etch themselves upon the reader's mind over successive readings. Set in the rugged Yorkshire of her childhood, WUTHERING HEIGHTS depicts a literary canvas of desolate landscape, where Nature ranges from fury in winter storms to indifference to human endeavor. Over the course of three decades we gradually learn the strange personal history between the Earnshaws of WH and the Lintons of Thrushcross Grange. This grimly violent tale of human passion and supernatural revenge reveals the devastating effect of a dark-skinned foundling lad who is adopted into the family of a kind country squire. With this charitable act Mr. Earnshaw unwittingly introduces restless energy and unbridled emotions into the placid neighborhood--ultimately destroying the decaying dynamics of relations between neighbors. Genealogies are rewritten as unleashed jealousy threatens the flow of lives yet unborn.Recounted in extensive flashback sequences by a faithful servant, Nelly Dean, to a recuperating new tenant at the Grange, this twisted story is also taken up by subsequent narrators--since no single character witnesses very event at both houses. Two gentlemen chose to reside in a remote region, to escape wordly distractions, but the arrival of a young, gypsy-like orphan, Heathcliff, proves the catalyst to disrupt their comfortable social decadence. His passion for Cathy, the wild daughter in his new family, would rule him for life--ruining himfor Life itself. Neither teen could live without the other, although she defied her heart; in so doing she destroyed the lives and peace of mind of innocent relatives and neighbors.Pursued by his private demons of despair Heathcliff knows no peace or valid existence apart from her, tormenting everyone in his intense, constricted social sphere. From foundling to Master, his morose moods and vindictive nature throw a pall upon both houses, as he conspires to control that which is not rightuflly his. All because he was denied sanctioned union with Cathy, his soul mate. Sowing a legacy of vice and despair, Heathcliff privately strives for reunion--not closure--with the shade of his other half. Chasing shadows he morbidly controls the destiny of those involved at Wuthering Heights, threatening to engulf even the detached outsider. A Gothic Classic for all ages."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Having had this book as an assignment in college.... I must say the years have given me a deeper appreciation of it. I really tripped my way through it as a freshman. But now over ten years later I am liking this one more and more!The story centers around poor Heathcliff and his sister/ loved one, Catherine. Heathcliff has lived a life of struggle and woe. He has been disadvantaged and mistreated. Even when he is saved by Catherine's father and brought to live with them he is still, disadvantaged. He is tortured by Hindley, Catherine's brother and made to live a life of pain and anguish.When Catherine leaves home and marries Edgar Linton. Heathcliff become even more tortured as the person he loves is taken from him.This story is one filled with regret, longing and revenge. We see Emily Bronte's excellent rendering of the corruptness of human nature... and in Heathcliff we can see a human going to the depths of depravity and hatred. The scarey thing is that we can... if we look hard enough see a little of ourselves in him too.The novel is dark and foreboding, just like the windswept moors it takes place on. The mood is expertly rendered by this genius author.When you read it allow yourself to be swept away by it's darkness and get caught up in the atmosphere.That was the draw for me and I'm sure you'll will feel it too.Excellent Book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the classical novel dealing with undying love and loss. Set on the moors of mid-nineteenth century England it tells the story of a love between the orphan boy Heathcliffe and Katherine. Katherine and Heathcliffe fall madly in love with each other, but there love is not to be as both end up marrying other people. However, their love for each other continues even after their marriages and after their deaths. This is a love that cannot be stopped by death and endures forever.In Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte wrote of one the classic novels of the nineteenth century. Her characters are well done and the story moves along at a pace that draws in the reader and won't let go. The story is told through the eyes of Katherine and Heathcliffe's nanny, Mrs. Dean, as she tells the story to man who has rented out part of Heathcliffe's property. Mrs. Dean's perspective is always humorous and one almost wonders how much of it has been changed to cover over her own role in the events. It is a testimony to her characters that by the end of the book you will end up hating some of the characters. I personally could not stand, Isabell's son Linton - he was whiny, selfish, pain in the a*s and I was routing for Hareton to beat up him up.The only slight problem with this book is it was written in the old style popular during the nineteenth century - at times this makes the reading some what ponderous. In particular, Joseph's dialogue is a labor and in order to understand it I had to almost read it out loud.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful story about two people who love each other so much that nothing can stop their passion. It is a story as old as time and that will endure until the end of time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not to be hyperbolic, but Wuthering Heights is one of the most well known and critically acclaimed novels in the English language, and there is precious little that I can add to the volumes already written on it. It is the story of two British households inhabiting the wilds of the Yorkshire moors, and illuminates the destructive undercurrents that come to uproot and ultimately destroy both clans. At the center of the tale stand the headstrong Catherine Earnshaw and the brooding Heathcliff, one of the most celebrated romantic pairings in world literature. Treated abominably in his youth at the hands of both households and having lost his love to another man, Heathcliff descends into a horrifying abyss of brutality and revenge still harrowing to encounter nearly two centuries after publication. Although the novel progresses at a leisurely pace compared to modern works, it presents the most complete and thrilling portrait of passion ever set forth in the English language. Passion is not a synonym for love in Wuthering Heights-it is an unbridled conflagration consuming all rationality and rendering its victims ravenous beasts, terrifying and magnificent in their hunger. When Catherine declares that her soul will roam the moors forever after her death, even the most confirmed atheist will find himself believing her- passion is such a billowing force in Wuthering Heights that the human body is convincingly rendered a prison of something altogether greater. At the same time, the primordial forces the book presents never become exhausting, contained as they are within a highly unique narrative framework channeling them through characters secondary to the main line of action. For those patient and courageous enough to immerse themselves in its richly textured reality, Wuthering Heights presents a world boarding on the mythic, and it comes highly recommended to the imaginative reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps it's the winsome imagery, perhaps the profoundly real characters one switches between loving and hating, or maybe even the dry humor that is the style of the British, but Wuthering Heights is my all time favorite book. How can words possibly do it justice...the only way to surely judge it is by reading it. Never before have I been so moved by a story; it might be Heathcliff's overflowing love for Catherine that drives him mad yet, ingenious in his revenge, or Cathy's shallow duty to society that denies her the power to be true to herself (I believe the main point of this novel is to not deny your feelings; go with what you feel rather than what should be), but I always find myself reading it on days I need to be cheered up or am really lusting after a good book. If one's not paying attention, you know, one of those days where you just read to take your mind off of something, it can get rather dull and confusing (the diction isn't as simple as say...Ethan Frome), but if you're concentrating, Bronte's words are so amazingly beautiful, it's hard to put it down. When read aloud it sounds like Shakespeare, and I like Emily's work a lot more than Charlotte's, for some reason. Gothic literature is so peculiar and wonderful: a class of it's own, and she really masters it. At the same time she avoids stereotypes and entertaining happenings (the spectre that appears to the somewhat insecure Lockwood early on foretells the chilling story, while at the same time hinting there is something deeply wrong about Wuthering Heights that needs to be corrected), actually writing the book with a purpose behind it. All the characters have very cool qualities about them; all have the potential to be irritating, but hey, we're all human. By imperfecting her people she has perfected the novel, and I'm so thankful I've had the privilege to read such a piece of art. This book forever remains with me; it's a part of me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm actually 17, not 13, but I don't have a credit card so I can't submit normally...Anyways, this is my review:To be perfectly honest, I found this novel to be very overrated. I didn't enjoy this book at all, and to be honest, I don't really understand why it has been referred to as a &quot;classic&quot; when it has, at best, a flimsy plot and several of the characters are little more than one-dimensional stereotypes, not unlike characters in a modern-day soap opera.I'll admit, it does have it's strong points at times, such as the profound symbolism used throughout the book and the imaginative descriptions of moments such as Mr. Lockwoods dream about the late Catherine, but personally, I found it to be overly melodramatic, and at times, tedious. I was glad when I finally finished reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm convinced that this book is considered a &quot;classic&quot;because people are sheep and know they're supposed to think it is.

To be truthful, it was such a chore to read that I could not bring myself to finish it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I started reading this book as part of my catch-up-with-the-classics campaign. And it was supposed to be full of smoldering passion, etc., etc. I read on and on and on - nothing. Did I miss something, I don't think so. Up until now, I could have said I've never met a book I didn't like. The best I can say - I didn't find it offensive. Just dull beyond belief. Read Dickens if you want to see an author go on and on not losing your interest and actually making a point.

Yet, we must read it if we are in an English Literature survey course.It is ponderous going... a classic of dreary proportions, encumbered by a depressing plot, set in dismal surroundings and peopled by dysfunctional characters.However, many other readers, many teachers and professors, many literature critics, genuinely love this book.- Perhaps it appeals to their current mood, or it speaks to having shared, in some way, the experience of one or another of the characters?- Perhaps they have loved long and deeply and found their love unfulfilled? Then Heathcliff speaks to their hearts.- Perhaps they have moved beyond a deeply felt love, for reasons that they cannot fully express or understand, all the while, still keeping deep in some hidden recess of their psyche, that love that will remain first or best or purest? We can see, then, why that reader might be drawn to identify with Cathy.A sad aspect of the book, however, is that it seems so hopeless, so dark, so fatalistic, so depressing. An over identification with these characters might have an adverse effect on a susceptible reader.The reality is, if you are more or less happy in who you are and who the other beloved people in your life may be, then you will probably find very few connecting points with these benighted main characters. If so, I will offer you this hint......Watch the DVD of Larry Olivier and Merle Oberon, dear student, before you read. They play fast and loose with the plot, so you still have to read the book to ace your test or write your essay. But at least you will have some visual hints of beauty to keep in mind as you labor with this challenging novel.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When my English teacher assigned this piece of Gothic literature instead of the prescribed novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" my curiosity was piqued. Though I had questioned her taste in literature throughout the year, I felt that this novel would be her redeeming point, the thing that would bring her class together.I couldn't have been more mistaken.Wuthering Heights is the story of a man who rents a small mansion from another man, and decides to pay his landlord a visit. Or so it seems. What the novel truly is can only be decribed as a farce on human emotion. It follows the passionate, and often violent, semi-romance between Catherine Earnshaw and her adopted brother Heathcliff. Bronte's poetic language eased the physical reading of the novel, but shrouded the actual plot in deeper mystery and chaos than it had managed to do itself.A novel filled with one amazing plot twist is intriguing; one with several shockers is unexpected. Wuthering Heights, however, conatins more curves and unexpected turns than a New Orleans back-road. This would keep the reader alert and willing to continue . . . if the characters were not blatantly predictible, and completely imhuman. The love-struck heroine/antagonist Catherine Earnshaw declares at one point that \\"Nelly, I am Heathcliff!\\" While intended to be a moving statement, modern psychology student would be more likely to call it stage one acute paranoia. Indeed, this particular educational slave had to struggle through only six chapters of poorly created characters, morose settings, and a plot that seemed more thrown-together than created, before literally guessing his/her way to passing every exam.Back to Ms. Bronte's plot devices. This novel is almost like watching a child play with dolls while talking aloud. Listen to your young daughters; \\"Suzie came home, and did this.\\" A thoughtful pause will follow, and then something else will hapen to Suzie. Then something else. Whatever comes to mind will happen, regardless of whether it makes good storytelling or not. The novel takes the same approach, with a plotline that could only be deemed a line in Lovecraftian geometry.All in all, Wuthering Heights demonstrates fluid and powerful use of the English language . . . but isn't that the purpose of poetry? With predictably unpredictable characters, stale settings, and a plotline that almost refuses to exist, Wuthering Heights could be summed up only in the words of another English teacher: \\"It's General Hospital with an English accent! She's making you read that!?\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is an incredibly hard to read book since it is written in old-English.

I have just a few seconds ago finished this book and I am completely speechless...but not with admiration.Yes,PERHAPS Emily Bronte might have written this well but EVERY other aspect of this books is extremely flawed. Good literature it may be to some but good characters, morals, story it is most certainly not. I completely 100% agree with a reviewer who wrote that she hated Heathcliff being described as some alpha male. Reader, believe me, he is the farthest thing from it. How can all these people talk about WH as being a love story? Some call it Powerful Love, Passionate Love, Strongest Love that Could Ever Exist, etc etc. Believe me when I say Heathcliff has ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE for Catherine. Nor she for him. All of it is just a matter of obsession. Their \\"attachment\\" to each other is purely selfish. This book has not ONE admirable character in it. All are either foolish or wicked. Heathcliff is nothing good and honest but obsession, jealousy, cruelty, baseness, dishonesty, and selfishness are the elements of his character as well as Catherine's I might add. Perhaps if Emily Bronte would have brought out all the folly of the characters and spoken of their error it would have had some merit. But the book starts off in bad and till the end no one grows or improves their moral characters. If the wickedness of a person can only be erased by extinguishing the the person himself what moral is there to be learned at all? I had not the slightest big of emotion except relief when I finished this. When I read a book I feel so engrossed in it, almost as if I know every character and am part of their world. HA!

I agree completely with the review by Monika on 1/25/04. The characters are weakly written so that I did not feel attachment to or pity for any of them, and their actions did not make much sense."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What an amazing book to be written by a 20-year-old woman. She was ahead of her time.I didn't know whether to like the characters or not: Heathcliff was such a jerk in so many ways and Cathy was such a wench.I enjoyed the second half of the novel, however, with the drama of their children.Still can't compare with &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; -- which gets 5 stars in my book. :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is, frankly, a disaster of a novel. Examining it from a technical point of view, the narration is stilted and poor, the characters are flat, the writing is childish, and it's much too bloated. The entire story could have been summed up into about forty pages or less, and I think it would have been more \\"passionate\\" and surely much more believable if Emily Bront had written the book in third person, not first person.Mr. Lockwood begins narrating the story, which is perfectly fine. I'd thought it would be a normal first-person narrative, until I discovered that the true narrator is Nelly Dean. In everyday speech, or even in telling a lengthy story (as Nelly is), no one actually speaks like they're writing a book (\\"'Yes,' she said, looking at me.\\"). People speak like, well, people. They stammer and stumble and interrupt themselves, especially when they're trying to narrate a story. Now, this sort of stilted narration is tolerable for a certain period of time--- the real issue I have with this book is that each and every character has the same style of speech. Each of these flat, poorly developed characters speak and narrate in the exact same way--- except for Joseph and the other uneducated characters, whose rare bouts of dialogue are generally incomprehensible.Heathcliff is supposedly the main character, but he is anything but a hero...although I do admit he is the most human. That doesn't say much, however. I really can't imagine any of the characters being portrayed as heroes. And the ancillary 'narrator,' Mr. Lockwood, is nothing but a stand-in for Nelly Dean. Of all the characters, he is the flattest, and he seems to have very little purpose in the story.To top all that off, the story isn't nearly as \\"amazing\\" as it's made out to be. It is advertised as revealing some of the \\"terrible truths about men and women,\\" but the characters are so unrealistic and childish that I can't even think of them as being true men and women. 95% of them fail to act their ages, by the way. The book is about thwarted love, yes, I understand. But the passion is just as believable as the characters are, and there is a disturbing lack of justice in the story. The whole book screams, \\"Who cares?!\\"Overall, I don't recommend Wuthering Heights to anyone, even though it is hailed (for whatever reason) as being a work of searing beauty and one of the most wonderful classics today. It is one of the worst books I have ever read, technically and metaphorically and creatively speaking. But who knows--- you may enjoy it.[EDIT: This review expresses my opinion about this book...my opinion only, and nothing more. I don't think it's mature for people to make illogical judgments (for instance, \\"people who thought Wuthering Heights was badly written aren't such great writers themselves\\") about others simply because they do not agree with them about a book. Everyone is entitled his/her own opinion, and therefore, no opinion is right or wrong.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Letters formed, words flowed, as Emily Bront moved the ink across the pages. In 1847, around the age of 28, Emily saw the culmination of her writing, Wuthering Heights, published. Emily also heard it bashed, criticized, and spoken of as worthless in her life time. As the year 1848 rolled around Emily perished from the earth. We do not Emily's personal opinion of her book when she died, but her sister, Charlotte Bront, around 1850, wrote an introduction to Wuthering Heights. It was then that the book burrowed its way into the hearts of society. Since then some have admired Emily Bront's intricacy of characters and format of plot, while others still hold to the idea that the book is morbid.Set in 1801, the story travels back in time to the beginning of Heathcliffs entrance into Wuthering Heights, it then once more progresses, ending in 1802. Emily Bront's novel, Wuthering Heights, weaves the lives of Catharine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Mrs. Nelly Dean, for the bulk of the novel, is relating their lives to Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange (which is owned by Heathcliff, who lives at Wuthering Heights when Mr. Lockwood arrives). Intertwined with other impressionable characters Catharine and Heathcliff's lives are poured out. Catharine, a stubborn, saucy, selfish girl, grows up with her parents, her brother Hindly, and Heathcliff - a young starving gypsy boy brought home to Wuthering Heights by Mr. Earnshaw to live with the family. Mistreated and degraded by Hindly and scorned throughout life by all, save Mr. Earnshaw and for the most part Catharine, Heathcliff grows bitter and vengeful. As time progresses and Heathcliff's bitterness thickens his love, his life, his Catharine, dies. She dies married to another man and giving her last breath baring her husbands child. All that Heathcliff then feels is left, is to live sadistically and desperately grieved among the ashes of his life.Wuthering Heights depicts love, loss, hurt, dread, selfishness, brutality, vengeance, and in a strange way a restoration of peace. As one reads the tale, one is aghast at the behavior of the characters' and nauseated by the plot. Yet, one is intrigued by the intricately woven details and structure of the novel.The novels strength is its style; personable characters that are intermingled with larger then life characters; and its tangible setting on the moors of England laced with a supernatural essence. Emily Bront captures the Romanticism ideation of the 19th century in such a way that one gets pulled into the era, into the lives of those at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Regardless of the well written tale and excellent method of describing the mind set of those in the 19th century, having this idea of the supernatural intermingled with the real; the novels weakness is loud spoken. The characters of the novel are insufferable, and the plot dark and selfish. Leaving one sick to the stomach and ones mind plagued by terrible images after reading certain portions.Through the strengths and weaknesses of the novel a lesson is brought forth. If one lets selfish ambition and revenge rule their lives, they shall live a sad desperate life among ashes. Instead of a pleasant life, by forgiving and moving towards reconciliation and freedom from the chains of abuse. It teaches that each person has a choice; to do good and bring happiness to themselves and others, or to do evil and bring pain and suffering upon themselves and others. Though the novel in totality impresses this upon its readers and concludes this in the end, I feel there are other ways of learning this lesson.I can not recommend the book; for although the conclusion brings about a lesson reaching that lesson is inner torture. I was excited to read Wuthering Heights for the title intrigues. Now that I have finished the novel I am even more excited to let it alone, to let it die among the ashes.I rate this book with one star because it is well written, not for its content."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"These books should still be required reading. HOW AWESOME and timeless.Thank you"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I believe Wuthering Heights to be just an average book hardly capable of any noteriety. The book seems to be the same old story of a vengeful man who takes his anger and hate out on other people in a useless effort to please himself. This deep inner hatred results from the untimely death of Heathcliff's lifetime love, Catherine. The reason I gave this book a three was because it was so difficult to follow. Bronte used the same names and the same situations over and over and I could never understand who she was talking about. The theme of Man vs Man was overly developed with the continuing acts of hatred from Heathcliff. I reccomend you read this book if you want to avenge something or you withold a deep hatred for someone. EMILY SMITH"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a strange ,but powerful book. Revenge is most likely the dominent theme in the second half of the book. Even though Heathcliff abandons his plan for vengence. There is no traditional happy ending for the principal characters in the book. It was also brought out that it was a spiritual love rather than a physical one the binds Heathcliff and Cahterine together. There is also a theory of crime and punishment. All the characters sin in some way and are punished, with the exception of cathy and Hareton. Another would be conflict between good and evil. The difference between the feeling that Catherine has for Heathcliff andthe one she has for Edgar is that she responds to Edgar only on the more superficial and shallow level. She seems aware that this love is far more important than the civilized and wordly advantages that Edgar offers. Despite this she goes against her natural instinct and marries him anyways. This action turns the good in Heathcliff to evil, taking revenge on everyone except Cahterine. This tears her up and her only option that she looks for is death. After many years he finds his revenge dying away and prepares himself for death and reuniting with the spirit of Catherine soon after. Love is the only element that remains constant. Everything else withers away. It boils down to nothing on earth matters ,but when we are dead and merge with the Almighty Being then shall we see our greatest satisfaction. The power of good is stronger than the power of evil and will eventually prevail."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read Wuthering Heights in my 8th Grade English Class last year, and I thought that the book was brilliant!

This, in my opinion, is far from the truth. It is a classic book and there is certainly a great deal of passion in it, but it is about a great deal more than just the love of these two charachters. It is also about the wild moors and the people they produces, about how evil propagates itself and how ultimately a little bit of compassion can overcome years of hatred and mistrust.

But, instead of whining about it Heathcliff does something about it, thereby makeing life miserable for everyone (including himself) but by doing so keeps his love alive, instead of just moving on.

The more I read the more I despised them, the more I didn't really care what kind of havoc they wrecked on each other or their relationship. Their relationship is the epitome of codependency and somehow this is supposed to be regarded as one of the great love stories of our time. How masochistic are we?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The achievement of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne is an unprecedented phenomenon in English literature. I've always thought of what lessons could modern parents learn from the raising of the Bronte sisters, in years when education was not a recognized priority in women's life, and yet no girls of the Bronte family was left behind. Amazing, wasn't it?It is unnatural to review this book without comparing it to Jane Eyre, another masterpiece of the Bronte sisters. I tend to put both of the two book in high rank, regardless of critiques from different directions. Jane Eyre is admirable for the ambition that is high but not wild, the emotion that is heated but not burned, the action that is courageous but not aggressive, and the totality of natural elegance and inner nobality. While Wuthering Heights is the opposite to the extreme. In WH, the ambition is wild but not high, the emotion is burned before it get's comfortably heated, and the action is often violently aggressive yet not courageous. The boundaries of humanity is ignored, the nobality is not admired or even hated, and the anger is allowed to vent at any cost.Said that, it is a great worth to read for the craftsman of the storyline and the superior language skills. It depicts deviated, obsessive, violent, and destructive personalities that need psychiatric help in my opinion. If it is just for the sake of reading a good novel, I would give WH and JE the same score. However, due to the fact one can not realistically seperate the entertaining effect from educating effect of any literal work, I would like to save the highest score for the truely and entirely best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Nowadays, if we want a good edition of this strangest and strongest of British novels, deeply haunting and intensely poetical in its rather dark and eerie otherness, we have a variety of options, both text-oriented editions or context-oriented (\\"study\\") ones.To name them all (see my overall review on the Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn)): Oxford World's Classics (Patsy Stoneman), Penguin Classics (Pauline Nestor), Oneworld Classics, among the text-oriented ones;Longman Cultural (Alison Booth), Broadview Press (Beth Newman), Norton Critical Third or Fourth ((Sale)/Dunn) among the context-oriented ones.But when it comes to choose a good-looking hardcover volume, it turns out to be an impossible task to get the right text with an adequate annotation (it seems as if nobody cared for it!).Oxford's World's Classics Special Centennial pocket hardcover issue, now very hard to come by, is a most lovable volume and features the Clarendon reference text, but we add a rather unperceptive and dull Introduction to an absolute absence of notes to get as a result a perfectly useless edition.Barnes & Noble is a really nice hardcover, together with a good Introduction (Daphne Merkin) and a very good annotation (Tatiana Holway), but theirs, while a reliable and well-known text (Haworth Edition, 1900), is a 1850 second edition text, that is to say, Charlotte's highly tampered-with posthumous edition, further disfigured at the hands of the Publisher. Many people think -as I do- that thistext-form is a no-go.Now we come to the Franklin Mint 1979 edition (and its version for Oxford University). It's a very beautiful hardcover volume, leatherette on boards that really looks at least like bonded leather, with all edges gold-gilt, with an excellent125 gram per square meter almost opaque paper (without mineral loading);an excellent quality two-color printing with 11/14 pt Linotype Garamond type and ornate chapter initials. It features the beautiful if not daring Alan Reingold five double-page lithographs with its photographic-like impact...And then what? The text -forgetting for a moment Clarendon and its derivatives-is a very good 1847 first edition text (in the line of SCHORER's, Moser's and Daiches's editions), and it features -for the first time in the novel history- a full and right footnote glossing of the dialectal tirades.Any misgivings? O...yes! Two little ones:a) the Charlotte prefaces should come at the end of the novel rather than at the beginning, not to condition our reading, andb) there is no modern good introduction to the novel (and there were by then a great deal many very good to excellent ones from where to choose); and a very big one:c) the absence of any note whatsoever other than the dialect glosses.Now, it's up to you to choose (and, should you go for this, do a little looking around to get the best preserved copy within your budget).Within its constraints, it's a very nice book and an interesting buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How odd that Amazon does not consolidate the comments on the various editions of this book from different publishers.I read this book out of a certain sense of obligation -- I'd been reading other 19th century English literature and, with some trepidation, picked up Wuthering Heights to complete the set. The book was wonderful, with fully developed if sometimes quixotic characters, and rapid and often unexpected plot twists. The prose is denser than, say, Jane Austen, but not as bad as the stereotypical gothic novel. The main character, Heathcliff, is famously attractive to women but, as a male reader, I thought he was a thoroughly bad egg. Worthy of discussion, though, especially with women who have read it and are likely to have a different opinion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though this story overall had a dark essence to it, I believe that an unrelenting passion was shared between Catherine and Heathcliff. Of course, in my view, both characters are selfish and share a fury in great magnitudes. But then again, these similar characteristics are what make them such a match made in heaven...or more accurately, a match made in hell. Even with the hatred, I still believe this is a great love story. Love can be shrouded in varying shades, from happy gay tones to the more darkening hues.The greatest burst of sunshine in this dreary novel would probably come fron Nelly Dean, who was practically the only character with a head on her shoulders. Just the fact that she was able to serve with such a crazed family for so long and come out sane in the end is and indication of her strong, noble personality.In this story, the line between hatred and love is precariously thin."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte wrote a novel that is both rough and sweet at the same time. This novel is fantastic in its voice. Mostly it is told through the eyes of Nelly Dean, housekeeper/protector of Catherine/busybody who is bold, blunt and strong. The novel is very much linear making it an easy read. Helpfully, in the front of this edition there is a family tree which will aide the reader immensely, because not only are there a lot of characters, there are many with the same name (though different ages). The novel itself is beautiful in its portrayal of everything; from the moors to even Heathcliff (though spiteful and mean as he is), Bronte created a world that truly exists for the reader. Be warned: this is not a world of balls and romantic marriage proposals as Austen, but rather base life as was most likely lived, isolated on the moors.What really I loved about this book was perhaps what came before and after the actual contents. Bronte and her two sisters originally came out with their books within a year of each other under the guise of being three male brothers Ellis, Acton and Currer Bell. In this particular edition, there is a \\"Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\" written by Charlotte Bronte after her sister's passing and on the commencement of new printings of their novels. This edition also includes and Editor's Preface by Charlotte. Commentary from E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and a review by George Henry Lewes printed in 1850 come at the end and are very interesting, just to see how two famous authors and one critic looked at the book. These \\"bonus pages\\" made Emily (Ellis) come to life for me.Read this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been trying to read more classic literature recently. And Wuthering Heights was really worthwhile. Yet I find myself almost at a loss for words in describing this book.

It creates a \\"feeling\\" that remains with you long after bedtime!The main characters Heathcliff and Catherine are larger than life somehow. How do you describe their dark and stormy love? It is a deep love that descends into obsession, despair, and revenge. Typical of gothic literature, the brooding and haunting landscape of the moors somehow seeps into the characters.

Bronte's superb authorship allows readers of all backgrounds and of all generations to feel the characters, experience the novel's moods and tones, and appreciate the art of literature. If you absolutely despise reading, you will learn to love it after reading this novel. The novel's themes of passion, hate, love, loss, revenge, and individuality are something we can all relate to and evoke powerful emotions from within any reader. Every educated person should read this...It truly deserves its place among the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Annotation: \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about Heathcliff, an orphan, who is raised by Mr. Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.Author Bio: Emily Bront was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, in the north of England. Her mother died in 1821. Between the years 1824 and 1825 Emily attended the school at Cowan Bridge with Charlotte, and then was educated at home. Her first novel, Wuthering Heights (1847), a story-within-a-story, did not gain immediate success, but it has acclaimed later fame as one of the most intense novels written in the English language. Emily Bront died of tuberculosis in the late 1848. She had caught cold at her brother Branwell's funeral in September. After the appearance of Wuthering Heights, some skeptics thought that the book was written by Branwell, on the grounds that no woman from such circumscribed life, could have written such passionate story. After her sisters' deaths, Charlotte edited a second edition of their novels, with prefatory commentary aimed at correcting what she saw as the reviewers' misunderstanding of Wuthering Heights. The complex time scheme of the novel had been taken as evidence by the critics, that Emily had not achieved full formal control over her narrative materials.Evaluation: Hate is proven to be weaker than love when it comes to Heathcliff. Heathcliff and Catherine are meant to be together. Since the time when they were children they loved one another. Many people tried to keep them apart and they succeeded at times, but their love for one another always shined through. Heathcliff went through a period where he felt that getting even would mend what everyone put him through, but the last part of his revenge remained undone and there was finally some sort of happiness. Love finally outweighed hate creating the happiness between Cathy and Hareton, and Heathcliff and Catherine. It is truly better to love than it is to hate.Overall, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is extremely enjoyable. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys gothic elements incorporated with romance and drama. There are so many themes explored. One thing happens after another, making you want to keep reading and find out what happens next. I liked the fact that love overpowered hate at the end. Jealousy, love, hatred, and tragedy are all mixed together in \\"Wuthering Heights\\", leaving you with a novel that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must admit I did the unthinkable. I watched the epic 1939 version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; before reading the book. The book portrays Heathcliff as a brash, violent man unlike the movie, where he is brash, but his heart is still carrying a torch for Cathy. I never knew that the two main characters had children, and reading about the deep contempt Heathcliff had for Linton, his son, I was appalled. Nevertheless, I loved reading the book. The tragic love borders many other great novels written for the period, and I would suggest anyone who loves two lovers trying to deny the feelings between one another, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights has very real, lively and more animated characters contrary to Austen and the like; and is told in a distinctive narrative form. I think the particular narrative style has been chosen because she wrote the book under a male pen-name.The story is very realistic, perhaps livelier than real life stories, but is very disturbing; mainly because of the seemingly morbid presence of Heathclif. Though his character can be attributed to his disappointing childhood experiences, there is still a hint of that 'savage' instinct (as is often stated) which provokes him to be brutal to the core.Catherine represents a typical girl caught in between 'real love' and 'wealthy love', finally chosing the latter since she fears she'd have to live an extremely poverty-stricken life if she chooses the former.A question that arose in my mind while reading it is the unnatural importance given to a servant like Nelly, who seems to have witnessed each and every scene in the novel.Reading the novel is an experience in its own; and,the novel, I'm sure is one of the best novels of its kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am indeed lost for words...a book of unprecedented power and imaginative scope."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the story of two families in the Yorkshire Moors and how they are all but destroyed by the evil Heathcliff, who was brought to Wuthering Heights as an orphan by old Mr. Earnshaw.It is in many ways a paradox: It is set in a rustic and tranquil environment and in many parts dwells on a picturesque domestic environment, which I believe, would do the hearts of the best of us good.And yet, that is in itself scarred by a regime of hideous terror and cruelty brought on by Heathcliff.From the beginning of the book, we see in the dream of the city fop, Lockwood, how the latter violently rubs the wrist of the phantom Cathy through a broken windowpane. This sets the mood for deed after deed of cruelty and violence.Hence the key word of the novel is paradox. Between the blissful and violent, the homely and the horrific, between the evil of Heathcliff and the goodness of Nelly Dean who muses of the former: \\"\\"Is he a ghoul or a vampire. I had read of such hideous, incarnate demons'.His cruel treatment of Isabella and the second Catherine, is something that would revolt all descent human beings, and cause us to hate Heathcliff.Even Shakespeare's Macbeth shows some conscience, some guilt about his evil actions, as does Lady Macbeth, but Heathcliff never. No plea, nothing at all, can cause him to show the mildest mercy.If he had, but a shred of decency, he would have at least treated the younger Catherine with compassion as this was the daughter of the great love of his life.Heathcliff is a usurper, who mistreats the rightful heirs to Wuthering heights and Thrushcross Grange, Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy Linton II.The other evil folk in the novel, Heathcliff's son, the degenerate Linton Heathcliff and the spiteful manservant Joseph, are but pale shadows of the demonic Heathcliff.The novel focuses on the intense passionate connection (for one could not call such a thing love) between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and the rage of Heathcliff before and after her death, that he could not be untied with her.Wuthering Heights was written in 1847, at a time when the rustic tranquility and wellbeing of the England where Emily Bronte lived, was being shattered by the twin forces of the Industrial Revolution and mercenary profit, and the radical and amoral revolutionary ideologies which would be chartered in The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Perhaps one can see a parallel between the way in which the peaceful routine was being destroyed by both mercantile capitalism and by violent revolutionary socialism , and the way in which the peaceful and tranquil houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights where marred by the diabolical monstrosity of Heathcliff.A key character in the novel is the nurse Nelly Dean, a wonderful woman who shows strength and goodness, throughout in the face of all the evil and cruelty in the saga.She is not much older than Hindley and the first Catherine and I would imagine she is about 16 years old when old Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to Wuthering Heights, and about 46 therefore, at the time of Heathcliff's death and the redemption of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The second Cathy, while showing a fierce spirit, is a fundamentally better person than her mother, both beautiful and good.Heathcliff and Catherine I are the anti-heroes of the story and Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy II, the heroes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is really fascinating. It's not very exciting, but not boring at all. It takes you to another world( well, at least for me because I'm living in a dull german village with not even a movie theater)and another time, where life wasn't so simple. I'm 13 years old and I've read this book in my spare time. I've read it in German but I'm going to read it in English too. One of my faves, everybody who's interested in a little bit confusing family stories should read it.BYE, Flowerpowertati"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A frame story that reveals the lives of a small cast of characters living on the English moors. Catherine Earnshaw is the wildly passionate offspring of the master of Wuthering Heights and his wife. Her father brings home a gypsy looking boy from a trip to Liverpool and this little \\"silent heathen\\" is integrated into the family. Catherine and Heathcliff, as the gypsy comes to be named, become inseperable and untamable. However there is another family in this picture who lives in the much friendlier and luxurious house of Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is wounded while sneaking about the Grange with Heathcliff and his welcomed into Thrushcross Grange to be cared for until she heals. Edgar Linton who is Catherines age and will inherit the Grange upon his parents death takes to Cathy and she to him. But Edgar does not feed Catherine's wild nature and is for all intensive purposes a milksop. Catherine returns to the Heights far more mannered and tamed than when she left and Heathcliff is furious that she no longer cares to share in his savageness. Some time passes and Edgar asks Cathy to marry him, she cries to the lady keeper of the house that she wants to marry Heathcliff but she will lose all of her status as upper class if she does. Heathcliff overhears and in a rage of pain leaves and we do not see him again for three years. When he returns Catherine is married and living at the Grange. Heathcliff has become wealthy but is still the cruel savage from his youth and is bent on revenging himself upon all those who wronged him when he was the title-less gypsy boy. (I'm leaving out some important bits and pieces but for the most part the storyline is intact) The ending is a secret known only by those who choose to take the journey across the moors to Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange to hear Ellen tell the story. I will tell this: Both Catherine and Heathcliff beget children and death figures big in the plot. This novel contains unbridled passion, heinous revenges, festering anger, unfathomable pain, and the intensity of a storm on the moors. Read the whole book before passing ANY judgement. Bravo Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Oh, where to begin? Yes, some people complain about the melodramatic (some even say soap-operatic) quality of this book, but it is simply wonderful. It's hard to find a book about the dark side of love, and this book (which offered, perhaps, the first \\"modern\\" character in Heathcliff) has the dark side of love in spades. The story is centered around the Earnshaw and Linton families, who occupy the Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange estates, respectively. While it would give away many important and poignant moments to go more in-depth, rest assured that there is betrayal, violence, and passion. The character of Heathcliff may very well be the best character in literature (in my opinion, at least). His inner conflict between vengeance and love is tragically human, and the fact that he knows that he is doing the wrong thing but cannot stop his drive for vengeance makes him that much more human. This book is excellent. Maybe the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"but I did not really enjoy it. I understand why it is a classic: Miss Bronte delves into the depths of the human psyche and recounts the agonies of lost love and the despair and cruelty it drives Heathcliff to. She describes the deep bond of love between Cathy and Heathcliff, a bond which is stronger than death and causes as much pain as it does pleasure, and as much agony as comfort. What I cannot understand is how people actually enjoy reading it. I do not mind a lack of action in a book: Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorites and contains far less action than this book. However, Pride and Prejudice was a pleasant read because it had pleasant overtones and a pleasant ending and pleasant characters. This book, however, has nasty overtones, an ending barely passable as neutral, and nasty characters. Most of the main characters were self-centered fiends: Cathy loved her friend more than her husband and made it known to all, Joesph was a foul hypocrite, Linton was a wretched weakling, Hindley a abusive father, Heathcliff an evil fiend, etc. The story itself was an awful tale of lost love leading to a collapse of characer and it's resulting consequences (all bad) on the people in contact with Heathcliff. Why people celebrate this of all love stories is beyond me. Why on earth would people hold up as an example of true love the story of Cathy and Heathcliff? A story which runs as follows: Cathy and Heathcliff are in love. Cathy marries someone else because Heathcliff has a low rank. Heathcliff causes jealousy for Cathy's husband. Cathy dies, and Heathcliff nearly goes insane and spends the rest of his life mercilessly torturing those around him. Someone explain to me why this is held up as a great example of love? Give me Miss Bronte's sister (Charlotte Bronte)'s Jane Eyre any day over this. Jane Eyre is just such a story as should be held up and shown to the world as an example of true love, not Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is an example of love gone horribly wrong, not perfect love. I do not think that it was the author's intent at all to have this lifted up as an example of what love should be like, as many have mistaken her to have done. She was simply showing the power of love: that it has both the power to do both great good and great evil. That is the strength of this book.Overall grade: A"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],x={key:0},M={key:1};function j(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=m("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(t(!0),o(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(f,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",x,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(E,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-7363276f"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/52.md","filePath":"library/52.md"}'),L={name:"library/52.md"},R=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{O as __pageData,R as default};
