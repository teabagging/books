As a grunt in the Americal and 101 Abn, I was always jealous of the guys in the Hueys. I still am, but now have a better appreciation on what they did and the dangers of the job. I liked the diary format that the author used to tell his story. A good read. Buy it."},{"Title":"The War Above the Trees","review":"I am puzzled by the reviews that comment positively on the writing style. I am not bothered by a diary format, but to me the book is extremely wooden. I was not engaged by any of the characters.This may also be picky but it relates to the writing style issue. The author continually gives an acronym, eg. \\"HQ\\" or any of the many others used by the military, then follows it by the full term, eg. headquarters. The convention is to do it the other way. Full name first then use the acronym thereafter. For me this became more and more irritating as time went by. I suppose because it kept interfering with the flow of the book.Furthermore, he would put such words as \\"grunt\\" in quotes and then gives an explanation that this refers to foot soldiers. He does this repeatedly about very basic words that I have trouble believing anyone reading the book would not already know. Again, interfering with the flow of the story.It appears that for some of the people who were in Vietnam during the war, it gives them an appreciation for the courage of the pilots and the many dangers they faced, but I want much more than a remembrance of past events. I want something that puts events in some sort of context and gives meaning, positive or negative or whatever.I imagine it gives a factual account of the events he experienced, but I could find no passion to engage me and no characters that I cared about."},{"Title":"The War Above the Trees","review":"Me being a gunner in Vietnam too it is the real thing don't miss this"},{"Title":"The War Above the Trees","review":"The first part of this book was very well written. but the last half of book took a nose dive."},{"Title":"American Plains Indians","review":"This Osprey book serves as a well-written introduction to the ceremonial and military sides to the culture of the Indian peoples of the Central Plains, c. 1800-1890. Though this is an excellent visual source (like all books in this series) and the author is a well-known scholar of Native American studies, do not buy this book looking for a thorough history of the tribes and their wars-only the last three pages are used to offer the briefest of outlines of the Plains Wars c. 1851-1890.This book would be very good for someone seeking to learn about the various warrior societies of the Plains Indians; these are very well illustrated and the author gives much information on their social roles in their tribes. Many aspects of non-military Indian culture, including the roles of spirituality and women, are also dealt with in surprising detail. There are lots of black-and-white photos of Indian chiefs and warriors, and line drawings throughout. One particularly interesting drawing (if a little morbid to the average modern American reader) is a chart showing how all the various body parts of a buffalo were put to good use by the Indians-as opposed to the contemporary white men, who are well known for their mass slaughters of more meat than they could have ever used.Overall, buy this book if you are looking for a good, solid intro to the material culture and warrior and religious societies of the 19th Century Plains tribes. If you are looking for their history and their more famous leaders, however, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Supremely Satisfying Bathroom Reader","review":"I hate reading...

(It seemed there was a lot of Canadian trivia--interesting for a Canadian but not so much for an American). Hopefully they are taking their time with the next issue to give us material that is more in line with their tradition of great trivia."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Supremely Satisfying Bathroom Reader","review":"I recently received a copy of the book as a gift. This is certainly not the type of book I would buy for myself and reading this volume has not changed that. While mildly amusing and certainly successful in giving me an occasional case of \\"gluteus circulus\\" aka buttcheek ring from prolonged sitting, this SUPREMELY SATISFYING edition failed to win me over as a repeat reader. Not that I found that much fault with this book, and I'm sure it has a great following of readers, I just like my mind enhancement non-fiction reading to be a bit more substantial.I must also point out the flawed editing (or lack thereof) contained here. Typos abound and, while irritating, I can tolerate typos better than I can unsubstantiated material passed down as factual. For example, on page 114 in a short vignette on famous last words, William Bonney (Billy the Kid) is cited. Over a century after his supposed death, there still remains a dispute as to just exactly who lies in Bonney's grave. If we lack conclusive proof that Pat Garrett did in fact, kill Billy the Kid, than how can the publisher say with certainty what his last words were? This is just one example to illustrate that the reader may want to accept the contents with a grain of salt. In fact, the publisher even goes so far as to point out past faux pas' found in previous volumes!As I mentioned, there is a certain degree of amusement to be found here and the publisher did make a good attempt to include a wide variety of subjects. This is the type of reading Cliff Clavin would have loved. There is certainly water cooler (or neighborhood tavern) knowledge to be gleaned here.

Like all the previous editions, I loved this book for the amazing amount of information from every possible sphere of knowledge: from the thoughts of Socrates to the the history of the bra, from the origins of the familiar phrases and words to the secret Hitler's files, etc. The weakest point in all these books is a lack of an index. It is quite difficult to find a specific piece of information since the articles are not arranged in any particular order and the table of contents is done by topic and not in alphabetical order. The task of looking up information is getting even harder if one is not sure what book to look in.

Reading about Woof and his family brought back memories of childhood, as we read through eight adventures about family life adventures with they're struggles, attitudes and good values and of course a typical dog and his 'doggie ways'. The stories open up opportunities to discuss things like God's love, prayer, how to treat others, and share this love with others in terms that children understand(very important for us parents!) Characters Mark and Krissy, Woof and everyone else came alive as we got into the first few paragraphs, and the illustarations vividly portrayed the the spirit of they're adventures.

It is meant to touch on many mathematical ideas, not to go into depth on any one idea. My son read this at age 8, then at 10, and again at 12 - getting something more out of it every time. Many of the ideas intrigued and inspired him to seek out more information on his own, to research and understand more deeply. For that purpose, it deserves the highest rating.I did not give 5 stars because there are some instances where I did find errors, these do not detract from the purpose of the book, but they are annoying to those of us who try to delve deeper. What I consistently found myself doing is researching from the internet and other print resources. But the idea originated from the overview in the book.Many recreational mathematics books are inaccessible to beginners or math phobes. This book allows you to sample many, many ideas without feeling overwhelmed by details you may not understand. If you want details, you go explore the world opened up by the book."},{"Title":"The Joy of Mathematics: Discovering Mathematics All Around You","review":"This is an excellent book that covers many areas of math. Each subject is covered in 1-4 pages making the book very easy to read, and useful to teachers as a resource for enrichment. This book may be too simple or &quot;shallow&quot; for some of the more serious mathematicians, but the fun feeling of the book makes up for it.The book also includes many tie-ins to areas such as science, art, and other fields.Definitely worth reading, a MUST for the library of any middle or high school math teacher."},{"Title":"The Joy of Mathematics: Discovering Mathematics All Around You","review":"This book could have been good if the author had done a careful job of writing the text, and perhaps if the illustrations were original, and above all if the author had understood the material she was writing about. Sadly these are often not the case with this book.Rather, this book gives every sign of being essentially copied from bits of many dozens of other books. All the illustrations appear to be low-quality xerographic copies from other books (clearly used without any permissions).But worst of all, the book is chock full of misstatements, misconceptions, and sentences that don't convey any meaning.This book gives the non-expert reader the impression that he or she is learning something, but a great deal of the time this is just the illusion of learning.I will list a few of the errors and illusory learning that I can readily find:________p. 6: The illustration of the cycloid curve should show it to be in a vertical direction where one arch meets another; instead it is at 45 degrees to the vertical.________p. 7: It is stated that when marbles are released in a cycloid-shaped container, they will reach the bottom at the same time. This phenomenon occurs for a bowl whose cross-section is an *inverted* cycloid, but that is omitted.________p. 13: Both the \\"impossible tribar\\" and \\"Hyzer's optical illusion\\" are NOT mathematically impossible, contrary to what is written. (They can be constructed in 3 dimensions.) Twistors are mentioned but not defined, even in a rough, metaphoric way -- just not at all.________p. 18: It is mentioned that pi cannot be the solution of an algebraic equation with integral coefficients, but there is no discussion in the book of what such an equation is.__________p. 19: Also, it is stated that the probability of two randomly chosen integers' being relatively prime is 6/pi. Not only should the correct number be 6/(pi * pi), but the idea of randomly choosing an integer is left completely undiscussed, although there is no known way to do this.________p. 38: The Platonic solids (aka regular polyhedra) are discussed here, but although they are defined twice, neither definition is correct. (The author neglects to mention that the faces of such a solid must be *regular* polygons.)________p. 45: The Klein bottle is discussed and illustrated here, but there is no mention that a genuine Klein bottle cannot be constructed in ordinary 3-dimensional space. (The familiar model of a Klein bottle depicted here is a self-intersecting version of the real Klein bottle, which does not intersect itself. This is much like the fact that a picture of a knot drawn in the plane must appear as if the knot intersects itself, though it does not do so in space.)________p. 46: The illustration at bottom purports to show what the model of the Klein bottle would look like if it were sliced in half. The halves are erroneously shown as identical, but they should be mirror images of each other.________p. 78: The title of this page is \\"Fractals -- real or imaginary?\\"This is an entirely misguided question that will only confuse the reader. All mathematical concepts are real within mathematics, and do not exist (except as approximations) in the real world.It's a worthwhile topic in the philosophy of mathematics, and could well have been introduced in this book, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with fractals per se.________p. 91: Here the author attempts to describe a model of hyperbolic geometry (in a circular disk) devised by Henri Poincar&eacute;. However, she gets it exactly backwards, saying that objects get smaller as they approach the boundary of the disk.(She may have been well-aware of how this model works, but her prose is at best completely ambiguous.)________p. 96: Here it is stated that it has been proved that knots cannot exist in more than 3 dimensions. Apparently the author is unfamiliar with an extensive and thriving field of higher-dimensional knots. (For example, a sphere can be knotted in 4-dimensional space.)________There are many, many more such gaffes, but I fear I have gone on too long. I just wanted to make it crystal-clear that this book is riddled with erroneous and vacuous statements."},{"Title":"The Joy of Mathematics: Discovering Mathematics All Around You","review":"Sorry to say but this book is a dud.

It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a \\"math tricks\\" book or a \\"popular mathematics\\" presentation substantiated by theory.There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling.

These factors cannot be separated, as at first you have to do more than just look around, but you have to have a beautiful mind of a child and be an intellectualist at the same time, not just to take things for granted, but as a child be curious and ask questions and finally as an intellectualist and mathematician find answers to them.Yet, there is more to it. It is so, as the author popularizes mathematics. She answers the basic questions about role of mathematics in our lives. Most people associate mathematics as calculating especially money, yet in mathematics the theory models or formula are created, and it occurs that they find application in our material world sometimes even centuries afterwards. Let us look at some examples in the book \\"The joy of mathematics\\": - earthquakes and logarithms- connection lies in the method to calculate earthquakes' magnitudes by means of Richter scale, which is logarithmic, - the catenary & the parabolic curves- who takes as an obvious phenomena- the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco- it looks gorgeous, but what it looks like is connected with construction equations, which contribute to the fundamental thing, that it really is invulnerable and cannot be destroyed by the mass itself, as well as additional natural forces. Even Galileo noticed the curve to be parabola, - Thales & the Great Pyramid- Egiptians' calculations of the height of a pyramid were based on shadows and similar triangles, -the Dome of Milan -Gothic plans incorporating the application of geometry and symmetry in architecture, and lots of stuff like that.

Many of the ideas described herein date back to Leonardo da Vinci and beyond. Others are modern. None is claimed to be an original creation of the author; but where else can an amateur go to find such fascination with the myriads of ways our universe is made knowable (somewhat) by the review of these grandest of arithmetic maneuverings?

Themes of bravery, love, cooperation, honesty, and respect are interwined throughout the work, giving readers from diverse backgrounds much to ponder and contemplate regarding human nature and human relationship with the planet. Highwater crafts his story so well that questions arise naturally, and readers are encouraged to think critically about the themes presented in the text. This is an excellent title to include on any upper-level multicultural reading list."},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"As a 6th grade teacher, I first learned of ANPAO through a children's literature course. I was enthralled by the Native American (Blackfoot) culture and how Jamake Highwater used it to weave a tale of love, adventure, and history into one book. This past school year was the 5th time I have shared it with my children. It didn't matter what their reading levels were, they loved it, we shared it, and some, went out and purchased their own copies of it. You know something had an impact when a student, who wasn't necessarily the most proficient reader, relates something in his life to the characater long after the novel was completed. &quot;That's something that Anpao would have done.&quot; I strongly suggest that all teachers of 6th grade reading or social studies, share this novel with their children."},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"Let's start with the bottom line: this is an attempt at a collage of Native American stories united around a single, fictional hero (a hero who isn't found in any ACTUAL Native American myths or stories). I don't think it's all that successful, but it's a very interesting idea. The end, dealing with the coming of the Europeans, is the most original part of the book. I found it the most moving too, for I hope that the peoples of the Americas will live, will return. As an attempt to describe Indian thought, ways, and values, ANPAO has its moments, but I felt that a lot of European (white man) values had got mixed in, a lot of influence from that direction no doubt absorbed by the author over the course of his life.On looking at the reviews on Amazon, I was surprised to find that it is being used as a text or reading assignment in schools. I think that this is a very valuable way to utilize the author's obvious ability, but being \\"slightly beyond\\" school, I had a different reaction on reading it. I bought the book to learn more about some specific Native American culture, but realized on reading it that it was more like a potpourri. Let's imagine a similar, potpourri-type effort to present European values and thought. Can you imagine a hero called \\"Justice\\" or \\"Se&ntilde;or Sacrifice\\" wandering through a mythical Europe on a quest, meeting Thor, Zeus, Don Quixote, King Arthur, and Beowulf ? I don't think such a concoction would do much for me. Should we then accept this book because it's about Native Americans and we want to support their efforts to preserve their cultures and garner more respect for who they are ? I think Native American literature should be judged by the same standard as the rest. No condescension. Momaday, Erlich, Alexie and Silko---top writers by any standard. I'm not sure about ANPAO; it's original, but it has an artificial flavor. As a magical mystery tour of American Indian culture, it could open kids' minds to new ways of thinking and so be very valuable. As purely literature for adults, I have my reservations."},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"Most odysseys and adventures that I've read are very good books. Out of all of these, ANPAO, by Jamake Highwater, stands out. It stands out because of all the magic mixed with facts. I think ANPAO is for people who like historical fiction books mixed with some action. It not only tells about gods and people that the Indians believed in. It also shows plenty of action, like when Anpao meets the goliath turtle that drowns two boys in the desert. I prefer a lot of action in books I read, so ANPAO fits me perfectly. In every chapter, he is either fighting something or facing a severe problem. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading action stories. The book ANPAO is about a young Indian boy named Anpao who wants to marry the chief's beautiful daughter, Ko-ko-mik-e-is. In order to marry her, Anpao must travel to the lodge of the sun and get his scar removed as a sign to Ko-ko-mik-e-is. The reason they can't marry right away is that the sun thinks she belongs to it. On his way to the sun's lodge, Anpao encounters many creatures, such as the evil birds by the lake. At the end of the book, Anpao gets permission to marry Ko-ko-mik-e-is. When he returns to the village, the white settlers invade, and the new couple run off together to get away from the settlers. The character Anpao was believable to me, because before his journey he was a boy who had to learn things about life. Anpao was a normal Indian. At the end of his journey, he was very wise and knew the world very well. Anpao is a believable character to me because people become smarter as they explore more. I enjoyed the use of conflicts in this story, because there were so many. I sometimes could not put this book down, because Anpao was always fighting someone or something. The author made the book easy for me to read because he split it into four different sections. The sections showed the plot of the book in a way that was easy for me to follow. He also used poetry and prayers to show how the Indians felt. Since ANPAO is a historical fiction book packed with action, I highly recommend it. The authour used detailed descriptions when he wrote about the magical creatures. The uses of his poetry and prayers were unique. Anpao's odyssey is one-of-a-kind."},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"The numerous charactors and situations that Anpao, the protagonist, faces give the old Native American beliefs on topics such as the creation story and the settleing of the white man in the new world.

The charactors were written very cleverly wiht the use of personification which brings a deep respect for the animals and the land in the Native American beliefs. Anpao's journey is fantastic and is one that will be memorable for the years to come"},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"This book is an excellent resource for teaching children and adults about Native American culture. Specifically, this book focuses on the philosophy of how Turtle Island children are guided through learning as a circle of experiences. People of a western mind frame can appreciate this book as a collection of traditional stories compiled from several Native American nations woven into a story about one boy's quest to find wisdom and eventually earn the privilege of marrying the object of his desire. Without an understanding of the Medicine Wheel, many crucial events of this book will confuse the western mind. This book is meant to be read more than once in order to grasp the depth of all that it can teach children about gaining wisdom while evolving from children to young adults. This book is best used with middle school students whose age is equivalent to that of Anpao at the beginning of the book. If used in a classroom, it's recommended that the teacher read \\"Seven Arrows\\" by Hyemeyohsts Storm or the \\"Native People Native Ways\\" series by White Deer of Autumn in order to gain an appreciation for the complexities of Anpao as a cultural resource."},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"Anapo, is by far one of the most enthralling books of all time. Each time it is read a new sence of existance and peacefullness fills the reader. There is never a dull moment while Anpao journeys to the sun to ask permission to marry his one true indian princess love, and on the way discovers himself with the help of many of nature's friends, and lessons. All the American Indian legends are mixed together perfectly to make this a story that can be read again and again and passed through generations!"},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"A Native American Adventure Set in peaceful, worry-free Native American village. Anpao by Jamake Highwater tells a story of a young Native American man, who is sent off on a great quest. Lots of methods and beliefs in the Native American culture are expressed in this book. To say that this book doesn&#8217;t have a new idea and isn't intriguing and informative is quite balderdash. In a Native American village, there is a very beautiful girl, whom everyone wants to marry. Her name is Ko-ko-me-kis. One young man, named Anpao, is determined to marry her, and to do so. Ko-ko-me-kis says that she belongs to the Sun her father. She tells Anpao that she will marry him, if he travels to the house of the Sun to be granted permission. For proof that he traveled to the Sun, he must ask the Sun to remove the scar from his face. Anapao sets off on the journey and he meets many obstacles and many challenges on his journey. This story is gripping to the end. The experience to different religious beliefs and descriptions of how the world came to are two reason why I would recommend this book. The views in Native American religion are very different than that of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim beliefs. The animals talk, and the Sun and the Moon are viewed as people. People are half animal, half human, and some people might like the different view on religion. The point of this religion I believe is that everything matters as much as everything else, that everything and everyone has a meaning. Another reason why I would recommend this book is because of the different kind of culture that is talked about. Some of the cultural celebrations, dances, and beliefs of Native Americans are talked about in this book. For example when Anpao did the cultural dance for the night, and when one of the villages Anpao was in started celebrating after they one a war. Some people might like to be aware of other cultures, and this is a good book for someone like that.Although I thought that this was a decent book, some people might disagree with my opinion. This book is confusing because of all of the different time switches and how Anpao has so many different personalities and identities. It is also very slow moving. Anpao's journey is long, and it may be a little too long for some people. He makes many stops at random villages that some people might think are unnecessary. Yet, all of these parts are needed in this story in order to be filled with great thoughts and experiences."},{"Title":"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey","review":"Finding this book, many people were estatic about it. &quot;Read it, you'll love it&quot; was the general feel about Anpao.

Also a center for traditional Japanese printmaking, it was natural that kites and kite-flying would often be depicted on prints. Stevenson, who has spent much time in Asia, treats the intertwined subjects of kites and prints with a historical overview that includes frequent discussions of particular kites and prints. \\"These kites [depicted in a print] must be large: the kite the young men are flying requires two to control the line, with a third looping the line into a basket.\\" Besides depicting ceremonial or recreational kite-flying, prints could also use kites symbolically, as when one artist suggests that confetti falling from a kite could be seeds being scattered over a field by farmers hoping for a good harvest. Such symbolisms indicate the meaningful place held by kites in the culture, almost as if they were religious or ritualistic objects. Stevenson's narrative and analyses for newcomers to the subject or advanced students complemented by colorful prints and details of them, including a number of large fold-outs, brings this somewhat specialized subject to life. With the author's special interest in kites as a part of Asian culture and his many years living in Asia, the subject seems second nature to him. He writes about it both naturally and knowledgeably, as if one were listening to an absorbing lecturer."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"This review relates to the volume -The Song of Roland-,Translated and with an Introduction by Dorothy L. Sayers,Penguin Classics, 1957 (first translation, 1937). 206 pp.There seems little point in giving a work of world literaturea rating of stars as to whether it is better or lesser thansome other work of world literature, even of the same genre.The rating for this review is based on this particularedition and translation.The excellent qualities of this Penguin edition includethe \\"Introduction.\\" Sayers discusses this \\"earliest,the most famous, and the greatest of those Old Frenchepics which are called Songs of Deeds.\\" Her \\"Introduction\\"is divided into the highly enlightening subsections titled:The Poem; The Feudal Picture; Vassalage; Tokens; Chivalry;The Rules of Battle; Nurture and Companionage; Horses andSwords; and The Verse and the Translation. She says thepoem as we have it \\"would appear to have achieved itsfinal shape towards the end of the eleventh century.\\" Butthe events described in the epic took place in 778, and\\"the anonymous poet describes in detail the betrayal andslaughter by Saracens of the rearguard of Charlemagne'sarmy under Roland -- at Rencevaux -- and Charlemagne'sbitter revenge.\\"Perhaps most interesting in the \\"Introduction\\" are Ms.Sayers' character studies. She sees that in Charlemagne,\\"beneath this larger-than-life-size figure, we discernanother: the portrait of the ideal earthly sovereign --just, prudent, magnanimous, and devout.\\" She goesfurther and posits that in the way he is describedin this epic he even seems like an early medieval versionof a \\"constitutional\\" monarch. \\"Beneath all this againis the personal character of Charlemagne -- his statelybearing, his courtesy, his valour and strength, his deepreligious feeling, his friendship for Naimon, his warmaffection for his nephew and the Peers.... He ridesand fights among his barons as the greatest baron ofthem all.\\"Roland, on the other hand, in Ms. Sayers' view, has acharacter which is \\"simplicity itself.\\" \\"Rash, arrogant,generous, outspoken to a fault, loyal, affectionate,and single-minded, he has all the qualities that endeara captain to his men and a romantic hero to his audience.He has no subtlety at all; other men's minds are a closedbook to him.\\" This particular view of Roland makes himsound a little like a faithful pooch rather than achivalrous knight; and perhaps strains a bit of invectiveat Romantics in believing that they prefer no subtletyin their heroes.The final aspect which Ms. Sayers stresses is the \\"essentialChristianity of the poem.\\" \\"It is not merely Christian insubject; it is Christian to its very bones.\\" *** \\"And itis a Christianity as naive and uncomplicated as might befound at any time in the simplest village church.\\" However,it is a Christianity which has already made the concessionto the idea of \\"just wars\\" -- and killing for \\"the rightreasons.\\" Augustine and Constantine take precedence overJesus.This is a very readable translation and Ms. Sayers, whoreceived a degree in medieval literature from theSomerville College, University of Oxford, in 1915, doesit great credit with a readable, engrossing translation.Here is the section on the death of Roland himself (actuallyit takes him 3 full stanzas to die; 174, 175, and 176,even though it seems he has fully expired in the first --):Now Roland feels death press upon him hard;It is creeping down from his head to his heart.Under a pine-tree he hastens him apart,There stretches him face down on the green grass,And lays beneath him his sword and Oliphant [his horn].He's turned his head to where the Paynims are,And this he doth for the French and for Charles,Since fain is he that they should say, brave heart,That he has died a conqueror at the last.He beats his breast full many a time and fast,Gives, with his glove, his sins into God's charge.[174]-------------------- Robert Kilgore."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"This is \\"The Song Of Roland,\\" as Dorothy Sayers remarks in the introduction to this fine translation, is 'the earliest, the most famous, and the greatest of those Old French epics which are called Songs of Seeds.'This book, written around the end of the eleventh century, and recalling an actual disaster in 778 A.D., the anonymous poet describes in detail the betrayal and slaughter by Saracens the rearguard of Charlemagne's army under ROLAND at Rencevaux and Charlemagne's bitter revenge. Nowhere in literature is the medievel Code of Chivalry more perfectly expressed than in this masterly and exciting poem.This text includes an extensive introduction to the Eurpoean Medieval world and provides explanations on civil and military costume.\\"When Thierry feels the blade bite through his flesh,And sees the blood upon the grass run red,Then he lets drive a blow at Pinabel.Down to the nasal he cleaves the bright steel helm,Shears through the brain and spills it from his head,Wrenches the blade out and shakes it from it dead.With that great stroke he wins and makes an end.The Franks all cry: \\"God's might is manifest!\\"Yes!!!! Buy this book! You will not be disappointed.Five stars. Without equal."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"This translation of the Old French tale is highly entertaining, with flashes of poetic invention that enliven the medieval folderol of swords, steeds and deeds. The story concerns the betrayal of the brave but foolhardy Roland, his knightly companions and his army by the treacherous Ganelon. Sayers cleaves closely to the meter of the original Old French, which requires clever feats of circumlocution and diction. The translation has a charmingly archaic quality, in keeping with the ancient nature of the tale."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"The great French/Frank epic poem, the Song of Roland, stemmed out of an actual event. There really was a Roland--he was a nobleman of some kind. He and his party were ambushed and killed during Charlemagne's lifetime. But they were not fighting Saracen pagans. They were actually killed by a party of Basques. Also, Roland was not a major factor in this battle, but rather merely a participant.Somewhere along the line a legend sprang up, and it gradually evolved and developed into what is now this poem. The poem is entertaining to read, and is a great example of Frank thought and prejudice (in making the villains Saracens). In fact, the opposing sides in the battle are Christians and Pagans, typical enemies from the period in which this was written.This poem is epic in many respects, and is also tragic. Certainly Roland's flaw is his excessive overconfidence and pride (hubris), which prevent him from blowing his horn and petitioning aid for himself and his army. The battle sequences, which are very graphic, are reminiscent of The Iliad and the Aeneid, though this work does not measure up to either in greatness or epic grandeur. I have given the poem four stars in relation to similar works (such as The Iliad, the Aeneid, and the Odyssey). The poem is well-written and is an enjoyable read, but the poet was by no means as talented as the likes of Homer, Virgil, Dante, Milton, or the Beowulf poet. Still, this is one of history's great epic poems, and should be treated as such. Study of this poem is essential for anyone interested in the epic as a form of poetry."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"An utter epic that deserves to be read by anyone with an intrest in either literature or history.Although there is controversy over the exact historical accuracy of this classic poem, it is based around the Charlemagne's campaigns against the Muslims in Northern Spain, around the late eighth century.It reads like a Frankish iliad, real events draped in myth.The poem has it all: enthralling plot, colourful charcaters, perfect timing.....A gem!"},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"I chose this version of the Roland over a later, clod-hopping translation I'd been bumping along with. What made that translation so awkward--besides the caesura that broke the flow of every line--was a complete lack of sympathy with the poem and the culture that produced it. From the way lines were rendered to the way the notes were written it was clear that the (Western) Medieval world was full of backward boneheads who just needed to put \\"Coexist\\" bumper stickers on rumps of their war horses.Yes, I know the surviving Old French manuscripts come complete with caesuras--Ms. Sayers told me so. But a good translator can take what is useful to their audience and leave the rest. That's exactly what Sayers does here. Rendering lines written a thousand years ago in accordance with an aesthetic long since forgotten in an idiom no one speaks is no mean feat. And Sayers does it with few wobbles or missteps.But what really makes this book purchase-worthy is Sayers' basic empathy with the material. Rather than do the obvious thing and roll her eyes at the irony of two deeply religious peoples hacking and hewing away at each other, Sayers takes you into that world and helps you understand it. Her introduction combines scholarship with a real enthusiasm for the subject. Her verse is fluid and conveys more than a little of what I imagine to be the poem's original drama. Like her contemporary C. S. Lewis, Sayers is known only for her fiction these days. But like Lewis, her academic work (including her version of the Divine Comedy, in terza rima no less) more than rewards inspection."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"A private feud gets in the way of a brave soldier's loyalty to his king. An epic battle between good and evil threatens the very order of things. Heroes are made and lost in a clash that sees tens of thousands of warriors slaughtered, their blood flowing like a river. The Song of Roland is perhaps the most famous French epic poem and a priceless piece of literature. This fantastic translation preserves the poetry and rhythm of the original piece, so the language doesn't get in the way. While you're reading, the intensely visual descriptions (you'll get queasy reading about the big battle) and detailed characters will pull you into the world of Charlemagne, and you can't ask for much more than that. Set aside some time for this one, you'll find it hard to tear yourself away."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)by Anonymous and translated by Dorothy Sayers tells an exciting story. While Charlemagne and his army were leaving Spain, his rearguard was attacked by Basques and destroyed. Two hundred years later this incident had been substantially changed into an epic story of the battle of the Christians versus the Muslims in Spain and the heroic exploits of Roland, the Emperor's nephew.Dorothy Sayers is best known for her detective novels about Lord Peter Wimsey. This work, published shortly after her death in 1957, gave her a chance to revisit her Oxford studies in Old French and produce a translation of this epic poem. Her introduction to \\"The Song of Roland\\" is wonderful! It is scholarly, interesting, and fun to read. For example, in her discussion of the conventions of this kind of poem, she notes that the last step is \\"the Victor's Boast.\\" She writes: Having killed your enemy, you encourage yourself and your men by hurling insults at his dead body. This custom is not altogether in accordance with English notions of sportsmanship...\\"Unfortunately, Sayers chose to confine her translation to the same complicated meter scheme of the original Old French poem, necessitating the use of alternate names for the main characters and many archaic words. While this preserves the rhyme scheme and rhythms of the original, it makes for a difficult translation that is not much fun to read. You get lines like:His great furred gown of marten he flings backAnd stands before them in his silk bliaut clad.Or:Where is your sword that Hauteclaire is y-clept,With its gold hilts and pummel crystal-gemmed?If you yclept your own bliaut, then you'll enjoy this translation! Otherwise, do yourself a favor - read Sayer's excellent introduction and choose another, less constrained, translation of this exciting poem."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland","review":"I'm teaching a literature class to guys 13-15 years old.

This story takes place in the bayous and swamps of Louisiana in the late 1950's - a time when Oyster farmers were threatened by the polution of modern industry. I happen to come from Louisiana and can say that the author captured this very well.Second, Biguenet's style is lively and rhythmic. He rarely takes refuge in boring verbs like \\"to be\\" or \\"to have\\", instead using more descriptive verbs to carry his sentences.Biguenet develops the characters like an expert psychologist, making the reader feel the struggles with guilt and family loyalties. The story unfolds very naturally and as it goes on you see how some of the characters dig themselves deeper and deeper into a hole. It's hard to put the book down once you start reading.I have also read another work by this author, \\"The Torturer's Apprentice\\", and I note that he picks interesting settings and really gets into the details of those settings. He also does a nice job of portraying the way people deal with guilt."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"I would really prefer to give this book 3 stars - it's not as bad as the 3 star rating would indicate. Biguenet is a fine writer - his short story collection, THE TORTURER'S APPRENTICE, which was published in 2001, simply blew me away. I was anticipating reading OYSTER immensely on the strength of that earlier work. The novel, however, reads like the author has turned himself down a notch. The characters are well-developed, and the story is an interesting one - and the setting, costal Louisiana in the late 1950s, is vividly depicted. I guess it's just that he seemed to be taking more risks with his shorter fiction, and not just for the sake of appearing to be \`innovative' - there was an educated, controlled abandon about those stories that was actually rather thrilling to experience as a reader. By comparison, the novel hit me more like a made-for-TV movie - albeit a well-made one. Too much of it was predictable - the characters' personalities and the conflicts they engendered, as well as several of the plot turns, could be seen coming \`with the headlights on'.I'm sure that the author will continue to work - he's got an amazing talent, just read the short story collection if you haven't, it's breathtaking. I'm hoping that this novel turns out to be a stepping-stone to something greater - I know he has it in him."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"This review is for the first Ecco Paperback edition published in 2003, 291 pages. Ecco Press is an imprint of HarperCollins.OYSTER by John Biguenet is the story of two rival families, the Bruneau's and the Petitjean's, who have the largest oyster leases in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. Fifty-two year old Darryl Bruneau holds loans on Felix Petitjean's home and boat. Felix is on the verge of default. To avoid losing everything, Felix agrees to give Darryl his eighteen-year old daughter, Therese.Oops, Therese has other ideas. She tells Darryl, \\"I don't get bought for the price on no damn boat.\\" In one of the most engaging first chapters I've ever read, Therese irrevocably upsets her daddy's plans. Go to the bookstore and read the first seven pages of OYSTER by John Biguenet; I'll wager that you buy the book.With masterful dialogue and just enough sensory detail, John Biguenet captures the sounds and feel of the oysterman's plight in the fall of 1957. There are some rough passages, like Mrs. Petitjean's confession to Therese, and occasionally Biguenet goes head hopping with omniscient POV, but he never forgets that it's all about story. This is a good story told well."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"\`Oyster' is a great book on every level. For simple reading it's a gritty story of murder, revenge and steamy passion. It centers on a feud between the two leading families of the Plaquemines Parish, LA, oyster industry. Felix Petitjean and family represent the long established leading family of the parish while Darryl \`Horse' Bruneau and his three sons are the brash, heavy-fisted newcomers who have carved a niche for themselves by buying up the leases of destitute competitors.Horse (\\"This child wants to know why I'm called The Horse. Think she's old enough to see?\\") dies early in the story but his personality is so forceful that his spirit is felt long after his body sinks into the bayou. Even dead he manipulates the actions of the story's characters, for good or (more likely) ill.At first I was concerned that Biguenet was steering his readers toward a Cajun \`Romeo and Juliet' but he avoided falling into that trap. That would not have worked at all in this rough-and-tumble setting. In its place, the author offered a much more compelling plot, deftly enhanced by intricately woven interrelationships of love and hatred.But Biguenet, an English professor at Loyola, didn't settle for just a simple read. Some have compared John Biguenet to William Faulkner but I don't see it. James Dickey maybe, but I never found Faulkner to be this entertaining. Nevertheless, social allegory lurks just below the surface of Bayou Petitjean, as omnipresent as the gators. Therese Petitjean is stirring up existence in Egret Pass as certainly and inexorably as the channels cut by the oil companies are changing the sedentary life of the oysters. It soon becomes very apparent that \\"It ain't like the old days, Darryl.\\"This is a must read. Rustle up some shrimp etouffee, put on the Beausoleil and make yourself very comfortable. You won't want to put this down for a long time."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"John Biguenet hooked me and carried me into the salt marshes and small towns of Southern Louisiana in 1957. I felt the humidity, smelled the salt marsh, tasted the jumbalaya, heard the clattering of winches and felt the nets on my hands. The characters are memorable, the story engaging and the twists and turns of the plot kept me hooked until the very end. This page turning yarn explores issues such as justice or revenge, the impact of &quot;economic development&quot; on traditional lifestyles, and how actions - - sometimes from decades earlier - - can rear their heads and bite us, all without any preachiness. This is a strong novel and leaves me eager for number two."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"John Biguenet's Oyster is a deeply dark and interesting novel that tells the tale of two familes immersed in a deadly rivalry in the late 1950s. The characters are well developed and the plot is engaging to the reader. Biguenet reminds one of Faulkner and I would highly recommend this novel which is hard to put down. I was sorry when I finished it."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"Oyster is set in the heart of the Louisiana bayou, a tale replete with strange characters, infidelity, greed and murder. It is a world filled with violence as ominous and sudden as the bite of a crocodile.The Petitjean's own the richest oyster beds in the parish, but they are heavily in debt to their rivals, the Bruneau's. \\"Horse\\" Bruneau and his three sons are ready to take over all the beds still producing in spite of the ongoing damage from the oil companies that are slowly polluting the waters. Planning to join the holdings of both families through a marriage of convenience, Horse Bruneau pursues Therese Petitjean. But Therese is not about to be tendered as a piece of merchandise, although she does realize that the union would benefit her family financially. Family loyalty is paramount in both clans, and blood defines every action.Suddenly, violence erupts, two are dead and there are questions that cannot easily be answered. Local citizens are curious about the crimes, but never surprised by bizarre circumstances. Sheriff Christovitch, a man who is familiar with the histories of all the suspects and has a past of his own, attempts to ascertain exactly the who, how and why of the murders.As twisted and mysterious as the murky bayou, the novel takes one unexpected turn after another. Some of the more colorful characters, including Horse and Horse, Junior, have natures as bent and narrow as the gnarled roots of the ancient trees that extend deep below the waterline. A challenge to man's true nature, there is no pity, or easy answer when life and death are at stake. Two wrongs never make a right. Or do they? Luan Gaines/2003."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"*Oyster* by John Biguenet begins so beautifully that it's a pity how far it bogs down as the story winds on. Initially, a wonderful, exotic ambience and a shocking deed capture the reader -- but once's s/he's captured, the reader is tortured with prose that grows ever more labored and didactic. Explaining the technical aspects of fishing-boat engines in the context of crime doesn't make them more interesting. And, having one character tell another how oystermen find their beds by checking trees on the bank doesn't make that exciting, either. These kinds of details can be lively and add to a book's power, but they have to be handled wisely.At the end, the author's need to tie up all loose ends results in nearly a grade-schooler's obviousness and dull simplicity. What a pity! Perhaps this is the result of a first attempt to move from short stories into full-novel format. Biguenet has a gift, and it shows up early in this book, but it's betrayed by the rest. I wanted to continue to feel that bayou water on my skin as I read, but instead I felt a kind of irritation of the brain."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"How anyone who has read Faulkner can compare this book to his works is beyond comprehension to me. This book was average at best--certainly nothing approaching a classic. The protagonist is a cold-blooded murderer--yet this fact doesn't seem to bother anyone--least of all the author. The worst part of this novel was the amateurish gimmick of having Therese's mother tell her whole life story to her daughter over hot chocolate one night. Much easier than trying to weave those facts into an actual plot I guess. This book was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The plot moved along at a nearly lightning pace, and characters were amazing. (Primarily Therese, who drives the action of the entire book. Dude, when two men are dead by page 50, you know you've got a page-turner.)Here's the quick version: Set in Louisiana in the late 50s, Oyster tells the tale of two rival families: the Petitjeans and the Bruneaus. Both families harvest oysters for a living, and ecological changes are putting full-time oystermen out of business. Therese Petitjean, a young girl, is offered in marriage to Horse Bruneau, more than 30 years her senior. The match will unite the two largest surviving oyster families, ensuring continued success, as well as lift the Petitjeans out of mounting debt. When Horse turns up dead, well before the wedding, his three sons are sure that a Petitjean is to blame. One murder later, the real killer is still on the loose.I thought Biguenet did a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of Louisiana and the region's love of food. As well, Therese is one of the strongest female characters I've read in a long time. Make yourself a pot of gumbo and READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"Oyster captures the culture, accent, and feelings of two rival families whose work and lives are intertwined.

If you don't like it, you haven't been there."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"Biguenet does a good job of taking us into the world of Louisiana oystermen (and women). As a Louisianan, the story made me wonder how much different or more difficult it is now to make a living as an oysterman, with the bayous disappearing and the lifestyle of the Cajuns being slowly squeezed out of existence. The in-book review likened \\"Oyster\\" to a Greek tragedy and I can see why, as power and revenge are played out among the characters. Be very careful of whose lives you try to control."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"I don't often find a book I am reluctant to put down, but this one kept me going, even with the predictability of plot. The characters are realistic and believable. One sympathizes with them, in spite of their faults and cruelty. I was disappointed in Mathilde's overly long confession to her daughter of a youthful love affair. Why was she compelled to tell all on the night of her son's funeral when she had kept it a secret for two decades? The dialogue was true, catching the cadence and syntax of the Cajuns. Setting was done extremely well, and not overdone. Imagery borders on the poetic. Biguenet is a good writer, and we expect him to get better as time goes on."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"All these comparisons to Faulkner, Chekov, etc. ... instead I found myself thinking of the Noir, pulp novels, such as the Grifters by Jim Thompson and Swamp Sister by Robert Edmond Alter. Oyster is more literate than the latter but Oyster is peopled by amoral characters (albeit Catholic ones)in a swampy, bayou setting."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"A enjoyable read that catches the tempo of the Louisana Coast. I read this book without ever wondering if I wanted to put it down. If you like a good story with a lot of local flavor, than this is the book for you.

Super story-telling and geat characters."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"Oyster is a tale of 2 families set in the backwaters of Louisiana. One family is rapacious, crude and successful, the other is decent but failing. Oh, the decent family has a murderous daughter, who is otherwise very appealing. The book is crafted at the level of a fairly well written crime novel. Biguenet is good with the fishing life, bayou version, and his scenic passages are very well done."},{"Title":"Oyster","review":"This novel never went anywhere. It is hard to understand how such a weak story, poorly written, populated by so many one-dimensional characters, could find its way into print. Biguenet is a pretentious writer, with little to say, who offers up caricatures better found in made-for-TV movies. His dialogue is embarrassing; his attempts at &quot;regional flavor&quot; an affront; his plot utterly devoid of originality. There is a ton of Deep South fiction to savor -- Welty, Percy, Faulkner -- before turning to the likes of Oyster. I regret that I bought this book."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"[...]. Splenda is the culmination of experiments conducted in labs seeking to create new pesticides. Yes, you read that correctly.Diabetics, weight watchers, calorie counters, I encourage you to do a little more digging into refined sugar substitutes. I also encourage you to look into Upper Cervical Specific Care as a possibility in refining your health status. Many folks, through traumatic events (accidents, slips, falls), have caused damage to one of the most vital structures that is very little understood in the public eye--the brain stem.

Then I saw the review saying there was too much sugar so I figured the answer to the good reviews was that the author used sugar only to &quot;call&quot; the desserts low sugar. But because my mother has diabetes, my wife is on a diet and my chef association mentioned splenda was a good product I ordered the book. Here is what I found:1. The desserts really do taste tremendous. In fact had I not made the &quot;Heavenly Cheesecake&quot; myself I would never have believed it had NO sugar and was so low in fat. My wife was thrilled at the meager 180 calories for a real piece.2. I found MANY of the recipes actually did not have ANY sugar. The ones that did had teaspoons or tablespoons. When you bake regular dessert recipes you use CUPS. To have the appearance and taste of these with so liitle is unbelievable.3. Portion sizes are real.4. A few chocolate chips, a little lite topping - these are the ingredients that make these desserts taste great, not dietetic or weird like health food stuff. And still the calories are low.Last, I have looked at many books for desserts for diabetics. Some use other no-cal sweeteners which don't taste or cook well. Some use fructose and apple juice but those are still sugar. These recipes taste great and are truly low in carb (and sugar).I intend to use them for all my &quot;special&quot; clients (and me too)"},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"This is the best book I have EVER found for desserts low in carb!I HAVE DIABETES AND I LOVE SWEET TREATS! It is soo hard to limit the cookies, cakes and other goodies, especially this time of year. In the past I tried (and usually failed) eating just a small amount of the usual treats so I could keep my blood sugar in check because most low sugar recipes taste too dietetic. (It is no fun watching everyone else get the good stuff!).I got this book on a recommendation from a diabetes educator just before Thanksgiving and I have been baking happily ever since! I saw the review about the lack of taste in the Cheesecake and had to write. My whole family loved it! They did not know it was low-fat or low in sugar and thought it was rich and creamy and sweet! I have also made the Pumpkin Custard, also great and REALLY low in carb and am addicted to the Deep, Dark Hot Chocolate. I have never had a better low sugar Chocolate Cake (great for birthdays) and the Applesuace Snack Cake has become a staple in my home. I look forward to a happy holiday eating my Chocolate Peppermint Cheesecake - a real piece (1/10 NOT the usual 1/16th of a cake) for only 22 gms of carb and 190 calories. To me that is a sweet and merry Christmas treat. I HIGHLY recommend this book to ANYONE looking for real tasting, WONDERFUL treats that are good for you without all the sugar and fat."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I bought this book last fall and HIGHLY recommend it. The desserts are very tasty (I used some of them for the holidays) and one of the things I liked most about the cookbook was that she goes into some details as to HOW she developed the recipe. This is invaluable to me because it shows me how to tweak my own family favorites.I appreciate that she found a good balance of maintaining taste and texture. One reviewer complained that a lot of the recipes still had sugar. Well, yeah, but the quantities are very very small amounts for a recipe (a tablespoon or two for an entire batch of cookies, for example) and is necessary to maintain the *texture* of the dessert--which keeps it from that icky dry fake taste that a lot of no-sugar/sugar-substitute recipes have. And best off all, she explains WHY she left it in there.I liked this book enough that I used it as a christmas gift to a diabetic family member."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"THIS IS IT! 10 years on Weight Watchers and I have never had a cookbook like this. For the first time I can bake all the things I love, have them taste and look great AND be low in points!I have an incurable sweet tooth that I have satisfied with lots of things like skinny cows and low fat ice cream but sometimes you just need real homebaked goodies! Especially for the holidays or birthdays. This book with over 75 recipes has it all!Chocolate cake that mixes up in 5 minutes and tastes great. A big piece with strawberries and whipped topping is only 3 1/2 points! It has coffee drinks like the ones in the shops for only 1 point and loads of cheesecakes - all that average about 200 calories - unheard of for a good size , not tiny, piece that tastes so great. I have tried the Pumpkin Streusel and the basic &quot;Heavenly&quot; and they were both sweet, creamy and very rich tasting. My hat's definitely off to this author. A real bonus is that she doesn't skimp on the portion sizes to get the calories low.Other great info: the book gives you a lot of great nutrition information, baking and serving tips, and all the nutrition information to figure out the points. If you are diabetic the diabetic exhanges are included and the carbohydrate is very low. My sister has diabetes and is even more excited than me about the book. (She says these are very easy to fit into her meal plan.)Especially great is the secrets of low sugar baking. I am looking forward to adapting my own recipes now - I was to unsure before but now feel confident that I too can get great results.With the holidays coming I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to eat great desserts and sweets without all the calories (and POINTS). I also plan to give it as a gift to many of my friends who love to bake. it is certainly a high quality , one of a kind book."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda is a godsend to diabetics, weight watchers, and all healthy eaters who still have a sweet tooth and a yearning for the occasional comfort of a homey dessert without the subsequent negative nutritional and health consequences. Written by a culinary nutritionist who is also a skilled cook, Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda contains page after page of carefully crafted recipes for treats adapted to low fat, low sugar profiles, using Splenda instead of sugar. There are beverages, breakfast breads, scones, cookies, pies, crisps, cobblers, cakes, puddings, sauces and (my favorite) cheesecakes to die for. In addition, Parts. I and II contain Nutrition and Baking Information to help answer a variety of questions.One of the best things about Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda is it gives you a model of ways to adapt traditional high fat, high sugar recipes so they can be healthier but still good. One of my favorite recipes for Fresh Peach Custard Pie reminds me of an old favorite called \\"Peaches and Cream Pie\\", of course, much higher in fat, sugar, and calories. Another wonderful old treat reborn is Gingerbread Coffeecake, with 130 calories and 6 grams of fat per serving. Although the taste of the baked product varies slightly from my original recipe memories, they are indeed excellent in themselves, and quite luscious.I recommend this cookbook to anyone who likes to cook \\"inclusively.\\" No one need feel they cannot indulge in a serving of Unbelievable Chocolate Cake (160 calories, 7 grams fat), or Heavenly Cheesecake (180 calories, 8 grams fat), or Chocolate Chip Cookies (80 calories, 3.5 grams fat). Use this cookbook, enjoy it, and be healthy!Nancy Lorraine, Reviewer"},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"In this book of desserts low in fat, sugar and calories Ms. Koch gives the reader information on diabetes, fats, ingredients, and what she calls \\"low sugar baking secrets\\" in addition to the actual recipes. These include hot and cold beverages, muffins, coffeecakes, breakfast breads, cookies, pies, crisps, cobblers, puddings and specialty desserts, sauces and toppings, \\"cakes for any occasion\\" and finally cheesecakes. In a chapter entitled \\"Cheesecakes to Die For\\" she includes 9 recipes including Chocolate Cheesecake, Pumpkin Streusel Cheesecake and Key Lime Cheesecake.Wanting to bake a cheesecake for a relative with type 2 diabetes, I tried the \\"Heavenly Cheesecake\\" on page 102. I was sure it would be inedible, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The cheesecake has a very nice texture, cuts beautifully and convinces you it is the real thing. The secret to Ms. Koch's success seems to be (1) a mixture of low-fat and no-fat cheeses rather than only no-fat cheese and (2)unlike other sweeteners, Splenda has no bitter aftertaste. At any rate, this is one fine dessert. Additionally you get about 200 calories in one piece of cheesecake rather than the usual 600. As the author says, she wants to create desserts to die for, not from. While I can only attest to this one recipe, I suspect the others are just as good.This book is a valuable edition to healthy cookbooks."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"We have tried quite a few recipies from this book, and enjoyed them all. They are, however, not for the person that wants quick and easy treats. But, if you like to cook, and are not easily intimidated in the kitchen, this is the book that can cater to your sweet tooth and your health at the same time."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I've been cooking with granular Splenda since it became available in the U.S. and have always simply substituted it for regular sugar, measure for measure, in standard recipes, with excellent results. There never seemed to be a need for special Splenda recipes. But I thought I'd buy and try Unbelievable Desserts with Splenda to see whether specially developed recipes do make a difference. With great anticipation, I made the Pumpkin Streusel Cheesecake for Thanksgiving dinner, following the recipe exactly. The result looked like cheesecake on the plate, and it felt like cheesecake in the mouth, but that's all. The dessert had almost no flavor--no cheesecake taste, no pumpkin taste, hardly any taste of spices. Even the gingersnaps in the crust lost the flavor they had had originally. The dessert was such a disappointment that diners left pieces unfinished on their plates.I went out the next day and bought ingredients for a pumpkin pie and then made my traditional recipe with Splenda instead of sugar, egg substitute instead of whole eggs, and evaporated skim milk instead of cream. The pie tasted delicious, and its texture was perfect. (Omit the crust if you really want to cut the calories; that works, too.)Just about any cook could figure out how to make the substitutions in standard recipes that this book touts. Save your money on the book and spend it on Splenda. The latter is a great product. This book isn't."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I'm very glad to have discovered this book, as I don't want to be on a long-term diet and not eat any desserts at all. I have made many of the recipes. Most are easy to make and taste delicious. (The cheesecakes are outstanding.) The author has avoided the current trends of reducing/replacing sugar _or_ reducing/replacing fat--her recipes reduce sugar _and_ fat.I do have two comments/suggestions about this book. First, the author routinely uses semisweet chocolate chips for recipes that simply require melted chocolate. I would much rather have the chocolate quantity stated by weight. Frankly, if there are any chips left over--and there always are--I eat them till they're gone. (Not a great way to reduce calories.) I don't do this with block chocolate. In any case, it would be convenient for all cooks who don't keep chocolate chips on hand.Second, the author gives choices between using fresh egg whites and commercial egg substitutes. Although the substitutes are convenient (and don't require throwing out egg yolks), the substitute I tried made baked goods horribly rubbery and rather strange tasting. I recommend using real egg whites.Oh, and one last request--I'd like to see a recipe for diet chocolate mousse! Surely it can be done?"},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I have tried three recipes so far.

A high percentage of the recipes include &quot;real&quot; sugar in addition to Splenda: brown sugar, regular granulated sugar, powdered sugar; and also ingredients containing significant amounts of sugar, such as sweet or semisweet chocolate chips. The author should have at least provided alternate non-sugar recipes for all recipes."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"excellent transaction; very satisfied. great book of dessert recipes which I can use for my diabetic husband who has a sweet tooth."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I suppose it's a good book in it's own right, but I bought it with the hopes of finding some good low carb dessert recipes. Instead what I found are recipes that are low sugar, not the same thing at all. In addition to cutting the sugar out, she seems to concentrate on cutting a lot of the fat out of the recipes, which tends to add carbs in some form.If you're on Atkins, this is not the book for you. There are a few recipes that are lower carb, but nothing that I couldn't get from straight Splenda=Sugar substitutions, and often not even with as good of results. Custard and cheesecake are 2 that pop to mind that are simple enough to do straight substitution without sacrificing flavor or texture. I didn't need to pay for this book to get those recipes.All in all, rather a disappointment."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"Nancy Lorraine, Reviewer for Midwest Book Review obviously didn't read this book.

Using REAL butter, eggs, etc."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"Two different groups of discriminating dessert lovers gobbled up the pumpkin cheesecake with exclamations of how wonderful it tastes. Using the recipe from this new cookbook, I first presented this amazingly low fat and low calorie cheesecake to a gathering of eight neighborhood couples. Then a week later, a second pumpkin cheesecake was contributed to an office potluck lunch. Both times, everybody raved about how good it tasted, how rich and creamy the texture is, and how unbelievably low the calorie and fat content are. Actually, the men in the crowd didn't focus much on the tiny sugar and fat tally: They REALLY loved the flavor of this luscious sweet.I plan to recommend this new cookbook to my friends who cook for family members coping with diabetes. Now they can bake special treats for all the people they love.Other big pluses: The author carefully provides a wealth of information about Splenda. The recipes are clearly laid out and easy to follow. The notes that go with each recipe give the reader comfort that the author thoroughly tested everything to make sure the results turn out terrifically. I especially liked the section on baking principles and adjustments when using Splenda. It really expands the usefulness of this book. You could quickly start adapting favorite traditional recipes based on the author's many tips."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"This little book is far more useful than many cookbooks I have whose bulk consists mostly of color photos and big type. The desserts are in the American tradition of home cooking, and simple to make. The author has worked to make classic desserts not only low in sugar, but low in fat and calories. (I have no use for the low-sugar but high-fat recipes I've seen elsewhere; fat is bad for you.) The author has tested the recipes thoroughly. Not only do the desserts taste good; the cooking times, procedures, etc. are correct.What I'd like is for the author to write another cookbook focusing on low-calorie versions of the fancy European style desserts I used to make (before I went on a diet and my husband found out his cholesterol is high). I'm sure it would be wonderful.By the way, Splenda really does taste exactly like sugar, and cooks like it except for having less bulk."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I've had this book for several years, and I reach for it all the time.

Furthermore, the author explains how she came up with the recipes, so you can easily adapt your own. Splenda and simple lower-fat substitutions let you satisfy your sweet tooth without sacrificing yourself. Each recipe includes nutritional information, including the diabetic exchange plan. However, while this book is great for anyone watching their sugar and calorie intake, including diabetics, the recipes are not necessarily low carb and some sugar is occasionally called for (perhaps a couple of tablespoons or sugar, or in the form of chocolate).

Splenda is used instead of sugar for sweetening and all the recipes are low in fat. The treats taste great!Why not five stars? Though Splenda seems to have an excellent safety record, I am not 100% convinced about all the safety matters, if one totally substitutes for all the sugar that conventional recipes require. I would say that one should read up on concerns with various artifical sweeteners.One of the nicer aspects of this book is that some of the recipes can be prepared by a creative cook, using other sweeteners in amounts calculated to give equivalent sweetening. Also the methods used to cut fat are applicable outside this cookbook.For diabetics, it is really nice to be able to have a treat in the refrigerator that will not harm one's diabetic diet. I do recommend this cookbook."},{"Title":"Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda: Sweet Treats Low in Sugar, Fat and Calories","review":"I didn't know that Splenda tasted as good as it does--almost like real sugar----wonderful desserts"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Colour of law was an absolutely enthralling read.

Great read that filled a large chunk of the holiday weekend. I'm a huge fan of Grisham novels and as others have said struggled to find anyone as good. Mr Gimenez certainly is. Always love finding a new author and I'll be borrowing/buying more of Mr Gimenez's!"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Mark Gimenez falls solidly in the same legal fiction genre as John Grisham, but he tells a much better story than Grisham. I like Grisham. I read all his books and will likely continue to do so as he churns them out. But they are not as satisfying and substantial as Gimenez's.The Color of Law, Gimenez's debut novel, set the standard for his later works. Here we meet A. Scott Finney, a lawyer in high-powered Dallas law firm, making big bucks representing Dallas's big bucks clients. He grew up poor, but was a football star at exclusive Highland Park High School and posh S.M.U. Remembered for his on-the-field heroics, he has managed to become a part of the establishment he always looked up to: he has the Highland Park mansion, trophy wife, expensive sports car, club memberships, the whole bit.All of this perfection begins to fall apart when he is appointed to defend--I know this sounds a little over the top--a black prostitute accused of murdering the son of a Highland Park denizen. Of course, the prostitute turns out to be a great mom in spite of her circumstances, and the victim is a spoiled, good-for-nothing playboy whose powerful father, a U.S. senator, is a favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, and Finney goes through a rapid conversion from a rich lawyer driven by money to a lawyer with integrity, driven by justice.Maybe there is some stereotyping here, and maybe the morality is a little bit too black and white, but none of that stops Gimenez from telling a richly satisfying story. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"The Colour of Law kept me awake all night long, I could not set the book aside no even for a minute.

The author keeps the pace and the suspense interesting all through.Must read if you enjoy legal thrillers."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Even he is a new comer in the legal thriller world; Mr. Gimenez is as good as his predecessor, like Scott Turow, John Grisham, William Bernhardt, Steve Martini and any others.In \\"The Colour of Law\\", Mr. Gimenez had succeeded for bringing a splendid job to message any lawyer in this world, about an important value of a legal profession.This novel make me realize that the real colour of law is \\"Green\\", not because how its cover illustrated, but because the story telling me so.I like the way Mr.Gimenez created the flow in this novel, he does a fine job with the plot - lots of twists, intrigue and the courtroom scenes are great.I like the way the story goes, how Scott Fenney giving his best sacrifice to reach more respectable life as a decent lawyer.I also assume that the Colour of Law is inspire by classic Harper Lee Novel's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".I say, \\"This novel is good and worth to read.\\"Two thumbs up for Mr. Gimenez!PS: I recommended This novel to international readers, because is easy to read!"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I have been a fan of John Grisham since high school and have seen a lot of writers being hailed as the next John Grisham or the John Grisham of accounting (Christopher Reich) but few manage to measure up to that title. The title of this caught my eye and seeing it was set in the south I decided to give this rookie a chance. It was well worth the money the perfect life of A. Scott, his gorgeus wife, and little girl is torn to shreds when he is forced into defending a black prostitute accused of murdering a senator's wayward son. He defies his well paying law firm and the political influence of a senator who wants to be the next president. He lose almost everything he owns to defend a woman whom he believes is guilty and becomes the hero his mother always wanted him to be. I hope Mark Giminez goes on to follow in the footsteps of John Grisham and not Harper Lee whose debut novel was the only one."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Corporate Attorney A. Scott Finney has it all; he was a college football star, now a highly successful lawyer with the beautiful wife, smart daughter, living in a huge home with three high-end cars making lots of money. After giving a bar association speech, Scott is asked by a federal court judge to take on a criminal case of a young heroin-addicted prostitute accused of murdering the son of a Senator with White House ambitions. What Scott first believes will be a simple plea-bargain for his client becomes much more complicated and live altering when the accused insists she is innocent.Mark Gimenez debut is a definite page turner. The characters were interesting although, for the most part, stereotypes of the worst types, but that doesn't mean such people aren't real. The plot is implausible. Not being a lawyer, I can't speak to the legal aspects. It was, however, a thoroughly engrossing, entertaining read.

I can't wait for more."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I was not really motivated to write a review until I read some of the negative reviews of a few others. Calling \\"Mark Gimenez\\" a racist is a bit of a stretch as he is simply telling a story about a few characters who happen to live in a very rundown area of Dallas. It seemed to me that he made those individuals look good as the storyline continued. Sorry, it is just impossible for me to understand the anger. Like it or not, there are people who do live in very shabby conditions but do manage to reach out and change things.It is an interesting book. It is fun to read. I seriously doubt reading it will increase your IQ but for heavens sakes, it is just a good book. I do not think it will change your life. I do believe most will enjoy reading it as it does move quickly and does seem to have enough interesting activity to keep the pages turning.Many of have known lawyers like those he writes about but in the end, they do pay very heavy dues to live the lifestyles he writes about. There are no free rides, whether it happens to be in the so called poor areas or town or the wealthy neighborhoods of Dallas.If you are just looking for a good book to read and you do not feel the need to alter your IQ and are smart enough to decide for yourself what is BS and what is an attempt at social reform, just get the book and enjoy it. Truthfully, I thought it was a good book.Just remember, this is a book of FICTION!"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The protagonist, A. Scott Fenny, was a very far from perfect character whose growth progressed throughout the novel. His relationship with his daughter, Boo, was so touching and sweet, which became more so when the character of Pajamae, his client's little girl, entered the picture. This humanized him from the beginning, which was needed for his early character. It also helped explain some of the better but unlikely choices he made. Some of the debate about doing good vs doing well was redundant, but this is a first novel so I didn't think too much about that. I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Mark Gimenez' first novel is a winner on every count. A truly fast-paced legal thriller with a believable plot and characters who almost breathe.A. Scott Fenney has it all. A fast-rising partner in a top Dallas law firm with a client who pays $3 million a year for Scott's advice; a beautiful if somewhat empty-headed wife; a mansion in an exclusive suburb; a Ferrari, Mercedes and Range-Rover; memberships in all the right clubs and a nine year old daughter who is so perceptive that she becomes one of the few elements in the story that doesn't ring true. But no matter, because Gimenez is so skilled that the reader simply doesn't care.Fenney attracts the interest of a federal judge when he gives a speech as part of his campaign for the presidency of a bar association. The judge is so impressed by Fenney's impassioned plea for lawyers to do good that he assigns Scott as pro bono counsel in a murder case. Not just any murder case, of course, but one involving a black, heroin addicted prostitute accused of murdering Senator Mack McCall's son. It doesn't help that McCall is about to become a Presidential candidate.Fenney doesn't want the appointment, but the judge puts him in an untenable position. Refuse the appointment and Scott will be unveiled as a hypocrite, a lawyer who doesn't really care about doing good, but does care about proper appearances and, above all, money. Lots of money. Take the appointment and Scott's law firm --- which just happens to be headed by Sen. McCall's former personal attorney and potential White House lawyer --- may be embarassed.Gimenez's plotting is flawless. From his initial entrapment, we follow Scott as he deals with his social climbing wife, the insistent moral and ethical questions raised by his unbelievably precocious nine year old daughter, his confrontation with the defendant, his attempt to get a less than successful law school pal to take on the defense and, finally, his need to make a life or death, potentially career destroying decision.Not a page goes by without Gimenez ratcheting up the tension. His development of Scott, his senior partner and mentor Dan Ford, the federal judge, his wife, his law school buddy are all close to perfect.The climax is a prize in itself and getting there as a reader is a reward.It's a delight to read a novel so well executed. Yes, those familiar with the operation of the criminal justice system and trials will find places where Gimenez has distorted things, but as a reader, I don't care. Gimenez has provided me with a great story and earns nothing but praise from me. This is one of the best legal thrillers in years.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"It is so much fun to discover a new author who shows such promise that you expect he will be writing entertaining novels for some time to come. Mark Gimenez looks as though he may fit that bill. Wisely, Giminez has chosen to write about something he knows about; i.e. the practice of law from the perspective of a member of a large Dallas law firm. A. Scott Fenney is our boy and he has ridden his reputation as a star running back at SMU and his intelligence and ambition to a partnership in one of Dalla's most successful law firms, Ford Stevens arriveing at this apex in just eleven years since joining the firm. He has a Ferrari, a 3 million dollar plus home in Highland Park, memberships in prestigious clubs in the area and a georgeous wife who is as ambitious as he is and whose main goal in life is to be chair of the Cattle Baron's Ball. His main client is a ruthless real estate developer named Tom Dibrell who is good for 3 million dollars in billings a year. A. Scott knows all the tricks of the trade on keeping Dibrill happy and the money flowing in.As the story opens, A. Scott is giving a speech to members of the Texas Bar Association in which he reminds them that everyone thinks lawyer's jokes are hilarious and challenges them to ask themselves if they as lawyers are really doing good, or are they just doing well? Are they noble guardians of the law or just greedy parasites? Are they making the world better or just themselves richer? He then thunders into a litany of how lawyers are making the world better and are fighting for justice and that hif he is elected President of the Texas Bar that he will remind people that society is better because of lawyers and that he will tell people that \\"he is proud - damn proud, to be a lawyer...because lawyers - do - good!\\" Of course he doesn't believe a word of it as is quickly revealed when he remarks to a fellow lawyer who admires his gift of oratory that \\"you don't get laid or elected by telling the truth.\\"One member of his audience has been wondering about a problem during A. Scott's speech. That member is US D.Ct. Judge Samual Burford who has been wrestling with the question of who to appoint in his court to defend what may be a very high profile murder case. One in which representation of the defendant may be very difficult and unpopuar. The speech gave him his answer and soon thereafter A. Scott got a call from the judge.The case involves the murder of the son of Texas's senior US Senator, Mack McCall. Clark McCall is one of Dallas's most eligible bachelors. Rich, handsome, the Chair of a federal agency thanks to his father's influence, Clark is back in Dallas for the weekend to pursue his favorite pastimes; doing drugs and engaging a hooker. This time, his interests have resulted in his murder and a black hooker has been charged.From this beginning, we watch as A.Scott's world slowly disintegrates and what effect it has on him, his family and his ambitions. Not a new story line in writing novels, but the beauty is in how it is written and how it reads and this story will pull you along as though you were floating in a large raft on a raging river. Giminez has the gift of a geat story teller and he spreads it throughout the book.I haven't enjoyed a read of this type this much in some time and I hope you will give this new author a look. He has great promise and I for one cannot wait to see how he does with the future novels that will surely follow. If he is more than a one trick pony, we are all in for quite a treat."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"The protagonist of \\"The Color of Law\\" is Dallas lawyer A. Scott Finney. Scott is a lucky man. He is an acclaimed former jock, a partner in a prestigious firm, the proud owner of a luxurious home and car, and the husband of a gorgeous woman. He defends mostly well-to-do clients, practicing what he calls \\"aggressive and creative lawyering,\\" which is code for cheating, conniving, and doing whatever it takes to win a case.When Scott is appointed by a federal judge to represent a black prostitute named Shawanda Jones, he is horrified. Jones is accused of murdering Clark McCall, the spoiled rich son of an influential United States senator. After trying in vain to extricate himself from Shawanda's case, Scott slowly realizes that fate has brought him to a crossroads. Helping Shawanda Jones may give Scott the chance to be the kind of lawyer his mother always wanted him to be--one who is anxious to do good, not just to do well.In \\"The Color of Law,\\" Mark Gimenez presents a complex plot featuring a tragic miscarriage of justice, political corruption, family conflict, greed, and the abuse of power. The author also explores the possibility that an arrogant, self-centered, and shallow individual can seek redemption. Gimenez skillfully orchestrates Scot's fall from grace and his gradual reawakening to the value of a principle-driven life. The best scenes in the book show the warm relationship between Scott and the two girls he cares for most--his eight-year-old daughter, nicknamed Boo, and Pajamae, Shawanda's daughter. Scott's decision to fight for Shawanda earns him Pajamae's respect, affection, and gratitude.\\"The Color of Law\\" is not perfect. It is at least fifty pages too long and the conclusion, although satisfying, veers dangerously close to sentimentality. However, the story ultimately works because of Gimenez's fluid writing style, dry wit, and sharp delineation of character. Not only does the author effectively depict the deep chasm between Dallas's haves and have-nots, but he also shows, through Scott's poignant journey, that one need not \\"check one's conscience at the door\\" in order to be a successful lawyer."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I have read and reviewed 37 books in 2005 and this book is without a doubt the best and most enjoyable of the lot. You owe it to yourself to read this book! I am not trying to sell more books for Mr. Gimenez, as far as I am concerned you can read this book at the library, but don't miss out this memorable piece of fiction.The Color of Law is the story of man who grew up poor, although athletically and mentally gifted. His athleticism was the ticket to college and his mind was the ticket to law school and a very successful partnership in a prestigious Dallas law firm. Success though, comes at a steep price, it is like selling your soul to the devil and turning your back on what's right, at least that's what it was for A. Scott Finney, the lawyer around which this book is written.The senior partner and founder of Finney's law firm tells him that \\"the color of law isn't black-and-white, it's green! The rule of law is money--money rules! Money makes the law and the law protects the money! And lawyers protect the people with the money!\\" This is the sort of law that A. Scott Finney practiced for 11 years. And there was none better, that is, until the judge in a federal murder case appoints Finney to represent a prostitute accused of murdering the son of a wealthy U.S. Senator and possibly the next President of the United States. It is the emotional turmoil associated with Finney's decision to properly represent his client, and the fallout associated with that decision, that makes this book so compelling.Books like this, define the genre, and firmly establish the author as a major writing/marketing force. This book is going to be very popular.

The addiction to power and money just happens to look prettier from the outside.Scott Fenney is the money- and power-addicted lawyer, and Shawanda Jones is the drug-addicted prostitute who sees her precarious position in life with greater clarity than Scott does his. At least Shawanda understands that she prostitutes herself and that her hold on life is fragile. Scott doesn't realize that he also prostitutes himself and that his hold on the \\"perfect life\\" is quite possibly even more fragile than hers.As Shawanda's pro bono lawyer in a federal murder trial, Scott's perfect life becomes a house of cards. With the losses coming one on top of the other in rapid succession, Scott is forced to take stock of what is REAL in his life - not the Highland Park successful lawyer married to a beautiful social-climbing wife life that is more smoke and mirrors than substance.That's where precious little Boo (his daughter) comes in. Boo centers Scott with her \\"out of the mouths of babes\\" wisdom. She gives voice to the part of Scott that vaguely remembers something finer and more true in his desire to be a lawyer, before he sold his soul to the firm.

It's an easy read, but the many chips on author Gimenez's shoulder get in the way of what is otherwise a fairly predictable legal/thriller. You also have to accept the fact that a federal judge would appoint a civil attorney to handle a criminal death penalty case. Not likely."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"THIS WRITER, MR. GIMINEZ, IS A RACIST. IN HIS MIND, NOT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ALIVE CAN PUT A SENTENCE TOGETHER.

This book supports this idea. Our legal system although the best is not perfect and justice does not always prevail. His characters really came to life. Ready for another Gimenez novel."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Gimenez has taken a bunch of common characters from other books, trimmed off anything that may have made them even slightly distinctive, honed them to crystal stereotype, and thrown them together in the most standard of plots and settings.No really, tell me if you've ever seen any of these before:- amoral lawyer- amoral lawyer- amoral lawyer- black prostitute junkie- greedy corrupt ruthless ambitious politician (going for the presidency, of course)- wayward spoiled son of the above- trophy cheerleader wife purely into social prestige of money- precocious child (who confounds adults with articulate insights clearly written by adults)- large muscular black man (I'd add more, but that's all he is!)I could go on.Actually, no I couldn't. Somewhere around Dan choosing to listen to his conscience (I didn't quite get to that bit but, hmmm, I wonder if it was going to happen, duh) I couldn't handle anymore. Oh, and amaze me by saying the defendant didn't really do it (wow, what an incredible twist that would have been if I'd ever made it that far).Who are these people? I didn't enjoy them as fiction - how tired and overused are these types? Why would I want to see them again? And to treat them as anything other than fiction is just offensive and stupid: of course people that fit these descriptions exist, but not too many of them can merely be reduced to a couple of words. Not with any insight anyway: that ruthless politician also has a great sense of humour; that amoral lawyer genuinely loves jazz; that trophy wife is actually smarter than the bread winning husband.No, this was unpleasant reading. I mean, a couple of good lines here and there, and the workable evocation of incredibly clich&eacute;d characters and settings - that really doesn't make a novel. Seriously, Gimenez seems to take pride in getting a scene precisely like something we'll see three times a week if we watch any of the glossy \`Law and Order' genre shows. It's harder to take because Gimenez doesn't even seem to realise that he's writing utterly derivative pulp. I mean, good writers sometimes have to do this sort of thing, they can even have a bit of fun with it, but embarrassingly Gimenez seems to think he's writing something profound. Get his dedication to:\\"Harper Lee, whose great novel inspired me to become a lawyer and to write this story.\\"*This* hackneyed story? This gulf between perception and reality reminds me of the absurd comparisons of Elwood's appalling Angelwalk to Lewis' inspired \`Screwtape Letters'. Or of Goodkind thinking he was clever and incisive (as opposed to ignorantly smug) in calling a book \`Wizard's First Rule' (people are stupid).Maybe I missed a huge turn halfway through, but I'm not putting any more time into that hope.Maybe I didn't miss a turn at all, and \`The Color of Law' will, gasp, turn out to be green, the color of money. Even if this is true, clich&eacute; is not insight.PS: After glancing at a few amazon reviews my interest was piqued, so I read the last few pages and epilogue. Oh my - just as well I didn't drag myself through the whole thing! I was hardly giving it a rap before, but the ending is a triumph of bad writing.- Right handed - left handed: have I used the word \`clich&eacute;' in this review yet?- Yeah, that's what good lawyers do isn't it. Isn't Dan such a sharp operator to just stand in the courtroom shouting totally unsubstantiated accusations at a witness? As he thinks of them on the spot. With neither judge nor prosecution raising a murmur to these wild speculations. And all clearly able to see his guilt by the look in his eyes. Yeah, intelligent realism there. Is Gimenez really a lawyer, or is that some sort of persona??- The summation, cause of moaning and rolling the eyes. Wasn't it good that Gimenez could correct the unhappy ending of \`To Kill A Mockingbird'? What can Harper Lee have been thinking - didn't she realise that social problems are simply solved?- Aaargh, my goodness. The epilogue. Now that's just plain offensive. The strong good white man just waves his magic wand and everything is good and right again. Wasn't it nice that the prostitute junkie mother died, that made everything much less messy. Can't we just see the only black girl in the school being welcomed by her new rich white friends, and of course there'll never be an ounce of tension in that context with her new white sister. Now we can have our fairy tale future, with new enlightened Dan (still making enough money, mind you, to keep his mansion in an exclusive suburb, drive a merc and employ a full time maid/nanny) the perfect single father (although that isn't quite mainstream so there's the promise of a nice new wife). It's like the ugly message of \`Jerry Maguire', where even though it's supposed to be a revelation that wealth is not as important as character, um, the American writers couldn't conceive of a poor hero: Jerry just isn't quite as rich. Ghandi, Jesus ... losers. How dumb is this?? If it looks OK it must be OK: Dan can still work his 50-60 hour weeks to support his standard indulgent lifestyle, but if he tucks the girls into bed at night now and then, this is somehow an idyllic family.The shortcomings of this book are so obvious that there should be some legal structure in place to fine the author for offences against common sense. We're not living in the 50s anymore, there's not really an excuse for this sort of blind condescending nonsense.And all supposedly in the footsteps of Harper Lee!"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"This book is not, repeat not, the legal thriller it purports to be. Instead it's nothing more than a book on race relations. Mark Gimenez is obsessed with race. Just in case you missed the fact that a rich, privileged white lawyer is defending a poor black hooker, he repeats it every two pages.It seems everything Gimenez knows about Dallas, he learned from watching the TV show \\"Dallas.\\" I was shocked to learn that he is actually from the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I've lived in Dallas/Fort Worth for over ten years, and I can't believe we lived in the same area.This book doesn't have characters, it has caricatures. Characters appear, say their clich&eacute;d lines to move the plot along, then disappear until they're needed again.Don't be fooled by the fake reviews that proclaim Gimenez as the next Grisham or this book a literary classic. If you paid more than a $1 for this book (like me), you paid too much."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I am liking this author more and more with each book of his that I read. Grisham has competition with him. His storylines are fresh and new and page turners."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Great book. Great writer. Great story line. One of the best I've read in a long time. When a book brings tears or laughter to my eyes it's worth reading and this book did both."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I could not put this book down. The reading is fast and interesting. Yes it would be a read that you could have at the beach or on the airplane. There was humor, a lawyer who was not a nice guy who found out that life is more than money. The amazing thing was his relationship with the hooker. He treated her with dignity and grace. He even took her daughter into his house. Can't get much nicer than that. The respect he shows for the characters is admirable. The story makes sense as it goes from a rich lawyer to a humble incredible guy. I would absolutely recommend this story for anyone who wants a fun read."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Mark Gimenez's first legal thriller is very fast-paced and highly entertaining. With the exception of the two nine-year old girls (who are too \\"cutesy\\" and knowledgeable to be very credible), most of the characters are pretty well-developed and believable. The plot is interesting and exciting, and Giminez's cynical description of what being a top corporate lawyer is like seems very accurate. The Color Of Law, although ultimately mostly predictable, will keep the pages flying through your fingers. If you are into legal thrillers, I think The Color Of Law is a book you will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"This books was excellent until the end. I think the ending could have been better. This could be a series."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"It's hard to review this book. It is a page-turner, for sure, especially toward the end. You're interested in what's happening, and what to see what happens next. Some things come out of left field.Highland Park, Texas, is much like the book describes. In the 2000 census, there were 8600 whites, 241 Hispanics, 73 Asians, and 33 African Americans living there. The first African American homeowners moved in in 2003.There are some inconsistencies and stereotypes, as others have said. Scott could not have sold his house in his wife's absence.Would a federal judge appoint a real estate attorney to represent a woman charged with killing of the son of a powerful senator, hoping to become president? Probably not -- but it becomes a little more \\"iffy\\" if the judge realizes that attorney is a partner in a large and powerful firm, and is likely to associate other counsel.There are stereotypes -- Shawanda, the prostitute with the heart of gold, like Julia Robert's Pretty Woman. On top of that, she has a darling daughter, whom she insists only speak proper English and not Ebonics, and whom she takes to church every Sunday.The law firm full of conniving attorneys, who have chosen to do well, instead of doing good. The kind-hearted \\"street lawyer.\\" The social climbing cold-hearted cheerleader wife. The politician who will do anything to get elected.Scott, really, is the only person in the book who is capable of change. This reduces the potential deepness of the book, but doesn't take away its page-turning appeal.When I read on 69 that Scott told Shawanda to write down her address, when to that point HE had been taking notes during their jailhouse conference, I suspected something was up. Indeed, the relevance of the passage, \\"Shawanda ... took the pen in her left hand, and began writing.... 'My daughter's left-handed, too.' She stopped and stared at her hand\\" turns up much later in the book.Keep in mind, folks, that this is a first book, and pretty good for that. The book _Case of Lies_, co-written by Pamela O'Shaughnessy, who we are reminded in every review \\"graduated from Harvard Law School and was a trial lawyer for sixteen years\\" has glaring legal and other inaccuracies, and plot inconsistencies, and yet is acclaimed as a wonder work."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I thought this book was boring, wordy, and tired.

Looking forward to the next book from Mr. Gimenez."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"In white-collar Dallas every association is an opportunity to progress up the food chain, a diligent race for wealth and prestige, outward accoutrements the measure of the man. The real power brokers expect their carefully selected puppets to dance to their every whim, dangling the carrot of success. This is the world Scott Fenney has attained for himself and his wife and child. Fenney's world integrity is a four letter word. What's good for the firm is the rule they all live by and all the lawyers at Ford Stevens Law Firm are expected to compromise in favor of their employer. Scott's case defending Shawanda Jones, a junkie hooker accused of murdering the wild son of a powerful man, is riddled with conflicts of interest. The dead man's father, Clark McCall, is running for president and is putting pressure on the firm not to sully his son's reputation, a fact which could embarrass his campaign. But Scott is a proud man, used to wielding his own power; for the first time in years, Fenney actually balks at being told what to do.On an impulse, Scott takes Shawanda's eight-year old daughter home until the trial is finished. The same age as Scott's daughter, Boo, this child cannot stay alone in the projects while her mother is incarcerated. The little girls have some interesting conversations about Shawanda's choices and her upcoming trial, constantly taking Scott to task and forcing him to explain what is happening with the investigation. Believing he is invulnerable, Scott hedges his defense with the services of a criminal lawyer, Bobby Herrin, a street lawyer who practices in a whole other arena. The two men are willing to get Shawanda to deal when McCall pushes too hard; eventually, Scott's long-lost ethics come into play, his lifestyle and career balanced against this one trial. Scott gets a lesson in law and finance that he will not forget, all his work threatened by this one powerful man, career, lifestyle, home, marriage, cars, reputation, everything but his law degree. To a lawyer, \\"a wife's betrayal makes him question her, but a client's betrayal makes him question himself.\\" The charmed life is only an illusion maintained when you play the game by certain rules set by the major players. Eventually, Scott is called upon to reevaluate his values, whether success and all its perks are worth the loss of personal integrity. Scott comes face to face with the realities of his profession, the quid pro quo of power. The question is whether Scott Fenney has what it takes to do the right thing, for his client, his daughter, his friends and himself.

First, and this is just personal, I don't care for the lengthy explanations of history/politics etc that the author delves into. I prefer the story line to proceed at a reasonably brisk pace. Clearly some people like this...I don't. My main complaint is how the characters are stereotyped, and how the story line is just so uninspired that when piled together with pages of \\"information\\" it really slows the story down. We also get to read, repetitively (ad nauseum), about Scott's red Ferrari, his fancy house, how succesful his career is. The author let's us \\"listen in\\" to Scott's thinking and it just goes round and round (and where it stops nobody knows) with the same thoughts. Don't bother."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Trial lawyers of a certain generation, mine mostly, were born raised on Atticus Finch and Perry Mason whose idealism and courtroom prowess respectively instilled in us a deep desire to earn our living in the courtroom.Somewhere along the line, the law became a business and not a profession, and that is where a young partner in a big Dallas firm finds himself. Scott Feeney has sold out. He is thirty seven, and driven not by the ideals of our profession but by greed. He is the enabler of rich clients who are pretty much laws unto themselves,But Scott has the gift, but he just doesn't realize until he is appointed to represent a heroin addicted prostitute accused of killing a federal official how close he is to losing it. And then, Scott like Attiitus does the right thing even though it costs him his partnership, his rich clients, his mansion and his Ferrari.We know how this will come out, but it doesn't stop the fun or the biting and deserved criticism of our great profession in the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"The \\"Good\\": Gimenez moves the reader through this book at a wonderfully nice pace! The main character is somewhat complex and at times you love him and hate him. That makes him very human. As a native Texan I definitely enjoyed the familiarity of the setting. I also enjoyed the reference to football and passages like this: \\"high school football...legitimate, structured violence, organized by men, inflicted by boys, cheered by all...\\"Most importantly, the author is successful in making the reader want to be a more active participant in politics and the protection of the poor and disadvantaged, at least it did for this reader!The \\"bad\\": Ok, Gimenez just doesn't give the audience enough credit. A quarter through the book I wanted to scream to him: \\"I GET IT\\"! The author's love of Harper Lee's wonderful classic \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is more than evident. The straight out refrences Gimenez makes to the classic novel work far better than his numerous clumsy attempts to \\"subtly\\" draw the reader into the similarities and moral dilemmas faced by the characters.The \\"ugly\\": Gimenez just went a bit too far for my taste when his climax matched that of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" so perfectly and sadly predictably. Really, there is only one Harper Lee.I gave it 3 stars because it is such a quick and easy read while making the reader more socially aware and concerned."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"this is great, can hardly wait for his next one. keep writing."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"This story by first time novelist Gimenez is one that tries to parallel \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" except that the ending is a lot more upbeat. A Scott Fenney is a successful lawyer who is forced into defending a junkie/prostitute from a murder charge. She is supposed to have murdered the hedonistic son of the senior senator from Texas who is about to launch his campaign for the White House.Fenney who refuses advice from everyone to drop the case and run like hell, has to decide whether or not he has the strength of his convictions. Helping him along (with a nod to Scout) is his daughter Boo, and his old law school buddy Bobby Herrin who is one level (a small one) up from an ambulance chaser.His wife leaves him (no real loss), the Senator pressures the \\"right people\\" in Dallas to cancel his country club and health club memberships; his credit cards; eventually his job, which leads to the loss of his house and cars. But our boy bears up well under all this trouble and does the right thing.During most of the book when some one asks A Scott what the A stands for, he says \\"nothing\\". In the end we find out that it stands for Atticus (how about that Harper Lee), and we know that he will be the lawyer that his mother wanted him to be. Though it may sound 'hokie', it's actual a fine read and without all the rigamarole you find in Grisham."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"For a debut novel, this is an excellent and well-crafted story about modern law, integrity and the corruption of big business. As a practicing lawyer, Gimenez certainly has a dim view of practicing lawyer's in general - dishonest, greedy with no real concern about the client, the law is about winning and losing, and the attainment of wealth. The only people concerned about truth and justice is the jury - for them the law is black and white, for the lawyer's the color of the law is green, the color of money. This somewhat idealistic novel is about a man's journey from practicing the law as a vehicle to create wealth and social prestige to the realization that the law can be about the truth; but this realization comes at a great cost.It is most men's dream to own and live in a big, luxurious house, marry a beautiful woman, have a smart and loving child and a job that brings in a lot of money. A. Scott Fenny, ESQ., Ford Stevens LLP. - has attained it all. As a 750,000 per annum corporate lawyer, personally billing three million a year, drives a Ferrari, lives in a four million dollar mansion in Dallas's most exclusive suburb and belongs to every exclusive club in the city, A. Scott Fenny has reached the pinnacle of the ideal life. When suddenly it all changes.This tale is about a lawyer that always left his conscience at the door, living a dual life of loving husband and father after office hours and corrupt corporate lawyer by day. When his precocious nine year old asks Fenny what he does at work, like most lawyers, he lies. Because he can't tell his daughter that he over bills clients and buries evidence, cutting corners - practicing a little \\"creative lawyering\\"- she would disown him, so he continues to lie, justifying this dishonesty as just part of the job.One problem with the novel is that the wealthy are all depicted as greedy, superficial, materialistic and corrupt. This of course is a clich&eacute;, as there are lawyers and wealthy people out there that have morals and care about their fellow man. Fenny's wife is also depicted as superficial, a narcissist and devoid of all concern except for herself. She also is a clich&eacute;, a bit unreal, but as a secondary character, served the momentum of the plot.This is a thoroughly enjoyable novel that is constructed and written well, moving at a good pace, ending with a great climax and epilogue, and wrapping up all the loose ends nicely. If you are a fan of thrillers about the law and lawyers, The Color of Law will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"\\"What do lawyers and sperm have in common?\\"...\\"Both have a one-in-a-million chance of turning out human.\\" This joke, as told by the book's main character, attorney A. Scott Fenney, only a few sentences into the first chapter of \\"The Color of Law\\", the debut legal thriller from Mark Gimenez, doesn't seem so funny after you realize this theme permeates the entire novel. As a matter of fact, after reading this book, you would think that basically all lawyers--or at least those who make any significant money at their job--are corrupt. Given the fact the US has the best legal system in the world, I think the law profession, or at least the corporate law subdivision, gets a little bit of a bad rap in this particular story.So, why the four stars? Because, despite the grave tone of excessive greed and corruption in corporate law the story portrays, the book is a high quality page turner. The story is very smartly crafted and the characters are well-developed. While the stereotyping of the extremes of Dallas society was overdone (the ultra rich white class consisting of evil, greedy racists and bigots; opposed to the poor, uneducated minorities who are victims of their environment and always manage to stay a rung higher on the morality ladder), the story is enthralling enough to get the reader beyond the discrepancies and look at the larger picture: the fact that good ultimately triumphs over evil, even in an unfairly tiered society.The main character is A. Scott Fenney, a.k.a, Scotty, a former football star-turned-lawyer with the the expensive mansion, cars, and trophy wife. As the plot pans out, we find that Scotty is at the crossroads of his life. He has a line drawn in the sand in front of him and has two options: cross the line and become a permanent part of the evil rich upper crust of society with a guaranteed comfortable life, or stop short of crossing over and regain the ethics and morals lost in his rapid rise to the top of the corporate law world. Of course if he chooses the latter, he will pay the price by losing all the comforts that come with being a dishonest, cheating lawyer, including his job, so-called friends, and wife.I felt this novel fell slightly short of the high accolades it received (i.e. nomination for The International Thriller Award for Best Novel) due to the overly dramatic dehumanization of those who have attained wealth in corporate law, the unintentional sterotyping, and certain small discrepancies in what the law allows versus what the law allows in this book. But the exceptional story line and fast pace were delivered in a such a solid voice by Mark Gimenez that taking a turn through the pages of this novel is essential for those hooked on the legal thriller genre. Simply seeing Scotty's rapid transformation from a greedy, non-caring corporate attorney to a defender of all that's right is enough to make you stand up and salute Old Glory.The bottom line is \\"The Color of Money\\" delivers. It conveys what most readers are looking for in an interesting thriller: a coherent, fast paced tale; a twist or two; a lead character who comes to see the light and thus becomes the hero; and, last but not least, a happy ending. This is fiction that touches the heart."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Wow, all lawyers are not that greed-minded. Guess it makes for a better read.

The author creates a detailed, vivid portrait of the legal profession, urban development, the Texas judicial system and the city of Dallas.

The wife, neighbors and the country club scene are quite convincing.The precocious girls are charming but as a high school teacher I rarely encouter teanage students half as insightful as the story's two nine year olds. Several of the supporting characters also seem a little too type cast.The plot has good drama and reads strong until the end.

Shawanda says she didn't kill the Senator's son but it was her gun that ended the life of the violent spoilt 30 year old and she had taken his car which was found not far from where she lived in the projects.Scott has no choice but to take the case and like everyone else believes Shawanda to be guilty but something happens to Scott during the process of him going through the motions of seeming to represent this unfortunate young woman. Scott suddenly finds out he has a conscience and that even though he still believes that Shawanda is guilty he has every intention of fighting for her God given right to a fair trial, and from then on he finds out that he is not only fighting for Shawanda's life, he is also fighting for his own, and that of his daughter Boo and Shawanda's daughter Pajame who he rescued from the Projects and bought home to stay with him and Boo.A riveting read from the first page to the last, I read it in one sitting and then read it again, a great story with a twist and sting in the tale that leads up to a climatic and suspenseful court scene in which Scott suddenly realises the shocking truth, Shawanda is actually not guilty of the murder of the Senator's son and that another is guilty of the crime she is standing trial for..."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"First book for me by this author and hoping there are more!

A hotshot young lawyer in a prestigious Dallas law firm: the multi-million dollar mansion in Dallas' most exclusive neighborhood, the Ferrari, the seven-figure salary, the trophy wife. A. Scott lives the American dream - from humble blue-collar origins to Dallas God thanks to his steely-eyed determination and a knack for knocking over would be tacklers on the SMU gridiron. On the other side of the ledger, Shawanda Jones, black hooker and heroin addict from the wrong side of Dallas who is also accused of murdering the son of US Senator and aspiring presidential candidate Mack McCall. A wily old judge traps the unsuspecting Fenney into representing Shawanda, pro bona, setting off alarms of indignation and outrage from Fenney's white-shoe law firm. Not a bad set up, more than worthy of a gripping Grisham fable of crime scene reconstruction and courtroom drama.But it's down hill from there. \\"The Color of Law\\" reads like Gimenez starts out wanting to be John Grisham, shifts to Tom Wolfe along the way, but soon is sounding a lot like Michael Moore. While billed as a legal thriller, it is really merely a tired rant on the evils and inequities of American society, one man's indignant but hardly profound discovery that \\"wow, life just isn't fair!\\" Unlike Wolfe's acerbic wit which skewers evenly without regard to race or social strata, crusader Gimenez spreads the stereotype so thick on his plastic caricatures of characters that his message backfires, becoming a parody of the injustices he tries so earnestly to condemn.In Gimenez's fantasy world, all that is evil stems from white wealth and power - from the country clubs and boardrooms of Scott Fenney and his ilk. Meanwhile, for purity, righteousness, and honor, you need to travel to only as far as Dallas' projects or caddy shacks, where virtue is found among whores and dope addicts whose only crime was being born the wrong color. Like \\"Pretty Woman's\\" Julia Roberts, Gimenez's Shawanda has a heart of gold, a dedicated and doting mother whose heroine addiction is merely the price one pays for living in the projects. But of all the cardboard characters, none are more (unintentionally) entertaining than Scott's wife Rebecca, uber-bitch and social climber of Olympic caliber, a human being so shallow and mean that by comparison Leona Helmsly is Mother Teresa. Rebecca's pretentious persona is so over-the-top she could step into the frames of \\"South Park\\" as is. But unlike \\"South Park's\\" darkly humorous satire, Gimenez is dead serious, and expects the reader to share his indignation. Fenney's pending downfall and concurrent social awakening are all too painfully obvious as the author preaches and proselytes from a pulpit of self-righteousness only a true liberal could appreciate. When Gimenez finally gets around to a trial, there are initially some genuinely suspenseful moments, but this also soon drifts into ham fisted made-for-TV-movie-like schmaltz, complete with an actual Perry Mason moment.In the final analysis, a mind numbing fairy tale of dated platitude. If you are looking for some truly engaging legal drama, try Michael Connelly's outstanding \\"The Lincoln Lawyers'. Or, if you'd prefer biting social satire with believable characters, witty dialog, and a rapier edge, Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" is still the classic that Giminez, one would guess, tried to emulate while failing so miserably."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"The Color of Law far surpassed my expectations.

Really enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I liked the plot and characters quit a bit, especially the two nine-year-old girls, who steal the show. I would read a follow-up with these characters, mostly because of the girls.However, I am a criminal defense attorney, and I have some problems with the legal stuff:1. A federal judge would never appoint a real estate attorney to defend a capital murder case, no matter how smart the guy is.2. The court scenes are poorly done. This book isn't really about that, but still, if Giminez is going to keep writing, he should get some advice from a trial attorney. I spent a summer in Texas doing a clerkship when I was in law school. I saw how voir dire is done there, and it's nothing like the portrayal in this book.3. The lack of ethics of the big firm attorneys is terribly exagerated. Only a very few attorneys do the stuff that this book presents as common place.For these reasons, I was surprised to learn that Gimenez is an attorney.Still, the book is well-written, easy to read, and engaging. I'll give the author another chance if he writes more."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I ordered this book based on the recommendation of a friend and am happy I did! It's fast-paced and the first book I've read in a long time that keeps me up past my bedtime--I have a hard time putting it down to go to sleep. I've also learned a lot about Dallas. I can't wait to read the other books by Mark Gimenez!"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I think this book is terrific. Fenny is a lawyer that has everything.

We have good and bad lawyers, murder, the rich and poor, black and white,happiness and strong sadness, all the luxurys and then hit rock bottom. I think the Author has good insight into all things legal. With this he has written a story that will stick in your mind for years to come. \\"Having everything\\" is strongly explained within these pages. Amazingly it is not always wealth. I highly recommend this novel, I will probably read it again in a year or so. That is something I never do."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"This book starts with a bang and never let go. You will feel for all the characters in the book. There really aren't big twists and turns, just good writing that make you feel what the characters are feeling. A. Scott Fenney, ESQ. has a great life as a partner in a big law firm in Dallas. Big house, a Ferrari, a beautiful wife and a great little girl called Boo. Then one day everything changes, and A. Scott is fighting the biggest battle he ever fought. He is fighting for his life and the life of a poor hooker accused of murdering the son of a very influential Senator who is running for the President of the US.The book reads like a storm. It is hard to put down. There is no back in time and back to the future. It is just strait forward story telling that keeps you glued to it. Pick it up; you will not be disappointed by this great debut of a new writer, Mr. Mark Gimenez. I will be looking forward to his new book...whenever it comes out."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"It's not a deep and philosophical commentary on life, lawyers or race ralations and I don't think that it was intended to be.

The characters seemed so real that several days after I finished the book I was still thinking of them as real people. A review called the book a mix of To Kill A Mockingbird and Law and Order. Because To Kill A Mockingbird was mentioned throughout I kept expecting sad things to happen, but they did not-thank goodness. This author is up to John Grisham caliber. I am anxious for another book by him. I hope he can keep up the suspense/tension."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"\\"The Color of Law\\" is an unashamed clone of Harper Lee's novel, updated for a modern audience and written with a very clear eye towards a Hollywood adaptation. \\"Color\\" is first and foremost a white Yankee liberal's wet dream, featuring a likeable, born-again-liberal attorney of working-class background; his Ebonically-correct, inherently noble victim (heroin addict and prostitute Shawanda Jones); and a large and colorful cast of bigoted Southern gentry depicted as such loathsome creatures that the reader can't help but hate them. Gimenez covers the bases by also providing a pair of angelic little girls who never fail to come up with the sort of cutesy truisms that are perfectly designed for theatre trailers or 30 second TV commercial bites. One is the attorney's daughter (nicknamed Boo, just to make sure the \\"Mockingbird\\" allusions come across with as blatantly as possible); and the other is \\"Pajamae\\", Shawanda's daughter, who is a carefully-crafted amalgamation of \\"Arnold\\" from \\"Different Strokes\\", \\"Dee\\" from \\"What's Happening\\", and \\"Rudi\\" from the \\"Cosby\\" show.What makes \\"Color\\" a fun read, even with its prefabricated plot and storyline, is the cutting, but always rewarding, humor Gimenez employs in depicting the amoral culture of the Dallas Rich and Famous. The worship of money and good looks permeates every aspect of the city's elite and Gimenez doesn't hold back one iota in presenting them in as scathing a fashion as possible. Of course, the flipside is that the downtrodden blacks occupying the city's slums are all of saintly mien, bearing their suffering with passivity and dignity and waiting wide-eyed and hopeful for a white liberal Savior to Deliver them from the curse of Racism.\\"The Color of Law\\" is by no means a courtroom drama per se; the storyline is little more than a one-dimensional affair upon which Gimenez hangs his satire of the Dallas political and legal establishment. Most readers will see the denouement coming well before they're half-way through the novel. But Gimenez is a skilled satirist and for that reason \\"Color\\" is one of the more entertaining books of its type in the crowded Legal Thriller field."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"A. Scott Fenney is as dislikeable a main character as you will ever find. He's a wealthy, Texan lawyer who has no morals and is proud of it. It takes an amazingly talented writer to create a character so distasteful then to slooowly bring you around to the other side and suddenly you find yourself rooting for the that jerk you hated a few chapters ago. Worth reading, worth buying, worth watching for his next book."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Color of Law is about as realistic as a fairy tale. The cardboard characters are straight from central casting.Lawyer-author Mark Gimenz has taken great liberties with the real practice of law to fashion a tv movie of a novel utterly lacking in believablity. No judge, federal or state, would appoint a lawyer with no criminal experience to defend an accused in a captial case as happens in Color of Law. No judge would permit the defense lawyer to literally testify for paragraphs on end in the guise of asking questions, without any foundation for the \\"questions\\" and without a single objection from the heavily experienced prosecutor (whose career aspirations are tied to winning the case). Couple this with a heroin addicted prostitute defendantwho manged to take her cuddly daughter to church every Sunday,a star lawyer with a trophy wife who has absolutely no feeling whatsoever for her cuddly daughter,a senator seeking the presidency who is so protective of his image that he employs a heavy handed thug fired from government service as his body guard and fixer and you have a novel that loses its entertainment value to an utter lack of credulity."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"The author made it very difficult for me to suspend my disbelief, but he did manage to move the story along, and somehow I managed to finish the novel, so I am giving it two stars in an act of seasonal generosity. Anyone with the slightest familiarity with the criminal justice system will realize how absurd the plot is, and anyone at all should see how laughable the characters are.A. Scott Fenney has done well by his ruthless, unprincipled approach to the practice of law but he finally takes the high road only when an ethical dilemma comes along that can destroy him. This lawyer who has no criminal defense experience is appointed to represent a prositute who is accused of killing the son of a presidential contender by a judge who, ignoring a sea of highly competent defense lawyers, appoints Fenney because he wants Shawanda to have the best representation possible. Instead of writing a serious story of complex characters who lack the moral equipment to contend with legal and human ethics (not entirely mutually exclusive) we have a rant by the author against what I suppose are subjects of his personal grievances. The reviewer who said that Gimenez starts out as John Grisham, goes to Tom Wolfe, then ends up as Michael Moore got it right. Unfortunately, Gimenez seems to think that his incessant references to To Kill A Mockingbird (even to the point of having Fenney's daughter named Boo) will help some of the lustre of that fine work to cause his poor effort to shine in its reflected light.Nevertheless, I must admit that the novel was entertaining to some extent, and I kept turning pages despite myself. I have a feeling that the author can do better."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"A particularly delicious story! My reading group and I enjoyed every moment! What a joy to have such a wonderful new author to look for in the bookstores. Congratulations on a splendid book."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"In his strong debut legal thriller \\"The Color of Law,\\" Mark Gimenez keeps a tempo going that makes it impossible to put down.A. Scott Feeney was football hero at SMU, married the head cheerleader, owns a home in the tony Dallas suburb of Highland Park and is the youngest partner in the most prominent law firm in \\"Big D.\\" In short, he has the perfect life.After giving an especially disingenuous speech about legal idealism he is assigned a pro bono case by a Federal Judge. He must defend a black prostitute hooked on heroin who is accused of murdering the debauched son of very wealthy Texas Senator---who is the Presidential frontrunner for his party.A. Scott assumes she is guilty. However, if he exposes the son's sleazy past, he may save her from the death penalty. This does not please the Senator.After the powerful Senator calls in favors all over Dallas, A. Scott has his mortgage called, his Ferrari repossessed, the country club membership gone, fired by his largest client and his firm...the perfect life evaporated.He rediscovers his conscience and decides to give his best effort.We know he will prevail, but the how keeps you reading into the wee hours.I was so engrossed in his story telling that it was only near the end of the book that I started to wonder who really committed the murder."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"This book is fun, but I don't really consider it a legal thriller at all. It is instead a rather satirical look at the life of a rich white middle-aged lawyer in Dallas. We get a lot of jokes aimed at lawyers, Dallas, Republicans, and materialistic yuppies in general.I used to work as a attorney for a big firm, and I find much of the legal plotline of this book to be absurd. For example, there is a scene where a white-shoe law firm throws a pool party for its summer interns, filled with bimbos in bikinis. Many of the bimbos are there to sexually proposition the attorneys. A real law firm would never do this -- a sexual harassment suit would be inevitable! But that is a common occurrence in the rather silly plotline of this novel.If you're looking for a comedic novel, this book is a good choice. I enjoyed it for what it was and laughed a lot. But if you're looking for thrills with a realistic plotline (like John Grisham or Scott Turow), skip this book."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Finally a legal thriller I can feel good about. A. Scott gives up a lot to do what is right. I couldn't put this book down. It was very well written, especially for a first novel by this author. I'm looking forward to more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Scott Fenny, protagonist of THE COLOR OF LAW by Mark Gimenez, has it all. He is a lawyer in a very successful law firm, he has a beautiful wife, a smart daughter and lives in a lovely gated community complete with country club and golf course. After giving a stirring speech at a bar luncheon about Atticus Finch of To Kill A Mocking Bird, he is chosen by an impressed judge to represent, pro bono, a black prostitute and heroine addict, Shawanda Jones who is accused of murdering the no-good son of a US Senator and presidential candidate. He attempts to push the job off on one of his not too successful law school buddies but Shwanda isn't having it. Scott Fenny finds himself in a predicament: either he defends Shawanda and offends the Senator or he refuses and is shown up to be a hypocrite who worships money and not justice. Either way, his career is in jeopardy. His social climbing wife is very angry with him and fears her position in society will be jeopardized. The Senator is also bringing subtle and not so subtle pressure, as is the judge who chose him. His nine-year-old daughter seems to be the only understanding soul in his life now. Will he do the right thing? Or will he bow to the pressure?Mark Gimenez keeps the suspense and tension going non-stop in this fascinating story of the rich and famous and the poor and lonely. It is a real page-turner that will make you keep reading until you reach the final page. There is considerable commentary on our society today and what we are really all about. I would recommend this book for those who love guessing what's going to happen next.Reviewed by Alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ(tm) Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I liked this first novel from Mark Giminez a lot. It held my interest throughout the entire story because it was an honest story. The situations and reactions were real. The ending lived up to the rest of the book because the author didn't cop out."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"Color of Law is an entertaining story. I read it cover-to-cover on a cross-country flight. The storyline has a quick pace and while, at times, predictable never becomes boring. I recommend the book enthusiastically if you enjoy legal thrillers.In rection to some other reviews:Gimenez will not win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction as Harper Lee did for \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" in 1962. Also, the author is not as polished a social critic as Tom Wolfe whose first book was published in 1965 -- more than 40 years ago. If those are the measuring sticks used for comparison, then Gimenez is doing well.Also, reviewers should have the good judgment to review the book without re-telling the plot, the twists, and the conclusion.Finally, I see that reviewers throw out charges of racism against blacks and whites. Well, there are heros and villians, educated and uneducated, good and bad in all skin colors. The racism accusations here are misplaced.Go enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"I am not going to go into every detail of the story. In short, it was a very enjoyable read.The pace of the book was good and made for a good read over the weekend. Were there a few things that I thought were a little much? Yes - The hooker with a heart of gold, the 9yr old that acts smarter than most 20 yr olds, the constant commentary about Dallas & money, a guy who is revered for rushing for 193 yrds against UT, and I thought the references to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" went a little overboard. A very good book for his first effort though. I look forward to his second effort to see if he is effective writing about something outside his normal circle of life (the author was part of a large Dallas law firm)."},{"Title":"The Color of Law: A Novel","review":"THE COLOR OF LAW, by Mark Gimenez, has a deep and profound conscience as you read beyond its colorful characters and the societal backdrop of greed and arrogance. This timeless story is a message of redemption and finding one's soul. A. Scott Fenney begins as a man rich in all things material and poor in spirit. In the end, he found what it truly means to be wealthy. This novel is a praiseworthy book with a righteous message for our masses."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"What a book! Finally! It is stated that this book is not a Wicca 101 book and they could not have been more correct. It is 1000 times better than a Wicca 101 book. This book not only explains this religion to our friends and family but it also explains what this religion is to those investigating it as a possible religion of their own. I have read many books on Wicca and they explain what the holidays are, who the Goddess and God are and how to do a ritual. Wicca Demystified tells us the \\"why's\\" behind the practical application, it tells us the ramifications of our actions and much, much more. Any new student should read this book first. Wicca Demystified will clear up many misunderstandings of the Wiccan religion. Way to go Bryan."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"This book eschews commercialized versions of Wicca to deliver frank and truthful information to the audiences needing it the most. It is useful for individuals who are investigating Wicca as a religion, but it is especially helpful for the potentially confused (and scared) friends and family.An avalanche of stereotypes and misinformation in this society about what Wicca is and who Wiccans are subsequently leaves the friends and families of the practitioners in a bind. They might want to be supportive, but those family members and friends do not necessarily know where to turn for affirming information. Despite Wicca being recognized as a religion (by institutions such as the United States military!) accurate information about Wicca remains to find.The tone of this book is open-minded, Lankford is able to empathize with his readers own path. He is an advanced witch but does not forget that potential readers and readers are entering with a dearth of information about this religion. Pulling rank on them would have been easy but he is instead empathetic to their own journey towards acceptance of friends, family, and themselves."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"Oh my, this is the book about Wicca that I've been waiting for. I have been Wiccan for twenty years and I have needed this book for at least the last fifteen. Finally, I have a book that I would be willing to hand to my mother or co-workers without having to apologize for some of the things it says. This book gives you an honest look at what Wicca is and why people choose to be Wiccan without trying to convert you or make you run screaming. For Christians this book gives you an insight into the Wiccan world, helping you understand why someone would choose to be Wiccan, while letting you interpret the information for yourself and draw your own conclusions. For Wiccans this book is the best resource I've found for helping others understand our beliefs. It gives a great description of all the basic Wiccan beliefs and misconceptions as well as delving into the types of questions people ask us about our religion.I didn't agree with everything in this book but Mr. Lankford went out of his way to tell people he doesn't expect everyone to agree with everything he says. However, the things I disagreed with challenged me to examine my own beliefs, deepening my own connection to spirit. It's like your having a conversation with the author where he seems to say, \\"This is how I see the world, now how do you see it.\\"This is the best and most helpful Wiccan book that I have seen in years. It is insightful, humorous and fun to read. I bought this book on my way home from work and thought I would read the introduction at bedtime, but when I looked up again it was 2:00 in the morning. Not only do you need this book, you will want several copies so you can loan it to friends or donate a copy to the library."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"Bryan Lankford has given us a gem. \\"Wicca Demystified\\" is a well-written, insightful and very reader-friendly book. It explains the religion of Wicca in a very down-to-earth and straightforward manner minus all the hype and sensationalism all too often present in many books on the subject. This is a book I would be proud to give my friends and family who wanted to understand what Wicca is all about."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"Mr. Lankford does a wonderful job explaining what Wicca is and what Wicca is not. He understand the ins and outs of this religion and is able to clearly explain it for anyone to understand. If you are Wiccan and have family who want to know more about what you do, this is the book to get them! This author comes across as a person who knows how scary it can be for someone to hear that a loved one is Wiccan or a Witch. He does a fantastic job of helping them through that fear by providing them with the information for a better understanding of something they've only heard scary stories about. Ignorance breeds fear and this book will definitely put an end to anyone's ignorance about Wicca/Witchcraft!"},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"I found this book very helpful for explaining an often misunderstood religion. If you prefer to get the real story rather than succumbing to commercial imagery when forming your opinions, this is a great source. Similarly, if you seek a clear and articulate way to express your own similar views, this book will empower you with a roadmap for doing so. If you fear for someone who seems to have gone astray and want to get the facts from a credible source, this is a must read. Well written and free of drama sometimes included to sell more books! Very refreshing."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"Mr. Lankford has written an excellent book that looks at the Wicca religion in an intelligent and sometimes funny manner. This book debunks common myths about the religion and informs the readers about the real meaning of the Wiccan religion. Having been Wiccan myself for many years, I found the book to be one of the clearest and easiest to understand on a complicated and emotionally charged subject. I have already purchased several for family and non-Wiccan friends to help them understand my religion."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"This is an amazing book. The synopsis says that this book lets you look at the soul of Wicca. I didn't think it was possible for a book to explain the soul of a religion and explain so clearly to a non-member why someone else would be a member of that particular religion but this book did exactly that. This book is also an enjoyable read although it presents vast amounts of information it does so in a style that is very reader friendly."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"I had the pleasure to read \\"Wicca Demystified\\".Being a Wiccan myself, I have read many books about Wicca and I looked at this one as another of the many inconsequential ones, but this is a truly exceptional book.There is much to know about Wicca that common people does not understand or, does not want to understand. Perhaps this book will reach the people who, out of fear, bigotry, or whatever, attack Wicca and will let them see what truly Wicca is about.By going from the very basic beliefs, Mr. Lankford reviews the different aspects of what we believe; our spiritual experiences; how we see the Divine, male and female; how we see those that disagree with us and the \\"live and let live\\" philosophy. He also talks about our celebrations, the Wicca Rede\\" and the \\"Three Fold Law\\".My wish would be that everyone would read this magnificent book. Everyone would learn something but especially they would see that there is nothing to be afraid of."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"This book is great for any curious person, beginning wiccan or pagan that just wants to explain what it's all about to there friends and family. It covers alot of those pesky questions that even a beginning pagan might not know all the answers to or how exactly to explain them. It's also a good book to own for those situations or just to have a referance to look back on when your trying to explain yourself to a group of strangers that just found out that your wiccan or pagan. Overall it's just a smart edition to put in your library."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"I have recently come out of the broom closet with my family. This is the book I chose to use to explain my spiritual practice to them. They had been reading some very bad things and were very upset. The format of the book with questions and answers was just the thing to settle their fears. I highly recommend this book. Bryan Lankford explains very clearly some of the most pressing questions non-wiccans have concerning our beliefs. It is also very good for a beginning wiccan to learn more about the faith."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"I'm doing a tlak for a comparative religion class on Wicca and this is the book I am recommending for those who would like to look into Wicca another step beyond what I can talk about in 45 minutes."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"Admittedly the goals of this book are fine, but it misses the mark by having way too many details about Wicca to serve the purpose of explaining this way of life to family and friends. The book WHEN SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS WICCAN does a much better job. Nevertheless this book is interesting and worth reading, but does not serve its intended audience."},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"I have to say that I was surprised by the quality of the book, and impressed by the writer. I have lost hope of sorts in finding a book that did a proper explanation of paganism of any kind, Wicca or no. So when it was suggested I read this book by a friend, I did so with a skeptical eye and jaded heart. He won me over with the first couple pages. It's a down to earth read that presents all of the information in a very mature, non-threatening way that is an excellent reference for concerned family members/friends. It can also be used by the curious new comers to the Wiccan faith paths as to the core of the beliefs, rather than having outlined what is in every 101 book in the New Age section of the book store.I would not hesitate to recommend this book, and will probably be purchasing copies in the future to gift to family members, friends, or friends in need of a good reference to give their families! My copy will actually be sent to my mother and younger sister when I'm done with it! Kudos to you sir! and thank you!"},{"Title":"Wicca Demystified: A Guide for Practitioners, Family and Friends","review":"Bryan Lankford has put a gentle and humerous hand upon an incredibly sensitive subject - Religion. He stayed true to his word when he said that this book is not intended to convert, but to inform the reader of the basic tenets concerning Wicca. Unlike Buckland, Bryan answers the questions that many family members, friends and co-workers often pose to a practitioner in ways that are humorous, non-confrontational and in layperson's terms. It is as if he is sitting in a chair having a conversation with you!Since most people fear what they do not understand, I truly believe that if people of all different paths or faiths would read this introductory glimpse into Wicca, discrimination that is based on fear which is fed by misunderstanding and/or ignorance will be a distant, gray memory - rewritten and replayed with the brilliant, vibrant colors of tolerance and respect."},{"Title":"The economists","review":"Leonard Silk has written an excellent book about five great Economists of our time. He covers Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, Wassily Leontif and Kenneth Boulding.Silk's conversational style makes this book not only informative but interesting as well.He manages to cover both the theory and some personal history which is a great credit to the man, since most books on the lives of Economists usually lean too heavily one way or the other. Silk is not afraid of stepping out of the \`academe' and speaking bluntly about some of the areas where Economists have gone wrong. He reserves his harshest criticisms for Friedman, whom he considers not only simplistic, but hiding his political preferences behind the smokescreen of his so-called positive economics.\\"Friedman's methodological insistence on the free market as the basic hypothesis of positive economic analysis conveniently dovetailed with his ideological faith in laissez-faire and his opposition to government controls and planning\\"... p.74This \`attack' on Friedman was what made me give this book less than 5 stars, I felt that Silk should have been impartial when discussing these men and saved the venom for another book. He does redeem himself in chapter six however, where he discusses the economic profession in the 1970s and how the movement toward abstract economic analysis was/is making economics lose touch with reality.Silk has some very insightful views into what it is serious Economists should be doing, he likens those economists who would rather work within the strict confines of neo-classical economics to the man who having lost his keys after a late night out, would rather search for it under the streetlight where there is some light rather than on the path he has traveled.

But be forewarned that the majority of the weight and resistence training exercises require AT LEAST a set of dumbbells and a workout bench. Many require gym machines. And Roberts does not offer any alternative exercises for people who don't belong to a gym, or who lack the funds, space, or inclination to fill their homes with gym equipment. This may not be a problem for \\"stars\\", or single people without kids. But for anyone with a full-time job and young children, this is a significant shortcoming. Furthermore, Roberts offers very little detail about how to achieve the nutritional goals he presents to the reader. You will not find detailed recipes here, only recommendations (drink a fruit smoothie for breakfast, eat more greens and fish, etc). On the up side, this book is a fast read, and very nice looking in a coffee table book sort of way, and might serve as a good motivator for anyone embarking on a new year's resolution."},{"Title":"90-day Fitness Plan","review":"This book helped me glide right into eating healthy.

The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History","review":"&quot;No other publication gives such comprehensive and up-to-date guidance on tracing British ancestry and researching family history. Illustrated throughout with more than ninety examples of the major types of records, and with detailed lists of further reading, Ancestral Trails will be the essential companion and guide for all family historians.&quot; Anthony Camp, Director, Society of Genealogists.This excellent publication was created in association with the prestigious Society of Genealogists, perhaps akin to the US' National Genealogical Society. The author Mark D. Herber is a solicitor who began researching his family in 1979. He has successfully traced some of his lines back to around 1580.Indeed I was impressed with this 674 page &quot;encyclopedia.&quot; (Quotes added for emphasis!) The bibliography alone is twenty-two pages. My experience with English records has been limited to early parish records in Devon and some Court of Canterbury wills, so I was most eager to have the opinion of three friends who do extensive English, Welsh and Irish research, and indeed are successful in helping others make strong headway in their research. You can imagine the excitement at our local LDS Family History Center as they poured over the book with uncustomary enthusiasm!The consensus is that ANCESTRAL TRAILS is as definitive of British research as Ancestry's THE SOURCE is of American genealogy. Lew, a 1st generation Brit, was impressed with the chapter on military records, and made a note to order the book forthwith. Elsie, born of English immigrant parents, had been inquiring previously about manor court records and found this publication provided more than she had found in explanation elsewhere. I was impressed with the 94 illustrations, including typical certificates of vital records, representative samples of wills and the like.Also impressive is the attention given to beginning genealogists. Basics such as pedigree charts, personal recollections &amp; memorabilia, spelling, handwriting, dates, obtaining certificates and organization of collected materials are discussed with ample illustrations.Additional chapters include: General Problems Encountered by Researchers, Civil Registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths, Census Returns, Parish Registers, Churchyards and Cemeteries, Directories, Combining Sources, Archives, Libraries and Family History Societies, Wills and Administrations,Catholic, Nonconformist and Jewish Records, Marriage and Divorce, Maps, Land Registrations and Property Records, Local and Social History, Newspapers and Elections,Parish and Town Records, Records of the Army, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, Records of Shipping and Seaman, Records of Trades, Professions and Business, Oaths, Taxation and Insurance Records Records of Civil and Ecclesiastical Courts, Records of the Criminal Courts and Criminals, Education, Peerages, the Gentry, Famous People and Heraldry, Further Property Records, Tracing Migrants and Living Relatives, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands Immigration, Emigration and Investigation AbroadAppendices included essential information under the following topics: Codes for areas and volumes in the GRO Indexes, Indexes to other GRO records, Chapman County Codes, Seize Quarters of Bessie Maude Symes, Extracts from the Bullied and Keates family trees, Public Record Office Information Leaflets, County Record Offices &amp; other archives, Commencement dates of the reigns of English and British monarchs, Wills &amp; Administrations in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury: A Summary of Finding-Aids, Records of the Court of Chancery: A summary of Finding-Aids.Owing only to its tiny print, you'll need a magnifying glass in addition to your bi-focals to glean all that's contained in Ancestral Trails.

The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History","review":"The field of genealogical research in Great Britain is littered with literature. This scepter'd isle has a long history of excellently preserved source records, an enthusiastic community of genealogists, and a wealth of authors willing to guide the enthusiasts through the records. Given this background, it is difficult to imagine that a new work on British genealogical research could quickly become a new \\"standard reference\\". Mark Herber has made his Ancestral Trails just such a standard. Ancestral Trails, written in association with the Society of Genealogists in the United Kingdom, is 688 pages of top quality writing, organization, and completeness of coverage. It takes a textbook approach to the subject of genealogical records, leading the reader from the more basic sources such as civil registration and parish records on to the more specialized such as military and educational records. Far from being dry in style, the author uses well chosen examples from his own years of researching his ancestors to explain how the record types in question can be used by the family historian. Some authors who use examples from their own research can detract from their work by doing so. In contrast, Mark Herber has made his personal examples of real research situations enhance the text because of their relevancy to his topics. Nearly one hundred examples of significant records are included as illustrations. Researchers experienced in using British records as well as beginners will find this encyclopedic guide useful. The author covers newly-available resources such as the 1881 Census Index and provides excellent research advice and several clever shortcuts to using this new finding aid. Those researchers with Essex ancestors will be doubly blessed by this book as many of Mark Herber's examples are from research in that county. The extensive bibliography really sets this book apart as a new standard reference. Almost one thousand bibliographic references are conveniently referenced from within the book's 30 chapters. Researchers familiar with particular record types will be pleasantly surprised to find Ancestral Trails referring to an exhaustive list of other works on the topic. The author's writing style lucidly describes the important considerations when working with a record type and seamlessly refers the reader to the more specialized works of other authors for greater detail. Ancestral Trails is a thick and thorough tome and an excellent addition to the research knowledge of anyone with British ancestry."},{"Title":"Ancestral Trails. The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History","review":"I checked this book out from my local library because I felt that I was floundering with my British research. This book answered all the questions that I had, and much, much more. I'm not going to write a long review of this because there are a couple of other excellent reviews here already. I just wanted to add that there is a second edition of this book, from January 2004, available in England, but unfortunately not in the US yet. Because the internet is so valuable to those of us trying to do research from abroad, I decided to spend the extra money and order the newer edition from www.amazon.co.uk . It is more expensive, but it seemed worth it to me to have the most recent edition. If that's important to you, check the publication date on the edition advertised."},{"Title":"Ancestral Trails.

I needed this book quickly, and was grateful that Amazon.com was able to rush it to me the next day.FamilyTapestry"},{"Title":"Ancestral Trails. The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History","review":"When a new edition appears of a genealogical reference book I have found especially useful, I don't necessarily, automatically, buy the new edition. If the updated information is primarily new addresses and phone numbers, but the meat of the book has stayed essentially the same, . . . well, one can always look up that sort of thing on the Internet. The first edition of Herber's fine work -- which has already acquired the label \\"Bible of British genealogy\\" -- appeared in 1997 and ran to 674 pages of extremely thorough discussion of sources for research in Britain. The second edition, published in association with the Society of Genealogists, is fully one-third longer. After paging through it at a conference, I counted up my pennies and bought it. And I haven't regretted the expense. While most of my own family lines are what some would call \\"Old American,\\" their progenitors having arrived here before the 19th century, the same is not necessarily true of many of the in-laws and friends on whose behalf I have carried out research. And even though our legal system owes much to the English common law, there are decided differences between the bureaucratic history of Britain's unitary form of government and our own federal system. Until comparatively recently, Britain's principal record-keeping body was the civil parish, and while many of the old volumes from the \\"parish chest\\" are now held by the Public Record Office and its branches, they are still organized by the old jurisdictions. Britain never had \\"public lands\\" open for claim and settlement, so ownership of real property was traditionally proved by a thick stack of successive title deeds and conveyances. This system, too, has been modernized, but the family researcher will need to understand the older system. The novice British researcher is often told that unless his 19th or 18th century ancestor was wealthy, or at least middle class, there's no point in searching for a will. And while it's true that earlier British laws of inheritance spelled out how one's interest in real property would descend to one's heirs (by primogeniture, usually), even a workman had personal possessions and the tools of his trade that he could leave to whomever he wished. One of my own ancestors appears to have arrived in America as part of the British military contingent sent to fight \\"The War of Jenkins' Ear\\" (my favorite name for any war, any time . . .), and even though that was in 1739, I was amazed to discover how complete the surviving regimental records were. The author will lead you through that maze, too. In fact, there is no area of recordkeeping, governmental, religious, or private, that Herber does not give consideration to. He's a lawyer by training and he possesses the trait of making careful distinctions between matters that appear similar but are actually different. He's also a very talented wordsmith with the knack of clear and concise explanations of sometimes complex topics. Throughout the book, he uses anecdotes from his own researched family as examples, most of them thoroughly down to earth. This is not the sort of work most people would read straight through (though some of us enjoy doing exactly that), but you should keep it in mind when you discover that link to a British lineage."},{"Title":"Ancestral Trails.

While this book was published a number of years ago, it contains most of the research to date, and is based on collaborative data from major SCI centers in both the USA and England. While heavily focused on the medical model, it can be a valuable resource for both professionals working with people with SCI as well as those with SCI and their families."},{"Title":"The Still Point: Reflections on Zen and Christian Mysticism","review":"In my view, this book is a little masterpiece. Prof Johnston advances beyond Thomas Merton, to whose memory he dedicated this book. This sober and balanced appraisal of the possibilities of relating Zen Buddhist insight to Christian contemplation is most appropriate. This is a big cut above the pop-Zen books that flood today's markets. Prof Johnston has the rare gift of writing simply and yet perceptively about an aspect of Buddhism that is still too little understood by Westeners - scholars and non-scholars alike. This is an important book, bridging the much-debated 'mysticism gap' between East and West. The book as a whole has much to offer, not only to the Christian but the Westener who wishes to understand Zen. Prof Johnston sensitively differentiates Zen and Christian Experience, the later he interprets chiefly through the \\"passion of love\\", which is strikingly absent in Zen. I recommend this volume wholeheartedly to anyone concerned with the continued vitality of the Christian religion.

It is something I go back to again and again and recommend to friends and all seekers."},{"Title":"The Still Point: Reflections on Zen and Christian Mysticism","review":"Though this is not a recent book, it provides excellent context for overcoming rationalism. Johnston speaks of an impoverished, dehumanized West, rich in technology but poor in intuition, sick from lack of mysticism. He sees Western Christians turning to Zen because of a dissatisfaction with a Christianity that is too rational, too Cartesian, too juridical. Most of these Christians are probably ignorant of the mystical element in Christianity. The East still remembers that humans can adore the Infinite with the whole body. This is important to Christianity, which is incarnational. The true Christian life is not imitating Christ, but \\"becoming\\" Christ, embodying Christ. As the apostle Paul said, \\"not I, but Christ lives in me.\\" For this to happen, something must die. Zen's losing of the ego and finding the non-ego-self is in tune with Paul. Says Johnston: \\"I would suggest that the Zen technique can teach the Christian how to relax, how to be calm, how to think in a deeper way, how to dispose himself to receive God's love, how to conceive the truths of faith not only in his brain but in his whole body.\\""},{"Title":"Divorce Dirty Tricks","review":"Divorce Dirty Tricks by this team of attys. is the ultimate ininformation on how to get the proper legal representation including gutsy questions to ask an atty before you retain them.It is written in an easy to read and vastly interesting format.For every legal situation they provide various situations withvarious outcomes... and a concise wrap up called \\"Moral of the story\\".

Field starts out incredibly strong on a novel describing a young man dealing with the trauma of the death of his father, his now mute mother and the pressure of living in an environment where no one tells you what is right and what is wrong. This causes some problems as the lad grows older and begins to develope a mental illness that would be the true horror of the novel.Unfortunately, just as the novel reaches its climax and as some readers will say \\"really gets good\\", Field sort of folds up the story and you are really left hanging what was going to happen to the characters. I'm not sure if this is why there don't appear to be any other novels by her or what. It's sad because it was an interesting story that needed more flushing out. Most of Zebra's horror novels from the 80s suffered from this almost pulp style of writing, some managed to succeed with it (say Johnstone's Toy Cemetary) others failed.Field's novel is full of interesting characters, is quite graphic at times (be warned!) but fails as a complete story."},{"Title":"Wild Violets","review":"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR ADULTS WHO LIKE HORROR NOVELS.

The Sonora Desert proves inhospitable from the start as Martin drives off the road at night. In the morning, they find themselves buried under sand dunes that arrived rather quickly to inter their vehicle. The pair begins a terrible march in hostile conditions seeking help. There is nothing but sand everywhere until they reach rotting edifices under a rocky ledge. Needing rest they take shelter.Leigha finds a strange-looking talisman that seems to appear out of nowhere. Not long afterward, an elderly sorceress medicine woman Maranther appears once again apparently out of the air; she informs Martin that she abducted his woman and if he ever wants to see her again he will need to look back at what brought him and Leigha together; in their past lies their hope for a future.MARANTHER'S DECEPTION is a very intriguing tale that takes elements from a relationship family drama and fantasy, but places them inside a horror story; that is the skill of Nik C. Colyer as he effortlessly combines the sub-genres. The Vandorfors are a couple struggling to find commonality as he wants the great outdoors and she wants the arts. Their compromise seems to be the right thing, but instead leads to danger as the mysterious Maranther puts them through a relationship test like no other. The reason why and Martin's efforts to find and rescue his beloved spouse make for quite a vivid thriller; fans will taste the sand that is everywhere.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Maranther's Deception","review":"June 27, 2005Martin and Leigha Vandorfor have made an unusual pact: Leigha would spend 2 weeks in the scorching desert and in exchange Martin would accompany her for an entire thespian season.Their great outdoor adventure immediately takes a turn when they drive off the road and by morning find a sandstorm has buried them!At the deserts mercy, a tedious trek through parching sands leads them to a small cluster of decaying adobe structures that are tucked under a rock ledge.

So much so that in the main town on the island Leukas/Lefkadi there are Japanese signs telling the visitor that this is where Lafcadio Hearn spent his first years.Before Hearn went to Japan where he got married and where he stayed until he died, he had behind him a background as among other things a journalist in the USA. This probably helped him develop his writing as well as his ability to see what was happening around him (even if he had a terribly bad euesight).For one who is interested in Japanese culture and has read quite a few more modern books on Japan and Japanese religion it is refreshing to read Hearn's views from more than 100 years ago.

Sheed does a great job showing how the world's perspective has invaded our minds willingly or unwillingly and if we desire to grow in our faith we must not only have a Catholic will but also a Catholic intellect. The \\"both and\\" theme that is a common theme in theology is implied and put to practical use in this book. Most Catholics in the pews and unfortunately even in the pulpits are not always expressing an authentic Catholic perspective on the Church's teachings because of a combination of ignorance,sloth and weak faith. I am one of these slothful catholics that can attest to this reality that we need to hunger and thirst to truly know and love our Holy Mother Church as she reveals to us the infinite love of God. Although God has given us all of these lights and \\"graces to know Him and love Him we have not sought Him or meditated on the realities He reveals to us through His beloved Bride. Reading this book has deepened my love and knowledge of God as I try to meditate on trying to see the world through the eyes of Holy Mother Church. God created me and keeps me in existence even as I live only that I might seek,know,love and serve Him. I am currently in the seminary studying to be a catholic priest and give thanks and praise to God for helping me to mature in my faith that I may become another Christ through Mary.May God give me light that I may understand,love and accept the tenets of my Catholic faith that He reveals to me through Holy Mother Church.\\"At that time Jesus said, \\"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.Matthew 11:25"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Catechesis, dogma, spirituality, and everything you've forgotten or received a poor explanation about is covered here in easy to read English."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This book by Frank Sheed reminds us that our faith consists of not just emotionalism or sentiment, but must include our intellect as well.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"I learned so much from this book. It is not only a great apologetic for the Catholic faith, but it also emerges you in theology. Definitely some of the best exposition of the trinity I've ever read. A must read for anyone interested in anything!"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This is an excellent and engaging book. In the author's own words this is a book about seeing the universe the way the Church sees it because that is reality, and seeing reality is sanity. Seeing the world in any other way is not reality, and therefore insane. As a very early example Sheed writes,\\"...she [the Church] sees all things whatsoever held in existence from moment to moment by nothing but the continuing will of God that they should not cease to be. When she sees anything at all, in the same act she sees God holding it in existence. Do we? It is not merely a matter of knowing that this is so. Do we actually see it so? If we do not, then we are not living mentally in the same world as the Church. What is more, we are not seeing things as they are, for that is how they are.\\"Sheed's writing has a very academic tone to it. In fact he states up front that he is writing about the intellect, not the will. He is clear that salvation depends directly on the will, not the intellect, but at the same time he emphasizes that neglecting the intellect is to our own great disadvantage. In Sheed's own words,\\"But knowledge of the truth matters all the same. It matters for the reason we have already stated, namely, that every new thing known about God is a new reason for loving Him. It matters also...[because] in the appallingly difficult struggle to be good, the will is helped immeasurably by the intellect's clear vision of the real Universe.\\"and,\\"After all, the man who uses his intellect in religion is using it to see what is there. But the alternative to seeing what is there is either not seeing what is there, and this is darkness; or seeing what is not there, and this is error, derangement, a kind of double darkness. And it is unthinkable that darkness whether double or single should be preferred to light.\\"The academic tone to the book will definitely appeal to those who are more intellectually oriented, but the book is much more than pure academics. Sheed spent many years as a street minister and this comes through in the book, making each point hit home personally in one's own life.The book is written in three main parts: God, Creation, and Oneself. And within these three sections the author covers the whole gamut of the Catholic faith including: Thomistic proofs of God's existence, the mystery of the Trinity, God's creation of man, God's personal relationship with man, the life of Jesus Christ, the Church as the body of Christ, the sacraments, the human condition as viewed by the Church, heaven, angels, sanctifying grace, and so much more. In short it is an exceptionally good overview of what the Catholic church is about and how it sees the world.There are a few things one might want to be aware of before choosing or starting to read this book. First, as I've already mentioned, sometimes Sheed's writing, can have an academic air about it that might turn some people off. Many will appreciate the academic tone, but Sheed's passion for the intellect may at times be a little overbearing and rub some people the wrong way. If this is the case for you, try not to let it distract you too much. What Sheed has to say is excellent regardless.In the same way, with Sheed's passion for the intellect, sometimes his writing is not the easiest to read. For the most part his writing is very clear, but sometimes it can be just a little difficult to follow. I mention this simply because I would hate to see someone start the book and then stop reading it because it was more difficult to read than they expected. It is better to know up front that it might be a little difficult in spots, and be determined to push through it, than to give up entirely.Finally, the book was written in 1946 and updated in 1978, so some things may feel a bit dated. Again, I point this out simply so that one does not begin the book only to give up on it because it \\"sounds too old.\\" On the whole, everything Sheed has to say is just as relevant now as it was then.In summary, through a mix of theology and ministry this book provides an exceptionally good overview of how the Catholic church sees the world and what that means for us in our personal lives."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This book provides wonderful insights into what Catholics believe, with supporting arguments and justification. If you have ever been at a loss to explain your faith, you should read this book. It's written for lay people, not religious scholars, so it's pretty easy to understand."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This book opened my eyes to things I had thought about or pondered for over a decade. Multiple issues were presented concisely, simply, informatively, and in depth, all at the same time: Amazing! It is not dumbed dowm material but it an easy read simply because you get so into the book, as you would a good novel. If you think you know your faith, read this and learn you know very little (the section on the TRINITY ALONE IS WORTH IT)If you know little about your faith, this will teach and bolster a new love for the faith and drive you to want to learn move. Simply one of the greatest books ever to grace my desk."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"FRANK SHEED'S BOOK IS HEAVY READING AND A GREAT STUDY ON THEOLOGICAL MATTERS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE SELDOM EXPOSED AND CONTEMPLATED.

I have also read three of Sheed's other books (Theology for Beginners, To Know Christ Jesus and A Map of Life), and they are also wonderful. Thanks to Sheed, I finally understand my faith! Please see the other 5 star reviews below for more detail."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Reading Theology and Sanity is like reading C.S.Lewis, G.K.Chesterton,Pascal, Aquinas, Augustine, Kreeft,Schumacker combined to make a magisterial simple, yet not simplistic volume of essential theology. Every thinker can not afford to miss the joy that comes as a result of reading Sheed's work. It is utterly stunning. Protestants and Catholics alike may have a taste of what C.S. Lewis called:The serious business of heaven, namely, Joy. Sheed is one of my giants....thank God for himDavid Valencia"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"The late Frank Sheed (a Roman Catholic from Australia) wrote this book in the 1940s during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII. It was later republished by Ignatius Press and remains one of the most essential and unforgetable Catholic books in America.He talks greatly about free will, the creation of Man, the test of Angels and Men, the difference between free will and predestination (the Protestant Calvinist notion), the Sacrifice of the Mass, and more importantly---WHO IS GOD?I love it because it is a great in depth book of understanding Catholic Theology. The Scripture quotations are from the Douay Rheims Bible and the Revised Standard Version: Catholic Edition.I recommend this book for all Catholics and non-Catholics as well. It was one of the best textbooks I used for catechism class in my parish church."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This is the most comprehensive overview I have read regarding the overall Catholic philosophy. If you are not Catholic, you may be offended by the basic assertion that the Catholic view of the cosmos is the sane view. If you are Catholic, you will be rewarded with a thorough, precise description of Catholic world view. For this purpose, this book is even better than the Catechism."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Frank Sheed will coax you along to have a much clearer understanding of where you are in relation to God, and what is known about the mystery of that relationship."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Excellent, reasoned defense of Christianity and the Catholic faith. This apologetic is a classic, a must read for an informed Christian. Much easier to read than Chesterton, this book reminds me of C.S. Lewis in practical writing, with a more in depth examination of theology."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"I don't want to bore any reader with a lot of commentary; others here have praised this book and sufficiently wet the appetite, I hope, of potential buyers. Let me add only that this is probably among the best five books I have ever read in my 66 years on earth. I read a lot, usually between six and eight books a month since I was in my early teens. Sheen was a post-Vatican II layman before his time. He wrote Theology and Sanity in 1946, back when many thought that only the clergy were sufficiently instructed to write intelligently about theology. If you are Catholic, this book will strengthen your faith and inform you concerning many things you don't yet know(unless, of course, you are already a theologian). If you are Protestant, it will make you want to explore those aspects of Christ's teachings subtracted from the whole by 16th century revolutionists. If you are a non-believer, the book will make you decidedly uncomfortable, but you of all people should read it for that very reason."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This was a wonderful book; one that I needed to read given my questions concerning God and His role in our lives. I also needed to read this book to determine how it is that the Church continues to spread the word of God given that the Church is organized and run by man. Man, inherently, because of the fall of Adam, is prone to sin. So how is it that the Church, run by man, who is prone to sin, can be the one organization to espouse the \\"truth\\" of God and His Son, Jesus?The first aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was that Father Sheed takes some very complicated topics and puts them into plain English so that the lay person can understand them. Father Sheed's explanation of the trinity, one of the most complicated aspects of the Catholic Religion (in my opinion), was explained in a most wonderful way. It was explained so that I could understand it and without all the \\"religious\\" terminology that usually accompanies such explanations.The second aspect of the book that I enjoyed was the organization. He takes these issues from step one and then logically continues with the book up to the end. He takes the prior steps and incorporates them into later steps and wonderfully demonstrates how they all fit together.The third aspect of this book I loved was the explanation of why Jesus \\"lowered\\" himself to human form. Father Sheed had a wonderful way of explaining why is it was that Jesus came to do what he did. He ties this in with the fall of Adam and how the fall of Adam severed our relationship with God. Father Sheed also explains what \\"original sin\\" is and why we have it. It is not that the person born has sinned but has the sin of Adam just because we are human. Because of the fall, man was severed with God but Jesus came to \\"bridge\\" that gap and that is what he did.Do not get the idea that the \\"sanity\\" part of the book title means that if you don't live the Catholic Way perfectly that one is insane. This is not what that term means in the context of the book. Sanity means seeing the world as it really is; not deceiving ourselves that the world is differnt that it really is. If we can do that, then we are seeing things correctly and have \\"sanity\\". However, not seeing the world and God as they truly are does not mean you are insane, in the mental aspect of the word. Father Sheed gives us a good idea what it means to not see things as they really are and how to change that in our lives.This is a wonderful book. However, this did take me a long time to read. Father Sheed has much to say and it is all something that you must think about to fully understand what he is saying. You cannot read this book like a fiction novel; you can't or you will miss much of what Fr. Sheed is saying. It will take time but the time is well worth it.I have already purchased two more of Fr. Sheed's books and I look forward to reading them.If you have an interest in learning more about the Catholic, or even just the Christian faith in plain English, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It certainly has helped me along in my own search on God and the role He plays in our lives.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Helps one discern what \\"is\\" is. Bill Clinton needs to read this along with most of our university professors."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Haven't finished the whole thing quite yet, but I'm very impressed by the book! It takes a very logical approach through theology and attends to many vital fundamental issues. If I could make one criticism, it's that Sheed seems to assume a certain amount of theological background at some times, but then later proceeds to discuss (in detail) things that such a background would presumably already contain. That's nit-picking to the max, though.Once again: great read, great theology, great stuff overall. While I'm reading it, I feel like every qualm I have is addressed and resolved almost immediately.Would recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Frank Sheed is a great Catholic Theologian. Between this and his book \\"Theology for Beginners\\" a person can get a really good idea as to what Catholics believe and how it fits into our daily lives. This book is very easy to read and within anyone's reach. Would be a great gift to that catachumen in your life."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This is an amazing book. Frank Sheed does an excellent job of sharing his insight into the mysteries of God."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Having read Theology for Beginners, this book takes those ideas and expands them further. Not an easy read, but so worth the effort."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Teologia y Sensatez (Theology and Sanity). Sin duda uno de los libros que dejan mas honda huella en el intelecto y en el alma. Tras su lectura es imposible no darse cuenta que vivir al margen de Dios, nuestro Creador, es una locura o una grave falta de sensatez. Imprescindible para todos los que se consideren seres humanos trascendentes (los formados de materia y espiritu). Los demas (los insensatos) pueden abstenerse de leerlo aunque les convendria darle una ojeada."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This was the first book covering theology that I've ever read. I mean I go to Mass every week and I talk to many Catholic friends about theology and the Bible, so I have some understanding of the Catholic faith, but I've never taken a theology class nor read any theology before and this book was perfect. The later parts of the book get pretty boring, but it's definitely worth picking up for all his wonderful examples. As others have noted, at least read his chapters on the Holy Trinity."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who believes in God and would like to understand better what that might entail. If you're not sure about God, this book may lead you to him and help fill the void in your life."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"For anyone who wants to know more about their religion in a very simple way, this is the book for you. Frank Sheed, in this book, provides solid facts about Creation in a simple un-arguable way and provides helpful arguments to our efforts to understand, partially, the many mysteries of the Catholic faith. It can also be used as an excellent reference book when awkward questions are posed on the subject."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Book arrived promptly and in excellent conditionThe book is excellent and thought provoking on subjects relating to Religion and Man's place in the world ."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"This book offers a good explanation of basic Catholic theology. In addition, he explains why the Catholic view is the only one that makes sense-- hence the &quot;Sanity&quot; in the title.The book is a bit boring at times, but this is probably done so that he will not lose people.Overall an excellent book. If you are interesting in learning a little about theology, I would read this book."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Sheed lost me near the beginning of the book, when he defined sanity as &quot;seeing things the way the Church does.&quot; The entire book is an explanation of how the Church sees things - a kindly explanation, to be sure, but backed by the assumption that the reader needs to understand and accept these explanations to be &quot;sane.&quot;Add a little temporal power, change the name of the institution to &quot;the Soviet Union,&quot; and you have the recipe for a story like Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's &quot;Cancer Ward,&quot; in which anyone who dissents is automatically assumed insane with dire consequences.I kept returning to the book, because the prior reviews speak so highly of it and because I am interested in both sanity and theology (I almost wonder whether I read the same book). But the author repelled me, despite his friendly tone; he assumes that Catholics have nothing to learn from other religions, and he states that in spite of the large number of corrupt popes, the Church has never taught anything false. I wonder what he would make of John Paul II's apologies to the Jewish people.This is kindly authoritarian Catholicism: &quot;the Church is right, submit to it.&quot; It's not unthinking, because Sheed is very interested in people thinking well. But I think today's freedom of denominational movement would perplex him: this book works well for Catholics who are born into it and for whom the option of leaving the Church is unthinkable. For today's Catholics, many of whom returned after experiments in evangelism, eastern religions or paganism, it's probably pretty unhelpful.Since Vatican II, the Church's position has been more authoritative than authoritarian: &quot;here is why the Church's teaching is correct.&quot; I find this mode much more interesting and helpful than the authoritarian one; I would give John Paul II's encyclicals, particularly Fide et Ratio and Veritatis Splendor, as excellent examples."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Mr. Sheed proves once again that he is an educator and theologian par excellence. This work is a more detailed and in depth version of &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; but a must read even for those who have read the &quot;lighter&quot; version. In fact start with &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; and then read &quot;Theology and Sanity.&quot;I have read innumerable books on theology with an emphasis, but not exclusivity, on christianity. And this book explains with clear and beautiful reasoning the christian faith. You will not find a clearer yet amazingly comprehensive explaination of the Holy Trinity. If you think the 'triangle analogy' is a good model, you will forever look back on it as a simple 2-dimensional representation, with usefullness to be sure, but without life. Mr. Sheed brings the Trinity to Life!Ever wondered how Christians have come to believe in Heaven, Hell, Angels and the Devil through scripture? Ever doubted that you could come to a rational belief of those concepts using logic, through combining philosophy and theology? Rejoice becuase Mr. Sheed reconciles both of those for you, beautifully and clearly.By the end of this book you will understand why viewing life without a belief in God is insanity and why believing in God is having clear and sane thought. Do yourself, your soul and your spirit a favor. Read this man's works."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"In an age where philosophy, academia, and society hold religious belief as subrational, Frank Sheed shines as a beacon for those who desire to begin the grave and joyous journey of reconciling faith with reason. His explainations of Catholic theology and the metaphysical realities it upholds prove to be some of the clearest of our time. His explaination of how those realities are translated into practical application,(morality), prove equally lucid. His embarkation into the mystery of the Holy Trinity leaves one with much to meditate upon. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking to understand their Catholic faith. Only a minimum understanding of the Catholic faith is required to follow the author through some of the most complex teachings of the Church. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Sheed does a fine job here of concisely presenting the entire Catholic worldview in a single volume. His explanation of difficult philosophical and theological concepts (i.e. the Trinity) is done in a manner that can be easily understood by those with less expertise in these areas. This book is really a valuable piece, and should be on the bookshelves and in the minds of all Catholics."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, Sheed never lost me, in the beginning or anywhere else. This is, admittedly, the Catholic view of the universe and I don't think Sheed intended it to be anything else. As such, it is much more an exposition and explanation of that view than a defense against various competing views, although there is some of that. So, if you are looking for defenses of the Catholic Christian faith against Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or even specifically contrasted to some Protestant beliefs, you won't find it done here explicitly. If you are a Catholic or are interested in learning more about how this magnificent religion views God and creation, there is no finer introductory work (although Sheed's Theology for Beginners is on the same par as Theology and Sanity, just shorter). I have now read four of Sheed's works and intend to read everything of his I can get my hands on. Two other points: 1. For the Catholic Church's thoughts on other religions, see the Catechism or the Pope's speech Dialogue with Great World Religions on May 19, 1999, or his Encyclical Fides et Ratio for starters, all available on-line. 2. For books on the Catholic argument for the teaching authority of the Church see Jesus, Peter, and the Keys, among many others."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"I am a professor of theology at a Catholic university, and I find myself going back to Frank Sheed for help in expressing the depths of the faith in accessible language. I read Sheed and found him extremely helpful when I was a teenager, and now after years of graduate work in Theology I see MORE depth in Sheed's work than before and I marvel that he is able to express the faith so simply without compromising the nuances that a trained theologian would like to see. Absolutely the best intro to Theology for highschool ages and up."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Ever wondered what catholics really believe? Why they havesome strange views &amp; practices? Written by a field-testedapologist, Theology and Sanity sets out in layman's terms a marvellously clear view of catholic theology. The title summarises the author's view that insanity is failing to see what IS -- and proceeds to describe what it is the catholic church SEES in its theological schema (ie just who and what are God, Jesus, apostles, Mary, angels, saints, pope, bishops - &amp; theological underpinnings for catholic morality and practice) . Sheed's lucid descriptions are exceeded only by his wonderful prose. Highly recommended to both catholics and non-catholics. Companion volume: Society and Sanity -- an equally well-written exposition of catholic anthropology and sociology. Will be seen by some as somewhat dated, the core truths nevethless shine forth brilliantly."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Well, ok, unless you want to go to the real compendium of the Catholic Faith: The Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Otherwise, this is it. Look no further. Sheed's Theology and Sanity is a masterful, deep yet accessible summary of the mystery of creation, its fall and redemption by the Divine Redeemer.The book covers all the essential aspects of the Catholic Faith and it makes for one of the best Adult Catechisms, Chistian Apologetics and theology books ever written. The reason for its greatness is that this is a book written with the love of a man of great faith and born out of love. Every sentence in the book was tested over 50 years of street corner preaching by its author to crowds not always in agreement with him. And this is the key to this book's clarity: it has been tested by time, the love of its author for the True Faith and his genuine desire to help others make sense out of the Catholic Faith and man's long relationship with God. In reading the book one finds the Faith as beautiful and merciful as the author himself obviously did.Some of the concepts such as the doctrine of the Trinity are difficult to grasp, but their study is by no means impossible and remain enormously rewarding to the mind. If you have never taken theology or philosophy before you may want to start with Theology for Beginners, also by Sheed; otherwise, look no further than this book. Like many reviewers, I had not covered 3 chapters before I decided to read it a second time as soon as finished in order to drink deeper from this fountain of Truth. How much better would the Church be if this book was more widely used in Seminaries, Universities and Schools!Those who upon reading this book find it \\"authoritarian\\", as some reviewers do, miss the point and prove their \\"insanity\\": Sheed properly sets Truth before \\"charity\\", as his concern is with explaining the mystery of the True Faith the way it is, come what may; thereby showing objective sanity, rather than subjective insanity (i.e. making the world an image of one's subjective self) -- This is not another experiment in a zoo of faiths. This is intellect seeking understanding and illumined by Faith above all. It is precisely that understanding that gives intellect its sanity, and it is that grandiose vision and comprehension that is the seed of all love. How can we love what we do not understand? It should be noted that in the Trinity, the Spirit (Love) proceeds from the Son (Word - Truth) and not the other way round. To set charity before Truth is to reverse and falsify the Trinity, and falsity belongs not to God but to the father of lies. We live in insane times. In times where man sacrifices truth every day to a false sense of \\"tolerance\\" for error and calls this \\"love\\". Charity requires Truth in order to be truly Love, and one can hardly love his fellow man if he is not truthful to him. Read this book, it will set your record straight and help you on your road back to sanity."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"i have read and reread this book four times. Unfortunately i gave this book to a friend.I am reordering it again now. It has the clearest explanation of the Trinity that i have ever read.I guarantee that you will not be dissapointed with this purchase."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Frank Sheed's \\"Theology and Sanity\\" is a classic work of Catholic apologetics. The book is a distillation of core Catholic teaching, which comes down to actions of three beings(God, Adam, and Jesus) and four events (Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Judgement), and the implications that these beings and actions have on Catholics' perception of reality. Sheed believes that without understanding the basic theology behind these beings and actions, that individuals have a limited ability to make sane decisions, because they are not making decisions based on the full reality of life.The chapters in which he defines the Trinity, are worth the proice of the book alone; never have I have such a full comprehension of this doctrine or understood the smenatics implied when Christians pray and invoke any or all of the three Persons. His chapters on Christ ignited in me a greater desire to read all that is written about Jesus, as well as made me more sensitive to dynamics behind his actions in the Bible.The book is written in a style that is simple and accessible, yet still erudite. I recommend this book to all Catholics who want to understand better the concepts with which they grew up. All Christians may benefit from reading the book as a whole, but I don't think it is the type of book to convert people who are opposed to Catholic teaching. Sheed uses scripture extensively to support dotrine presented in some chapters but does not implement this approach with all chapters, which might lead people who are not familiar with the history of the teachings presented to question \\"where in the Bible it says that,\\" though all doctrines are supported by the Bible, this is not a Bible study (but Sheed recommends that people reading the bok combine its study with a simultaneous study of the Gospels). It is a summary of Catholic beliefs about main events and actors in the history of the Christian Church. There is less stress on proving that the beliefs are valid, and a greater emphasis is on articulating the basic interpretation."},{"Title":"Theology and Sanity","review":"Frank Sheed, in his wonderful volume THEOLOGY AND SANITY, writes at length upon theological topics which are meant to make a man see the world through the eyes of the Church. Various topics, such as the nature of the Trinity and the Fall of Man, are wonderfully discussed in a few short pages.Frank Sheed writes in his simplistic style that does not water-down Catholic theology, nor does it present it as something incomprehensible to untrained theologians. Using non-theological terms, Sheed works through many aspects of Catholic theology. A wonderful volume that can be knocked out in a couple of weeks."},{"Title":"Finding Out about Everyday Things (Explainers Series)","review":"I'm getting it now for my nephew, age 3 (and his dad).

It is a good read about a ghost that has remained in a family for over 3 generations and has moved around with different family members, although, does not show them by appearing to them. The ghost makes itself known by rocking in a rocking chair or use of chimes, lights, footsteps etc. The author presented this story in a very interesting way with good detail. It was a light and fast moving story. It was not frightening at all, although, I could see where the family members would get annoyed and scared at times, especially with being touched and covers moving off the bed and just not knowing what to expect next. It would also be very frightening for the children growing up. It is a little sad to think of this ghost wandering around and not being able to cross over for over 100 year and the family changes with the family house being sold and entirely changed.

Seventh grade...What a year that was...&quot; Thirteen was one of those years that only now I can begin to appreciate and laugh at. I don't know if I'd like to relive it though. And this is perhaps why I was so hesitant to pick this book up. But I'm glad that I did. The stories are all beautiful.

These tales so capture the deliciousness, awkwardness, hope, and disappointments of budding adolescence that I imagine anyone could relate."},{"Title":"Queer 13: Lesbian And Gay Writers Recall Seventh Grade","review":"This collection of 25 autobiographical essays about gays and lesbians at age 13 is not for queers only. You may ask, what makes it a Jewish Book? Well, what is age 13? The age of bar and bat mitzvah's, the age of wo/manhood, seventh grade, hair growth, Keds, adolescence, zits, humiliation, name-calling, teen-star posters, summer camp bunkmates, Playboy magazines, and peer scrutiny. An age when you make your way to Junior High, gain friends, lose friends, outgrow friends, and are outgrown by others... a time when some focus on band practice and other on athletics, and others... who knows. At least six of the writers discuss their Jewish adolescence, so the book may be of interest to Jewish readers. They include Robert Gluck's &quot;Three from Thirteen&quot;, in which he mentions the irony of his Bar Mitzvah parsha being the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. In Gabrielle Glancy's &quot;Train&quot;, she discusses how she managed the school officer campaign of her German/Swiss, swastika loving classmate, even though she was obsessed with fellow tribesman, David Gittelman, as well as Diane McCann. In David Bergman's &quot;A Close Escape,&quot; David recounts a sickly miserable life in Queens NY which was enriched by an enchanting performance of the puppet show, Sleeping Beauty, and his desire for association with one boy and lust for another. David's Bar Mitzvah was a grim, small, estranged affair which marked his escape from shul and elementary school. In Wayne Koestenbaum's &quot;Fashions of 1971&quot;, Wayne writes about his boy scout uniform, bell bottoms, LOVE shirt, fringe, P.E. class jocks and coaches, tube socks, and Becky's slip. In Lisa Cohen's &quot;Still Life with Boys&quot; we find a make out scene with the Bar Mitzvah boy. And in Michael Lowenthal's (SAME EMBRACE) &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, he recounts Spanish class, the derision of classmates, a Bar Mitzvah sleepover party, and his desire for a classmate."},{"Title":"Queer 13: Lesbian And Gay Writers Recall Seventh Grade","review":"Some of the intent of this collection was psychological investigation. The editor, Clifford Chase was looking for memories of \\"that key transitional moment.\\" There are certainly many questions that arise from studying the early adolescence of homosexual people.How does it arise that gay males have constellations of interests in particular fields? Why the liberal arts rather than the physical sciences? Why acting rather than football? Is this really true or is it a prejudiced stereotype? How and why do effeminate or butch mannerisms arise?Does the gay student need to be protected from peer persecution? Are segregated high schools justified.?A taboo question is that of \\"nature or nurture?\\" Many gays get annoyed if we even consider the possibility of homosexuality being other than inborn, although some transsexuals are liable to insist that sex roles are social constructs and that a chromatin negative person can choose to be a female.The collection does not answer all these questions or identify a key moment. What is does have, and which may be a homosexual trait, is superb literary merit.

Recollections of being \\"scowled and smirked at\\" in gym class, such as that of Ralph Sassons, are counterbalanced by the titillating voyeuristic pleasures of such settings. The only horrendous abuse, in Justin Chins \\"The Beginning of my Worthlessness\\" was not inflicted as a penalty for effeminacy although it fed into a later feeing of homosexuality as a stigma.(By the way the book \\"Peace from Nervous Suffering\\" that Sassons' mother found helpful is by Claire Weekes, an Australian pschiatrist, and I have often recommended it.)"},{"Title":"Queer 13: Lesbian And Gay Writers Recall Seventh Grade","review":"What a wonderful collection.

I especially liked the sections describing how working with the environment (including the local people) can be more profitable than destructive methods now in use.

In my initial reading, I was struck by several: 1) the cost of remote sensing satellites is not $50 billion and up, as even the US wouldn't build them at that cost; $50 million makes sense [this translation was published in NY, not London]; 2) Gen. Philip Sheridan was not a Confederate general; right war, but he was Union; 3) the solar influx is not 1.35 KW/minute/square meter; the units are clearly wrong, it is ~1.35KW/square meter (measured outside the atmosphere, normal to the radiation). A ten or fifteen minute scan in review prior to returning this book revealed several other questionable to ridiculous numbers.The compilers of this book are 3 journalists and a graphics specialist, not specialists in the subject.

Science fiction is normally set in an imagined hi-tech future, whereas \\"Pavane\\", like Kingsley Amis's \\"The Alteration\\" or Ward Moore's \\"Bring the Jubilee\\" is set in an imagined alternative low-tech present, less technologically advanced than our own society. It would, of course, be quite possible to write about a high-tech alternative present, based on some such premise as \\"If the Roman Empire had survived we would today be colonising the planets\\", but this is less often done. If one wants to write fiction about the colonisation of outer space it is easier to do so within the framework of orthodox science fiction and to set one's story in, say, 2511 rather than in an alternative 2011.Keith Roberts's alternative world has many similarities with that imagined by Amis in \\"The Alteration\\". Roberts's point of departure occurs in 1588; Queen Elizabeth I is assassinated, resulting in a civil war and a successful invasion of England by the Spanish Armada. Protestantism is eventually destroyed, both in Britain and in Europe, and the Roman Catholic Church rules supreme over Western Christendom, including the European colonies in the New World. \\"The Alteration\\" also deals with a world where a reactionary, intolerant Catholicism has triumphed in Europe, although in Amis's world Protestantism still survives across the Atlantic in the \\"Republic of New England\\".In the world of \\"Pavane\\", England remains a semi-feudal society, dominated by the Church and a powerful aristocracy. The Church has banned, or severely restricted the use of, many new inventions, with the result that late 20th and early 21st century Europe only possesses a level of technology which in our timeline had been attained by the early 19th century. The most advanced form of transport is the steam-powered traction engine; long-distance communication is achieved by the use of mechanical semaphore towers.Like Roberts's later \\"The Chalk Giants\\", \\"Pavane\\" is less a novel in the traditional sense than a series of seven short stories, all set in Dorset. (There are other links with \\"The Chalk Giants\\"; both books feature as important characters a lorry-driver- or traction-engine driver- and a woman named Margaret, and in both a crab symbol takes on great significance). A \\"pavane\\" is a type of dance, and continuing the musical analogy Roberts refers to these stories as \\"measures\\" with a final \\"coda\\". Although each \\"measure\\" constitutes a separate story in its own right, they are linked by being set in the same imagined world, by a sense of growing revolt against the power of Rome and by the use of characters drawn from the same family. (The main character in the first story is the road haulier Jesse Strange and that in the sixth story is his great-niece Eleanor; Eleanor's mother Margaret appears in the fourth).One reviewer complains that the book's depiction of Catholicism is offensive to that religion. In fact, Roberts simply depicts a twentieth-century Catholic Church acting in much the same way as its sixteenth-century predecessor did, and I would certainly agree with his thesis that the failure of the Reformation would have acted as a brake on scientific and technological progress, although for slightly different reasons to those he gives. An all-powerful Church acting as the sole source of religious authority and political power throughout Christendom would have led to a deeply conservative, less intellectually adventurous society where there would be no need to ban inventions like electricity and the internal combustion engine for the simple reason that they would never have been invented in the first place.And yet in the context of \\"Pavane\\" such arguments are perhaps unnecessary, as Roberts never intended the book to be a serious piece of counter-factual history. This is demonstrated by a series of deliberate anachronisms antedating his stated point of departure in 1588. We learn that members of the British aristocracy still speak Norman French as their mother tongue, even though this language had ceased to be spoken in England some two hundred years before the Armada sailed. One character is killed by a lynx, a creature which had become extinct in Britain during the Dark Ages. Some places are referred to by their Roman names, such as \\"Durnovaria\\" for Dorchester. And when a twenty-first century monarch has trouble with a rebellious aristocrat, his forces bombard her castle with stones fired from mediaeval siege engines. Even the Elizabethans had cannons!The world of \\"Pavane\\" is rather a blend of alternate history and fantasy, in this respect reminiscent of Philip Pullman's world in \\"Northern Lights\\", although unlike Pullman Roberts does not make use of explicitly supernatural elements. It is a brilliantly realised world, one both like our own and yet strangely different. In some ways it is a very concrete place; Roberts delights in giving detailed descriptions of his imagined alternative technology, especially the traction engines and semaphore towers. In others, however, it is a strange, mystical, alien place. (The fifth story, \\"The White Boat\\", has a particularly mystical tone).By the end of the six \\"Measures\\", most readers will be left feeling profoundly relieved that they have the good fortune to live in the real twentieth century, not this alternate one. And then, suddenly, in the final \\"Coda\\" Roberts leads us to question this assumption. As he points out, his world might be a place without democracy and freedom of thought, where the Enlightenment never happened, but it is also a place where Passchendaele, Hiroshima and Auschwitz also never happened. We are left to ponder two unanswerable questions. Might not political progress and scientific advance have been purchased at too heavy a price? And might not the Church's suppression of new technologies have been based on a deeper wisdom rather than obscurantist folly?"},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"As an avid reader of Alternative History, I think Keith Roberts's Pavanne falls far short of its potential. The individual stories are uneven, although beautifully written. (I think I would have appreciated the book more had I understood that they were originally published separately as short stories.) My favorite was &quot;The Signaller,&quot; which faintly resembles the use of semaphores in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the stories are starkly anti-Catholic, while on the other hand one of the stories appears to justify the Inquisition. It is this unevenness that makes the book as a whole of considerably less interest than the individual stories. One of the aspects of Alternative History that makes it so interesting is that the alternative scenario appears so plausible. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Roberts's novel, despite an impressive literary style."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Kieth Robert's novel, \\"Pavane\\", is an alternate history that reads like literate fiction.

This is not &quot;lean&quot; writing by any stretch, I would term it much closer to &quot;rococo&quot;."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"This book uses six independent, but linked, short stories to paint an England that, like much of the world, is under the domination of the Catholic church. The Church has limited the use of technology, so that, even though it is the 1960s, most of society functions at a sort of Middle Ages level. Each story draws out a little more detail though, goods are moved by &quot;hauliers&quot; who drive a sort of truck-locomotive, or how news and messages are sent via &quot;signalers&quot; (the story of the signalers is reprinted in Modern Classics of Fantasy). It's sort of interesting, but a bit ephemeral; there's all kinds of obscure references to &quot;Old Ones&quot; and &quot;faeries.&quot; Rather than reading the whole book, I'd recommend reading just two of the stories &quot;The Lady Margaret&quot; and &quot;The Signaler.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"The overall premise is fairly interesting: an alternate version of the world, all resulting from the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I. The book is a collection of short stories set in this world, showing how society functions within the scientific boundaries imposed by the Catholic Church. The individual stories are fairly well-written, especially the first. The big problem for me was my having settled into the premise of the book, and then getting to the end and realizing that things aren't what they seem. While I normally like surprise endings, the particular twist of this one was just too much to accept. I think readers would have a better time with the book A Canticle for Leibowitz, by Walter Miller."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"I was very eager to read this novel after reading numerous wonderful reviews about it in magazines and online, so when I finally bought it I was quite disappointed. Although a very dense and intricate novel, it was ultimately very boring. Even individually, the &quot;measures&quot; barely stood up alone as short stories, and together made a poor body of work. The &quot;twist&quot; in the Coda makes one wonder whether the preceding stories were a waste of time. Yes, worldbuilding is fun in science fiction, but it does not necessarily make a good novel. I am not surprised that this novel has not achieved a higher status or circulation. It doesn't even have a cult fiction quality to it. Go read something else."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"I really wish I could have given this book a half star as I feel that is the most it merits. This book is unrealistic in the extreme. While one has to remember that it is \\"alternate history,\\" allowing the author some creativity with facts and language,he might have tried to be more on the ball. Had Spain's Armada actually triumphed and the English succumbed it is highly unlikely the world would have been so offset as to appear like the Middle Ages in the 20th century. Certainly the Protestant Reformation would have reached its end in England. Certainly the Catholic Church would have been restored (let's not forget that the Anglican Church, the religion of England was and is \\"Catholic\\" in doctrine and practice, arising not out of doctrinal differences with Catholicism, like the Calvinists and the Lutherans, but out of a tantrum by Henry VIII when the Pope refused annulling his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, and so English Christianity as a whole would have been only nominally changed). To assume that merely because of the re-instatement of Catholicism the world would have been thrown in another Dark Age is blatantly bigotted. Italy, the home of the Popes, an overwhelmingly Catholic country ushered in the Modern Age with the Florentine Renaissance. Italy in the XV and XVI centuries was the most cultured and scientifically advanced nation in Europe \\"despite their catholicism.\\" Italy gave us Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Caravaggio, Bernini, Galileo (yes!, the Catholic Church did mess with the man, however, contrary to popular thinking most of his theories and scientific advances were not suppressed by the Church, only the issue of Heliocentrism), the radio by way of Marconi, the basis of Einstein's theories were based on the work of Italian physicist Fermi. All these advaces and culture took place in a Catholic nation. The same can be said for France, Spain and Portugal each of which contributed cultural, philosophical and scientific advances despite being overwhelmingly Catholic. To write a book and suggest that the world would have been sunken into a cultural and scientific void by virtue of a religion is not just fiction, it is poor imagination and lack of historical knowledge at best, and offensive close minded religious prejudice at its worst."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Keith Roberts' great late '60s Alternate History novel, Pavane, towers over the popular contemporary AH novels, with their tendency toward silly games such as &quot;pick the branch point&quot; or &quot;identify the historical figure in a new role&quot;. Pavane is based on a history which branched when Queen Elizabeth died early, and the Spanish Armada succeeded in conquering England, paving the way for continued domination of Europe by the Catholic Church. This book is concerned with metaphysical and moral questions such as the nature of history and the value of technology.It is composed of a brief prologue, indicating the &quot;branch point&quot;, followed by six &quot;measures&quot;, novelette- or novella- length sections, beginning in 1968 and carrying the story forward several decades. Each measure is a self-contained story, but there are also links between them, particularly three stories which follow three generations of the Strange family. Finally, a Coda serves to cast the entire story in a somewhat different light, for one thing technically removing it from the strict &quot;Alternate History&quot; subgenre, and also commenting on the central conflicts of the story. The mood overall is rather dark, though flashes of brightness and joy light the pages. Roberts' Catholic dominated England, or Angle Land, is rather backwards technologically, as the Church carefully vets all scientific and technological knowledge, rejecting some advances and delaying others. Thus we have steam-driven road-based &quot;trains&quot;, and semaphores instead of telephones, in the late 20th Century. Roberts' detailed descriptions of both sorts of old-fashioned technology are intriguing and rather romantic. At the same time it is clear that people are poorer and hungrier and fewer because of this retarded development -- but there is throughout an ambiguity about the depiction of this alternate present which is only intensified by Roberts' coda.The book is set in a time of subdued unrest -- the heavy hand of the Church on Angle Land is clearly resented, and this resentment is seen to spread throughout society as the book unfolds. The opening story deals with Jesse Strange, a prosperous and hardworking businessman, who must work with and around Churchly taxations and technological restrictions. That's a side issue to his personal story, though, as he takes his train on the last trip before winter closes the roads one year, worried about outlaws, and finds a reason to visit a barmaid he has long fancied, and also encounters an old school friend. Both meetings have momentous results, and change his life profoundly. &quot;The Signaller&quot; follows, a stark, sad, beautiful story of the title character's successful struggle to become a Signaller, and the violent fate that awaits him on his first solo assignment, as well as the mysterious person he encounters alone in the back woods. &quot;Brother John&quot; introduces us to a monk, an accomplished artist, who is radicalized when he is forced to record in his drawings the efforts of an &quot;inquisitor&quot; to torture the &quot;truth&quot; out of a crop of suspected sinners, and who almost by accident starts a grassroots rebellion. &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; takes up with the Strange family again, as Jesse's niece, prosperous as a result of Jesse's hard work, meets a charismatic scion of the local noble family -- this story shows the class structure of this alternate England effectively, and sets the scene, as it were, for the conclusion. But next is the mystical &quot;The White Boat&quot;, in which a simple fishergirl becomes obssessed with the title vessel on its repeated visits to her home cove. Finally, in &quot;Corfe Gate&quot;, Jesse Strange's great-niece, ruler of a castle, finds herself pushed to open resistance to the harsh rule of Rome, and with the help of her mysterious seneschal, John Faulkner, starts a country-wide rebellion, with bitter if ambiguous results.This remains a remarkable novel, beautifully written and unexpected in its working out. The characters come fully to life. The hints of mysterious elements working in the background add a special resonance to the book. The book asks interesting questions about the working out of history -- and if it suggests answers that a reader might not agree with, it does not compel agreement, but rather it compels thinking. It has been rightly regarded as a classic of SF from its first publication."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"This is an excellent book, a largely unknown gem. I picked it up because the steampunk theme intrigued me. I didn't expect the quality of writing I found here.Pavane is alternate history (also alternate-timeline, though that's subtle.). Queen Elizabeth was assassinated, and the Catholic Church has maintained tyrannical control of Britain and Europe. Only limited technology is allowed, and Roberts' descriptions of the steam trains and the semaphore signalling stations are beautiful.This is not a book with a linear plot -- the title gives a clue to its structure. Its parts work together to form a gorgeous whole, but we don't follow one character throughout, which may throw some readers. In addition, elements of worldbuilding exist -- the long description of the semaphores, for example -- which don't directly support the plot. Some readers will be bothered by that, but I wasn't. I found the world, the Signallers' Guild and all the rest, fascinating; the sort of world in which multiple wonderful stories could be told.Though we see each character for a limited period of time, Roberts keeps them sympathetic and interesting. The whole book has a mythic feel. Though written in '66, I found nothing dated about it. The only thing that might perhaps change from a modern standpoint is that I think Roberts intended the end to be entirely happy. From the perspective of 2002, it's bittersweet, with the beauty of what was lost shadowing the bright modernity with a dark counterpoint."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"In case you were wondering, a &quot;pavane&quot; is a stately dance in elaborate clothing, and this book is contructed like such a dance: six measures and a coda, each one a separate, but tenuously connected, story. It's an alternate history of the world in which Queen Elizabeth I is assassinated in 1588, and the Spanish Armada conquers England. For hundreds of years after that date, the Roman Church rules most of the world with a somewhat iron hand, keeping to a minimum the progress of science and inventions. Throughout the book you wonder about the rationale of the Church leaders for this stance, until everything (sort of) is made clear in the Coda. The writing is quite lyrical at times, and even though a reader might wish for more information about the world the author created, enough is given to enable you to understand what is happening, even if you don't quite know what's going on (if that sounds like a contradiction, it certainly is, but you have to read the book to understand what I mean). If you enjoy &quot;alternate history&quot; works, I think you will like this book very much."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"This is simply a beautiful work; another gem from Gollancz' Masterworks series, although one which reads more like fantasy or historical fiction than SF.The novel is told through a series of six 'Measures', vignettes of story and mood focusing on a different character each time. While each works separately, taken together they form a tapestry linking thematic and narrative concerns - producing, ultimately, a beautifully-conceived and wonderfully effective tale of twentieth century England stifled by an all-powerful, anti-progress Catholic Church.The alternate England is a triumph of understated, economical world-building (something that many of today's fantasy novels could learn from, perhaps). It is filled with enduring images - the Signallers' towers, the steam engines, the land held in winter's icy grasp - made all the more striking and memorable because we are shown them through the eyes of convincing and distinctive characters.My only criticism would be of the 'Coda', which feels superfluous, and far too neat. Otherwise, this is a moving story of a transforming world, all the more effective for being incompletely explained."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Pavane is promoted as an alternate history book, but it is not really like most works of that genre, which seem to focus more on technique than anything else. It reminded me strongly of Walter Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz in more than a few ways, particularly tone, structure, and the Catholic atmosphere.The book is not one single narrative, but six short stories plus a coda section, taking place over a period of several generations. While reading it, you may think that the stories are barely related, but as you read on, you discover more and more connections, like the pieces of a puzzle falling into place. (For this reason, don't take the advice of the earlier reviewer who suggested only reading the first two stories.) Then the coda comes along with a revelation that causes you to rethink everything that came before -- and perhaps read the book over again to see what you missed.The images of the England in Pavane will stay with you a long time. This book is a treasure; it deserves its reputation."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"This novel begins with the premises that Queen Elizabeth I was assassinated in 1588, and that the Spanish succeeded in conquring England. The author's proposed result is a Europe dominated by the Pope and his supporters, who suppress advances in science and technology. By the twentieth century, England still is in a quasi-medieval state, its cities linked by steam-powered road trains, its messages communicated by semaphores. Supernaturalism still influences perceptions and behavior. The bulk of the book consists of the separate stories of six major characters, each illuminating different facets of this alternate world. Some of these tales are beautifully and poignantly written. Unfortunately, the book's first story is its least interesting, possibly discouraging readers from continuing on to later and better ones."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Of all the alternative histories I have ever read, 'Pavane' proves for me the ultimate best, a glorious work of art. In fact, it was one of the first novels I'd read that got me hooked on to the subject of AH! A powerful drama enshrouding the reader like an inquisitor's cloak, it draws them into a dark, curious world of steam engines, medieval castles, and semaphore towers. All this, because Queen Elizabeth I was assassinated in 1588. The Spanish Armada then invaded, aiding the Catholics in an inevitable civil war, and subdued the warlike nation, restoring it to Papist rule. A superb 'what if' premise that re-creates England - a country rebelling and yearning for freedom, science and scholarship. His three stories wonderfully describe life within England's society, the various characters, their differing backgrounds, dreams and failings, their skills tested to the limit as they defy the mighty Roman Church, where others endeavour to uphold it. In particular, I enjoyed 'The Signaller' story, and imagined life within the strict Guild. Roberts is a master storyteller and inventor of great literature. I daresay he ranks amongst those such as Dickens and Shakespeare. My other favourites included the slowly changing 'Brother John', and the open hostility displayed by the aristocracy at 'Corfe Gate'. 'Coda' is a great conclusion fully realized, and provokes the thought that times change for the better. However, as other readers have commented, I almost desire in visiting this world, wanting to see it for myself - although for what reason I cannot guess. The other thing about alternative history is that it inspires you about your own world's past, and how lucky we are not to be living under an unforgiving regime. Indeed, had it not been for Henry VIII's marital problems in the first place...But Roberts dark age, pre-industrial scenario provides an excellent thesis on 'what if' England had been subjugated to Spanish Conquest. However, I only hope that somebody, someday, produces a film of this brilliant book! If not, then Radio is surely a bountiful consolation...'radio'? Oh, sorry, I meant 'semaphore'."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Pavane's premise is fantastic (the non-occurrence of the Reformation) but the book transcends science fiction or fantasy. The novel traces the interweaving lives of several late 20th century Englishmen, in an England where steam engines are newly invented and the telegraph unheard of. Its true strengths are the undeniable skill of its prose and the ability of the writer to make you feel the cold of the winter before central heating, or the emptiness of the moors before highways and telephone lines. The characters are well-drawn and empathetic, and around the margins of the story is a delicate tracery of magic and faery, just enough to make you want to say,&quot;Wait, what was that again?&quot; Roberts keeps his major thesis a mystery until the very end of the book, revealing an abrupt reinterpretation of everything that has come before, which is nevertheless plausible and even attractive (I wish I could say more, but it would spoil everything). Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"*Pavane* has some beautifully realized \\"chapters\\" in its presentation of linked short stories, and I found myself increasingly drawn into the world it portrayed.

And the conclusion provided in its \\"Coda\\" comes close to wrecking the book. The sudden, and ultimately unconvincing, reversal of practically everything that has gone before undercuts what hard-earned coherence Roberts has managed to create. It is an extremely artificial attempt to generate ambiguity, and since it too becomes mixed up with the \\"mystical\\" strands of the plot the final effect is close to a complete shambles. This is unfortunate since the various parts of the text, with a few exceptions, were quite strong until its ending. For a considerably more successful reconciliation of mysticism and alternate history read Philip K.

He once said he preferred the past to the future, which is why a couple of his juvenile-oriented stories have been set in post-technological futures; societies that are oppressed and primitive, as seen in the medieval &quot;Prince in Waiting&quot;(1970), where knowledge of science and machinery is punishable by death. However, where &quot;The Prince in Waiting&quot; is post-apocalyptic in its setting, &quot;Pavane&quot; describes a world shaped by a crucial incident that alters the course of history - namely, the assassination of Elizabeth I in 1588.In &quot;Pavane&quot; we see a 20th century England ruled by the Catholic Church. Heresy is punished by draconian methods. While technological progress is largely held in check, minor innovations are grudgingly accepted. Electricity, television and computers are unheard of. One compensation (perhaps the only compensation) of this alternate world is that there is no industrial pollution.&quot;Pavane&quot; reminds us of how much we take for granted. In the Western world that we know, people live in relative comfort, thanks to the benefits of modern medicine, education, mass production and democracy. Many people benefit from science. It improves our standard of living, allowing people to live lives of leisure, dignity and intellectual stimulation. The Church in &quot;Pavane&quot; is determined to avert this, for reasons that don't become clear until the very end of the novel.The part of the book I enjoyed most was &quot;Brother John&quot;. I think this might be because I'm studying art myself. I've seen how tiring it is when lithography students grind away at a slab of stone. Because Keith Roberts is also an illustrator, the writing style is highly visual. Roberts has created a very convincing scenario in &quot;Pavane&quot;. This is the first alternate history novel I have read. I also plan to read Ward Moore's &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, which is supposed to be in the same class as &quot;Pavane&quot;.

In this alternative history, Roberts has constructed in graphic detail a late 20th century England that missed the evolution in technology and civil liberty that the industrial revolution stimulated. This is an England whose renaissance was stunted by the victory of the Spanish armada after Elizabeth\\"s assasination and has endured three centuries of the dictatorship of the Church of the Inquisition, which permitted no more advanced machinery than the steam engine & the most elementary radio.The social mores and the individual personalities that are the result of such an environment are biopsied in Pavane in lucid, plausible detail. & the revolution, when it comes, is messianic as it must be, from a dissenting frior.Keith Roberts is a strong, literate writer. He made me think, my greatest compliment."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Pavane is an alternate history fix-up book. It came recommended to me as part of the Steampunk sub-genre, though that is a little bit of a stretch. Steam engines certainly are central to the story, and a strong whiff of dystopia comes through, but it is significantly different from neo-victorian stuff. It is constructed in 'measures' instead of books, or chapters, with a short coda at the end to finalize it. It starts with a lovesick locomotive man who embraces his melancholy as a motivation for great business success and goes on to trace through characters related and associated. One of the best examples of a 'fix-up' book is Ray Bradbury'sThe Martian Chronicles, which was produced by arranging pre-existing short stories published in different places and augmented with specially written chapters as a way to form continuity. Bradbury made little effort to make the whole book consistent, and descriptions of chronology, events and the martians can be significantly different; but that is part of the charm of that effort. The chapters of Kieth Roberts' Pavane all occur in the same fictional universe but in this style and setting should be more succinct.I shall start with the bad before the good. Some of the chapters do not fit well with the arc of the story, most notably the one entitled \\"The White Boat\\" which plays out as a long distraction. \\"Brother John\\" seems out of place as well, but does add to the flavor and tone. The most haunting, \\"The Signaller\\", while providing essential information comes off as tangential as well. The most glaring, which loses a star from the rating all by itself, is the short Coda. It's conclusion contradicts the entire effort of the rest of the book! An important theme, a hard-edged but truthful critique of the Catholic Church, is undone by this tiny bit. While it provides an antidote for the bitter bedrock of the novel and provides an optimistic stinger at the end, would have been better to leave it out entirely. My suspicion is that Roberts had second thoughts and lost his nerve. It is a jarring finale to the otherwise wonderful story, not unlike the final chapter of Anthony Burgess'A Clockwork Orange (Norton Critical Editions).Overall, however, the book is fine, with wonderful writing. Until the third chapter I had the notion that this might be a five start book in my happy collection. The settings are magical and mysterious, with just enough detail to allow the reader to construct this gritty world in their mind. Roberts' wordcraft is poetic and thought provoking, and his social commentary biting, as with this line:\\"Because there was no law in this land, not for commoners. Rich and poor alike they held their places by the whim of their lords; and the lords got theirs in feoff from the English King, and he sat his throne by the grace of the Throne of Peter. The [cannon], glaring out there through the gates, that was the law...\\"Pavane occurs in a world where technology is forcibly frozen in place, where steam power, fire, and black powder are the only state of the arts and sciences allowed by the masters of the lands; the lives of the characters struggling in their hardscrabble world draw you in and keep you fascinated. Sadly little things spoil it, but it is quite an effort, and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Pavane, by Keith Roberts, is a beautiful collection of six connected stories written in an alternate England where Queen Elizabeth was assassinated and Philip II won the throne of England. The Protestant Reformation never occurred and Europe, as well as the New World, fell under the control of the Pope. Now it's 1968 and because the Roman Catholic Church has held back technological advances from the people, the English still live in a feudal society complete with candlelight, castles, moats, monasteries, and much superstition, though the Church has allowed some steam-powered vehicles and the use of semaphore telegraph lines for communication. The Church has electricity, people know they have been repressed, and there are rumors of revolution.The title Pavane comes from the Spanish-style dance which has six steps and a coda. Likewise, after the short prologue, the book contains six stories and a coda. The stories span a couple of generations and occur in chronological order:\\"The Lady Margaret\\" -- Here we meet Jesse Strange who carries freight on his steam engine, which is named \\"The Lady Margaret\\" after the barmaid he's secretly in love with. On one of his business trips, during which he stops to see Margaret, he meets an old friend from college. On his way home, he's attacked by bandits. Jesse, a competent and hard-working man, is the patriarch of the characters we'll meet in the last two stories.\\"The Signaller\\" -- Rafe, who is fascinated by the semaphore telegraph stations that span the country, has his wildest dreams fulfilled when he earns a spot as an apprentice in the Guild of Signallers. In this story we learn that the faeries are still active in England -- the Roman Catholic Church has not been able to eradicate them.\\"The White Boat\\" -- Fourteen-year-old Becky wants to be free and she thinks that the mysterious white boat she occasionally notices on the sea may be her ticket to a better life... until the Church notices it, too.\\"Brother John\\" -- The monk Brother John is commissioned by the Inquisition to use his artistic talents to document tortures and confessions.\\"Lords and Ladies\\" --Jesse Strange, now a rich man, lies dying. As the priest intones last rites, Jesse's niece Margaret remembers her recent humiliating experience with a young local lord and wonders if the faeries would treat her better than the priest's god does.\\"Corfe Gate\\" -- Lady Eleanor, daughter of Margaret in the previous story, defies the Church. Lord Henry, who represents the Pope in England, is sent to bring her down. With the help of Sir John, her seneschal, Eleanor prepares to stand firm. During her struggle, she suggests that history is like the pavane.In the Coda, Sir John's son visits Corfe Gate decades later and reads a letter from his father who explains what happened after Eleanor's revolt. Sir John's justification of the Church's actions seems odd and tacked-on. Or perhaps Keith Roberts was going for an A Canticle for Leibowitz-type feel. Either way, it leaves the reader scratching his head and wishing Roberts had just stopped after the last story.Overall, Pavane is a beautifully written book with well-developed characters, skillful use of language, and vivid imagery -- dark brooding castles, hulking gothic churches, powerful steam engines, lines of clacking semaphores, horrid tortures at the hands of the Inquisition. These images will stay with me.I listened to the audio version of Pavane which was produced by Neil Gaiman Presents. Gaiman introduces the book and explains why he loves it and chose to add it to his audio line. The narration by Steven Crossley was excellent; I recommend this version.Originally Posted at FanLit."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"A fascinating alternate history. And back in print:Pavane. With the Dillon cover from the Ace SF Special edition, along with two pieces of artwork by Keith Roberts."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"About a decade ago, I collected all the Ace science fiction special paperbacks, mainly because of the wonderful artwork on the covers. In that collection was Pavane, by Roberts. I started reading some of them. These books are so old, the speculative futures have come and gone for most of them. Recently, I finally got around to reading Pavane, and what a marvelous and mysterious book! Strangely descriptive and completely absorbing. As well written as you would want any work of literature to be."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Roberts' portrayal of an England without the British Empire and still ruled by an omnipotent Papal imperium strikes a chilling cord in the heart and not-so-subtly shows how the entire course of history could have been altered by a single event. That's not original or terribly exciting in itself, but the way that Roberts immerses us in this world, how he presents the thoughts and behaviour of the heroes, is so vivid and at times beautiful that it almost makes our reality seem to be the false doppelganger. By focusing mostly on common people and quotidian events the book brings us into the daily lives of a people strangely close yet undeniably alien to the English of our world. The only false chord in this symphony of short stories is the ending Coda, which throws the reader out of the constructed world; it may be best to skip it entirely. Comparable to The Man in the High Castle, and rightly so, as a classic of alternative history."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Of all the alternative histories I have ever read, 'Pavane' proves for me the ultimate best, a glorious work of art. In fact, it was one of the first novels I'd read that got me hooked on to the subject of AH! A powerful drama enshrouding the reader like an inquisitor's cloak, it draws them into a dark, curious world of steam engines, medieval castles, and semaphore towers. All this, because Queen Elizabeth I was assassinated in 1588. The Spanish Armada then invaded, aiding the Catholics in an inevitable civil war, and subdued the warlike nation, restoring it to Papist rule. A superb 'what if' premise that re-creates England - a country rebelling and yearning for freedom, science and scholarship. His three stories wonderfully describe life within England's society, the various characters, their differing backgrounds, dreams and failings, their skills tested to the limit as they defy the mighty Roman Church, where others endeavour to uphold it. In particular, I enjoyed 'The Signaller' story, and imagined life within the strict Guild. Roberts is a master storyteller and inventor of great literature. I daresay he ranks amongst those such as Dickens and Shakespeare. My other favourites included the slowly changing 'Brother John', and the open hostility displayed by the aristocracy at 'Corfe Gate'. 'Coda' is a great conclusion fully realized, and provokes the thought that times change for the better. However, as other readers have commented, I almost desire in visiting this world, wanting to see it for myself - although for what reason I cannot guess. The other thing about alternative history is that it inspires you about your own world's past, and how lucky we are not to be living under an unforgiving regime. Indeed, had it not been for Henry VIII's marital problems in the first place...But Roberts dark age, pre-industrial scenario provides an excellent thesis on 'what if' England had been subjugated to Spanish Conquest. However, I only hope that somebody, someday, produces a film of this brilliant book! If not, then Radio is surely a bountiful consolation...'radio'? Oh, sorry, I meant 'semaphore'."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Pavane is one of the novels I recommend to non-SF readers who believe SF lacks characterisation, atmosphere or literary merit. The flavour of this cycle of linked stories isn't particularly SF at all, but reminds me most of the Wessex novels of Thomas Hardy, whose settings it loosely shares. Like Hardy, Roberts taps into a very English rural nostalgia - timeless Dorset landscapes, steam traction engines, and real ale - whose cosiness counterpoints the storylines: poignant human dramas of ordinary people struggling against larger forces."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"It has often been said that science fiction is a literature of ideas, but not of characters. &quot;Pavane&quot; is proof that sf can be both. Roberts introduces the peculiarities, both technological and social, of an alternate 20th century England in a totally unobtrusive way, and without neglecting his various protagonists. (The moving love story in the first chapter is just one example.) The six &quot;measures&quot; are beautifully intertwined, each one that you read making the whole picture richer. Roberts creates images that will stay with you for a long time: the road trains, the semaphores, the villages (often literally) frozen half-way between Middle Ages and modernity. The mood throughout is elegiac, the writing beautiful, each episode memorable. It should be pretty obvious by now: I love this book."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Now 30 years old, 'Pavane' is the one novel I would want to have with me were I to be stranded upon an island. It is neither 'science-fiction', nor one of the write-by-numbers 'alternative history' books which have followed in its wake. It is enigmatic, original, strong in characterisation and story, mysterious, uplifting and sad. It paints a picture of an England which never was yet, for reasons revealed cleverly and slowly, we might almost envy in our 'real' world. In the 16th century, a harsh, feudal order triumphs over the renaissance and ruthlessly blocks the unfolding of modern progress for 500 years. But this is the result of a strange and enigmatic conspiracy between the forces of reaction and strange, fey beings who linger always on the edge of the storyline without ever fully revealing their true nature. Roberts's bold conclusion, that the delay of progress is not necessarily a bad thing, and that progress itself can be a force for greater evil is, I think, ! increasingly popular. His conclusion, that a lesser evil may prevent a greater is quite shocking, and regularly comes back to haunt me, especially after seeing bad news headlines. A novel that entertains and makes you think. Highly recommended, especially to those who like good writing but would not normally think to find it under 'science fiction'."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"I first read PAVANE while in the Army, in Frankfurt, Germany. I finished the last 15 pages while waiting for dinner with an English friend. When she found what I was reading, she told me there really is a Corfe Castle. Our next trip to England, I drove down the Purbeck Hills, and &quot;knew&quot; it was just around the next hill; and it was!! Just like the epilogue: coming home to a place I'd never been before. I wanted to use it as alternate history in an SF course several years ago, and found it out of print. Maybe now it's back, I can use it next time."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"Anthony Burgess sent me to this one, though that wouldn't be recommendation enough for everyone - it was one of his selection of 99 best postwar novels (worth reading in itself) and one of the few that I hadn't at least heard of. Hard to describe without falling back on cliches - for Pavane, they seem strangely apt and unavoidable.Resonant: there is a far distant corner of my mind which is forever Pavane and scenes float into my mind at the strangest times.Elliptical - it takes a single notion: that the Reformation had never happened and that Catholicism had continued to dominate Western society and politics - and uses it as springboard from which to explore ideas about communication, science, humanity and life.It certainly breaks out of its category - science enters into it, although more in the form of anti-science, and though fantastic, it's too firmly grounded to count as fantasy. This perhaps makes it sound dry or fey - it's neither.A book that flips our own world on its head while somehow shedding new light on it. Just read it !(Bob Machin,Stirling,Scotland"},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"This book is marketed as Alternate History but I disagree. The content is broken down into mini stories detailing matters seldom written about. My favorite coda was the Semaphore story. If you buy this book and are expecting in-your-face alternate reality, then you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"&quot;Pavane&quot; is a collection of six intertwined, character-driven short stories, followed by a &quot;coda&quot; which fundamentally challenges any sense you may have been able to make of what you've read up to that point. Set in an alternate reality in which England was defeated by Spain in 1588, Science has been ruthlessly suppressed by an all-powerful Catholic Church. The odd thing about this book is that you can't help wondering, upon looking blearily up from the last page, whether perhaps the church actually was acting in mankind's best interest by engineering this suppression... The characters here are very three-dimensional, and very compelling. You will find yourself, well, strangely absorbed by the ebb and flow of the fortunes of the Firm of Strange, which tale loosely forms the backstory and background of these curiously interwoven stories.Wow... what a book. &quot;Pavane&quot; is not your usual &quot;alternate history&quot; book. To say too much about why this is the case would be a spoiler, but just be prepared for some odd twists near the end. I enjoyed the story called &quot;The Lady Margaret,&quot; which poetically limns a savagely twisted love triangle, quite a bit. &quot;Brother John,&quot; about an artist-monk whose life is wildly changed by what he sees at the Inquisition, is incredibly powerful, although as a story I think it has a few flaws. The latter part of the book is mostly concerned with the machinations and amoral politickings of a group of lords and ladies, which as an American I suppose I found mostly to be just depressing. Anyway, here you will find powerful elements of fantasy, incredible imagery, and a haunting, grim writing style. The author once made his living illustrating graphic novels, and this shows through in a myriad of ways. One has an overpowering sense that the writer could SEE everything that happens in these stories before he wrote them, and just sat down one day to describe what he saw. In short -- great visuals. Also, there is more tense, desperate grimness packed into each page than most people who are not citizens of Bangladesh are faced with in an entire lifetime. Not that that's necessarily a compliment -- I just want prospective readers to be prepared. I also want to say, for anyone who is new to this genre, to try searching the internet for sites that have the word &quot;Uchronia&quot; somewhere in their text -- you may be pleasantly surprised.I must say it again -- this book is really a far cry from your usual alternate history novel. The genre, at its best, is typically characterized by an almost painfully cerebral gaming out of the possible concatenated changes which may have accrued if a particular pivotal moment in history had gone... differently. &quot;Pavane,&quot; however, scarcely ever reminds the reader of the painstakingly scrupulous attention to historical detail which went into the making of &quot;Fatherland&quot; or &quot;Guns of the South.&quot; This book gets by almost purely, (and quite successfully, I must say) on ATMOSPHERE -- brooding, dark, and grim. If that's your cup of tea, then by all means please read &quot;Pavane.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pavane (Del Rey Impact)","review":"I own an original paperback copy from 1970.

Wonderful gift from a special human being !!!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"You can truly see how different, not in a weird way, he is from the general population. His sensitivity allowed him to see things in a different perspective, thus his anguish over the suffering of others. Through this book, I am able to gain insight into his view of children, and the role they play in his life. I have never believed the allegations of molestation, and this book truly anchored that belief. I am certain there are others that are determined to categorize Michael Jackson as weird, because he's different. However, in my own personal view, I believe he truly believed that all he wanted to do is \\"love\\" everyone, without reservations -esp with children. He never understood why the public threw stones at him over his \\"innocent\\" ways of loving children. I think for someone who fought against growing up, there was nothing wrong interacting with children in such an intimate manner, although physically, he was no longer a child.Like everything, you can be your own judge, and this is no exception. This is only my personal view and I think if you are curious about Michael Jackson's perception of life and people (including animals), this would be a great book to help you understand Michael Jackson, to a certain extent. Additionally, I admire his compassion for all living things, especially animals. I can tell you that as a Buddhist, there are a lot of us out there that can not reach the same compassion as Michael Jackson did-over all living things."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I've been a huge fan of Michael Jackson since I was little. \\"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections\\" and \\"Moonwalker\\" are the two books that I treasure most since both of them were written by Michael Jackson, which means that through them you can get to know not only the artist but also the man.

No one has ever compared to Michael, no does compare to Michael, and I know for a fact that no one ever WILL compare to The KING, MICHEAL JACKSON.

Poems, stories and prose that he wrote, on subjects closest to him. He wrote about dancing for the moon and in the surf. He penned love songs to planet earth. Told about elephants and their pledge to man. Gave his take on children, creativity, magic, god, innocence, trust, ecstasy. We see Michael the story-teller as well as the poet and the essayist. Most revealing of all are two of his poems on the Magical Child. The magical child that could not be killed or beaten down or destroyed. Michael knew very well what people were trying to do to him. He hung on to magic and innocence in the face of a world gone old and cold.Throughout are photographs of MJ, including many lovely stills from Black and White and a Desert shoot for a Dangerous commercial. There are also some rare photographs of MJ in romantic costumes, as King Arthur, Napoleon, Mark Anthony, etc. A couple of intimate shots of him wandering in a blanket along the shore and so on.

We only paid 20 bucks at the time, but now it looks like even the foreign reprint is climbing in price. Hopefully this is a book that Michael's estate will see fit to re-release and promote someday. It truly offers a glimpse into Michael's soul, far beyond even his music. His stream of consciousness is so eloquently written and touchingly beautiful, that any fan is doing themselves a disservice to not read his words in this book. It's also beautifully illustrated, often with Michael's own drawings. It also has a lot of very nice pictures of Michael, many of which I have never seen before. Magical Child is a particularly beautiful poem, and clearly autobiographical. This truly is a beautiful book, the kind that we always leave out, and pick up to read a few passages from, whenever the mood strikes. The cover on this official book is much nicer than the UK version, and more fitting for a book of poetry, but it's still nice to have all the same. The original release has turned into something of a collector's item, and nice as it would be to have, it's the words that are important. So the more affordable reprint is just fine for us. If you are a fan, then you really shouldn't miss this one. Get the book and bask in all that is... Michael Jackson.

It focuses on how sensitive Michael is and how lonely fame can be at times. If you are a MJ fan you will want this book in your collection."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"You get an insight on Michael jackson. I'm not really interested in poetry and essays but he did have some lyrics from the Dangerous album in it. I don't think he made lyrics that's why I originally liked the book. It just sits on my shelf most of the time though. The pictures are excellent reminders of moments that you might remember seeing in a book, magazine, on t.v. etc. It's cool though, if you want like trivia information or something like that check out a biography or his autobiography."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"the book contains a grate deal of Michael Jackson's deep emotions and fellings. a childs hart and Are you listening are 2 favorets of mine.

I had a hard time getting through it. I truely have a hard time putting into words how feel about this book but as a fan it is a must have. It is beautiful!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Most of us think of MJ as a great entertainer. But I suspect few of us consider him a great thinker. This book which contains his poetry, short essays, and a couple of his songs will, like his music, touch your soul. His thoughts on Courage, Innocence, Love, and God are very profound. His beliefs about saving the planet come through very strongly. I gain new insights every time I read a selection."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I had heard about Dancing the Dream , wasn't sure exactly what was in it. After I got the book, I couldn't put it down.It certainly was an eyeopener for me. Michael Jackson was very expressive and could paint a picture with words that just made you see the subject matter.Dancing the Dream made me appreciate him, his talent, his concern for the earth and his love and appreciation for children all the more.His was truly a God given gift that he did not mind sharing through the written word, through music and his humanitarian efforts. I recommmend highly."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This is an absolute must-have for all hardcore Michael Jackson fans. His words and reflections are beautiful, and never fail to bring a tear to my eye! I was ecstatic that I was able to find a first edition of Dancing the Dream for such a great price in such a great condition! The product was exactly as described and I received in on the estimated delivery date. Very satisfied overall!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I was expecting a really nice book and what I found is a GREAT book of poetry that I can pick up, read quickly and be inspired to believe in myself, to remember that I am a gift from God, that the earth is to be cared for -- there is a message for every aspect of life in this book. It is amazing that we spent so much time inspecting the man's life and didn't spend enough time reflecting on his message to the world -- love yourself first and then love one another. This is a must read for, not only Michael Jackson's fans, but anyone who enjoys reading spiritual books. I will keep this and my other favorites - Tuesdays with Morrie, the Four People You Meet in Heaven and others near my bedside to be savored again and again. Read this book and you will see Michael Jackson in a new light; it is especially an eye opener for people like myself who knew very little of him before his death."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"My friends bought me this book for my 14th birthday, June 20th 1992. I read the book cover to cover about 10 times that night. I found several weeks after Michael's death. It made me experience emotions i did not kno w existed. The book for the first time made me cry, especially I You We. Being German American I loved Berlin 1989. If you are a fan or maybe even not, I guarantee you will love this book.RIP MJ"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Beautiful book which I read for the first time when I was 15. Written with heart and with lovely presentation."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Unbelievable. $1200.00. The mind boggles. The book is truly a beautiful collection of poetry and deeply personal essays by a man who was quite simply the greatest artist of our age. Nevertheless, the money-grubbing exhibited since his death, including by some members of the poor man's own family, has been beyond disgusting. I just bought this book (new, unread copy) from Abebooks for $21.00 plus shipping. Doubleday is re-releasing it in the U.K. for slightly more than that (you can order it from there). Don't reward the greed of this seller by paying this absurd, bottom-feeding price."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This was the most wonderful book I have ever read. As soon as I heard about it I had to have it because I have always been a huge Michael Jackson fan, and always will be. However, though I expected it to be good. I did not expect this. The poems and essays are so well thought out and beautifully written. The man has a true gift. Every single work is filled with the joy of life and is a true inspiration. It has even inspired me to start writing poetry, but I am not nearly as good as this. They made me smile, laugh, and cry. Whenever I have a bad day I read either &quot;The Heart Said No&quot; or &quot;Grew Wings Without Me&quot; or &quot;Trust&quot; and they truly lift my spirit. There are also great essays and poems about nature and animals like &quot;When the Elephants March&quot; and &quot;Look Again, Baby Seal.&quot; Also, there are poems about the love of God. Furthermore you will discover how Michael really feels about children in poems like &quot;Children of the World,&quot; &quot;On Children,&quot; &quot;When Babies Smile,&quot; and &quot;Wise Little Girl.&quot; This man is the last person in the world that I would worry about being with children. After reading this, I trust him not to hurt children more than I do myself! And I adore children! This book is truly beautiful and will show the path of love and righteousness to anyone who reads it. I would recommend this to someone whether or not they have ever bought a Michael Jackson record. If you want to be inspired beyond belief, read this. If you want to know who the REAL Michael Jackson is, don't watch the news, read this."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This is Michael Jackson at his prime. It is a living proof that the man is not only the greatest pop star that ever lived, he's the greatest artist that ever lived.The book is printed 100% on glossy paper and has tons of pictures. It contains Jackson's observation on life, humanity, god, the world and children. It takes you places only Michael Jackson can.So, in a word? Breathtaking.

It cost twenty one dollars and seventy one cent including shipping cost.Update: they ship fast and you want to pay by Capital One credit card to avoid the exchange rate fee. I think other credit cards charge fee for foreign transaction. The new one is exactly like the original one except for new picture on the cover. All the pictures, poems and essay are the same. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"After reading this book I was speechless. I found myself in complete awe, not because Michael Jackson is the world's most talented writer but because he is so raw, genuine, and his words are filled with innocence and sincerity.This book is delightful to read - a must read for Michael Jackson fans. Unfortunately, due to his recent tragic death, it's hard to find at a reasonable, affordable price anymore. I'm sure you can get your hands on it somehow though at a library. As I read this, I could almost hear Michael Jackson saying the things he writes in my head. The pages also contain artwork and some absolutely beautiful pictures of Michael.His short essays, even more than his poems, are a pleasure to read because they really present Michael as a human being who is so curious and simple. He wonders about things like the stars and makes keen observations about things that most people would find too insignificant to notice - like how elephants always have to stand, even when they're sleeping. He thought that the things most people would disregard were worth thinking about. He thought about everything! This simplicity allows the reader to connect with him. This book reminds me of his song, Human Nature because the reader really get's a glimpse into Michael's human nature in this book. He asks why. He writes a lot about children as well which really captures the purity and innocence in how he connects with children.After reading this book, I was left with only one thought (aside from how insanely gorgeous this man was): what couldn't Michael Jackson do? He could write, dance, sing, compose music, act...He encompassed all the forms of art and in everything he did, he made sure he was the best at it. This book is a small glimpse into the beautiful mind of Michael Jackson. Anyone who wants to know anything about Michael the person, rather than the celebrity, should read this book first."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This book is living proof that Michael Jackson is not only a wonderful musician, but a wise and wonderful human being with a childlike innocence that is a rare find these days. God bless him."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This book is without doubt the best one I've ever read, no book has touched me like this one. It has such great messages and it's almost as if you can feel the magic by reading it that Michael probably felt when he wrote it. This is a must read for both fans and non-fans, because either way, this is a master piece."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Dancing the dream is a glimpse into the soul of Michael Jackson. It's a must have for any fan. It gives you a MUCH MUCH MUCH better idea of who he is than his 'autobiography' Moonwalk (which was little more than a recounting of his career). This book shows you the idealistic, perhaps naive, and sometimes sappy core of Michael.If you're looking for the world's best poetry or writings, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a glimpse of Michael Jackson's heart, if you want to escape the harsh realities of everyday life and indulge in the idealistic dreams of someone who genuinely looks for the good in the world, then this is the book for you.Any time I'm feeling down, I can always pick up this book and read a few pages and it always makes me feel better :)"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Michael Jackson wrote some Great Poems here and they cover many topics.Alot Of Folks don't Understand or Know How Talented he Really is.The Man has Been GIfted for so Long.He is a Great Talent."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I always thought about Michael Jackson as a great singer, song/writer and dancer. This book shows that he is a great poet too. It also shows how gentle he is. I love this book! If you think that Michael is just a spoiled, creazy pop star, then this book will change your mind. My favorite poems are &quot;But The Heart Said No&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I got this book not too long ago from London. I was just browsing for poetry in a bookstore and I saw this book. I was really surprised to learn that MJ is the author of this poetry book. Anyway, I read the book on the airplane on my way from London back to the USA. It is totally beyond my expectation. I love MJ music and respect his god-given talent, but I would never expect he could write poems like that! His words are beautiful, profound, witty and very intelligent. Technically the writing is quite simple, but the beauty of this book is the soul it bears. MJ is all about L O V E. This man has a pure, genuine and very kind heart."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This book is a complete treasure. I love this book it clearly reflect on the person that MJ was. His poetry is heart felt and his lyrics are amazing.This book is a good indicator into the mind of Michael.

This book is breathtaking! A must buy for everyone! For those who judged him, read this book! you can sense what kind of person he is. He is loving and caring to the world and he simply wants it to become a beautiful place. He wants WORLD PEACE!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I didn't even know this book existed until I was here on amazon a few months ago looking up all books that came up under a search of Michael Jackson. The search result for this particular book came up on the last few pages, so it could have easily been skipped/missed. I was a bit shocked and disappointed when I found out how much this book was going to cost, even for a used edition of it. The \\"new\\" ones were being offered for $1200 at the time I wanted to purchase it, which is just ridiculously overpriced, since the actual book when it came out in July 1992, costed only $17.50 before tax.So it is good to note that if you don't really care for the cover (the image on the dust jacket of MJ in his pose from the Black or White vid) and if it's not a big deal for you to get the first or original edition of it and you just want to read what's in the book itself, then as other reviewers have already suggested, it is highly recommended to just go to amazon's UK site and order it (the same book that just has a different cover) from there, as you would be able to get it for much less.I personally wanted to get the first edition and although at first I was hesitant to pay so much even for a used book of the original edition, I knew it would ultimately be worth it, in my opinion, so I looked through all the sellers that were offering it and based on the seller's descriptions of the conditions of their particular used copy, I narrowed it down and contacted one of the sellers for more additional info about the book itself. The particular seller that I had e-mailed responded very quickly and provided photos to me of the condition of the book as well as exact details on it and any of its flaws, which I really appreciated. When I received the book in the mail, I was so happy with my purchase! The seller, books_below, did a great job of shipping it out fast and wrapped it nicely, and the book I received was really in excellent condition, so I am glad to have been fortunate to have purchased it from a reputable and honest seller. Besides just a few spots on the outside cover underneath the dust jacket and a slight curling to the edges of the dust jacket itself, there were absolutely no other flaws nor marks inside the actual book itself, so the inside pages were truly in pristine condition. I see sellers that are putting the book up for sale with conditions less desirable for so much more than what I paid, so if you are looking to buy the used edition, be sure to ask detailed questions to the seller and ask for photos!As for what Michael Jackson has written in this book, I cannot add more to what has already been stated in all these previous reviews. I knew Michael Jackson was very talented when it came to singing and dancing and the arts, but what he wrote in this book is on a whole different level. Most of what's written in here is deep stuff. I had trouble following some of it too (as some other reviewers have stated), but it's not because it doesn't make sense - I just kept re-reading what he is saying until I finally comprehended it. One can definitely tell clearly his love that he has for animals, children, the earth and God by reading his writings in here. And the photos included in this book are absolutely beautiful!!! Even from a book that came out originally in 1992, I was amazed at the great quality of the photos and the paper that's used is high quality as well.If I'm not mistaken, Michael Jackson had only written two published books in his lifetime, one being \\"Moonwalk\\" and the other being, \\"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections\\". As a big MJ fan, both of those books have been a joy to read, each special in its own ways. Each time I open this particular book to read a story in here, it's nice because I always feel a wave of calm and peace come over me. What makes this book different and special to me, is that I can see myself opening this often, just to read one of his writings to cheer me up, or to really meditate or concentrate on a particular story he had written that helps to see how he had seen things in life, and how you can try to think the way he did and apply what he is stating, in your life. This book has had such a positive impact on me and I'm so glad to have purchased it. I would absolutely recommend this in the collection of any MJ fan, it is truly worth it!!!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of this book.

That is why you will love it."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"\\"Dancing the Dream\\" is an amazingly beautiful poems and reflections in one volume by Michael Jackson to allow us to have a glimpse into his mysterious soul. He had always been a mischievous loving human being to amaze us with his angelic high pitch voice and professional energetic dancing performances on every stage. In contrary, he was a terribly shy person off stage with a deep gentle loving heart for the entire human being and the nature of this planet Earth. Off course, there always had been a very dark complicated side of him which he carefully tried to hide...but doesn't everybody have both sides? The difference is only the depth of them all. A lot of us who understand the inconsistencies or conflicts within religious organizations but feels the urge to hold on to their spiritual beliefs are capable to accept such dichotomy. With listening to his speeches, interviews and casual conversations, his intelligence was so obvious. He also had the aggressiveness, the business tactics to conquer the eugenically manipulated music industry to straiten the history of the core position of the black race...which probably sped to widen his grave hole....It seems impossible to understand the real Michael Jackson... probably, because he himself couldn't understand or try to believe his disguised self image...So, let us hold on to this breathtakingly beautiful book and try to believe in them. Let us always remember the generous creative works by the genious late Michael Jackson.Read it on Scribd if you don't have it."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"What a beautiful book this is for Michael's fans! It's full of wonderful photos and illustrations, not to mention his touching poems and essays. His words give insight to the humanitarian he really was, and reflecting on his writing inspires me to be a better person."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Many books have been written about Michael Jackson the Entertainer. But Michael Jackson's Dancing the Dream should be required reading for anyone wanting to get to know Michael Jackson, the Man. In addition to MJ's phenomenal talents as a singer, dancer and songwriter, Michael had a wonderful, easy way with words as an author as well. Dancing the Dream is a beautifully written book of essays, poetry and observations about life. The heart of this book is MJ's writing and the soul of this book is MJ's message. His message is that we are all connected to each other and to this planet. We are all in this together, and we can make it wonderful if we all work at it. Only a genuinely good, decent person could have or would have written a book like this. When Michael died, we not only lost one of the the greatest entertainers of all time, we lost a mighty fine human being as well. As for the book itself, a lot of thought was put into its layout and design, from the typefaces used to the well-chosen photographs used to illustrate each entry. And check out the really cool drawing done by MJ himself of when he was very young. This one drawing itself tells a story, and is an example of one more thing this Renaissance Man was good at: visual art. I totally recommend this book to any one who wants to get a good look at another side of Michael Jackson."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books I think I have ever read. What an enormous insight into the heart of one of the worlds most influential people. Yes, I am speaking of none other than Michael Jackson.

I would have liked to have seen more from this hidden side of a greatly talented man, musician and humanitarian. My hats off to you, Michael. Love and miss you terribly."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"i LOVED this book of poems and reflections from michael jackson. i like to write poetry myself and so i can really appreciate and identify in that way here - i am also a very reflective thinker and so i really appreciate people who take the time to reflect and write down their thoughts. i love to write so i can relate to this form of communication well.this book really gives insight into the mind and thoughts of michael jackson in a way that is so unique that it is inspiring and very deep. i truly enjoyed reading this and being exposed to a side of mj that i didn't know before.the introduction says this : \\"i think michael is like litmus paper. he is always trying to learn. he is so intelligent that he is alarmingly bright. he is also very curious and wants to draw from people who have survived. people who have lasted. he is not really of this planet. he is filled with deep emotions that create an unearthly, special, innocent, childlike, wise man that is michael jackson. i think michael appeals to the child in all of us, and i think he has the quality of innocence that we would all like to obtain or to have kept.\\" - elizabeth taylori loved first of all how this book was dedicated to his mother. he has a poem called \\"mother\\" in the book - some of it says, \\"...you gave me joy and position, cared for me without condition, and if ever i change this world, it's from the emotions you've unfurl'd.\\" what a neat poem! i'd love one of my kids to write to me that way one day!in one of his reflections, this one on God, he says, \\"for me the form God takes is not the most important thing. what's most important is the essence. my songs and dances are outlines for Him to come in and fill.\\" and in another part, \\"i've looked up at the night sky and beheld the stars so intimately close, it was as if my grandmother had made them for me. 'how rich, how sumptuous,' i thought. in that moment i saw God in His creation.\\"one quote that i extemely like of mj's in another one of his reflections is, \\"this world we live in is the dance of the creator.\\" the cover flap sums it up well when it reads, \\"...this incredible, inspirational man who died as he lived - dancing his dream.\\"i highly suggest this book for anyone to read - esp fans of mj who want to get a perspective of went on inside his head and how creative he could be in expressing that. awesome color photos in here too!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Dancing the Dream is unquestionably a must have for any Michael Jackson fan.

As you read through the lines, you get this clear glimpse of Michael's thoughts and beliefs and by the time you finish reading it, you are enlightened with the spirit of Michael Jackson. You wouldn't feel the need to read tabloids and gossips on Michael Jackson to solve the supposed mystery of his life. You understand that he was connected with the above in his own way and he only wanted to share it with the world.Even if you are not a Michael Jackson fan, this book is still precious for it talks of love, humanity and kindness. An inspirational and heartwarming book. Go for it."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I enjoyed his poetry. I'll have to say I had a hard time following his thinking at times but the problem is mine; not his. He was such a profound thinker. His earth poem was above me but when I later listened to him recite it on his This Is It CD, I got it. This book reveals his extremely high intellect and genius. I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds. He was such a loving and caring person."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I'm very happy with this book!

I'm not much of a poetry fan but after reading this I felt that I knew Michael so much better, how he thought and felt about many things. The photos were awesome too! No one can describe Michael like Michael. No one ever will be like him again. This was a rare look at a true legend."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This is a must have item to add to your collection. It's a wonderful insight into Michael's heart and soul. I was very pleased with the product and look forward to receiving his book Moomwalk.

Michael reveals his soul through the art of poetry and photos!!!! &quot;Dancing the Dream &quot; reveals Michael 's genius and brillance!!!!! He delves into the beauty of Mother Nature and teaches us what she has to offer!!!!! It is quite evident that Michael truly has a geniune concern for Nature, Mother Earth and Mankind!! It may seem sacrireligious, however, I truly believe&quot; Dancing the Dream &quot; is a the &quot;Bible &quot; for his fans!!! This has changed my perspective on life and Nature!!! &quot;Dancing the Dream&quot; ought to be used a teacing tool; as some sort of guide!!! It's Michael at his best!! It is Michael!!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I love this book and its a must have for any Michael Jackson fan. It's Michael's 2nd book (his first being 'Moonwalk'). It is a sensitive, beautiful and personal view of the world through his eyes, not only of the world around us, but the one inside all of us too. It is a brilliant collection of Michael's own writing, his poems,lyrics, reflections and observations. As if that isn't treat enough it contains so many wonderful photographs, as well as drawings, + paintings from his personal collection.This book shows how inspirational Michael was and serves to highlight what a tragic loss he is to the world. Michael Jackson was a master at his craft - his music, singing, dancing, his humanitarianism, and his writing - In all these things he was a perfectionist and gave only the best. I have read this book through from cover to cover, but I just can't help picking it up, almost daily, to look through it again and read his words which are inspirational, profound and honest, but most of all deeply sincere and straight from his heart. On stage he was a powerhouse of confidence, energy, talent and professionalism - Off stage he was a gentle soul and a sensitive human being with a warm heart. It is so sad that only now, after his death, are people beginning to truly appreciate who the man really was, as opposed to the way the media bias portrayed him! (Shame on them). His millions of fans worldwide have always known he was truly the one and only 'King of Pop'. They love him, not just as a celebrity, but as a human being, for all his great humanitarian work, and for caring so much about the planet we all share. Michael inspired that love. We can't all be wrong! His memory will live on always. Rest in peace Michael. Buy the book!"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"Poet, philosopher and mysticDancing the Dream has been republished in England and is available for a reasonable price at amazon.co.uk, although for some reason it is not available yet in the US.Students of poetry will recognize In Michael Jackson's poetry a number of poetic devices and forms that give clear evidence of his own study and love of poetry. Here is no novice poet. Only a skilled poet can express deep thoughts with the simplicity and ease Michael Jackson does. His poetic spirit is actually quite evident in the lyrics of many of his songs, though it takes center stage when seen by itself in this book without musical accompaniment.His essays in this book reveal the mind of a philosopher and mystic as well. But unlike most philosophers, he has the genius to distill his thought to its simplest and most easily understood ideas, and to express them so clearly that almost anyone can understand them. I find myself often reflecting on his words, rejoicing to find a spirit in tune with my own and building on his insights!His mystical nature becomes evident in the way he sees the Dance. \\"I keep on dancing and then, it is the eternal dance of creation.\\" I'm reminded of the Shaker hymn, \\"The Lord of the Dance\\" in which the life and death of Christ is celebrated as a series of dances. Michael's vision of the unity of life is deeply mystical, as when he writes in his poem \\"Heaven is here\\": \\"You and I were never separate.\\" Michael Jackson's earthly life was powered by joy, love and bliss, and that bliss is evident in the pictures of him throughout this book. We come to realize the powerhouse he was on stage simply evidenced the tremendous joy and love that powered his life.He reveals himself as an excellent storyteller in stories like The Boy and the Pillow and The Fish that was Thirsty. Small wonder he kept children entertained for hours at Neverland! Without preaching he gets across the idea that people who don't find God miss what is everywhere like fish who say they're thirsty. \\"But for me the sweetest contact with God has no form. I close my eyes, look within, and enter a deep soft silence. The infinity of God's creation embraces me. We are one.\\"Michael wrote, \\"We were born to never die.\\" Meeting him in Dancing the Dream, I know he isn't dead. His body is dead and buried, but Michael Jackson lives and will never die. We can join him in heaven now, as he wrote in \\"Heaven is HERE\\":\\"Heaven is hereRight now is the momentof eternity.Don't fool yourself.Reclaim your bliss.\\""},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"I didn't just buy this book...I bought this book when it first came out and I just wanted to post a comment.

I just wish that more people would not be afraid to speak their mind of the simple beauties and wisdom of life, because other people could learn from them. the things michael has said has literally changed my life, i would not be the person that i am today. and i am glad to pass on what i have learned."},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"The poems in this book are wonderful to read and the pictures in this book are great.

For those of you who think Michael Jackson is crazy, or others who may think his only talents lie in singing and dancing, you gotta read this book! It's basically a collection of poems and stories written by Michael, and each one has a moral (No, it's not a kiddie book). I used to think he had no talent for writing before I read it, but after I read some of the reflections, I felt like I had experienced and learned more than I ever had from a single book. For those Christians, there's a good number of poems and reflections about God in there, too! My favorite poems in there are &quot;So the Elephants March,&quot; &quot;I You We,&quot; &quot;Berlin 1989,&quot; and &quot;But the Heart Said No.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dancing the Dream: Poems and Reflections","review":"This book is a wonderful testament of Michael's love for God, humanity, animals and our planet.Michael wrote on many things including his love for his mother, the innocence of children, and he even pleadedwith the baby seal to forgive us for killing them by the thousands each year.\\"Look Again, Baby Seal\\" (excerpt)Baby seal, forgive us. Those men who raise their clubs over you are also fathers and brothers and sons. They have loved and cared for others. One day they will extend that love to you.Michael invites us into his world and challenges us to re-evaluate our way of thinking. To move from apathy to compassion, from selfishness to selflessness.In \\"So the Elephants March\\" Michael beautifully explains how the elephant's gentleness shows a reverance for life.He exclaims that even while enduring cruel and inhumane treatment they remain silent, patient, peaceful creatures even though they have the power to uproot whole forests.\\"Magical Child\\" Part I (excerpt)(I find this poem to be one of the truest reflections of himself Michael could have ever penned)He knew his power was the power of GodHe was so sure, they considered him oddThis power of innocence, of compassion, of lightThreatened the priests and created a fightIn endless ways they sought to dismantleThis mysterious force which they could not handleThe desire Michael had for wanting to make the world a better place was apparent in his music but also evident in his short story\\"That One in the Mirror\\" (excerpt)I wanted to change the world, so I got up one morning and looked in the mirror. That one looking back said, \\"Thereis not much time left. The earth is wracked with pain. Children are starving. Nations remain divided by mistrust and hatred. Everywhere the air and water have been fouled almost beyond help. Do something!\\" (On the opposite page of the story is a picture of Michael sitting on the floor with his hands covering his face, to hide his tears and sadness).Michael writes about his views of the world in deep revelation and with each word you can feel his yearning, his pain, and his hope that things will someday change for the better.Yes, Michael was talented beyond all imagination. He was gifted in singing, dancing, writing and many other things.But what made him truly remarkable was the fact that even through his astronomical success he remained humble, and through his unrelenting tribulations he remained full of love. He teaches through his writings and the life he lived that love and humbleness, grounded by faith in God are needed if we are to ever heal the world.In conclusion, these poems and short stories are revealing, intelligent, extremely insightful and heartfelt. Everyone, whether a fan or not, should have this book. Fans will no doubt enjoy the beautiful pictures, but fans and non-fans alike will appreciate these poignant writings that call for us all to reflect on how we treat our earth as well as one another. This book is absolutely amazing. I can't imagine not owning this treasure!By the way for those of you who can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars on it try Amazon UK.

The illustrations are bright and captivating to look at."},{"Title":"T. Rex Trick-or-Treats","review":"Parents of young children looking for picture books to introduce Halloween and its customs could do worse than this book. The titular character is trying to find a scary costume for Halloween. His three friends, the Diplodocus, the Stegosaurus and the Iguanodan, help him in his quest.There is nothing remotely scary about this book and that is a plus. The vocabulary and tone are best for the preschool audience. Parents may balk at the sight of apples, baked goods and other handmade goodies but this book is not intended to be a step-by-step safety guide for Halloween. Instead, it is a fun Halloween adventure that tackles one of the biggest anxieties kids face: What will I wear?My sons (ages 8 and 7) didn't find the book as interesting as another Halloween-themed picture book,The Ghost of Nicholas Greebe, we recently read. However, that reflects their ages and the volume of bedtime books we read, not any particular fault with this book.In summary, I recommend this picture book for children ages 4-7. The light-hearted story won't leave a lasting impression but it will make a fun introduction to Halloween."},{"Title":"T.

I was thrilled to see the novel written by Isaac Asimov, although he based it upon the screenplay, which is something Isaac is definitely NOT known for doing. He then went on to write his own version: 'Fantastic Voyage: Destination Brain' which again was fun, but I found it to be not quite up to the usual Asimov level of entertainment and intellectual stimulation. Now comes Kevin J. Anderson and a version which takes us inside the body of a real alien. Could there be a better premise for a novel about miniaturization?I am happy to say that Anderson does a Fantastic job of taking an idea originated by someone else, and taking it to a higher level of science AND entertainment. Now, it has been mentioned before that this book isn't going to make anyone smarter by reading it, but, it certainly WILL give you an entertaining thrill while you do.I read some reviewers now and again who base a books readability upon an almost impossible set of statistics that virtually NO book will ever live up to...are the locations of each novel 100% accurate? Is the science verifiable and factual? I personally base MY enjoyment upon whether or not I actually ENJOY the story, NOT the messy details...not that they aren't important or appreciated when an author goes out of their way to do the research, but I personally don't believe miniaturization is possible--at least not yet anyway--and therefore NO amount of scientific explanation, no matter HOW plausible and sophisticated it sounds will suddenly sway my opinion on whether or not a novel is actually worth reading. However, Anderson has written the technical details in such a way that whether or not miniaturization IS possible, it sure SOUNDS possible.Oh yeah, one more thing: This story MOVES. Yes, it DOES take a chapter or two before the plot really unfolds, but trust me, when it finally takes flight, make sure your seatbelt is fastened and your tray is in the full and upright position 'cuz you suddenly go super-sonic super fast. The imagination alone it took to craft this story is worth the price of the novel...but the fact that Anderson has given us a great story as well certainly underscores his raw talent at storytelling. Buy this book and set aside an afternoon of virtual adventure in Innerspace...you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage: Microcosm","review":"This story spends about a hundred pages developing diverse intersting characters and then BANG sends them on a fantastic voyage. While I did not find the actual voyage into the alien that exciting, it was definitely suspenseful. What was more interesting to me was the story that was happening outside the alien among the politicians, diplomats, and the poor doctors. This was page-turning stuff! I think that the problem with the voyage inside the body was that it plays better on the big screen where one can visualize the suspense among the myriad of special effects. The narrative does just not do it justice. Great characters, a mysterious alien, and a good tale make this a four star book."},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage: Microcosm","review":"What Asimov's 'Fantastic Voyage' did for the human body; Anderson does for the alien. 'Microcosm' is at once filled with chilling alien exotica, fraught with danger, speculation, and awe,for that edge-of-your-seat ride. Anderson has written an exhilarating and fast-paced thriller that is a welcome companion to Asimov's original novel. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet."},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage: Microcosm","review":"Immediately after reading the blurb on the back, I realized that the idea has some inherent limitation, and it would take a lot of doing to pull it off. I decided to go ahead and read the book, and see if Kevin J Anderson's reputation as a good writer would hold up. The book does have it share of action and highlights that makes it worth the time spent reading it, but I'm not sure if it was worth the money.As far as science-fiction goes, most of the science that Anderson uses to explain the technology in the book is solid, but somewhat shallow. There is a lack of depth in the biological description of the alien body: the details Anderson uses consists primarily of very elementary biological terms. Furthermore, this book lacks a strong underlying meaning or message that can be found in great sci-fi. In this respect, it comes off as little more than a sci-fi thriller filled with some fancy terms. I am not even sure if the science (especially the physics aspect) or the logic for that matter is very sound.In my opinion, the characters are paper-thin and rely on mostly character sterotypes to carry them through. I could not relate to the characters and did not feel emotionally attached to them when something happened to them. Anderson choose to place his character description in the weirdest place, often inserting them in the middle of an action scene. His characterization also lack subtlety; he tells the reader what the characters are like rather than revealing them within the plot or dialougle.Speaking of dialouge, the lines exchanged between character are often corny and used at utterly inappropriate times. Failed attempts at humor punctuating scenes seem out of place and make the characters (especially the Mote's crew) seem like they aren't facing grave danger.Summing it up, the novel does what it sets out to do (excite the reader with lots of action) relatively well without doing much more. For me, much of the plot was predictable so the book didn't intrigue me as much as it could have, but I did enjoy the end. The nanotechnology twist breathe additonal life into the novel, but it was excessive towards the end (how smart can those nanocritters be with microscopic brains?). I think this book would be a lot better as a movie especially with special effects. The abundance of action, plot, characters, and lack of deeper meaning makes it like the movie, Armaggadeon.You will probably enjoy this this book if you liked Armaggadeon, but I am somewhat of a sci-fi purist which explains the negative tone of my review. It's a also good book if you're bored or need something to fill time on a long trip (like me)."},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage: Microcosm","review":"In present day Russia, Deputy Director Foreign Minister Vasili Garamov is in Azerbaijan trying to defuse a military crisis.

There were no footnotes at all anywhere in the book to back up her information, and the &quot;sources&quot; listed at the end of the book are vague, and don't give specific names, dates, and page numbers of newspaper articles, letters, magazine articles, etc. etc. Although she occasionally named titles of newspapers and magazines within the book, there was no further documentation given (i.e., dates and page numbers), so it would be impossible to look up the information. She says she had access to letters and memoirs that Nelson's mother had written. Where are these letters and memoirs? She doesn't tell us where they're located or who owns them, in case we'd like to see them for ourselves. Also, some chapter notes just list sources as &quot;newspaper clippings&quot; and most of the people interviewed were &quot;anonymous&quot; or came from material written or published by herself, in her own fan club magazine. All authors and historians should make their writing and sources reliable. If you can't trust the sources, you can't say her story is true, no matter how much you'd like it to be."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"This book smacks of fly-by-night-publishing. The grammatical skills are poor, the source notes are suspiciously bogus, and the alleged stories are highly dubious. After reading Edward Baron Turk's prestigious,meticulously researched biography on Jeanette MacDonald, Rich's book definitely lacks credibility. She &quot;lifts&quot; a lot of material that I've seen before (without giving the sources any credit) - for example, the quote attributed to Lotte Lehmann was snatched off RCA's 1967 LP of MacDonald's. Also, Rich's claim that she had long talks with Blossom Rock (MacDonald's sister) is highly unlikely: Rock herself could not speak after a debilitating stroke. Evidently I am not the only one to disbelieve this book: according to a brief newsclip I heard on television, a major book project - spearheaded by a private detective and an old friend of MacDonald's - is underway to dispute all of the allegations made by Rich. I hope it permanently erases all the damage Rich has done to several fine people. I'm glad the book is out of print, so it can't do any more harm."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"This book is a &quot;trash-fest&quot; that should appeal to people who think what is printed in the supermarket tabloids is true. The so-called affair between these two stars is nothing more than an extension of the author's vivid imagination. It is very unfair to trash the reputations of two fine people who have been deceased for more than 30 years and cannot defend themselves, and I found the &quot;sources&quot; very questionable."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"A concatenation of &quot;research&quot; that is touted (but not demonstrated), in contradiction to most reliable documented information and apparently libelous in the extreme to two individuals (and their respective spouses) who, deceased, are not able to defend themselves.

As a genuine fan, I am disgusted."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"I've written several books on classic movie actors and actresses from the silent era to the present, and found this title at a used book store while in the U.S. After reading it, I must say it made quite a romantic story, but couldn't help being disappointed in the author's amateurish abilities as a writer. [Louis B. Mayer's first name is NOT spelled &quot;Louie&quot;, for instance...] To begin with, I found the &quot;Sources&quot; at the back of the book very questionable. Sources given as &quot;Newspaper clipping&quot; (without dates) and also the old standby &quot;Anonymous source&quot; don't quite measure up to the standards of a true film historian. If you can't name and date your source, don't write it! Lastly, many of the sources can't be found in public libraries for researchers to access, they are letters housed in the &quot;author's collection.&quot; As a historian, I could only recommend this book to Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy fans as a collector's item. Even if the author's claims ARE true, this book is very poorly written and documented, and would not be a definitive source of information for anyone wanting to know more about Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Most, if not all, film historians like myself would dismiss this kind of writing as something suitable for tabloid newspapers. From what I understand, most already have."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"Don't be taken in by Rich's protestations of truth.

It appears to verify what all the Nelson and Jeanette fans have felt, despite an organized effort on the part of Gene Raymond's and Jeanette's supporters to demonize Nelson, and destroy his reputation.As a Nelson fan, I resent this and hope Ms. Rich's apparently well documented bio will dispell the lies about their relationship whatever its' duration.I have a few questions re it being a lifetime affair.I've begun looking into Nelson's later years as a nightclub intertainer and another relationship with his singing partner.There's very little coverage of this in the book, and, hopefully this will be explained later.In the mea ntime, the author seems to have fully researched the earlier Hollywood years and seems to have very good sources, especially Jeanette's sister, Blossom.to confirm their romance.The villains who tried to keep them apart are their spouses and LB Mayer. Some parts are a little dramatized and over the top, but guess a writer has to have a certain amount of drama and conflict along with the romance. otherwise, it appears to be a well written and enjoyable look back at a Hollywood love affair,that kept going off track, and ultimately failing.christine ."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"First of all Sharon Rich isn't exactly the best writer but never mind that, this book is good. I mean even if you don't like Jeanette or Nelson it's got a lot of Hollywood history and tragedy. Some of it was a bit silly but other parts were very real. And at this point I think maybe it did happen, it's hard to imagine that in a partnership that worked and lasted that long nothing was ever felt or ever happened."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"An eye-opener!

The one written by Mr. Turk is a sugar-coated silly tribute to Gene Raymond. Jeanette and Nelson were obvioulsy very much in love. This seems evident by just how they looked at one another. Both of them seem somewhat lost today. It's really a shame that society has sunk so low. We can only hope that their kind will come back sometime soon! This book is such a good read and very entertaining while still being very honest and candid. I too have first hand knowledge by way of another Hollywood Luminary, none other than Ann Sothern who was a frequent co-star with Gene Raymond in the 1930's and a fellow player at MGM in the early 1940's. Ms. Sothern shared some very interesting facts regarding the MacDonald/Eddy relationship. It is such a shame that they were not able to live a life together. Many years from now, the written words and gossip will all be forgotten, but the films they made for us will live forever. Thanks Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald from the bottom of my heart for sharing your wonderful talents with us, We all hope you are singing together forever more!"},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"A good source for information on the on and off-screen love affair between Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. There are not many books out there than suggest that their love affair was even a possibility.Full of accounts of suicide attempts, physical and emotional breakdowns, breakups and reconciliations, and other tragedies, there is an upside to all this: The deep and abiding love between two very intense, talented, and passionate human beings.The book remainds a good source, but I was put off by the many spelling and grammatical errors in the book. A good editor should have caught these. And the reliance on too many secondary and \\"anonymous\\" sources was off-putting as well. Some of the claims could indeed have been better substantiated.All in all, I believe in the romance of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald due to the BETTER sources in the book, plus the feeling I get when watching their movies. You could SEE they were in love with each other.In closing, I would recommend the book as a valuable starting tool for learning about one of the most popular duos of the 1930's. But please keep an open mind."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"My mother could not stop raving about this book.

At the time I had barely heard of Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddy. I happened to read a small chapter about them in another Hollywood book and my interest was piqued. It is the best money I have ever spent on a book, and I have many, and it is re-readable over and over. The facts are given concisely and clearly and backed up by many years of hard research and is written in a style that encourages you to read long after you should be doing something else. Not only that but it is unputdownable, you need to keep turning the pages and when you do there is always something that you may have missed or not thought about.The whole story of these two magnetic stars is tragic, both intent on careers, both very alike in temperament, too many meddling people who couldn't leave them alone, from her mother Anna Macdonald to studio megalomaniac Louis B Mayer, who wrecked so many lives.The author, Sharon Rich spent many years compiling the material for this book and was personally a friend of Jeanette's sister Blossom, from whom she got a great deal of information. Blossom knew about this book and heartily approved of the subject matter, even suggesting it and giving her total support to the project.Over the years since publication Ms Rich has been slated for writing \\"trashy fiction\\". As anyone with a modicum of sense can see there is too much evidence in the work to be lightly dismissed, and as for the idea that it is fiction, it is easy to see this is a serious work of non fiction that should be on the bookshelf of everyone who is interested in the 30s and the Golden Age of Hollywood. The definitve book about Jeanette and Nelson. Who could ask for more.Just watch the movies and look at the way they react to one another. This is not method or even acting, it is love."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"I am a great admirer of both Nelson Eddy and Jeanette macDonald, and I was happy to see a new book about them be published. That was before I read it! This book seems to belong in the FICTION part of the library, as Ms. Rich has done the unforgiveable thing: waiting until practically everyone involved is dead and then writing a trashy &quot;supposed&quot; biography. The only good thing I can say about the book is that it has some very nice photographs. Otherwise, I think it is a collection of embellished and fabricated stories."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"My mother knew Nelson Eddy as a friend back in the 1930s and '40s. It is absolutely true that Nelson wanted to marry Jeanette MacDonald; it was discussed at our dinner table after Nelson's visits. Although I was a teenager and not privy to all of it, I learned enough to know that even though they married other people, their marriages were not happy and they still loved each other. Why some people still deny it is beyond belief and does Jeanette and Nelson a great disservice.

She had first hand knowledge of Nelson and Jeanette's love affair, which we used to discuss, after he visited. Why so many people cannot accept the reality of their relationship and continue to believe the fairy tale,that they want to believe, is beyond all reason.

I am the biggest fan and have loved them since 1965, I couldn't believe it when I viewed the &quot;This is your life&quot; tv show. The way she looked at Nelson when he walked out of the curtain, it was so clear, you KNOW it was love! FINALLY a book came out revealing what WE ALL KNEW ALREADY! Thanks so much Sharon Rich!

It's not hard to believe!)"},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"I would like to thank Ms. Rich for writing a book finally revealing the timeless love affair that all TRUE Mac/Eddy fans knew existed. Jeanette herself stated in a 1960's interview (Exerpt included in the book 'The Jeanette Macdonald Story') That she was in love with a man in the 1930s, tall, blonde, and always wondered what would have happened if she married him instead of Raymond. In their little ways they let the audience know what was going on behind the scenes, and for that I am glad. Now we know, THEY ARE TOGETHER, FINALLY! God Bless them and Thank you - Dame Sharon Rich"},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"Nelson and Jeanette have never been equalled.

I like the new chapter that tells how Miss Rich met and became friends with Jeanette's sister Blossom, who got her started on this story. Also in the new version I counted 56 pages of meticulous source notes, including reproductions of letters (from previously annonymous sources who have since died)for those who have to see it to believe it, Gene Raymond's arrest log, FBI files, etc. Famous people who are still alive and knew about the Jeanette-Nelson romance are quoted by name. No documentation? Get real! Arguing that Mayer was called &quot;Louie B.&quot; in the book is a minus point? He WAS called either that or L.B. to his name--and a lot worse names behind his back! Nelson Eddy called him &quot;Louie B.&quot; in interviews, so what is the problem here? Also, so what if some of the author's sources who are still living haven't decided to turn over private letters to a library. It has no bearing on the validity of those letters. Miss Rich played a lengthy videotape in Los Angeles last year at a Mac/Eddy luncheon of the owner of some of the letters. The elderly woman held the original letters up to the camera and read lengthy selections out loud, even some of the more graphic ones. Word for word, they were exactly as quoted in the book. Bottom line: Nelson Eddy bedded Jeanette MacDonald, as often as he could, it seems. So get over it! All I want to know is, Miss Rich, where's the movie version? We're waiting impatiently! I'm certain even the younger generation can learn from this tragic story of two people who discovered too late how much they loved each other. But until the movie is made, I highly recommend the book for any fan of old Hollywood or anyone who wants to read a true-life &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"I have met some of the sources named in &quot;Sweethearts&quot; and they verify that they were quoted correctly. Gene Raymond's homosexuality was well-known in Hollywood. Ms. Rich doesn't even mention that Raymond frequented that now-defunct gay bar in Cathedral City, Daddy Warbucks. The MacDonald-Eddy affair was best-known in town from the mid '30s to the mid '40s. In the '50s Jeanette semi-retired and Nelson left Hollywood to go on the nightclub circuit, so the &quot;Hollywood&quot; crowd knew less, plus the nature of her relationship with Nelson had changed. Obviously there was bitterness but also a spiritual bond that apparently was never broken. If the exhaustive documentation and celebrity name-dropping in the book doesn't convince you, [look] at Ms. Rich's just-published companion volume to &quot;Sweethearts,&quot; the Interactive Biography with a hundred photos that back up her claims, as well as a copy of Gene Raymond's arrest log with the LAPD. Look at the photos that prove they knew each other long before &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (clue: Nelson has a mustache). She's right when she says to listen to Nelson breaking down and crying while giving an interview the day Jeanette died, or to watch &quot;This is Your Life&quot; and see for yourself Jeanette's reaction when Nelson makes an appearance. Jeanette and Nelson themselves give the essence of the story away by their actions. Rich makes her case, sad to say, because it's a tragic story of two very decent people who were chewed up and spit out by Hollywood. That they kept their pain private from their fans and most of their friends, and tried to just go on with their lives, doesn't make it any less true."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"This book is extremely well documented, and the author wasn't sued even though Jeanette's husband is still alive. &quot;Sweethearts&quot; should be made as movie; it's one of the great Hollywood love stories. You can read the first chapter of it online at: http://idt.net/~maceddy"},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"Sharon Rich is an extraordinary woman. I know. I've known her since first reading &quot;Farewell to Dreams&quot; and asking her to actually document the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald story better before attempting to sell it to Hollywood. It was at this time that I began to insist that all of the interviews with some of Sharon's sources be videotaped... or audiotaped... so that the research could be preserved even after the interviewees died. Many of them have, sadly, passed on. But the tapes survive! In those days, a co-writer and I insisted that Sharon meticulously database the whereabouts of all the principals from the moment they met until their deaths, and she did just that. She poured through documents -- every kind of printed source (including the LA Times, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department logs, English newspapers, fanzines, Variety, etc) until she could darn near tell you on an hourly basis where Nelson, Jeanette, Gene, Ann Eddy, L.B. Mayer, and others were. While compiling the database, Sharon also came into possession of letters, unpublished autobiographies, and people who are still alive who can swear to the veracity of the information in Sweethearts. I can personally swear to meeting many of the people who knew Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. I can tell you, I have met Gene Raymond... interviewed him over lunch and also watched him meet one of his former lovers and Jeanette's gay friends. I have talked to people who sat at Blossom Rock's feet and heard the story first hand. I am convinced, from these interviews, that Blossom was not only in her right mind... but capable of telling the story (one way or another). Just because you cannot always speak doesn't mean you cannot write or communicate in other ways. This book is true, and the sources are available for researchers to access. It's a shame people like Turk do NOT make use of the invitation to do so. This is not only a terrific read, but it is the the life work of a woman who made a promise to Blossom Rock to tell the truth about Jeanette. She has kept her promise."},{"Title":"Sweethearts: The Timeless Love Affair- On-screen and Off- Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy","review":"Made me sad.

We begin with a quaint little village in England and the employees in a small bank.It starts out a little boring but quickly turns into a complicated affair when the bank manager turns up missing.

It helps that she's rich and her own boss. Her uncle, Mr. Horbury, manager of the Chestermarke bank, has disappeared, and the bankers claim he went off with securities and jewels.Mr. Horbury is such a principled, trustworthy person that no one but these unpleasant bankers can believe evil of him. There has to be another explanation. Two detectives from the Yard and the local police chief investigate, aided by the press, a handsome young bank clerk, the local townspeople, a cranky old antiquarian, and a shrewd traveling tinker, among others.Part of the fun of reading a Fletcher mystery is that we think we've guessed at the truth of the matter, and we have, partially, but the whole truth is incredibly complex and unexpected.The hero of this novel is the handsome young bank clerk, Wallington Neale. He gets himself into a tight spot that will make your blood pressure spike. The heroine is Miss Fosdyke, who is refreshingly brassy and pushy. She's not even conventionally pretty, just a force to be dealt with. Neale finds her captivating.The two bankers, the Chestermarke uncle and nephew, are two of the most unforgettable creeps in the literature of detection.The Chestermarke Instinct was first published in 1921. The setting is delicious - a gossipy old English town beside a rural wasteland full of dangerous abandoned mine shafts. This is my favorite Fletcher novel so far, and I've loved every one of them.Resurrected Press, as usual, does a nice job of typesetting, formatting and editing.

There is not very much too it, except for basically rehashing the first book in the cycle, \\"The Moons of Mirrodin.\\" Running away from the enemies, searching for items that are in places the characters have already been, except they wern't \\"ready\\" to understand the items use, or \\"wouldn't believe it.\\"This book has a severe time disorientation. It is so hard to follow time because it will take many chapters for the characters to go from, say, the plains to the swamp, while then it takes them only a chapter break to go from the center of Mirrodin to the forests on the surface. It seems the Mirrodin block is all about visiting the five mana sources (plains, swamp, islands, mountains, and forests) because in everybook they somehow, for some reason, need to run to all of them, and fight the same creatures in all of them. There is always, ALWAYS, fighting going on, and it gets very old because the fights are not that engaging.However, despite the one dimensional characters and plot, there is one moment in the book that I felt some serious emotion for the \\"bad guy.\\" I really felt for him, and had a lot of empathy for him. It was an extremely sad part, for me.They also find an item that wasn't even in the cardset for \\"Darksteel.\\" This item didn't come out on card until the next set, \\"A Fifth Dawn.\\"Despite the flaws in this book, I am still going to read the next book because I am interested in the final interaction between the heroes and Memnarch, and then, as the back of the book states, the planeswalker Karn, who created Mirrodin. Hopefully it won't be a lot of running to every part of the world in some undescript amount of time, and unneccesary battles up until the last couple chapters - but I'm not holding my breath...."},{"Title":"The Darksteel Eye (Magic the Gathering: Mirrodin Cycle, Book 2)","review":"We purchased this book as a gift.

Sprague de Camp for some time, but I am only now delving into his fiction. This book is a little peculiar; I can name several things I didn't love about the book, but overall I found it an interesting, enjoyable read. Kerin is our honorable barbarian (branded the latter for the sole reason that he travels to the east in his recorded journey) whose family sends him on a business trip immediately after the father of the supposedly \\"virginal\\" Adeliza (she is colorfully described by one character as having \\"a hot notch in her crotch\\") catches him in a hayloft with his daughter. He journeys to Kuromon to retrieve information on advanced clock technology. The journey is not an easy one. After bartering his way on to a ship, he is forced to flee from the jealousy of the captain's lust for the female navigator. After enduring some months with the talkative, self-exiled wizard Pwana on an otherwise deserted island, he finds himself in the hands of nasty pirates intent on buggering him and eventually killing him. Managing to escape unbuggered, he continues his journey with a princess rescued from the clutches of the dastardly pirates. All too soon, though, the princess falls into the clutches of Pwana, who intends to sacrifice her to his god. As if rescuing princesses is not enough, Kerin must also deliver a secret message to the Kuromon government, evade the continuing threats and attacks of the evil wizard Pwana, and abide the torment of the sprite Belinka who was hired on behalf of Adeliza to keep him away from other women (particularly the comely princess) while he is away from home.One thing that hinders the flow of the narrative, particularly early on, is the dialect of the characters, each of whom speaks like a second-rate Shakespearean actor, with \\"methinks,\\" \\"cansts,\\" \\"thankees,\\" and the like permeating the narrative. Everyone also makes a habit of referencing strangely-named gods in their rather numerous exclamations. This is standard fantasy fare, though, and it does tend to give the novel a more exotic, otherworldly feel. I must admit I was surprised by the amount of carnal references in these pages; there are a number of lewd jokes and loaded statements, but these are largely pretty subtle, often quite humorous, and in no way gratuitous. The conclusion lacks oomph, I feel, and it somehow seems to be rushed without really feeling rushed. Some of the things I viewed as most important early on ended up being rather trivial by the end, which was a little disconcerting. Even more disconcerting was the introduction of roller skates into this seemingly medieaval fantasy world, but such a little shock to the system is by no means a bad thing.The Honorable Barbarian does seem to be an offshoot of sorts of de Camp's The Reluctant King trilogy of novels, but ignorance of these other novels takes absolutely nothing away from your enjoyment of this story. This novel was captivating enough to convince me to read these other works and to continue exploring the fictional worlds of L. Sprague de Camp. There is just something about de Camp's writing style that distinguishes him from the crowd of modern fantasy writers, and this particular novel is certainly an enjoyable, eccentric read."},{"Title":"The Honorable Barbarian","review":"This is a delightful de Camp bit of slantwise fantasy.

This is a fate that his family has tried to save him from by sending him on a perilous mission.A great and joyous romp through the highs and lows of magic . . ."},{"Title":"Framing Software Reuse: Lessons From the Real World","review":"I thought I was becoming comfortable with OO until I ran into a group of Smalltalkers. What a mind bender! I learned things about OO that I didn't know. I also became concerned as, ostensibly for reuse purposes, the design stage decoupled logically unrelated functionality and fragmented real-world objects far beyond their natural granularity, to the point that I found myself mired in bitty components and methods with so little responsibility that I could no longer see the big picture. Worse, those myriad components now had complex interrelationships, most of which I could no longer see. I fully agreed that reuse was a worthy goal - but at the expense of readability and maintainability? Paul G. Bassett not only identifies and describes all of these issues (and much more), he has concrete solutions to these problems, with bottom line statistics to back up some pretty wild claims.

Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Of all things,","review":"This collection of Benchley's writings, appearing in magazines prior to 1920 or so, pleases the reader on several levels. There are articles whose humor hasn't faded in the 80 or more years since they were written such as \\"Coffee, Megg and Ilk,\\" or \\"The Passing of the Orthodox Paradox,\\" containing a nice parody of Oscar Wilde's plays. I think these are as funny to us as they were to the readers when they were written. There are others, such as \\"Lesson Number One,\\" that tells about learning to drive at a time when an automobile was as exotic a possession as, say, a home computer in the early 1990s. These are funny in a different way, and I enjoyed reading them even though the things they laugh at are decades out of date.Anyone who has suffered through learning to play bridge will enjoy \\"Not According to Hoyle,\\" and those who sympathize with the record number of Americans finding it hard to pay all their bills will delight in \\"Turning Over a New Ledger Leaf.\\" Those who read old literature will get a kick out of his pastiche of annotated Shakespeare in \\"Shakespeare Explained,\\" and anybody who has read a novel in which the plot is advanced by letters exchanged between two viewpoint characters will laugh at \\"When Genius Remained Your Humble Servant.\\"All in all, an excellent collection of humor writings not available elsewhere."},{"Title":"Of all things,","review":"I've loved Benchley since I stumbled on a collection of his short pieces in my father's library as a kid. Like any writer who turns out material in such volume, the entries are a bit hit or miss, and they should definitely be read a few at a time, rather than straight through. But at his best, Benchley was both a hilarious writer and a keen observer of the passing parade. The fact that these pieces were written 90 or more years ago doesn't detract from enjoying them. In fact, some of the most dated pieces are the best.Unfortunately, this Kessinger reprint edition isn't of the highest quality. Here is their disclaimer from the front:\\"Due to the very old age and scarcity of this book, many of the pages may be hard to read due to blurring of the original text, possible missing pages, missing text, dark backgrounds and other issues beyond our control.\\"Not too clear why these issues are beyond their control. In the case of this book, the main problem is that they have reprinted the original in reduced size. I have no idea why that would have been necessary. Every page has two-inch margins on each edge and type that is reduced in size to an extent that might cause a problem to anyone with vision difficulties. Otherwise, the reproduction is pretty good and I didn't detect any missing pages or missing text. As you can see, Kessinger has also replaced the original cover with a very nondescript one. One final problem is that my copy arrived a bit scuffed up. Whether that is a problem with Kessinger or with Amazon, I don't know.So, if you like Benchley and don't otherwise have access to this book, buying this edition may be worth it. If Kessinger had done a better job of reprinting it, the book would have my unreserved recommendation."},{"Title":"Of all things,","review":"Length:: 2:41 MinsWhat did comedy look like before Comedy Central?It was kinder, gentler, and--yes--it was funny.

The particular bit about roast beef nearly had me in tears.If I had to complain, it would be about the Kindle edition only. It is minor, but quotes are often pulled from the text and should be bold, italicized, indented, anything, but they are left to look like regular text.

The book takes you on a journey out to sea where Morowizt ponders some of life's deeper questions.

This book uses humor to reveal God's hand at work in the complications we confront in everyday life.

The more I get into it the more interesting it becomes. I have seen and read many books on the history of Indianapolis racing cars. While I first thought from the title and descriptions that it was about the 60's, on cracking it open it became apparant that it reviews many decades of innovation at Indy. What is also unique is that, although other books have covered these Indy eras, this one bring new pictures, annecdotes and some spin that brings new perspective to a subject that has been covered before in other titles. What is also apparant is that there probably exists even more material for even more indepth review of any of the eras presented; in particular not only the famous vehicle and engine designs that were successful, but also the more novel ones founded on apparantly sound principles(at least to their designers and supporters) that were never able to realise their supposed potential.What it really brings to life however is a different time when &quot;the cars were the stars&quot;, when innovation and trying different solutions was part of the competition. It was a much different time than the current era of limited technology in chassis and secret leased engine designs.Lets hope that perhaps Indy might exercise some vision as it moves into its next engine formula to rekindle automotive creativity in racing that can be shared and appreciated by racing enthusiasts. How about Hybrid methanol/electric powered racing cars?"},{"Title":"INDY's Wildest Decade","review":"Excellent coverage of the waning yet most prolific years of creativity at the 500.

Overall, it did. However, Gabbard needed a better editor/proofreader. There are numerous instances of misinformation in the captions on photos that are corrected in the text and vice versa. The photos, as a whole are quite good but have some obvious gaps. For instance, in 1969 he detail's Mario Andretti's ground-breaking 4-wheel drive Lotus 64, yet neglects to show any photos. Then there are out right errors such as when describing Peter Revson's first McLaren finish in 1970 as coming in 2nd, when in fact it was 22nd. For those looking for a broad overview of Indy's most progressive decade, this is an adequate review.

Given the title, though, its surprising that at least a third of the book deals with Indy's early days. Interesting historical context, but not totally on point.There are a number of minor inaccuracies distributed throughout the book, particularly regarding misspelled names. Also, much of the core 1960's narrative draws heavily on Leo Levine's Ford -- The Dust and The Glory. At times it reads almost like a book report. More seriously, there is at least one instance that borders on plagiarism: in describing Jim Clark's initial impressions of the Indianapolis track, the author says that Clark found it a bit dull. From Clark's autobiography \\"Jim Clark at the Wheel\\" Clark states (referring to the same) that \\"overall I found it a bit dull.\\""},{"Title":"Shakespeare's World","review":"Johanyak's book offers a useful approach to Shakespeare by examining the world that influenced the culture in which his works emerged. As stated in the preface, _Shakespeare's World_ enlightens readers with information that illuminates the landscape of Shakespeare's creative genius. Chapters on the northern Renaissance, the Reformation, and European colonialism, for example, help us to understand &quot;his&quot; world--a world untouched by 21st century perspectives. The book also offers helpful tools, such as a list of referenced geographical regions in Shakespeare's works, simple plot summaries of the plays and narrative poems, and an especially helpful chronology of key period events that set the stage for Shakespeare's literary accomplishments.This is a handy companion for literature students and general readers who may be curious about the early modern period and its influences on Elizabethan England's greatest playwright. The book utilizes a simple, approachable writing style accented by period artwork that should satisfy the hungry mind."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's World","review":"I would use this as a text for my students because of Johanyak's sweeping choice of texts from Shakespeare's time that give a fresh voice and explanation of the sixteenth/early seventeenth century.My one quite serious quibble, however, is with the book's poor syntax (or perhaps poor editing). Explanations are often badly written, with some sentences either making little sense, grammatically incorrect, or in some cases just plain wrong. \\"Shakespeare's King Lear is set in an early period of English history and myth, evoking similar myths.\\" Huh? \\"Hung\\" for \\"hanged\\",\\"utilized\\" rather than \\"use\\". Her over-reliance on \\"impacted\\" for \\"affected\\" just got irritating. I have to wonder if the scope of her project (she mentions in an interview that the book was initially much larger), when reduced to its present size, left her little time for revising the explanatory paragraphs whose brevity is to be applauded, but whose poor editing is headache inducing.It's also worth noting that her choices of early modern art are poorly realized by Pearson's evident parsimony on the production side. This is a shame, as she's chosen some genuinely gorgeous stuff. Moving, informative, beautiful - but frequently hardly discernable in their small, smudgy black and white reproductions.It's a book that deserves re-visiting and re-editing."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's World","review":"I suppose referring to Shakespeare unironically as &quot;the Bard&quot; is a matter of taste: some people call Dickinson &quot;Emily&quot; and Whitman &quot;Walt.&quot; Other choices in this low-level introduction are more irritating: Shakespeare's grandfather &quot;was a tenant farmer who owned 60 acres . . .&quot; (p. 17). The plot summaries are fatuous: in _Two Noble Kinsmen_ &quot;Theseus tells Emilia to choose one; the other will die. She cannot choose so a date is fixed the following month&quot; (p. 51); at the end of _Measure for Measure_ &quot;The duke marries Isabella&quot; (p. 44). Johanyak's bland assertion is both untrue to the script (no wedding) and concealing of a crucial point of 20th &amp; 21st century direction: how does Isabella respond to the Duke's assumption that she'll marry him?--Well, W.H.

A job well done by Mr. Prothero."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"I found DEFENDING GARY to be a well-written legal analysis of the defense of the Green River killer, Gary Leon Ridgway. Mark Prothero, a public defense attorney with ACA in Seattle, is assigned the case of Gary Ridgway once he is arrested in 2001. The lawyer initially cannot believe the police have the right man, but soon finds he is very mistaken, as appearances are very deceiving. The book takes the reader through the planning of the defense. Prothero explains that the inescapable evidence of the paint flecks leads to a plea deal, in which Ridgway pleads guilty to the murders in exchange for life in prison. Mark Prothero, who teaches courses in the mental health of criminals (according to his website), provides a detailed and meticulous analysis of Ridgway's growing-up years in this book, and devotes a lot of time to understanding the factors that may have led to his developing such twisted sexual obsessions. Prothero IN NO WAY excuses Ridgway's behavior, however. But he does provide some interesting insights. For instance, the poverty of the Ridgway family may have played a significant role in the development of his character. Prothero explains that Ridgway's mother, Mary Rita, did not even take the children to the doctor when they had an ear infection, preferring to use home remedies such as blowing cigar smoke in the affected ear!I found it interesting that Prothero explained his own reactions to this case frequently; for instance, his son was graduating from high school at the same time he had to go on \\"field trips\\" with Ridgway and the detectives, looking for remains of someone's child who hadn't even made it to high school. He is sensitive to others' pain and that was evident throughout the book.For anyone interested in criminal defense or law, social work, sociology, or psychology, this would be a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"While I haven't read this book yet, I am looking forward to reading yet another viewpoint on Ridgeway.

You definitely get the impression GR will be taking a lot of secrets to the grave.One storyline I really enjoyed since it was decidedly new information to me was the author pointing out Sheriff Reichert's role in this investigation...I won't give it away here, but it definitely changed my impression of him! The only thing I was missing in this story was despite all the focus on getting GR to admit to later killings in the 1990's, there was no mention of any open cases the police might have suspected him for. I also thought one missed opportunity for the author would have been to point out that the \\"bunker\\" they were holding GR in was almost literally across the street from the Kenworth Seattle plant where he worked during his killing spree."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"This is the perfect book for a Green River follower.

Fantastic book with great insight to the case."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"I have enjoyed true crime books for many years, and this is the best I've read. Seeing what went on behind the scenes, the considerations of the defense attorneys, dealing with a serial killer on a daily basis, attempts to look inside Ridgeway, the toll it took on those involved in the investigation and defense, all make for fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"I thought this book was fabulous...I couldn't put it down and finished it in about 10 hours...I felt like I was in the room with Gary. Further, I thought Mr. Prothero's information relating to the defense costs and death penalty may give perspective to people who have contempt prior to investigation in regard to defense attorneys and cases such as the Ridgeway case.You must read it!"},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"Having met the author in 2002, as my daughter's high school swim team coach, it peaked my interest in reading this book of a notorious serial killer from our \\"own back yard\\" so to speak. It's a very interesting and insightful read from the defense teams' point of view. The interrogation interviews were long and drawn out, but how do you unravel the mind of the Green River Killer?"},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"Well written book. Authors had a good understanding of Gary Ridgway and yet did not lose caring about those whose lives were ended or forever changed by his behavior. By reading this book, it became clear to me that Gary Ridgway was a person who had no ability to perceive his victims as real people. Those who cared for the victims are desperate for bits of information about what happened to them. Gary doesn't know--he killed them and dumped their bodies and that's all he knows. This book gives a good understanding of the grueling months of trying to gather information and find bodies and the toll it took on all involved. I would have preferred a little less of the verbatim interviews with Gary--the book was overly long. I also didn't see the relevance of all the information about the Prothero family and their swimming skill. All in all, however, this book is recommended to those who are still trying to understand these murders which were so horrific for so many."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"This book is a perfect example of the exploitation of someone \\"at risk\\" by an attorney (IMHO). If there is one law passed in this country it should be that no one representing a client may them write a book about them. Prothero states that he has permission from Gary Ridgeway. Really? Ridgeway is in jail and Prothero was one of his attorneys; this is commonly known as an exploitative situation whereby (as Prothero recounts) Prothero kept personal notes from the beginning of the case and those notes are wrong on every level to share with the public whether recounted verbatim or via a filter.Ridgeway, and every single person ever represented by an attorney, should have the right to know that all they say, all they do, is confidential and will always be confidential, especially in a day and age of exploited clients for personal fame and fortune. Prothero (if memory serves while writing this) says he started out intending to \\"do good\\" or something like that as an environmental attorney, but found he couldn't earn a living. Well, all one can say is heaven help us if this is the best ya can get as a criminal. It's a funny thing about a lot of attorneys, so often they come across as having watched too many tv shows on attorneys where there's mostly fornicating, drinking, and instant drama, and that about says it all doesn't it? The \\"profession\\" of law seems to have been invaded by a bunch of people looking to become the next \\"snookie\\"., whatever!As one of Ridgeway's attorneys, Prothero has no right (in the moral sense, and probably in the legal sense if it were truly examined) to write of his experience with Ridgeway. Prothero implies that he is so budddy buddy with Ridgeway but if one looks at the exchanges what one sees is someone too smart for the attorneys. In every way, and at all times, Ridgeway was way ahead of Prothero, no doubt about that.Prothero comes across (IMHO, of course!) as only interested in creating a name for himself via this horrific sequence of women's deaths. I actually heard Prothero speak and found him self-indulgent, arrogant in the worst way, and self-aggrandizing. It's odd that in the book Tony Savage is the primary attorney on the case, but is barely mentioned by Prothero. Odd, hmmm..... Also, the only woman on Ridgeway's team, who actually seems to be thinking and defending Ridgeway's legal rights, is treated in the book (again, IMHO!) as getting in the way of Prothero's \\"handling\\" of Ridgeway. My conclusion regarding this book is that Prothero was posturing more than representing, attempting to find himself a claim to fame, more than find a way through the case. As a previous reviewer noted here, Prothero sure does seem to love pics of himself, i mean really, a picture of yourself in swim trunks in a book about the murders of an endless sequence of women? For shame on the publisher for even publishing those pics, or this book. One can imagine Prothero's office has at least this cover hanging on the wall, if not other memorabilia from the case, so that one and all who enter know that through happenstance Prothero was \\"on the case.\\"Overall, just a bad book, sloppy in its thinking, self-indulgent, and one which should never have been written. To be fair, Ann Rule's book on Ridgeway isn't much better, at all. Recitations of found bodies do not a book make. But ultimately, please save us from Prothero \\"writing\\" anything else, even with a co-author. After reading these two books, the person who should be the attorney is Ridgeway, for he comes across clearly as the smartest of the three. And that is the most frightening thing of all."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"This is an amazing book!!! I started reading it and could not put it down! After living in Seattle for all of these years and having the fear of the Green River Killer in my own \\"back yard\\" I had many un-answered questions. I finally had all of them answered after reading this book.This is also a \\"must read\\" for anyone studying psychology. Many people studied Gary but few really understood him."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"Any defense attorney who finds room to include more than one full-size photo of himself in swim trunks while consigning the photos of some of the Green River killer's victims to thumbnail-sized rows squeezed into two horrifying pages (noting that several other victims' photos have simply been left out) is perhaps not as much a victim of bad media and resentful families as he depicts himself here. The very premise of the book seems to be that it is Prothero and the Green River Killer himself -- and not the raped and murdered women -- who are to be pitied for being misunderstood. Morally repulsive and embarassingly self-indulgent."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"Prothero is one of those poor writers, I'm sure he a lot of help as well, who couldn't resist the urge to talk about himself and family all throughout the book. It's nothing against him, but when people get these kind of books they want to read about Ridgway not Prothero. If you are looking for a book on Ridgway, definitely get Ann Rule's Green River Running Red...it is much more informative, interesting, and all around a much better read.Prothero's book is nearly painstaking to read at times...he feels it with so much unnecessary banter...I'm sorry, Prothero, but that joke you told another lawyer once upon a time ago isn't that funny and I don't care about your wife's thoughts on the case. This book could've been a quarter of the length without all his irrelevant asides. He's also very childish when it comes to critiquing the psychologists' and profilers' methods when it came to analyzing Gary.... Excsse me, Prother, but you are a LAWYER. You went to law school while these other individuals dedicated their lives to studying these kinds of criminals...so, his commentary just comes off as immature, slightly arrogant, and inexperienced.You get more Gary quotes from cross examinations than in Rule's book, but very little info on his murders and victims. I do applaud his insight on the importance as to why men like Gary shouldn't receive the death penalty...It's not about a childish vendetta, it's simply we can get information from him to better prepare for others like him.The lawyer who defended John Wayne Gacy wrote a much, much better book on his defendant.So, really, if you're interested in this man, his crimes, his life, and victims; Rule does an infinitely better job and I highly recommend her book over Defending Gary any day."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"First person defense account is compeling, believable, and insightful. The interaction between the defense team, the opposing lawyers, and the uncertainty of the process of the defense is compeling - with possible twists and turns introduced that could have changed the outcome completely.

Loved it!"},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"Defending Gary is written by one of Gary Leon Ridgeway's attorneys. It provides probably some of the most earliest and abnormal behaviors exhibited by very young Gary Leon Ridgeway besides Ann Rule's book, a true masterpiece,\\"Green River,Running Red\\". \\"Defending Gary\\" gives the reader a clear, comprehensive and chilling look as to why Gary Ridegeway stalked and murdered at least forty-eight prostitutes along the \\"Sea-Tac Strip\\", an area around the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washigton State. The killings seemed most likely to have started in mid 1982, although detectives cannot be positive. The bulk of the killings were from 1982-84. The murders seemed to have stopped in 1984, but in reality they had not. It took twenty years for detectives to catch one of the most deadliest and notorious serial murderers in U.S history. He did literally \\"hide in plain sight\\" as he was very average looking. Finally on November 30, 2001 Gary Leon Ridgeway was apprehended and sentenced to life in prison. The author tells of his troubles in defending this killing machine of a man. Ridgeway himself said \\"I tried to kill as many prostitues as I could\\". He blamed them for spreading the AIDS virus and actually thought he was doing society a favor of ridding the streets of women he considered \\"evil\\". A must read for anyone who wants to know about the thought processes that Gary Ridgeway had and \\"his reasons\\" why he preyed upon and killed very \\"down on their luck\\" and desperate women for whom prostitution was many of the victims' means of survival and to support their children, for the ones that had children to support. A definitive look at in my opinion, the most dangerous and scariest case in America on serial killings."},{"Title":"Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer","review":"This is truly a great read and provides a useful insight to the case. Not only in terms of Gary's psychology, but the methods that those close to it must use to stabilize themselves. It is at times funny, dark, but mostly very sobering.

She is an excellent and knowledgeable teacher. Since graduation I have worked as a CVICU & CV Recovery nurse at a cardiovascular specialty hospital.I found this book difficult to navigate while taking the critical course and I have not found it helpful since graduating. In my opinion it is not organized clearly enough to be helpful as a quick reference (like say Kathy White material). The explanation of how to do tasks is broken down into too much common-sense minutia (like \\"gather materials\\"). On the flipside it is not detailed enough to qualify for a textbook, so the book falls into some unfortunate I-don't-know-what-to-do-with-you middle ground. I suppose that accounts for the low resale costs. I think most students sell this one after school.What the book does well that I have not seen others do is to group critical care topics according to nursing diagnoses; therefore, it will serve the nursing student very well, and may help you to think more like they teach nurses are supposed to think and less like a doctor."},{"Title":"Mosby's Critical Care Nursing Reference, 2e","review":"Still gets the job done and helpful with making some aspects of nursing easy to understand but I was surprised that there wasn't anything about cholelithiasis!

In regard to regimes, on the other hand, he accepts at first international regimes as social institutions since they are products of human activity. This formulation eventually facilitates the possibility of regime change as independent from power and distribution of capabilities. In his criticism of the realist concepts of institutions, Young follows the argument; hegemon's role in international regimes is an exception not a rule or a general pattern. In this respect, he mentions three types of regime formation unlike to hegemonic stability theory, which accounts only hegemon or coercive power in this process. Regimes can be spontaneous, negotiated or imposed institutions while these three categories of institutions are not mutually exclusive. First two types of regime formation do not necessitate any hegemon. Coercive power or hegemon may be significant for just imposed regimes. Young also argues that hegemon may be important only for the transformation of imposed regimes not for spontaneous or negotiated regimes.In this formulation of international regimes, as mentioned before, power is not sufficient condition for regime change. Both exogenous (international system, distribution of capabilities, power, prevailing technology etc.) and endogenous (domestic politics, inner dynamics or internal contradictions of regimes etc.) factors can lead to regime transformation. It is also distinctive in Young's examination of regimes in contrast to the realist formulation of regimes that he evaluates these institutions are crucial at both domestic and international level. They are not epiphenomena (of power) since they are important as independent variables for international cooperation. In addition to these theoretical arguments International Cooperation has also three case studies. They are in the issue areas of marine fisheries and deep seabed mining, nuclear accidents, and arctic shipping. In all three case studies Young emphasizes the importance of regimes as social institutions for preservation and governance of natural resources and environment. He also considers that regional regime arrangements would be more effective and less costly than international regimes. Overall, Oran Young's work can be considered as a classical work on international regimes. Henceforth, it can be deemed as a must reading in this field."},{"Title":"International Cooperation: Building Regimes for Natural Resources and the Environment (Cornell Studies in Political Economy)","review":"I hereby acknowledge receipt of the book \\"International Cooperation: Building Regimes of Natural Resources and Environment.\\" The book you sent me arrived on time and in perfect condition.Kindest regards,Rodrigo Miranda [Chile]"},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"If you ever have reached that point where you think that there really isn't anything innovative left in today's anime and manga then you must not have read Saikano (Saishuu-heiki Kanojo). This is one story that manages to juggle various genre, and successfully reach the hearts of both guys and girls alike. It's a modern day love story, it has mecca-driven sci-fi style, it's a story of war and of friendship, of loss and of pain... It's a little bit of everything for everybody. It's a story destined not to let you down.I say all this with a small warning for parents. The story begins where the two main characters are innocents, so nothing happens, but the thought of sex is ever present. There is not much physically... in the beginning... But be warned that by the seventh volume our protagonist's story will definitely be NC17 worthy."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"I usually hate any love stories. I just meet them with cold unethusiasm because no one seems to get it right enough. Well, this story doesn't just get it right, it gets to the point that anyone-even the cynic- can see love as the most beautiful and painful thing there is.The thing I noticed about the story is that the situation with Chise is treated in a very unusual way- probably the best of any high-schooler-in-a-war-zone story I've ever seen. The military talk is technical, official, and it completely goes over Chise's head- which is why it's perfect, because realistically they wouldn't break formalities to accomadate one confused schoolgirl, even if she is the megaweapon. So it sounds authentic, but not tedious at all. It sets up the book as more believable and Chise as more likable.The story's in Shuji's point of view most of the time, but it goes to Chise once in a while. So you hear everything first hand from one of the lovers. And you see how much his love for Chise consumes and scares him, but not in a sappy way-in a very heavy, desperate, and determined way. It literally puts love in perspective. There's a lot of words, but they're emotional words, and you'll find yourself going slower than you usually would with a manga so Shuji's deep inner thoughts on love reaches you better. You'll read them over and over and then sit quietly in reflection. This manga is something that has a lot of reread value, because of course everyone's feelings on love changes as time goes on.The art is... what I'd call evanescently innocent. Most of the pictures look a little ghostly. But the characters are cute abnd childish for the seriousness of the story, and sketchy. Though highly stylized, it fits the plot perfectly. Saikano's trademark feature, though, would be the nonstop blushing.The relationships between all the characters-major and minor- are simply amazing.I f you've ever been in love, it'll break your heart- and if you haven't, you'd wish you'd had been just so you could understand."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"Some people say they'd do anything for the person they love. You'll see lots of that (and MORE, MUCH MORE) in Saishuu Heiki Kanojo, the story of Chise and Shuji, two highschool sweethearts that have an unusual relationship because of the communication problems they have, not mentioning that Chise is a weapon...The plot of the story isd just fantastic and what's most important it makes you THINK. You won't just eat the argument up whan you read the comic book.I'd qualify it for 16+ ages due to the explicital sexual content in some of the books and the extreme violence."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"I really wanted to like this manga. The story is compelling, the reader can identify with the characters, and the ending is EXTREMELY disturbing and thought-provoking. There are, however, two big problems with the series as a whole.One, while the draftsmanship is competent enough to get the point across, the sketchy, tossed-off character art looks unskilled to my eye. The lines are all of the same width, and while computer compositing is used extensively to try to give a sense of depth, the lack of contrast makes the whole affair look somewhat monotonous. It is serviceable art, but no more.But the real failure of Saikano is the writing. Words in a graphic narrative should be as few as possible and carefully chosen. Takahashi's characters talk too much, drowning any emotional resonance in endless dialogue--their internal monologues are especially bad. The dialogue itself isn't terrible, there's just far, far, too much of it. the pages are jammed with it, giving the manga a very cluttered, claustrophobic feel that makes for an unpleasant reading experience. In my first review, I laid a hefty portion of blame on the translation team, but upon re-reading the series I realize that I was being unfair (sincerest apologies, Mr. Caselman). The translation is actually quite decent, with only a few obvious missteps. The blame lies with the source material. _Saikano_ has a serious telling-instead-of-showing problem.There are so many moments in this manga that could have been great, if only the characters had known when to shut up, if only the dialogue had been a little less maddeningly vague, if only the art had been up to the task, if only, if only, if only. Too many \\"if onlys\\". It's still worth reading for the story, but the missed opportunities made me sadder than the tragic human drama _Saikano_ attempts to describe."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"Saikano is, hands down, an amazing manga... it's beautiful in many aspects. The art, the sad love story, and even the dialogue... everything is written and drawn flawlessly. It's easy for anyone to understand, yet it really pulls at your emotions. I don't find it \\"depressing,\\" but it is a serious series. You'll probably, like me, be hooked by the first volume. It's all just such a GOOD read and so... sincere!Note... If you like more of a cheerful manga, then Saikano is not for you. Also, be warned that it contains death, war, sex, violence, language and etc."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"The story is very powerful and moving, I almost cried several times. The art I didn't notice very much, nothing special but not bad either.I'd rate it 13+. There is some sexuality (not much, just talking about it and one time where the girl has her shirt off) and violence."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"This story is awesome. Saikano is a heart wretching story about one couple's will to live and love in the mist of war even in the event of the end of the world. The female lead is a shy, clumsy girl who has been modified by the military into the ultimate weapon. Her boyfriend is just a regular guy trying to come to grips by what is happening to his girlfriend. The author/illustrator does a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life. The artwork is sketchy but this story is an absolute must read for any Manga fan. This Manga is for mature readers. It is 7 volumes."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"the inside is great,all the pages are intact,but the cover has damage.back and front.they look like puncture marks,and this wasnt in the info.for my help in further purchases i need more information about items.this was shocking to see,and wish i was informed before purchase."},{"Title":"Saikano, Vol. 1","review":"Being a manga collector I must admit that this is the worst series I happen to have bought. I was looking for something new to get and since it had an editor's choice logo on it I thought that it must be pretty good. Yeah...the self appointed praise should have been my first clue. This series is pointless and dumb. Somehow I'm supposed to 'feel' the struggle of this girl who is in love and is also some super weapon. The story itself is just simply lame. It's not believable in the least I couldn't get into the relationship aspect of the story at all. That part being the whole point of the series to begin with. Plus I don't want to see detailed sex scenes with kids. That's just gross. Couple that with a crappy story say hello to regretting to pay money for this.If you want a garbage 'love' series that most certainly isn't for kids, then this is all you. Otherwise pass on this total waste of time. If you want an actual good love series then pick up Fruits Basket instead."},{"Title":"The case of the angry mourner (Pocket books)","review":"The Case of the Angry Mourner is one of Earl Stanley Gardener's best works in his Perry Mason series. The premise of the book is very simple, the action is straightforward and suspenseful, and plot keeps you guessing until the very end. The book is a real piece of classic detective fiction because the reader is never lied to and is given all the evidence so that a cunning reader could potentially solve crime before Perry Mason. In fact, Gardener repeatedly gives clues to the ending, but uses his literary genius to present them in such a way that the reader jumps to a false conclusion. In The Case of the Angry Mourner, Perry Mason finds himself on vacation when his rest is suddenly disrupted by a murder. The millionaire Arthur Cushing, who was an infamous playboy, was murdered in his own home. A woman from a neighboring cottage, Belle Adrian, calls upon Mason to defend her daughter Carlotta, who she believes shot Cushing after he became too insistent during an intimate dinner. Carlotta believes that her mother killed him in a vindictive fury and police agree with her conclusion. Its is up to Perry Mason to sort of the clues and determine which woman, if either, killed Arthur Cushing. This book is a great murder mystery because of its presentation of the evidence. Unlike many Agatha Christie and Murder, She Wrote mysteries, the reader does not have to spot a single line of dialogue where the killer slips up and reveals himself or herself. Instead, The Case of the Angry Mourner depends heavily on circumstantial evidence. Gardner laying out a set of clues that can be interpreted in numerous ways and quickly deflates the &quot;experts&quot; who narrowly interpret the evidence against his client."},{"Title":"The case of the angry mourner (Pocket books)","review":"Background: The stylistic heritage of the Perry Mason mysteries is the American pulp magazines of the 1920s. In the early Mason mysteries, Perry - a good-looking, broad-shouldered, two-fisted, man of action - is constantly stiff-arming sultry beauties on his way to an explosive encounter that precipitates the book's climactic action sequence. In the opening chapters of these stories, Gardner subjects the reader to assertive passages that Mason is a crusader for justice, a man so action-oriented he is constitutionally incapable of sitting in his office and waiting for a case to come to him or to develop on its own once it has - he has to be out on the street, in the midst of the action, making things happen, always on the offensive, never standing pat or accepting being put on the defensive. These narrative passages - nave, embarrassingly crude \\"character\\" development - pop up throughout the early books, stopping the narrative dead in its tracks, and putting on full display a non-writer's worst characteristic: telling the reader a character's traits instead of showing them through action, dialogue, and use of other of the writer's tools.Rating \\"Ground Rules\\": These flaws, and others so staggeringly obvious that enumerating them is akin to using cannons to take out a flea, occur throughout the Gardner books, and can easily be used (with justification) to trash his work. But for this reader they are a \\"given\\", part of the literary terrain, and are not relevant to my assessment of the Gardner books. In other words, my assessments of the Perry Mason mysteries turn a blind eye to Erle Stanley Gardner's wooden, style-less writing, inept descriptive passages, unrealistic dialogue, and weak characterizations. As I've just noted, as examples of literary style all of Gardner's books, including the Perry Mason series, are all pretty bad. Nonetheless, the Mason stories are a lot of fun, offering intriguing puzzles, nifty legal gymnastics, courtroom pyrotechnics, and lots of action and close calls for Perry and crew. Basically, you have to turn off the literary sensibilities and enjoy the \\"guilty\\" pleasure of a fun read of bad writing. So, my 1-5 star ratings (A, B, C, D, and F) are relative to other books in the Gardner canon, not to other mysteries, and certainly not to literature or general fiction.\\"The Case of the Angry Mourner\\": A+\\"The Case of the Angry Mourner\\" is Gardner's masterpiece, one of the two or three best pure detective story he ever wrote. He is at his deftest in presenting the actual murderer's motive and opportunity in such a way that the reader is looking the other direction for the villain. Against the rural setting of this story, he plays by all the \\"rules\\" of detective fiction, never lying to the reader, and above all never hiding evidence that is crucial to the solution of the puzzle. He even one-ups us by repeatedly returning to important clues to the solution, but returning to them in such cunning ways that we constantly misinterpret them to arrive at the wrong conclusion.The story is straightforward enough. Perry is on vacation at a cottage in the woods when a woman from a neighboring cottage calls upon him to defend her daughter against the charge of murdering a playboy who had become a bit too insistent after an intimate dinner at his rural retreat on the other side of the lake. The scene of the crime is positively cluttered with clues suggesting how the wheelchair-bound bounder met his end. Gardner uses one of his favorite detective story devices: a forensic \\"expert\\" who reads the clues and weaves them into a net that snares Perry's client. In this case the expert has two stages on which to strut his stuff: the interior of the murder cottage, and the back-road where the snow around the automobile abandoned by Perry's client tells the expert who came and went on the fateful night. Gardner truly enjoys laying out a set of clues that can plausibly be interpreted in a number of different ways, and his own guilty pleasure is in gently making fun of these experts and deflating the pomposity and closed-mindedness with which they typically deliver their chiseled-stone-tablet conclusions.Fine stuff all around, with the only letdown being minor: the courtroom scenes are quite good in their own right, but they don't pack quite the punch of some of Perry's urban encounters."},{"Title":"The case of the angry mourner (Pocket books)","review":"The Case of the Angry MournerThe 'Foreword' tells how a car on a Massachusetts highway at night suddenly swerved off the road and landed in a river. Was the drowning a suicide? Dr. Richard Ford, the Chief Medical Examiner for the Boston area, did not declares it a suicide. Six months later this happened again! A thorough investigation revealed that an oncoming driver's headlights from a private driveway made it appear a collision was imminent. When a drive swerved right he went off the road and down the banks into the river. Dr. Ford created a library of colored slides to show the injuries from various weapons or poisons for educational purposes. Circumstantial evidence is infallible but only if it correctly interpreted. Often only the evidence that supports a conclusion is collected.It was late at night when Belle Adrian heard a scream from across the lake. She went to Arthur Cushing's cottage where her daughter Carlotta was visiting. She found Arthur dead in his wheel chair, a bloody hole on his chest! A woman's compact was on the floor; Belle removed it. Sam Burris heard glass breaking and a shot from the Cushing cabin. His wife watched with her telescope. Belle found Carlotta asleep in her bedroom, home hours ago (Chapter 3). Sam Burris tells about the land sale to Cushing (Chapter 4). The increase in value meant higher taxes on his land. Sam will be neighborly. After he tells Belle that he saw her at the house Belle decides to call Perry Mason. Perry calls Paul Drake for help. Sheriff Bert Elmore arrives to question Belle (Chapter 6). Belle only tells what she wants Perry to know. Sheriff Burt tells what the tracks in the front say; it contradicts Belle's statements. A revolver was found near Carlotta's car!Paul Drake and his men arrive at this resort town. Their first job is to note the license plate numbers of every car in town (Chapter 7). The mother and daughter are trying to protect each other. Are they both guilty? Chapter 8 recapitulates the story. Sheriff Bert has a search warrant and finds the hidden compact. Perry explains his strategy to identify Arthur Cushing's friend (Chapter10). Four license plate numbers were at Bear Valley and the funeral. One young woman was not a business associate or relative. Perry will not put his client on the stand, her first story will contradict the facts. But he will call Marion Keats (Chapter 11). Carlotta borrowed that pistol to practice shooting (Chapter 13). A doctor estimated the time of death (Chapter 14). Chapter 17 has the important testimony of the witnesses.A sliver of glass was piercing the tire and tube of Carlotta's car from where it was parked by the cabin (Chapter 18). There were no glass splinters on the tires of the wheel chair. The drama continues when Marion Keats makes an admission on the stand (Chapter 20)! Perry surmises what happened and names the murderer who had the motive, the means, and the opportunity to kill Arthur Cushing (Chapter 21). Perry's client will be released and they return to the big city.Like some earlier novels the story concludes without a showdown in court. Most of these novels are set in Los Angeles or the desert to the east. Erle Gardner must have spent one winter in the north for knowledge and decided to return to a warmer climate for the rest of these stories."},{"Title":"The case of the angry mourner (Pocket books)","review":"This is the Book version of \\"Perry Mason\\" Episode 7 that Guest Starred Barbara Eden who played the role of \\"Carla Adrian\\" in the Episode and it is a good Mystery Book and if you are a Barbara Eden Fan you would like this book for your collection since it is the Book version of the episode that Barbara Eden Guest Starred in in 1957."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is a piece of trash. I feel that nothing other than such a blunt remark justifies my feelings towards this mish-mash of bogey, high-faultin' pretention and early 70s self-help gibberish. Clearly, this tripe hooked on to the swinging trend of cascading times when mid-life crisis was hitting people from 16 to 76. It will take the reader about an hour to puff through the briefness on nothingness with such inspired pages like &quot;Johnathan Livingston Seagull flies!&quot; on a page with a picture of the bird soaring off high into the sky. Real deep. The basic, Scientology inspired motivation is keen wrapped around something passed off by its publisher as literature about you and me and us and them when, in reality, it is about Richard Bach's own trifling human insecurities and his pompous belief that if he feels it, we all do. Surely most authors have such pretentions, but most are able to wrap a story around it so we can ignore it all the way through."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book was not in the condition stated by the seller I know this book has been around for ages but don't say its like new when its not I lost my original copy so I really wanted another one just to have so my grandson who is 11 months can read it one day so I really love the book just not the condition I got it in"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"First published in 1973 and still people reads it.

I think that's really the only reason to read it, to know what all the fuss is about.

All you need to do to make this similar to something from the Bible is switch a few words around; I don't enjoy that sort of allegory. (Jonathan, also known as Son of the Great Gull?) And then, a lot of the meanings behind this story are dead cliches; &quot;do what you love and you will be happy.&quot; Give me a break here; if you want a little religious didactic story that's fun and expository and by Bach, read &quot;One.&quot; Skip this one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Of all the thousands of books (on all the many topics and themes) I've read in my life, this has to be the single biggest piece of drivel I have ever had to endure.Given to me as a present, I assumed it was some vanity press self-help crap.

So, when I happened upon it at a close-out sale, I bought it.I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.Maybe I am too old to appreciate the 'inspiration' that it is meant to provoke. I think I learned the lessons it teaches a long time ago - from my parents & in church. 'Life is to be lived, and since we are all in this together, we should try our best to make the world a better place'.Frankly, after reading, I wondered what the fuss is about. Yes, I caught what could be subtle inferences to spirituality, but I got a lot more out of other books I've read. But it's basically just a nice story about a bird. If inspiration & spiritual growth are your objectives, I recommend \\"The Greatest Salesman in the World\\". Another quick read, but much more substance than JLS."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a pseudo-Christian parable retelling the story of Jesus in the form of a seagull. The language is simple and unadorned, with very little worth calling \\"style\\". As a literary work, Jonathan Livingston is a very mediocre piece of writing, if olny because its characters are so artificial and lacking in depth. Jonathan Livingston cannot really move you because it is simply a prop for Richard Bach's idea of Perfection. It is an allegory and nothing more. Bad writers who have lots of ideas but have lived and observed little can only people their novels with allegories.Concerning the Jesus simile, let me add that the only difference between Bach's story and the canonical Gospels is that the underlying theology of Jonathan Livingston Seagull is basically Unitarian (from another point of view one could also describe it as Pelagian): Jonathan was not born a divine bird from a virgin and he is not fundamentally different from other seagulls. If in the end he attains divine \\"seagullhood\\", it is only through his own \\"superseagullan\\" efforts. In a way, Jonathan, as his very name indicates, is John the Baptist unredeemed by grace. Hence all the toil and sweat. Augustine of Hippo would have been appalled by this book...Put very simply, Richard Bach's philosophy is one that tells you to make strenuous and unrelenting efforts in order to become the strongest, the wisest and the most beautiful seagull (human being) ever. Salvation is elsewhere, in a realm of luminous and perfect seagulls. In a way, this book could be used to illustrate the absurd and arrogant Olympic motto of \\"altius, citius,fortius\\".Therefore, there is hardly anything new or original to be found in the worldview the book sets forth. And contrary to what some reviewers claim, it is not a revolutionary philosophy. Jonathan is only superficially a rebel. His rebellion is in fact taking place in a very old framework: that of heroic struggle. It is true that the heroic model has fallen into disrepute and we now live in the epicurean bourgeois mode, but to claim that Jonathan is an absolute rebel is false. As I hinted before, this book could have easily been written by a Christian ascetic, and, indeed, what the book teaches can be regarded as a form of extreme asceticism, with the refinement that it is aesthetically appealing. Violence is often aesthetically satisfying.No wonder everyone succumbs to the charm of the story: such thinking has been preached relentlessly from the pulpit and from other places of authority for the last 2000 years. I can't help thinking that the message of becoming The Ideal Human Being and of escaping the world through effort and holy war against oneself is essentially a Fascist idea. One could also say that it is the core of the Darwinist social manifesto. The idea that one should strive to become the best permeates our whole society, specially our economy, and is only superficially a message of hope and optimism. It is in reality a message of hateful tyranny, the tyranny of the Ideal over the Real. But we fail to see it because this message is not only familiar to us, it is also aesthetically tremendously attractive. Spiritually, we are all Platonists and flesh-haters at heart.As a philosophical tale, this book, which, as I said, is not very well written, cannot be compared, even remotely, with such unsurpassed masterworks as \\"The Little Prince\\" by French author Saint-Exupery or \\"Zorba the Greek\\" by Cretan writer Nikos Kazantzakis. The Little Prince is pessimistic and suffused with sadness and nostalgia (a typical French mix), but is full of original ideas and insights of great depth, besides being a radical critique of modern society. It is a book one can read and re-read and still find full of enigmas and hidden messages.\\"Zorba the Greek\\" is a hymn to life lived in simplicity and in straightforwardly rejoicing in the senses, the very opposite of the austere message of Jonathan Livingston. And it has style and beauty. It is a book about loving Incarnation, whereas Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a book about pseudo-spiritual escapism based on violence against oneself.For those who want philosophy written not in the form of myth but plainly, Jiddu Krishnamurti's books may also work as a potent antidote to Richard Bach's destructive idealism and the illusory hopes it generates. They may also teach you the right kind of effort. Jonathan Livingston represents in my view the wrong kind of effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I remember when Jonathan came out. I think Paul Twitchell had just died, or was just about to. I found it a tribute to his life. Being at multiple places at the same time. Using Paul's 'Soul Travel' to rise above time and space. Leaving the body, learning one's own lessons on one's own path. The lower planes where so many dwell and exist is death to those who starve for more.

In fact a seagull is the centre piece of my company logo. Sometimes I think books come our way at a partiucllay meaningful time to ourselves which is perhaps why this book seems to attract such varied reviews I loved it and also enjoy the spin off movies and sound track.

Jonathan and his family of seagulls teach the reader follow their dreams, escape the ordinary, and transcend the limits of the ego.

After reading the book, I view us in society as the flock, and many of us are curios to learn about something different that may not be socially accepted or is beyond our understanding. The problem is we do not have guidence as the gulls do in the book from Jonathan. That being how I compared it to life, I still belive it is a valuble book to read because it can motivate us to strive to learn what we have a passion for and to share our knowlede. After reading about what a great gull Jon was we woiuld like to picture oursleves more like him, and it can influence the way we view life. This can only be a good thing!

Reading more than 100 pages about birds was not the book that I wanted to read at that moment.But a few weeks ago my friend mentioned it and I thought it was time to start reading it and see what was all about.I have to admit that it was a great experience and the moment I started to read I simply could not put the book aside. I felt great when I finished it and it made me think that life can also be nice and full of optimistic things. 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' is one of them.This is a very nice fable about life, ambition and pushing one's own limits. The more you read it, the more you start asking questions about yourself and your life.Jonathan Livingston is a seagull that chooses a different path than the rest of the birds in his flock. He spends his days looking for perfection - he prefers to learn to fly rather than eat, unlike the other birds. He is single-minded focus on and flying is not the way to make him popular with other birds. Such an attitude made Jonathan an outcast, rejected by his community and he finds himself alone but doesn't want to give up his dreams and ideas.I think the one big thing this story teaches us is that we should all admit our limitations, but the secret consists in trying to get over them, to challenge ourselves and evolve.Only great challenges will make us reach &quot;heaven&quot;, which is just a matter of being perfect. If there is no challenge, then there are no failures and we cannot evolve. Only excellence,intelligence, and skill can set free a spirit that is lookingfor important challenges in life.Richard Bach, who is an accomplished pilot and who has written a great deal about flight, uses the theme of flying in this book as a way of making us think. We have to think of ourselves as creatures of total freedom, free from all rulesin our minds, the place where actually everything happens. We can fly at the speed of our minds, not limited by anything .I think the book is also a story about modern society, where people who are different, the ones who want to make a change, are seen as crazy and are often rejected by the society that tends to be more and more ordinary, with limited views, and no dreams or desires.It is a good story from which we can learn a lot of things: never be afraid of reaching perfection, never stop dreaming. It is a short and very easy to read story, written in a very nice language, full of deep meanings. I think it should guide us all in life.

He transcends the paradigm imposed on him by the other seagulls and is banished from living with them.

He meets a great teacher who shows him how to transcend even the laws of space and time, and Jonathon Livingston Seagull ends up taking his place as a teacher. He eventually returns to a land of seagulls like the ones who banished him. He shows them his abilities and teaches the ones that will listen to him. It is a very short book, but it leaves you with a lot to think about. It is a very effective metaphor of growth and personal enlightenment that reaches a wide audience.

If you would like to attain the level Jonathan Livingston Seagull achieved, then I would recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet. This book will indeed challenged accepted beliefs; and provide new and enlarged concepts in the areas of religion, psychology and philosophy - ideas to replace the limited beliefs which are now accepted by and binding the majority of people today.If you have the courage to leave the old behind and attain a new level of thought get this book.

The quiet, overlay photographs were a pleasant addition that I appreciated--I've had too much of garish cartoonish illustrations in my children's books. The book continues to well serve its original purpose. However, now each time I read it, or read it to friends (adults), it grows in meaning. Bach's message that we are more than we ourselves often recognize (physically, intellectually, spiritually, and metaphysically) is far from subtle, once noticed; it is evident in every scenario his seagull hero suffers through.

And it's the type of meaning that will vary according the individual personality of the reader and his or her goals and dreams.For me, this book showed me the relentless, self-improving, goal-driven perfectionist in myself. Whereas Jonathan was separated from his Flock in his pursuit of Flight, I found that my interpersonal and spiritual life decreased in proportion to my 100-percent attitude of all the way on, or all the way off and nothing in between. That in-between is balance, something people like me lack when they want to be the best in the world at something.But, as Clint Eastwood said in the movie \\"Magnum Force\\" -- \\"A man has got to know his limitations.\\" And we all have them.This book captures it all: Eastern thought, Buddhism, even Christ (if you choose to interpret it that way) -- it captures the Way: The way one lives and the way one ought to live. It shows what is really important in life.Follow Jonathan Gull in his journey as an independent free-thinker who doesn't want to be like everyone else in The Flock. Follow his evolution from finding Flight, to being Outcast, to finding teachers and then, to complete the circle, his becoming a teacher himself.It's a tiny book, befitting a fable. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two to read it. But it's a book you'll want to read time and again, and one you'll remember the rest of your life. What an outstanding achievement by Richard Bach."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I read this book for the first time forty years ago. The book still holds up the the change in time.I found it well whorth the time to read the first time. and I got more out of the book the second time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago when I was a teenager. Along with several other influences at the time, it changed my life in the respect that it confirmed the spiritual path that I had chosen for myself. Religion does not have to enter into this at all. There is a difference between Religion and Spirituality. This book contains a philisophical viewpoint that is truly inspiring and applicable to all age groups. It is as relevant today (if not more so!) than it was 30 years ago. If you read this book with an open mind, receptive to philisophical concepts, you will discover a meaningful message for everyone. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN TO READ! I have just purchased a copy for my 8 year old daughter. I consider it to be a &quot;Must Read&quot; for her!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"All through my childhood, teenage and early adult life have I heard reference to this story. At the age of 22 I read it. I read this book after reading a large numeber of new age and transcendal lit., such as the celestine prophecy, Dr. Dyer's books, Castaneda, etc. And I cried and I was filled with joy. I was elated to have read such an allegory, when the time was right for me to read it. I believe that we, as friends, parents or siblings, should not &quot;force&quot; this reading onto anyone, but maybe just mention it, and allow for every person to choose the right time to read it, be they a child, adolescent or an adult. I live in a city on the Adriatic coast, and there are many seagulls, I often watch an meditate on their flight, and wonder if Jonathan is watching over me. Bach inspires a Jonathan in me!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This was an amazing story about breaking barriers and living life to it's complete fullest.I really enjoyed this book a lot. It made me think of things in a way that I usually don't. It was very uplifting and inspirational. I liked how even though the main character was a seagull he still tried to fly like a falcon. Even after everyone put him down and told him that he couldn't. So that right there was why i liked this book so much. It was also written very well. The author used many great words, sayings, and transitions. In conclusion I would deffinitley reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys to read stories about inspiration and having no limits."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Misunderstood because of his radical flights of fancy - and fancy flights! A Seagull, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, discontent with squawking and pecking for food, finds himself outcast from the brotherhood. Believing that there is more to life than \\"flying to eat,\\" he spends his time in isolation, determined to find what that is.This book is not about seagulls - it is about life. It is about conformity, for conformity's sake. It is about breaking out of that mold that we are forced into. It is about the Spirit that is within us all, if we dare to chance a peek.We can live our entire lives - squeezing ourselves into someone else's idea of what it means to be successful, rich, powerful, happy. Or we can find what these mean for ourselves, if we spread our wings and fly!Jonathan teaches us to *be*; to practice perfection in whatever form it may manifest. Jonathan also shows us that this may not be easy, however,"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I read this little book in my late teens, and i never saw seagulls the same way again. I would always look to see whether a Jonathan Livingston was among them :)Years later i read a series of books, The Wave by Laura Knight Jadczyk, which reminded me of this one: perhaps all there is in life - and after this life - is lessons. And for some - people or seagulls - just eating and sleeping is not enough; they will always strive to learn the truth about themselves and the truth about life and its meaning, and about love.In the words of Bach: \\"...his own way of demonstrating love was to give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a chance to see truth for himself.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I liked this book. 'Twas warm, and fuzzy, too. Fact is, I liked it the FIRST time I read it-- when it was called &quot;Anthem&quot;.

From Jonathan's beginnings of becoming an Outcast of gull society for the love of flying to his return to the Flock, the reader is swept away by the charming parable and empathizes with Jonathan's plight. You will gush over this book (as I probably am in this review).Who should read this? A better question is &quot;who shouldn't?&quot; It's short enough to read to your children at night (it may take two or three nights), or for an adult to read in an afternoon. The powerful message to &quot;be the best you can be and live true to your dreams&quot; carries across generations and cultures and is always worth hearing.Overall, this is an extremely uplifting, clever, and wonderful book. Just be warned: do not buy just one copy! This book is guaranteed to be one that you will want to share with your friends, family, and coworkers. I'd hate to see you to be without it while your book was on loan. You never know when you might want to &quot;gush over a gull&quot; yourself..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"\\"Johnathan Livingston Seagull\\" gave me something which hardly any other book has given: a sense of flight.This story has an abundant sense of exhilaration which is literally absent from most of contemporary literature.While dealing with the theme of the genius against society, &quot;JLS&quot; is fundamentally a metaphor of how man can reach God. It is a little surprising that no reviewer has mentioned the religious significance of this story.The message it carries actually could be elaborated into a grand philosophic vision which can change the very essence of religion and man's conception of God and Heaven. (Johnathan Seagull has been called \\"the son of the great gull\\").\\"JLS\\" goes to the root of the psychology &amp; character of the lonely genius, the path-breaker and presents it in terms of the essentials : his loneliness; his devotion to the truth; his constant pursuit of higher &amp; higher levels of achievement &amp; self-realization; his complete disregard for security &amp; comfort; his thirst of appreciation; his fearlessness with respect to challenging the unknown &amp; not-attempted; his uncompromising integrity. All this is given to you in a capsule in the form of a symbolic tale.It depicts the relationship of the rebel, the non-conformist, the innovator with society and shows that it is the man of independence, genius and vision - he who disagrees and disobeys (and often appears rude &amp; ruthless) who has a tremendous sense of benevolence and goodwill towards humanity - that it is precisely such a man who desperately yearns to share the higher truths of life discovered by him, and his newfound vision, with mankind - and it is precisely such men who are ostracized and condemned; that it is those who break the rules who have benefited mankind much more than those who cling to tradition.&quot;JLS&quot; conveys a lot more: the view that unwavering devotion to one's values, confidence and self-esteem can help one overcome any barrier-that no obstacle is insurmountable - that the Highest can be achieved and the tremendous sense of joy at having achieved one's goals and the best within oneself.This book shall lift your spirits and encourage you to take a new, enraptured view of life, of this world, of God, of MAN.Definitely, one of the best stories of recent times."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is one of those books where it probably was better to have read it when it came out, in the era of the 1970s, in the United States. It\`s better as a story one would read to their child because it does have some interesting points to be made albeit cliches we already know. But I also concur with some of the other critics that it is a bit overly done with the \\"do whatever you fell like\\" mentality, which I find to be destructive in the long term for a society. Just look at the current state of affairs in the States now (as of the writing of this review 2012) as we see what was once a great country is now faltering in so many ways, which is a direct result of the \\"do what you feel\\" philosophy.

It's about a seagull who shuns the social conventions of his flock to pursue his love of flying.The book is divided into three parts, beginning with a predictable follow-your-dreams story and then moving into an Eastern-style cycle of self-perfection and reincarnation, and then there's some business about love and forgiveness tossed in at the end.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a short book, but even within these confines Bach does little to give the book much ambition or depth. The seagull flies this maneuver, the seagull flies that maneuver, the seagull spouts some platitude about transcending reality. There's no sense of setting, no real insight - just flying birds and superficial philosophy. Bach's writing is otherwise unimpressive. There's at least one continuity issue, and it does feel rather absurd that these birds have such amazingly accurate internal speedometers (Bach rather belabors that point).Munson's photographs of seagulls and beachscapes help to set the mood, but the low quality in which they are reproduced in every version of the book I've ever seen just doesn't do them justice. Nevertheless, they do imbue the book with a certain charm that it badly needs.Jonathan Livingston Seagull basically comes down to banal fable and trite spirituality. There are a innumerable better \\"follow your dreams\\" stories out there, most of which don't get into this unlocking-the-unlimited-freedom-inside-you nonsense."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book had a personally inscribed inside cover.

It was extremely inspirational and somewhat destructive. It follows the silly North American idea of being &quot;the best&quot; at the cost of everything else in one's life. Striving to be the best at something is counter-productive and will leave you empty and frustrated. There is more to life than being the best flyer in the group or whatever.

First, it manages to be truely universal. Unlike so many inspirational works, the situation in which Johnathan finds himself could easily become a metaphor for anything worth the aspirations of an individual. Second, it manages to be a reat story. This makes it an easy and enjoyable read, rather than just a series of appeals to perseverance. This keeps the book from becomming preachy or condescending, which is so often the problem with works of this type. Also, the nature of Bach's message is stresses not only the rewards of perseverance, but also the difficulties that are inherent in it, which is important in fulling exploring the intricacies of his point. On top of all of this, Bach has a special gift for prose and storytelling that allows the reader to forget that he/she is reading a work of fiction and instead believe that this seagull really does exist, thus making his plight all the more enlightening. For teachers seeking to motivate students, coaches trying to motivate athletes, or parents trying to motivate children, this is a perfect place to start."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"You all know it this book. You may even have fond memories of your mom reading it to you: I do. But this slimy collection of self-important piety and nonsensical bilge is one of the most horrific encapsulations of what is rotten and bad in western society today. In it, a sentient air-rat decides he's much too important to deal with small minded concerns, like making a seagull's living eating fish. He decides he's some kind of artist. He meets an asian air-rat who is of course much more wise and deep than his own whitebread air-rat self, and becomes some sort of super spiritual air-rat. Not content to jockey around the entire universe like some kind of air-rat version of Padre de Pio, he returns to earth to lord it over the other air rats with his superior spiritual pose. Of course, the only air rats who listen to him are similar outcasts from air rat society. He then attempts (successfully) to destroy air-rat society from within. Because it's a story written by a wretched hippy, the air-rats move on to a higher spiritual plane rather than starving to death, which would be the real outcome of such a course of action.Throughout this abomination against all human decency, reference is made to the word \\"love.\\" As the famous line in \\"Princess Bride\\" goes, \\"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\\" The author, of course abandoned his family, and went through a succession of trophy wives once he got famous. Because, rather than being a superior seagull, Richard Bach was merely a self-important monstrous one; a typical scoundrel who tapped into the zeitgeist of his era. He even rationalized the whole thing in a hippy dippy way; go look it up on Wikipedia.This sort of fortune-cookie spiritual hokum and self-justifying baloney is exactly what is wrong with everyone. Duty, honor, decency, good humor and common sense are extinct. In its place is a prim, flatulent, doltish self-rationalization of petulant, grubby \\"whatever I feel like, because I am one of the enlightened\\" idiocy.

But, as an adolescent I assumed that I just didn't &quot;get it&quot; because everyone else loved it. My book group chose it last month and dutifully I read it again, hoping to understand what I didn't before.Unfortunately, now that I am older and wiser, I disliked it even more. Perhaps when viewed in its historical context, being published in the early '70s on the brink of all the self-help drivel that followed, it could be considered original or extraordinary. But to me, it was the opposite. It was as if Richard Bach was trying to incorporate every feel-good cliche and every religious idea into one marketable paperback.If this book changed your life, I am happy that you have been helped.

I was captivated by his \\"Stranger to the Ground\\", so I sought out his more famous \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". Great idea and presented well (at first). About the life of an overachiever seagull in the seagull community. Some very interesting technical seagull flight science. I've been around seagulls and casually studied them myself. I was interested in this and looking forward to it. May I add that I wasn't looking for a zoological piece on seagulls . . . I was indeed seeking a bit of whimsy.Unfortunately, after the thrilling openers on the art of flight, the story drifts into metaphysics and becomes rather preachy, with forays into ideas of reincarnation, universal interconnection, be-all-you-can-be, blah, blah, blah. I don't even agree with that stuff but could have written this part myself, considering the hackneyed ideas shared here.You'll likely read this short work in 30 minutes. Half of the book is filler of photos of seagulls in flight. The first couple dozen were interesting. After that they became, well, filler. But without them you would have had a magazine article and not a book.Overrated, but I suppose the philosophy appeals to a literary faction \\"in the power\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Since my youth, this book has been an incredible inspiration to me. It helps all who read it persevere through adversity, trials and triumphs. I have drawn from it examples for teaching, coaching and counseling all who may be in need of direction or strength to carry on. It might be especially helpful for those who are transitioning from one era of their life to another. It addresses the full gamut of life, and life beyond. The only hiccup in the whole of the script, is toward the latter half of the book when the phrase \\"forget about faith\\" is used. Although maybe out of context and not at all what Bach, the author, intended, it is all about Faith. I give a lot of copies out to friends and clients, whenever I get a copy I suggest omitting that phrase. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a must read for anyone searching for direction in their lives, especially if they are an athlete currently in competitive arenas, or moving on and trying to deal with who they used to be."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who has some extraordinary adventures. Young Jonathan feels that there must be more to life than eating, the main preoccupation of his fellow gulls, and has become fascinated by flight as an end in itself, not just as a means of finding food. He begins to experiment and discovers that he is capable of flying at high speed and of performing all kinds of daring and exhilarating aerial feats. Outraged by Jonathan's refusal to conform to the norms of seagull society, the other gulls expel him from his flock, but this ostracism in no way affects his determination to learn all he can about flying and his quest for perfection.Some have seen the book as trite and banal, but in my view it can work on a number of different levels. Jonathan's adventures continue after his earthly death, which have led some to read a spiritual meaning into it. It has even been seen as a Christian allegory, with Jonathan as a Christ-figure leading others to salvation. This interpretation has not, however, been accepted by all- some fundamentalists have even denounced the work as satanic- and for me it does not really work, for two reasons. Firstly, although some of Jonathan's followers proclaim that he is the son of the Great Gull (for which read God), he himself denies such claims and regards them as a misunderstanding of his teaching. Secondly, Jonathan's passage to the afterlife is presented not as the ascent of a justified soul to a Christian heaven but as reincarnation on a higher, but not necessarily the highest, plane of existence in which he can continue the spiritual development begun on Earth.To me the book is less a Christian homily than an exploration of the alternative, especially Asian, forms of spirituality which were becoming popular in the West in the sixties and seventies. (It was first published in 1970). Jonathan's mentor in the \\"higher plane\\" is a seagull with the distinctly Chinese name of Chiang. The religious philosophy underlying the story is not so much Christianity but a theistic form of Buddhism, with Jonathan as a bodhisattva, that is to say an enlightened being who, motivated by compassion, assists others towards enlightenment. The book ends with Jonathan's transition from learner to teacher, one who passes on his idealism and his love for flying to other gulls.Coexisting with its spiritual aspects, the book also contains secular meanings. On the one hand it is an obvious satire on materialism and conformity, on the other it can also be interpreted as preaching an optimistic philosophy that \\"you can do anything if you want it enough and if you try hard enough\\". (The secret, according to Chiang, is to \\"begin by knowing that you have already arrived\\"). This would link the book with the self-help and positive thinking movements, although Richard Bach was presumably not thinking of the materialistic side of self-help. (\\"You can have the perfect job, a huge house and millions in your bank account if only you want it enough........\\"). A pilot himself, he was using flight as a metaphor both for spiritual growth and secular self-perfection.The story is a simple one, reminiscent of a fable or folk-tale, but it is surprisingly deep; Bach's superficially simple tale has several different levels of meaning, and it is certainly a work of some literary merit. Nevertheless, there is a reason why I have only awarded it three stars. Even works of literary merit need to demonstrate some sort of value for money. It is not a novel nor for that matter a novella, although it is sometimes described as one, but a short story. My copy runs to 88 pages, but only 40 actually contain the text of the story, most of the remainder being taken up with some unremarkable- and in some cases frankly dull- black-and-white photographs of seagulls. Even that total of 40 pages is only achieved by some very generous typesetting and the use of a smaller format than most modern paperbacks. 6.99 for the paperback version is really too much to pay for a single short story which, in a normal format, would run only to some 20 or 30 pages. Mr Bach and his publishers should consider either bringing out a cheaper edition."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"For anyone who always seems out of step with the people around him.

I also grew up, and still live, near the ocean, where seagulls always maintain a constant presence - which made the metaphorical vehicle for this story particularly apt in my case. It remains one of my very favorite books, even to this day.The truly amazing thing (the thing that elevates this book to a 10) is how elegantly, simply, and deftly the author covers such profound material, with such a minimum of effort and words. The book weighs in at a mere 128 pages ... over half of them B&W; photos of seagulls ... so it's actually less than 60 pages of text. If you reformatted it to small, normal size print, it'd probably drop to about 30 pages. I recently re-read it in about 2 hours, so it's a very fast read - but it's tiny size is greatly outweighed by it's impact. One could easily argue that the story is prose poetry, rather than a short story, because of it's well honed cadence.I highly recommend this gem for anyone (particularly those in their teens and twenties) who's groping about for their emotional, spiritual, and intellectual niche in society, and life in general.Life can be hard, lonely and painful at times - but every once in a while we stumble across a rare gem ... be it a person or a moment or a song or a book or the touch of a friendly hand ... that helps us catch a glimpse of what it's really all about, and which lets us know that we're not alone, and that there are others out there, like us, who occasionally 'get it' too.For music lovers, there's also a lovingly produced full length orchestral album (by Neil Diamond) that was inspired by this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The tale of Jonathan Seagull is one of trials and unknown growth.

Well, maybe useful from the standpoint of staying alive, but what use is that if you don't do anything more wonderful than eat?Mt father insisted that I got this book from the bookstore one day, and I will never regret getting it. It is like Bach's ultimate goal. Although I rather wish I was a gull.;)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This slim little volume is quite an interesting book. In the simplistic sense it is the story of a seagull who is exiled from the flock because of unseagull like tendencies. Jonathon was a seagull who dreams of flying, not like the other gulls, but to the full extent of his potential. He wants to be better, to fly better and this is contrary to the nature of the flock. He doesn't fit in and he is exiled for it. After the exile he discovers that there is an entirely different world out there with gulls who are also trying to reach their potential. He becomes part of this world and tries to teach other gulls to not just follow the flock but rather to excel and be a better gull. This is the simple explanation of the story.This is also not all there is to the story of Jonathon Livingston Seagull. This is a fable for us to learn a lesson from. Richard Bach is telling us that we can be like Jonathon Seagull. He is telling us that we must still seek our higher ambition even if our friends and family don't understand or try to hold us back. This is a very relevant book for today (even though it was written 30 years ago). Call it a fable, call it a parable, this is a good book to read and should even be on some required reading lists."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is a short parable about living without limitations, and realizing the perfection within oneself. The story begins with a young seagull, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who is curious about learning how to fly. But Jonathan lives with a flock where flying is considered irresponsible and pointless. As he continues to develop his flying skills, he is cast out of his flock and told never to return. This is where the real adventure begins with Jonathan meeting other seagulls, just like him, who love flying and are perfecting their skills.This is a beautiful story about going beyond our perceived limitations of life and seeing possibilities. It is about freedom, love, and happiness. There are many lessons to be learned from this book including that we are limited by our thoughts and that we are capable of accomplishing our goals. This is a short book and a most enjoyable read. Appropriate for all ages. It is certainly a book that I will read again and again. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This timeless classic was created in a time gone by and yet it's spirit captivates readers of today as easily as it did when first published. A credit to Richard Bach's insight, this simple and absorbing story is an any age read. I first read this book 16 years ago. I have read it as a bed time story to youngsters, and like John Bertrand, in &quot;Born to win&quot; the story of the 1983 America's Cup campaign (Forward by Richard Bach) have worked with Jonathan as an inspirational model for team building and one-on-one coaching. Courage and persistance in the pursuit of personal excellence are tenants of this tale which is underpinned by values which support the personal development of individuals and of society. Our hero is a seagull, with an unlikley scenario in which to provide the reader with a prescription for personal insight and growth. This books descriptive prose allows the reader to be alongside Jonathan as his adventure unfolds (&quot;he eased out of the dive and shot over the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon.&quot;). The book also contains a myriad of photographic illustrations, further entrancing the reader throughout this epic journey. This book should be in every bookcase. Thank you Richard Bach, for bringing characters such as Jonathan Livingston Seagull and Fletcher Gull from your imagination to ours, for providing an opportunity to bring the magic of imagination to useful personal creation and individual reality."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The parable of a bird who chooses to follow his dreams over convention, one cannot help but be inspired.Bach clear lucid prose and easy to follow story telling also cannot help but to challenge the reader to themself choose dreams over convention and in so doing really know what it is to fly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. It contains the most important truths I have ever learned.This book certainly could be viewed as Eastern Religion / New Age, and considering Bach's other books perhaps that is his main meaning.However, JLS also contains important non-religious truths which apply to everyday life. For example, based on one of the most quoted parts of the book, \\"Jonathan\\" might answer everyday questions like this:Are you saying I can lose weight and be thin, even though I've been fat my whole life?I say you are free.Are you saying that even though I finished near the bottom this year, with hard work I could finish near the top 3 or 4 years from now?I say you are free.Are you saying that even though the aptitude test showed I'm bad in math, that I could be successful in my dream job, engineering, if I try hard enough?I say you are free.Those answers are very, very different from the prevailing paradigm / meme within our society, which says that nearly everything is determined at birth, so that we are born either \\"fat\\" or \\"thin\\" people, born \\"smart\\" or \\"bad at math\\", born as \\"great athletes\\" or \\"losers\\". Society then tells us that we shouldn't try to change anything about ourselves (since it supposedly won't work), but should spend our lives happy or bitter because of the gifts that were handed out at the birth lottery. A key turning point is when Jonathan rejects the \\"strange hollow voice\\" in his mind which tells him:\\"There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have charts for brains. If I were meant to fly at speed, I'd have a falcon's short wings... I must... be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull.\\"Jonathan rejects this when he realizes that by tucking his wings close to his body he can simulate the falcon's short wings and fly fast even though he wasn't born with short wings. After he tries this and is able to fly faster than any gull could with extended wings, Jonathan realizes: \\"We can be free! We can learn to fly!\\"JLS says that mental restrictions are the biggest factor keeping us from reaching our potential. Some of those restrictions come from society, and some are self-created mental straitjackets. All of those mental limits are false and unnecessary. The truth according to Jonathan is:\\"Your whole body... is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see. Break the chains of your mind, and you break the chains of your body, too...\\"(That can be seen as a totally non-religious statement. Our bodies today are the result of how hard we worked in the past and the mental limitations we didn't shed, and \\"our thought\\" = our mind is what determined that.)This leads Jonathan to answer these questions very differently from society: Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Should I be egotistical?Society tells us that we should conform, and we specifically are what the birth lottery gave us, like someone might be \\"heavy set, average intelligence but good in math\\". Society says that we should be immensely proud of everything we (supposedly) were born with, and of every victory, and should be intensely ashamed of anything we were born without, and of every defeat.Jonathan however, believing we are not limited by birth, sees each of us as being unique and of unlimited potential. Our goal and purpose in life is simply to be ourselves. This is not the limited self we are at the start of adult life, but everything which hard work could make us:\\"you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.Are you saying I can fly?I say you are free.\\"\\"Each of us in truth is an idea... , an unlimited idea of freedom, and precision flying is a step towards expressing our real nature. Everything that limits us we have to put aside.\\"This means that ego is meaningless, because what we are today is simply the result of yesterday's hard work, and whatever races we lose today could be won in the future if we work hard enough. Today's ranking and abilities are just the starting point for the rest of our lives, not something to get egotistical about. As one of Jonathan's students thought with a smile once he began teaching his own students, \\"No limits, Jonathan? Well, then, the time's not too distant when I'm going to appear out of thin air on YOUR beach, and show you a thing or two about flying!...\\"The reason why I discussed this in length is to disagree with reviews which say that JLS must be seen as a religious book, and that it teaches only \\"common sense\\" truths. It is rare, not common, to meet anyone who believes what JLS teaches."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"A book about \\"instructors\\" full of desire to give \\"something of truth\\" to whoever has a burning drive to learn what is unknown to him - be it some useful method to achieve a specific goal or the meaning behind that goal itself.

I know, I know, \\"He's a seagull!\\" but the fact of the matter is, it doesn't matter what he is necessarily. If you're not comfortable finding inspiration in the form of a seagull, then rewrite the book in your mind to fit your needs. Jonathan in a inspiration because of the things he does, not what species he is.If you are a reader who enjoys philosophy, but not books that over complicate everything for the purpose of sounding more important, JLS is the book for you.

It's about a seagull who shuns the social conventions of his flock to pursue his love of flying.The book is divided into three parts, beginning with a predictable follow-your-dreams story and then moving into an Eastern-style cycle of self-perfection and reincarnation, and then there's some business about love and forgiveness tossed in at the end.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a short book, but even within these confines Bach does little to give the book much ambition or depth. The seagull flies this maneuver, the seagull flies that maneuver, the seagull spouts some platitude about transcending reality. There's no sense of setting, no real insight - just flying birds and superficial philosophy. Bach's writing is otherwise unimpressive. There's at least one continuity issue, and it does feel rather absurd that these birds have such amazingly accurate internal speedometers (Bach rather belabors that point).Munson's photographs of seagulls and beachscapes help to set the mood, but the low quality in which they are reproduced in every version of the book I've ever seen just doesn't do them justice. Nevertheless, they do imbue the book with a certain charm that it badly needs.Jonathan Livingston Seagull basically comes down to banal fable and trite spirituality. There are a innumerable better \\"follow your dreams\\" stories out there, most of which don't get into this unlocking-the-unlimited-freedom-inside-you nonsense."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"received as promised, great condition, got this to read again and for child to enjoy"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I read this as a teenager, and I have to admit it, I got sucked in. O.K., let's get something out of the way: this isn't great literature, nor is it a great story. This is a sermon, a parable, a mildly entertaining allegory about seeking a higher purpose in life, not simply living for food (or money or job or survival or routine -- whatever else Bach and you might substitute here). For young adolescents this is an easy read with a good message. As simple and easy to read as it is, it really doesn't surprise me that it sold so many copies. I have no idea what kind of editorial reviews this received when first published, but I suspect they were mostly critical of the message's simplemindedness. Bach isn't subtle, nor is he morally ambiguous. But then, I'm sure this really hit the spot for the idealistic flower power children at the time. I only wonder what Bach thinks of it now."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston is a seagull who spends an inordinate amount of time learning to fly in a way seagulls weren't designed to fly. Regardless of how many times Jonathan falters and embarrasses himself, he continues his relentless quest for flight perfection. Being an ordinary gull to him was lowering his standards much to much. He wanted to be able to fly like a falcon, a feathered projectile. To Jonathan, his pursuit of flight perfection was much more important than being a part of the flock so he continued to practice his unorthodox flying skills at the expense of being banished.People may call you crazy and you may lose friends; at any rate, anyone who chooses to \\"fight the system\\" or go \\"against the grain\\" will always find much opposition. If one wishes to live an easy life then by all means follow the crowd, fit in with everyone else and don't cause any friction. If you want to go beyond the call of duty to accomplish what few have ever done however, you must make many sacrifices and endure all kinds of hardships and setbacks.This is a very simple story and a simple lesson but nevertheless very important.

Hands down. This book gives you wings not only to fly with but to free your own mind from the illusions of everyday life. The book focuses on Jonathon Livingston Seagull (big surprise) and his desire to learn to fly. Of course, this is strictly tabooed by the Flock, or other birds. His desire to fly and to learn to fly are symbolic of the love of learning. Flying isn't just another natural instinct but rather an art. Such an art also is language and this book is a Mona Lisa then."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"My children and I were talking about favorite books over dinner one night (children are 10,12 &18) when one of them asked me what my favorite book was.I am not an avid reader, so at first I could not really think of an answer. After a little thought, I remembered back to a book I read when I was in 5th grade - some 30 years ago, that really left an impression on me. Jonathan Livingston Seagull! My children all gave me blank looks - they had never heard of the book.That evening I logged on to Amazon.com and ordered the book. I am hoping we can read the book together, each taking a turn and reading a chapter outloud.

Each time you read these 127 pages you rediscover a whole new meaning. Jonathan Livingston seagull is a world litterature classic, written concisely in plain, simple English. The simplicity of the narrative and the boldness of the style let the careful reader see between the lines that what is at stake in this book is something big, something fundamental to mankind, something you don't get away with the next day.The storyIt is the story of a bird that wanted to fly.It could be Le petit Prince, because Jonathan travels through the universes, see different birds, learn about himself and his condition and discover he is alone.It could be The catcher in the rye, for the little story of this bird reminds us of the time we too, were fleeing our Flock, because of incomprehension and anger.It could be the cavern of Plato, for no one wants to hear about what Jonathan have seen and understood. His discovery changed the meaning of his life in such a way he would not renounce it under a death threat. He will now live for it, or die.It could be Matrix Reloaded since Jonathan is pushing his physical limits so far he enters a new dimension in which more is possible. He learns he is everywhere and everything.It could be the Joconde for it is as mysterious as the Joconde, but unlike the Joconde you know why this book is a bestseller and why it has influenced so much people who read it.It could be this Spanish song heard on the radio yesterday:\\"I will resist, to stay aliveI will resist, although the winds of life are blowing hardI will resist, to stay aliveI will resist, until my dreams are broken to pieces\\"Because Jonathan Livingstone is risking his life against the winds to follow the tiny little star of hope he is the only one to see.Could Jonathan Livingstone seagull be Jesus Christ? Maybe, but he is just a simple bird, of bone and feathers, just as we are. He is a prophet, for sure. He wants us to become what we really are. We have to work hard to reveal our self, and to believe in ourselves because everything is possible.Nicolas Zumino"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"one of the seagull says : are you sure that i can fly ?janathan says :i will tell you that you are free .this story is about a seagull that dont want to follow the life like the other do that , not like the routine days . he can see the life so wide and he doesnt fly due to find a food and keep hisself alive . he flys cause he loves it . he learns a lots of things through the life and learn new things . but the other think that they come to this world just to eat and sleep and fly without any motivation . at the end he goes somewhere that is more perfect than we lives now .mitra"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Read this one.

Well maybe I'm just not that deep, but I saw this as nothing but a story of a confused bird with an anxiety disorder. I'm sorry but the whole story was just a little too tough to swallow. By the way, I spent some time at the shore this summer, and I can assure you no seagull that I saw even remotely appeared to be as introspective and contemplative as JLS. Anyway, nice try Mr. Bach, but next time, let's make things a little more &quot;real world&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Okay, so I used to work for ForeverLiving.com, an MLM company (like Avon) in Scottsdale, AZ. Anyhow, when I came onboard, the company was still transitioning out their old company icon and stamping in their new one of an eagle. The old one used to be the exact image of a seagull as shown on this book's cover. The company's owner (a family owned business), Rex Maughan, told his customers he decided to change the icon image because he saw an eagle spiraling upward in the sky. But the truth was that he was sued by this author's family for using the book's signature image without written approval. Supposedly, Rex had a gentleman's agreement with the author; not something to keep attack lawyers at bay. After the author died, the man's family was running dry on the residual proceeds inherited by this book which is still in print and for sale. Whether they knew Rex Maughan is the 138th richest man in the world or they just knew he was rich, I don't know, but they took advantage of the situation, sueing Forever Living Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Though the settlement amount is a secret, it must have been a lot, even for a man so rich because this book that he used to help mass distribute to all his customers as a philosophical cornerstone of his business suddenly became banned. Not one copy is to be found anywhere on the premises and no one is allowed to speak of it, less they lose their job. I think, after having helped to sell so many more copies of this book when the buzz of it died in the literary community, he now resents the notion of helping even more copy to sell and benefit the greedy family that sued him.Because of all this drama, I finally got around to getting a copy and reading it. And well, it's okay; I guess. I wrote to both Rex and his son, Gregg, and told them I don't understand why it got so much buzz back in the 70s (so I heard). I agree with a quote I read from one critic that it's banal. Look up that word's definition; that was the right word to use. I believe some people enjoyed it because of the fantasy we may have that there's more to this world and our experience of it than we're aware of. Basically, this book will help you daydream of being able to move through time and space instantly, simply by willing it with your mind. It doesn't really give you a technique to try, in case you're wondering. Just practice, practice, practice, and you may eventually be able to experience something like being a god. Oh yeah; that reminds me - this book tries to tell you (in between the lines) that there is no God. Just you and your thoughts but that's enough for you to be your own god. That's why the Catholic Church shunned this book too when it 1st came out.This book is a short read. I forget how long it was but I read it in one evening's sitting."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book was received in a timely manner and was in good condition as stated.

Deep messages? Please. What is so annoying about \\"Seagull\\" is the blatant anti-intellectualism of it; the pseudo-profoundity; the feeble fable. After being asked to write a paper on the meaning of the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" lyric(!), having to read this book was the last straw for our 11th grade Language Arts class. We feared \\"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs\\" was next. Read it if you must. As a snapshot of mid-70's popular culture, it fits somewhere between pet rocks and Space Food Sticks."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I first heard about this book when someone compared it to the wonderful 'Serendipity's Secret', as they both use the fable formula where an animal goes on a journey of self-discovery. I did feel that 'JLS' started well. I liked the use of Jonathan's desire to break free from the flock as a metaphor for going after your dreams. I was really rooting for Jonathan at first and admired his determination to succeed. However, very soon I found the book started to get slightly wierd and hard to follow, especially when Jonathan meets his mentor Chiang and starts flying through walls, talking about space and time et al!! All very new age! It was at this point for me it changed from inspiring fable and I started to slightly loose the plot!The inspiring message of going after your dreams no matter what, is great up to a point but unfortunately, life isn't always that simple. You need talent as well as tenacity to succeed at certain things and the ability to set goals and overcome obstacles are all just part of the picture. There is often a fine line between determination and delusion, which means that going against the advice of others to pursue your dreams no matter what is not always the best option! Just remember those awful 'Americal Idol' auditions...!However, this book is good as a starting point to inspire you, especially if you haven't read self-development books before and you like the new age style of writing. It's great that so many people do feel inspired by this little book but unfortunately I seem to be one of the people who just didn't connect with it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I think this is a cute story that younger readers will appreciate. I'm not sure why there is so much hatred for this little book. If it's not for you there are plenty of other books out there to read. As a librarian, I must say that there is too much negativity in our culture towards what people read. Let people read what they like. Reading at any level improves vocabulary and comprehension. Snobbishness towards reading materials is especially counter productive. Just say why it wasn't for you and leave it at that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL was such a cultural phenomenon when it was first released in 1970 that it is hard to fairly evaluate the book. This simple (notice I said \\"simple\\" and not \\"deceptively simple\\") fable about a seagull who loves flying more than he cares to troll in the wake of the herring boats, was an explosive best-seller. Tens of millions of copies and a movie later, it's still in print.Bach's next book, 1977'sIllusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, is actually a better book. But JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL came at a time when it was the perfect vehicle to represent the last gasp of the Woodstock Era, the birthing cry of the Me Decade, and was the grandpappy of New Age commercialism. An easy book to digest, it seems to offer the reader a glimpse of profundity but without requiring effort on anybody's part. In other words, J.L.S. is a perfect mass market sop to the idea of spiritual materialism.Aye, there's the rub: For although J.L.S. is hokey beyond belief, it's also a book that can change lives, or at least set one's feet on the Path With Heart. Hardly deep (the writing has been described as \\"Kahlil Gibran Meets Captain Kangaroo\\"), the book's sincere message of transcendence over the mundane life can touch a chord inside the reader, especially if the reader has not been exposed to Kahlil Gibran (or Captain Kangaroo, for that matter). Every garbageman a guru.There are far greater examples of poetical writing (try Gibran for example, or Rumi, Peter Matthiessen, or Loren Eiseley), and the reader who comes to JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL after first findingThe Prophetwill probably roll his eyes. This is definitely a \\"starter\\" book. It rates THREE AND THREE QUARTER STARS, (but possibly FIVE if you're at where it's at). Otherwise, J.L.S. is just a curiosity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it.

I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I just finished reading this book (it took less than an hour), and I must say that I absolutely loved it! Although it's a REALLY short book, it's filled with wonderful, important insights for all those reading it with an open mind.Richard Bach uses the life of a seagull to examine the importance of following your dreams, and to highlight the reasons why many of us tend to give up - at times before we've even really tried. These reasons include: fear of what other's might think of us; being considered different from everyone else (and at times this leading to being seen as \\"bad\\"); and the inability for us to KNOW that we can do it - we can do ANYTHING we put our minds to.I would highly recommend this book to everyone with an open mind. I also think this would be a great book to read to children - the very young may not be able to grasp its implications, but I bet those around 8yrs. and up could understand the meaning if the parents discuss it afterwards."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is a truly magical book. Its message can be interpreted in many ways by different people as the reviews posted here attest. To me, this book is an eloquent reminder of the power of persistence. Most things in life worth achieving don't come easily, they are preceded by struggle and hard work. There is usually a direct relationship between what we put into something and what we get back in return.Jonathan had an insatiable desire to learn. He wasn't interested in ordinary goals or activities. He was seeking nothing less than perfection. His thinking was on a higher plane than his fellow gulls. They were thinking - \\"fly to eat\\". Jonathan was thinking - \\"eat to fly!\\". He was driven to acheive his goal of perfect flight regardless of the consequences or sacrifices he had to make. Few people have this attitude, but the few who do are lucky indeed. That attitude, combined with persistence, is the key to all great acheivements.There is a quote by Calvin Coolidge that seems appropriate here: \\"Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is the ultimate fantasy of love and kindness triumphing over the mundane matters of everyday existance.

It is a very simple book and its written in a way that is very easy to follow. I find this book to be very inspirational and it shows how all of us can achieve anything we want if we just we put our mind, heart and soul into what we're doing and never give up no matter how tough the long journey ahead seems to be. I found this book late in my life, I wish I would have read it when I was much younger but it's better late than never and now that I have read it I understand so many things that had I read the book many years before I would have done differently. This is an excellent book for everyone and I highly recommend it. They should make this book required reading for school children so they can learn the true meaning of going for what they want in spite of negative opposition from others. I'm glad I found this book even at my age, it made look at life in a different perspective. EXCELLENT!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I've read many reviews on this book. I'm not satisfied with most. Most both negative and positive have poor reasons.Most negatives I read just don't like mindless hippy-ness and empty new age philosophy (neither do I); they think the book propagates these things so they condemn it. It only propagates mindlessness if you are short-sited enough to assume that is its message. Don't be.Most positives I read just demonstrate the mindlessness that the negatives dislike. There is more to get out of this book than the \\"feel-good\\" aspect.To those who think the subject matter is thoughtless: look deeper.This is a much more accurate view of heaven than what most people have discerned from the Bible. If you want evidence of this, read Mark 12:34 in context. Heaven is not a place.It also indicates some of Bach's suspicions about the true nature of messiahs (Muhammad, Buddah, Jesus) that the world upholds and a possiblity of their true nature.It is clear that Bach meant flying for seagulls to represent learning for humans. I am in agreement with him that this is what we do best and what life is about: learning, growing. In fact this is (ironically) the same viewpoint that the negative spotlight reviewer, dbsholes, seems to have (go read new books; don't become stagnant).I like that the highest rung on Bach's \\"learning ladder\\" seemed to be love. This parallels biblical teaching (1 Jn 4:16; 1 Co 13).The most important idea (in my opinion) that the book hints at is the possiblity that God is not a being, but a mind of which we are a part.If this sounds like foolishness, read the first chapter of Swarm Intelligence (SI) by James Kennedy and Russel C. Eberhart, a graduate level discussion of minds (with a focus on artificial intelligence). The first chapter of SI is a discourse on the nature of minds (and how much of a misunderstanding most people have about what they really are). I wouldn't immediately buy it unless you are a Computer Science graduate focusing on AI or a Psychology major, but it is definately worth a check-out from the library, although I doubt a non-collegiate library would have it.We don't have to overcome the laws of nature. Never does the book state that the seagulls are overcoming the laws of nature. They are simply coming to realize that the laws of nature don't limit them, that the only thing limiting them is themselves. We assume the laws limit us when in fact they are the tools set up to help us.I don't know if Bach thought he was just making this stuff up, but the reality is he has hit the nail right on the head.There is more to the book than I have listed here. I'll leave the rest for you to discover."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I left home to join the Navy when I was 21 and this was the only thing I took with me that I still own.

The book travelled with me around the world to my first ship in the Indian Ocean and then back to the US. I've had it ever since.There is magic in these pages. You can read this book at different points in your life and you will focus on different things ...often things that you never noticed before.

Thanks so much for this gift Richard.Final Note: Regarding the great concern regarding \\"New Age\\" ideas ...I can't say exactly how Richard intended this story, but I read it as an allegory. I never assumed the author thought gulls could instantaneously travel through time and space, just as I never thought 3 pigs could build houses.

Why? Because they've all been done before. Classics like Animal Farm and Watership Down define the successes of this overused technique. Jonathan Livingston Seagull shares a throne among the best of these.It's a short and simple tale about a seagull who loves to fly and wants to do his best at it. The writing is lyrical and flowing, with beautiful, almost poetic language. The story line is rich with metaphor, spirituality, and subtle meaning. It is an uplifting story, one that adds weight to the good side of the scale of humanity.I first read this book as teenager shortly after it came out in 1970. At that age and at that time this was a powerful book. It still is. I think it will be appreciated by idealistic collegians more than cynical forty-somethings, but everyone will benefit. If you don't like this book, you'd better get yourself checked out.

He soon discovers the eternal truth that different is a gift not a burden &amp; learns the lessons sent to try him with great success &amp; spiritual freedom. A parody of human life in our present society &amp; a prediction of how our future may turn out? You be the judge, it has a different message for each person who reads it; that's why it's such a special book. I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind &amp; a desire to create a better life,and I think that includes almost all of us."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I can remember, before I read this book about 5 years ago, growing up always seeing this book lying around my house. Of course at the time I never inquired as to what it was, I just saw it all the time. I always associated it with some Christian book of inspiration that my father was reading, which is why I never bothered to look at it.After reading this, however, I was truly amazed with the story. I knew I knew it. I mean, the story was entirely familar. Like most people growing up in a Christian household they are likely to hear the story of Jesus. Either from their parents, church or wherever. This book surprised me with the parallel to Jesus' own life. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who knew he something better to do than just eat. So he flew higher and higher and came down faster and faster. He was learning. He was experiencing.Soon, after being kicked out of his own lang and meeting some very wise Gulls. They taught him perfect speed. It was some time before I understood what this meant. But I found out one day at an Ani DiFranco concert (learning is everywhere around you). Someone said that she was the fastest female metal guitarist, or something or other. It dawned on me then what perfect speed was. Its not the speed, its not the height, but the quality. In a word: now.At any rate, this book was one of the books that really inspired me, for many things outside of it just being a Jesus parallel. It inspired me to know that we all have more to do with our time than to work to make money to eat (ad infinitum). One of the great books of its day. Highly reccomended for those who love good stories. (Oh, by the way - if you loved this story and thought you might want to see the movie. Dont! You will be utterly bored, especially by Neil Diamonds droning terrible songs in which a short book is made into a 2 hour live rendition. A complete let down, not to mention a waste of a film)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is a wonderful, concise read for those of us searching for meaning to this thing we call \\"life\\".

At first, I was kinda turned off when I found out that Jonathan was a gull. I don't have anything against gulls, but I thought it was going to be a story about a *person*, so when I learned he was a gull, my expectations went down. *sweatdrop* But please read on.Another thing that nearly cost this book its 5-star review by moi was the fact that it lulled me to sleep. Not necessarily because the *story* was boring--it was just that the smooth prose and the calm, soothing feeling it evoked lulled me to sleep. I first picked up this book about half an hour before going to sleep, so you can just imagine how sleepy I got even before my time. -_-;But I didn't give up on this book. Jon's character... saved me, I guess. Even though he was a *gull*, his personality (er... gullity? ^_^ ^_^ ^_^) was remarkably human. I really liked him as a character, and I remembered how much I enjoyed reading &quot;Illusions&quot;, so I decided to continue reading. And that was when I finally found delight in the piece.The story seems simple enough, but its central message is advice that I think people are most desperate for in this new age. Kinda like a modern-day Gospel or something, except this one is much more refreshing to read, and much more relevant. Which isn't to diss the original Gospels or anything. But those Gospels were intended for ancient peoples of long ago. *This* one is for now, for the moment, and that is what I feel matters most.Like &quot;Illusions&quot;, this story will inspire you. And if you're the type who looks to books more for the story than for anything else the book may tell you, you'll find this an equally satisfying piece of prose. The writing style is fluid and easily understandable, and has a poignant beauty in its simplicity as well, and you'll find scenes that are amusing (there's one amusing scene that I doubt I'll forget in a long time ^^) and touching and inspiring.Just a few suggestions for new readers:1. Don't read this before going to bed (unless you're sure you won't let the warm, serene feeling lull you to sleep) 2. Look at the pictures (too bad they weren't colored, or I would have spent more time looking at them) 3. Don't rush. 4. If possible, get &quot;Illusions&quot;, too, written by the same author.This concludes my review. I hope this helped, and I hope you enjoy your experience of &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; as I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This is a sublime and inspirational fable about the timeless quest for higher meaning ... told in this case though the eyes of an sensitive, lonely, and highly intelligent seagull, named Johnathan.I first read it when I was in high school, and at the time it moved me ... very deeply. I also grew up, and still live, near the ocean, where seagulls always maintain a constant presence - which made the metaphorical vehicle for this story particularly apt in my case. It remains one of my very favorite books, even to this day.The truly amazing thing (the thing that elevates this book to a 10) is how elegantly, simply, and deftly the author covers such profound material, with such a minimum of effort and words. The book weighs in at a mere 128 pages ... over half of them B&W; photos of seagulls ... so it's actually less than 60 pages of text. If you reformatted it to small, normal size print, it'd probably drop to about 30 pages. I recently re-read it in about 2 hours, so it's a very fast read - but it's tiny size is greatly outweighed by it's impact. One could easily argue that the story is prose poetry, rather than a short story, because of it's well honed cadence.I highly recommend this gem for anyone (particularly those in their teens and twenties) who's groping about for their emotional, spiritual, and intellectual niche in society, and life in general.Life can be hard, lonely and painful at times - but every once in a while we stumble across a rare gem ... be it a person or a moment or a song or a book or the touch of a friendly hand ... that helps us catch a glimpse of what it's really all about, and which lets us know that we're not alone, and that there are others out there, like us, who occasionally 'get it' too.For music lovers, there's also a lovingly produced full length orchestral album (by Neil Diamond) that was inspired by this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a very brief, easily readable tale about a young seagull who is always stretching beyond his limits. Never satisfied with being &quot;average&quot;, Jonathan wants to fly faster, wilder and better than any other seagull. Over the course of this short story Jonathan is enlightened about his own existence and teaches other gulls like him.This beautiful, heart-rending story is a page turner and a quick read. It is also well worth the time spent reading it and is a good story to keep nearby for reading again and again. I found that this book changed my perspective greatly. It's a very uplifting and heartening work.It's also interesting to note that Richard Bach wrote this story for a fellow friend of his, a pilot named Jonathan Livingston who died in the 1970's.This is a book about limits, precisely, about never letting them hinder you. It's a terrific story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"It appears that most reviewers of this book read it in their youths at a time when their identities were still forming and when they were in craving inspiration and hope to aid their lackluster adolescent existences (keep in mind that adolescence does not necessarily end with the teenage years for oh so many people, as evidenced by some of the reviews). As with most identity-creating experiences most of these individuals are apparently loathe to let go of thier superficial first impressions of this book and in fact have only reinforced its significance with additional readings. One reviewer is so invested in this book's contribution to their selfness they have proudly proclaimed to have read it &quot;over 300 times&quot;. Is there any better example of how addiction to that which is comfortable eliminates opportunity for exposure to new ideas (I'm thinking of people who spend their lives reading only the bible). How can anyone get anything out of something when it is virtually the only thing they read. Aren't they curious about what else is out there? Apparently not, and so much the pity.It need not be surprising then that most Amazon.com reviewers of this book have done so long, long after forming their emotionally-fortified opinions of the book so that thier reviews are not really reviews at all, but rather emotional defenses of themselves as those whose very identities were in part formed by this short work. As a result those positive reviews tend to be long and detailed while the negative reviews - obviously written by people didn't get much out the book - tend to be short and lacking any significant detail making them very easy for dismissal by the &quot;loyalists&quot;.I on the other hand, at the age of thirty-five, have only just read the book for the very first time. Yes, I admit it is a bit of a surpise. As rediculously simplistic a message that this book contains, barely disguised as serious literature, it is a surprised that my high school didn't assign it as most school readings tended to have such two-dimensional messages (and also tended to swear the student off reading anything for a short time immediately following completion). I, on the other hand, although having obviously heard about the book for years, never crossed paths with a copy for the forty-odd minutes required to snack on its highly-regarded psycho-wisdom. So I came to it as a fully-formed functioning adult, fresh and anew, and this review is therefore in my opinion a more honest appraisal than most that you will read here.My review itself is short: This book would appear to appeal to the same mass of people who religiously watch Oprah and listen to AM radio for clues on how to better live their lives. It is indeed self-help drivel, perhaps the first example of the avalance of so-called inspirational excrement that rolled off the presses in the 1970s and 80s. I'll allow that Richard Bach may have been the first writer to frame the message of &quot;be all that you can be regardless of the obsticles&quot; into an allegorical (read: thinly disguised) format, but that would only excuse the throngs of people who gravitated towards this book when it was first published during the naive, self-indulgent, spiritually-seeking 70s. It explains nothing about the masses who still seem to derive live-altering inspiration from its simplistic story. I don't claim to have an explantation for that. All I am certain of is this: it only takes a quick chanel surf through daytime television - with the popular surplus of JerrySpringerRickiLakeSallyJesseJennyJones et al, alongside the mind-numbing idiocy of the ever-popular soap-opera genre - to understand that there is indeed a very wide audience for this type of simplistic, non-threatening, non-challenging, non-talented, non story. It is harmless, that is true, but it is hardly a contribution to the condition of man. It may appeal to individuals from the inside of a soul-searching crises, but it is also sorely lacking in substance, meaning, and soul. There is much better enriching material available to read. Of those to whom this book has meant so much I can only say: enjoy your lives. But for heaven's sake read some other stuff as well."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is an insullt to people everywhere. The fact that many enjoy it is shameful. This silly little &quot;children's book&quot; of about 90 pages with large type is about as intellectually stimulating as being hit in the head with a rock. It's plot and characters are dull, and the metaphorical garbage it spews out at you is disgusting."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"For a long time I had suspected that America was a nation full of pathetic people desperately striving to improve their lives. This so-called book has confirmed my suspicions. That most of the reviews for this piece of trash are positive is not surprising. After all, this book is full of the You-can-do-anything-you-want if-you-try-hard-enough nonsense that Americans cherish. That anyone would describe the author's overwrought, shamelessly manipulative, saccharine prose as good literature, however, is simply mind-boggling.People, please, get off your butts and start living your lives!! Trust me, reading feel-good, exploitative books written by savvy, if untalented, authors will do little to change your unsatisfactory existence."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Everyone had limits. I, for instance, will never be Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the first place, I haven't the time or the perseverance to hit the gym, nor the money and courage to get a sex and name change, nor even the ability to fake the accent well. Moreover, even if I accomplished all these things, I would not really be Arnold, but simply a copy of Arnold.So when Jonathan Livingston Seagull triumphantly crows: \\"a seagull is unlimited\\", we know it is a blatant lie, for a seagull, no matter how strong or Austrian, cannot be Arnold Schwarzenegger any more than I can.This, in turn, brings us to another limit. I will never understand why this book, conveniently titled after it's main character, gathered praise. Perhaps if my mind were unlimited and soaring as Jonathan Livingston Seagull's, I could understand such a puzzling quandary.Written by a man by the name of Richard Bach (no relation, I assume to the famous composer, who was far too limited, for he merely wrote symphonies with music, rather than mothballs or goat cheese), this little parable tells the story of Jesus Aslan Messiah the Seagull (Jon for short), who spends his days learning to fly fast instead of stealing people's fried dough or fighting over dead crabs left to roast in the sun. For some reason, this irritates the rest of the flock, and they kick him out for being different.Jon spends the next two double-spaced wide-margined pages perfecting flight, and I must assume that those two pages cover a long bit of time, because soon after, Jon meets a couple of sparkling, angelic Seagulls who take him to Heaven. Serves the nasty scavenger right! I cried triumphantly, for we all know that seagulls are, in truth, vultures that decided the beach was more fun than the side of the highway.I assumed Seagull Heaven would contain a lot of parking lots and dumpsters, but instead it seemed to be a regular old beach. As it turns out, this isn't seagull heaven at all! It's merely another plane of existence, for, as Jon's new friend whose name is unworthy of remembrance teaches us, there's no such place as heaven. Heaven, he instructs, is merely a state of being; it lives within a gull (or person, as it were.). Strange, thought I, this book must release some sort of drug through my fingertips and it has finally altered my mind, for nonsense like this cannot truly be written and published.The drug-induced state did not improve matters, in fact, things became worse. Jon and his friend whose name I still can't remember learn to teleport. Apparently, it's as easy as imagining yourself where you want to be. However, though I tried, I could not will myself inside the TARDIS, but instead was still stuck in my room with a book I had no desire to finish.Jon ascends to another plane of existence with his friend whose name may or may not begin with an S, and there he teaches other seagulls to fly. He himself, of course, keeps training and somehow manages to fly up to Love and Kindness which makes him realize that he wants to go back to the flock that kicked him out in the first place and teach them to fly.He teleports back to his old flock and meets an outcast gull named Fletcher and decides that this juvenile delinquent is a fine candidate for flying lessons. They are later joined by Charles-Roland Seagull, Judy Lee Seagull, and Silly Name Seagull. They fly circles around the Flock.A lame seagull wants to join in the flying lessons, and Jon teaches him that he just has to believe in himself, and lo and behold, it works! Instead of being hailed as a hero, Jon is doubleplus shunned, though some call him \\"son of the great gull\\". I'm sure I've heard this story somewhere, but I can't put my finger on it.Finally, as we near the end, Fletcher Seagull flies smack into a cliff, but instead of dying like a normal person, he ascends, has a little chat with Jon, and decides he's better off back on earth.At long last, Jon ditches Fletch and ascends to do unlimited things, disappearing in a sparkly cloud. Fletch then, in turn, begins teaching young seagull brats to fly at abnormal speeds, preaching at them the entire time.This leads us to one more limit: this book could not be worse. The plot is vague, the philosophy is slightly moronic, and Jon is nothing more than a half-baked Aslan. He exists only to spout the author's viewpoint, but, unlike Aslan, he's not even remotely likeable and is a Mary Sue of the highest order.Disgusted, I tossed the book at the nearest wall and glanced at the clock. It had taken up fifteen minutes of my time that I could never recover. Unless, of course, I look outside myself and learn that Time is Unlimited and that I will exist forever. Perhaps I will even be reborn as Arnold Schwarzenegger.I thought, perhaps, it was just me that hated the book, so I passed it on to my eleven year old sister, who has dubious taste in literature. When I asked her not five minutes ago what she thought of it, her response was ripe with wisdom and pretty much sums up the whole experience. I leave you with her resonant word of wisdom, for she, in one word, accurately described the schlock we have witnessed:\\"Euugh!\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"It's the same feeling as describing the love.

However, this story of the seagull who strived to fly his own way just didnt work for me. It was not a horrible book just kind of campy for my taste"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an excellent book written by Richard Bach. It tells of the life of Jonathan, a seagull who does not wish to follow the rest of the flock. After being banished for reckless flying, he lives out the rest of his days in this life in happy solitude, learning almost all that he wants to learn. Once he moves onto the next life, he meets a wise teacher, and Jonathan learns more than he could have hoped for. After learning so much, he returns to his flock to try and teach them the wonderful things that he knows. Most do not listen to him. Only outcasts, like himself, are wiling to learn the wonderful things that Jonathan Livingston Seagull has to teach. However, all of that is simply the literal version of the story.This story is very deep, with many philosophical and spiritual questions and answers given. The deeper meaning of this book is wonderful, and much better than the story itself. I highly recomend that you read this book, if only to have some of the ideas in it implanted into your mind.Lengthwise, this is a very short book. I read it in just one siting. There were no big words, or any lengthy descriptions. All of the material was presented in a simple and straightforward way. There are many wonderful pictures of seagulls that fill up a sizable portion of the pages. I highly recomend this great book to anyone who is pondering about some of the mysteries that life holds.

It is a short, very short, book. Johnathan learns that he loves to fly. He decides to learn how to fly better than any seagull ever has flown. And, we get a, sort of, existential account of what follows. Johnathan finds that doing what he loves and doing it well brings him a, sort of, spiritual fulfillment and a, sort of, trancendence of self.This book appeared at, about, the time that the hippy, yippy, long-hairs were into the Beatles, who were into Indian music and Ravi Shankar, or whoever. This is, about, when \\"New Age\\" spiritual quests began.The book is a good read. It does offer some things to think about. But it is not a deep, philosophical or religious, screed. It is a simple story. Also, it does offer a modern alternative path of spirituality that is not the same old Judeo-Christian-Moslem religion plus Buddist paths that extend back over a couple of millenis, or more.However, easy does it! This book is somewhat like the Japanese Tea Garden, near the greenhouse, in San Francisco. It is great to contemplate from a short distance. But, does not do as well under close inspection or under heavy traffic. I repeat, it is not deep philosophy or deep religion and is not reinforced for heavy duty load-bearing use. I rated it a 4, for being a nice read. However, if you are looking for industrial strength religion and philosophy, start with the Bible and continue reading all the serious Budhist books, and many more. \\"New Age\\" is 'feel good' but does not offer the support that the old-time, complex, structurally multiply-reinforced religions offer.So a sort of \\"fun\\" read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Like the \\"Cookie Book\\" and \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\", Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a great little story packed with inspiration for young minds developing in a rather horrific and relentless world. It is an escape from your everyday way of thinking to, perhaps, strive to better oneself and those around us. Being an adult and already hard pressed with my own self awareness and assurance, this book does little for me. As an adult I rate the book a 1 star, but my inner child rates it a 5. Somehow it all seems fitting to place it right in the middle. Don't take this book seriously... and don't take yourself seriously.In conclusion (and in retrospect), there is little need to even review this book.

One of those classics that one always looks back on with delight. Bach evidently chose seagulls in light of his own flying background but the picture of the rat race remains as compelling. I bought soon after a poster of a bird silhouetted against the sun setting over a seascape and the words on it always remained with me : &quot;You see things as they are, and ask why?

So, some almost forty years later I decided to make a second attempt.It only takes an hour or so to read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". It's a tiny book. It's not even a very long short story. It is, however, allegorical. In simple terms, JLS is Jesus. He has learnt much from his heavenly father and is keen to pass the knowledge on to others. He can even perform miracles.Although this book has been widely praised and sold millions of copies, I had real difficulty in seeing why. It's not that it's well written or even very original. In fact, more than anything, it's just banal. What on earth is all the fuss about?By all means, go ahead and read this book. You won't be wasting much of your life.

It uses two fundamental motifs of Platonism. 1) The allegory of the cave. Jonathan has a lot in common with the liberated philosopher who manages to free himself from the narrow rules that enslave his peers; the character's vertiginous ascension towards another world mirrors the philosopher's efforts to contemplate Good itself; Jonathan's return to his people, late in the book, shows the necessity of going back into the cave to help the remaining prisoners. (Incidentally, Jonathan's isolation and the lack of understanding he faces throughout his quest is akin to Plato's description of the philosopher in many of his dialogues.) Another key Platonic motif used by R. Bach is 2) the relation between the Idea and its sensible copy. It can be seen in the notion of a True Seagull (the Idea of the Seagull) which serves as a model and guide to each and every particular seagull; their goal is to emulate this paradigm in their thoughts and actions.

Read this book and learn to fly..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull is much more than just a bird learning to fly. It's a story that teaches freedom, dedication, and desire. This story teaches people that there is more to life than what meets the eye. I would recommend this story to anyone who is struggling with decisions about what they want to do in life, or rather what they believe they can do with their life.I read this story at a good time in life. Right now I am trying to pick a career that's going to satisfy my needs and myself. Instead of doing something only for the money, since that's essential for life, I want to do something that I can wake up every morning and look forward to doing it. I thought about becoming a nurse but figured I wasn't smart enough to go into that. This story taught me to believe in myself and go for what I want. It doesn't matter if I think I can handle it or not because I can do anything I set my mind to.Like I said, I would recommend this story to anyone who is trying to decide where to go to college, what to major in, what sports to pursue, and other big decisions such as those. It's hard to explain the lesson to the story or the feeling you get when reading this story, you just need to read it and find out."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"A 30 years old classic book that still works, because the story is one that we can easily get into (You don't need to know about ancient history for example). The story of Jonathan is one we all can get attached to and we can learn from.Unlike other books of this kind (You know, learn more from yourself, self-betterment and all that) like &quot;The knight in rusty armor&quot;, the book doesn't seem like a disguised &quot;Learn to love youself&quot; book, it is a nice story, and it is left up to the reader to pick up what he wants. And by the way, I am in no way fan of the &quot;Self-betterment&quot; books, I actually don't find them interesting, but this book was WAY different....that above was comming from a 16 year old :) , have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book was in perfect condition, as stated in the description.

Growing up Gracefully is the theme of the Book with very good illustrated pic of Sea Gulls on the cover page. Captivating attention with this classic read, Richard Bach's fable Seagull named Jonathan Livingstone is an example that teaches about 'Flight' and capture the moments of love and kindness. Jonathan had a deep desire to soar high in the skies and hardly cared for eating like other seagulls. The message was to aim higher for a purpose in life even if its against the wishes of own people. Jonathan is courageous and in pursuit of excelling, he almost has to leave his flock and experience learning with wise seagull who taught him perfect speed. It's the art of perfection one develops keeping the spirits alive as one rise up aiming higher in life. A good read and great message for taking Flights to achievement.

Instead he devotes himself to perfecting his flight, going higher and faster than any gull ever had before. He is eventually expelled from his flock, but continues his flight perfection. One day he is met by a pair of gulls who take him up to a 'heaven' where all gulls seek perfection.

As he works his way through all new types of flight, you begin to find hidden meanings that Richard Bach leaves for you.

People keep saying that this story is unrealistic because seagulls aren't intelligent enough to reach a state of perfectness, but this story isn't about birds.

READ IT!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Ideas, philosophy, and great writing fly through this book with the effortlessness of a seabird on an ocean breeze. Perhaps the crowning achievment of Richard Bach, as both a writer and philosopher, this book takes the reader on a journey into Self, through the questing form of a seagull whose spirit and faith know no bounds. In the gulls' journey through life we are given a message, a timeless message - that it is we, ourselves, who set our limits, or don't. Not really a childs book, but neither an adults, this is a book for those of us who have not yet adopted the mantle of cynicism and disbelief in possibility which defines the word and concept of &quot;limits&quot;. &quot;you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.&quot; Simple words of an author, or perhaps a seagull, but sometimes it it the simple things which do the most to set us free."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I once read a review of this book that said something along the lines of &quot;it is so vague that anyone from Hindu to Roman Catholic could find meaning in it.&quot; I agree whole-heartedly. This book contains so many mixed messages that anyone of any age at any time could find meaning in it. There is the admittance of a higher power (the Great Gull), and at the same time an extreme emphasis on the greatest importance of the self. Bach's tale of how the story came about(a voice in his head which dictated half the story to him then waited 11 years to dictate the rest) seems a little too far fetched for me. I think this book is a tiresome, low-vocabulary attempt at propheticism. If you're looking for meaningful allegories, go to your parent's book case and pick up a copy of THE LITTLE PRINCE...or create your own &quot;voices.&quot"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"All I can say about this book is what it has done for me.I read this book when I was 11 years old (I am now 29)andit definitely changed my way of viewing the world, the afterlife,and why we are here and born to this earth.

It's also a metaphor for life. It's a parable on the difference between existing and living; existing is easy, but to truly live is hard.The book is a joy to read once, but even more of a delight upon further examinations.

Within the pages of this novella, first published in 1970, the author takes the reader through an adventure in time and space and reality. The book is titled after the main character, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who desires to transcend the mundane chores of everyday life, and achieve greatness in flight, and accomplishment, and fortitude. It is an inspirational, and emotionally charged drama which will inspire each reader to aspire to their greatest potential."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"A fun little book, it's very short and you can probably read it in one toilet sitting. Jonathon Livingston Seagull is an allegorical tale about a seagull who becomes completely absorbed in the art of flying, he learns everything there is to know about it, and through the help of two birds he flies to a \`higher plane of existence'. There he meets a guru bird called Chiang who changes his perspective on life and helps him transcend time and space. Don't worry, I didn't ruin the book for you as it's not something you can ruin; it \`transcends' story and plot. It is a story about the depths of human (or seagull?) potential and is very worth the read. Hmm, \`very worth the read' doesn't sound quite right, oh well. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I wasn't sure where the author was leading me to in this book. I was kind of confused. I heard so much about it but was not impressed. I guess it just wasn't \\"my\\" kind of book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"No matter how many times I read this classic (and I read my first copy so many times the pages are falling out), it always moves me, it always motivates me, it always makes me want to soar - and, forty years after I first discovered it, at last it has. It has!I also have it on audio and hearing it in Bach's own voice makes me cry - really! It is that powerful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Wow, the story was inspirational and seemed to be centered around seeking the truth regardless of the consequences and leading others to the truth once one finds it. The story contains elements of unnoticed ambiguities that will go unnoticed, but the ambiguities are just enough for the reader to put them self in the story without realizing it. If you have a friend read it ask them what they thought about the book and they will get something different out of it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathon Livingston Seagull begins his story as an ordinary seagull that strives to be different, and thinks and sees beyond the ordinary cycle of survival of a seagull. This gull has a dream, and that dream is for something higher. I believe this is a good way to look at life, as we only have one, and may as well live it to the fullest and strive to reach our dreams with the time which we are given. Jonathon shows us that in order to reach these dreams, much hard work and dedication is required because those things most likely will not just come to you. In doing so and possibly achieving that dream, you may not be accepted by those who just live for survival. This is shown in Jonathon Livingston Seagull, as he is deemed \`Outcast' by the Flock.At this point in this story, Jonathon is forced to make a life-changing decision to either be an ordinary bird who is solely concerned with survival, or to leave the Flock in order to pursue his dream to fly higher and faster than any seagull ever known. Jonathon chooses to live as a loner and continue working towards his dream of flying. By making this decision to work hard and sacrifice the social group he had grown up around, he is soon rewarded by going to the next \\"level of life.\\" Jonathon considers this \\"next level\\" as Heaven, though that thought is shot down by other seagulls Jon comes into contact with, because Heaven is known as a place of complete perfection. This \\"next level\\" is really about becoming a new person, and continuing to learn, achieve, and grow.Religion is also very dominantly incorporated in Jonathon Livingston Seagull , as Jon is basically envisioned as a Jesus figure. Jonathon shows the reader that to reach the next \\"level of life,\\" you must help others achieve who don't know how to. Jon descends to a lower level of life back on the seashore he had been casted away from to teach other gulls to break away from the ordinary cycle of only being concerned with day-to-day survival. The gulls of the Flock, as expected, still refuse to listen to Jonathon and will not open up their minds to discover what is beyond their usual life's cycle. Because of this, Jon must find himself a \\"disciple.\\" Jonathon teaches his disciple to teach others to open their minds and follow their dreams, and at this, Jonathon Livingston Seagull's story comes to a close."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Where to start with this steaming pile of book? Well, it's about a seagull who doesn't like to catch food, preferring instead to spend his time perfecting his flying techniques. Right then and there I thought, can't he do both? I mean what's he doing while catching his food - walking? But that doesn't fit in with Richard Bach's simplistic story, sorry, \\"fable\\" because, ahem, he's a teacher. But for some reason this society of seagulls discourages flying for the sake of flying and Jonathan Seagull is cast out for doing loop the loops and whatnot for some reason.The \\"meaning of life\\" for Jonathan is apparently to fly fast. Yeah, simplistic right? But that's it. Jonathan talks about how much more there is to life but all he seems to conceive of this limitless horizon is to fly fast. Anyway.The second part of the book is where the book really shows it's age. It was published in 1970 so it was probably written in the tail end of the \`60s, and a lot of that pseudo-spiritual hippy crap winds up in Part 2. For example, the mystical seagull (a seagull!) teacher \\"Chiang\\" (has to be an eastern name right? That's where all the hippies were \\"learning\\" things in the \`60s), says \\"You will be ready to begin to fly up and know the meaning of kindness and love,\\" (p.55). So now Jonathan's quest for fast flight is about kindness and love? Groovy, man.And how about this for the most mind meltingly insipid expression of their pseudo-philosophy: \\"If our friendship depends on things like space and time, then when we finally overcome space and time, we've destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all we have left is Here. Overcome time, and all we have left is Now. And in the middle of Here and Now, don't you think that we might see each other once or twice?\\" (p.57). Riiiiiiiiiiiight.Part 2 is also the part where Jonathan learns how to travel across space and time and Christian values get mixed up with Buddhism ideas (reincarnation) before Part 3 borrows heavily from the Bible, essentially becoming nothing more than a pro-Christian recruiting tool. It's not even well written. Bad metaphors litter the pages, for example \\"His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even heavier on his back.\\" (p.11). Ergh. Sloppy writing like this fills the book.This ridiculously stupid book - book! It's 87 pages, most of which are black and white bland photos of gulls, followed by blank pages - it's more like a heavily padded short story! - is the least interesting, least wise, least knowledgeable story/fable I've ever read. Once you realise Bach is a pilot the metaphor of a seagull becomes quite transparent and all of that \\"live to fly\\" crap is just Bach's own philosophy of his life.\\"The most celebrated inspirational fable of our time\\" the cover boasts. Well, if this fable inspired you, you're either a simpleton or a child, or maybe a simple child, or even a Christian, because I couldn't find a shred of inspiration in this joke of a book. It's about as profound as a bowl of porridge. Steer clear of false prophets and their laughable attempts at literature, this book is just the worst."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I first read this title as a serial magazine story, in a flying periodical. As short as it is, the story was presented in four or five installments. Like most pilots I could fly forever without any other purpose than to \\"punch holes in the sky\\", so the book immediately struck a cord. My wife gave me the hard cover edition some years later, and I've reread it many times. The lesson to follow ones dreams is plane and up front. The fact that life is short is reflected in the length of the story. The presentation of bias to the point of segregation even violence is a lesson we all could learn, but as old as the story of Joseph's coat. I have been tempted to pass the story on to my grand children, but the denial of Heaven and with it God, would be in violation of everything in me that's Christian."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I first read this book while in college.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a seagull with ambitions to fly higher, faster and farther than a seagull is supposed to fly. As a consequence of his expressed ambitions, the gull leadership expels him from the flock. Disappointed but undeterred, he leaves but becomes a teacher to other gulls with similar ambitions. A large number of pictures of seagulls in action are used to press home the points.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is the personification of any human who has aspired to do break out of the herd and do great things that others consider \\"irresponsible.\\" Once shunned from the flock, he becomes the leader and educator of an alternative group that clearly will soar higher and further than the flock he was expelled from. It is a good lesson about life expressed in an unusual and entertaining manner."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Of all the countless, thousands of books I have read, &quot;Johathan Livingston Seagull&quot; is my number one favourite book. It is so much more than a simple story about a seagull who learns to spread his wings and fly. The book can have many individual interpretations, depending on how you relate to it, and to me that is the magical wonder of this beautiful, inspirational book. For each one of us, the book has its own personal meaning. To me, it is about personal freedom and having the courage to be the person you want to be; the freedom to become all that you were meant to be, not what someone else expects you to be. It is about spiritual freedom and how our fate on this Earth, and in whatever worlds may follow, is determined by the choices we make. As a parent, it is about learning to let go, for giving your children &quot;wings,&quot; is the greatest gift they will ever receive. By setting them free, when they are no longer yours to hold, you are giving them the freedom to grow and the dauntless courage, strength and independence to fly on their own in an uncertain world.I have read this book so many times throughout the years that the pages are dog-eared and worn.

And in many ways i owe my own life to it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is a classic, the comparison of animals to actual people and the things we do is incredible. It's a very spiritual book, it not only tells you to do your best, but also that you should connect with the things you can actually see on earth before you try to understand what you can't see. Richard Bach writes this book based on methaphors which in my opinion are used very wisely. It's a very short book, but it gets the point accross which is what a book or any publication should do."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I can't remember how I first heard about the existence of this book, but boy am I glad I found it. It was first published before I was born, but it's one of those classic books that will last for generations. Although it's incredibly simple (only about 90 pages, many of them featuring simple illustrations of seagulls), it's the content that shines. A beautiful, inspiring story of perseverance, determination, going for your dreams and being true to your heart. Don't let anyone tell you you CAN'T do what you dream of. Anything is possible, even the impossible.I don't know how widely distributed this book is, but I think it should be given to each and every child in school. It should be required reading. It's simple enough for children to read and comprehend. A truly beautiful little book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I read this little book in my late teens, and i never saw seagulls the same way again. I would always look to see whether a Jonathan Livingston was among them :)Years later i read a series of books, The Wave by Laura Knight Jadczyk, which reminded me of this one: perhaps all there is in life - and after this life - is lessons. And for some - people or seagulls - just eating and sleeping is not enough; they will always strive to learn the truth about themselves and the truth about life and its meaning, and about love.In the words of Bach: \\"...his own way of demonstrating love was to give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a chance to see truth for himself.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Many will pan this masterpiece by Richard Bach as fuzzy and warm. But it is Jonathan Livingston Seagull's simplicity which allows the book to be vulnerable in this respect. However, this vulnerability, this love, allows it to soar. It's message is so simple -- desire is everything -- and so immutable, that it reaches to beyond the heights of hman expeience.This book is on my friend Marcia Makepeace's ten favorite books. I agree. Jonathan Livingston Seagull has risen from its following in the 70's, to inspire another generation in the miracle of its message."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I loved it!

Jonathan Livingston Seagull embodies the principle of mind over matter. He inspires us to push ourselves into the realms where our dreams are in reach. I think the most important lesson that Jonathan offers is what he does with this knowledge of flight after achieving excellence. He gives it back to the community that had once cast him out. We can take Jonathan with us in whatever we endeavour.

He received great meaning from the book and I thought - as an 8 year-old - that it was just a stupid book. I remember not understanding the book very well as he read it to me but more so, not understanding why my father was reading a book to me. I didn't know how to respond, how to act, what to say as this strange man read a strange book to me. The book meant something to him but by the fact that he was reading it to an 8 year-old was proof that he was doing it for himself, not me. I couldn't wait until he finished so I could go watch \\"The Brady Bunch.\\"I revisited the book as an adult and still thought it was a ridiculous cliche and unoriginal in its story and execution. Perhaps my childhood memories tainted my adult view of the book (of course they did) but I think you can read the book now and wonder why it was considered so unique and groundbreaking in its time. I realize we can read books like \\"Seagull\\" and \\"I'm Okay, You're Okay\\" more than 30 years later and think they are absolutely moronic because many of us didn't grow up as adults in the 1960s and 70s.

It is pablum and shouldn't even be wasted on children."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"OK, so I admit upfront I am a cynic and didn't go into this with an \\"open mind\\".

What this teaches is that you can write a fairly disguised children's book, or steal the sermon from your local clergyman, add some out of focus black and white photos and make a fortune. THIS is what this book really teaches. I suppose since it was rejected by so many publishers before it was printed, attests to the theme of the book, keep trying no matter what other's say.It also is a not so thinly disguised New Testament in 52 pages. Not beingof the Christian persuasion, and an agnostic at best, I was offended by the Jesus story.....oh, it's about SEAGULLS, I see (gull).I have enough Christianity shoved down my gagging throat now by the media, the politicians in this America founded on separation of church and state.Keep your beliefs and strive to be different may be a nice philospohy, but the jails and unemployment offices are full of \\"independent thinkers\\".

It basically erects a facade of enlightenment on a way of life that is essentially childish and selfish - which is a reflection of the life lived by the man who wrote the book - a way of life that most people could not live unless Mom & Dad and/or the government and/or your deceived devotes were paying the bills while you were off at the ashram contemplating yourself.When I first read this back in the 1970's it was required reading from our hippy-dippy \\"humanities\\" teacher in high school.

So simple in fact that you wonder why the writer got paid for it. A seagull gets banished for flying wrong and then dies. But he comes back from the dead because freedom is the way to be, so he preaches the Buddhist-Christian gospel with the smug certainty of a kindegarten teacher.I admit that I did love this story once. It was kinda deep. Or at least my friends told me that it was deep. The problem is that it's not deep at all. It's trite and self-satisfied. It's one of those books that you love as a child but then you realize how condescending you got after you read it. Then you think about it years later after having learned more and you think back about how dumb you were to have been impressed.I give it an extra star because it is good to read once. I would have even given it three stars if it didn't have all the publicity and the hype and fanboys surrounding it. If you are expecting an amazing life changing book and you get a slim story instead it's bound to take down the ultimate joy of the whole endeavor. If I was expecting a nice little story, I would have enjoyed the final product better.One more word - I know that the pictures have been in from the original, but they are grainy blurry things that look like the author took a polaroid to a beach one day.

They are so &quot;feel good-sugar-coated&quot; that it is frightening to see how greatly our youth lacks an understanding for allegory and symbolism.

He is not afraid to be humble at all... and he is a very strong person (both physically and emotionally) And has a very high position, yet he is not afraid to be kind to people on a &quot;lower rung&quot;. He realizes you can be yourself and kind to others, while maintaining a strong character... NOW, did he get this philosophy from this book? No. He got it from Christianity...Yet, it intrigues me that at 30 years old, this book still influences him in subtle ways. And in fun ways...ie: Seeing the Gulls at the Shore, he leans toward me and says, &quot;that's Young Jonathan&quot; I'm going to read this book and find out about it.

But most importantly it shows us how to break free of the crowd and how we bless ourselves and the whole of creation by doing so.The greatest gift that you can give the world is to heal yourself.The story is short and yet so deep that you may never see the bottom, therefore it speaks to everyone on all levels.

It seems like a good idea to equate our universal human aspirations for greatness and uniqueness, with the whimsical trials and tribulations of a friendly, iconoclastic, renegade coastal pigeon. Through the inspiration of his example, (Jonathan, in case you're not with me just yet) we might too one day soar high above the flock, dare to glide outside societal norms and boundaries, challenge blind authority, stand strong in the face of the disapproval of one's peers, and ultimately like Jonathan, transmogrify ourselves into mega-achieving phenoms, who are not too busy with our daredevilry to spend a great deal of quality time doubling as inspirational coaches and gurus for a whole new generation of freshly-hatched oceanic avians... *whew* hold on, let me catch my breath for a second. I haven't waxed that sententious since reviewing \\"Harold, The Friendly Buddhist Beaver\\" late last year. There, that's better. Anyhoo, for me, in the course of reading this book, which incidentally took me approximately 39 minutes, I always felt like it was Richard Bach speaking to me, pretending he was Jonathan. And hey, I felt gypped! If I'm going to read the memoirs of a seagull, then by golly, I want to hear from the bird himself, not some human who wishes he were some sort of wing-ed beak-ed creature. Meanwhile, as I honestly wanted to like this book and come to care for the flying feather bundles therein, I felt there was not sufficient character development to learn to feel anything much for any of them. I did however learn to feel that Richard Bach is several light years away from being a substantial writer, although I'm sure he's a perfectly nice man when he's not comandeering some innocent typewriter, and using it to churn out more of this sort of cotton candy philosophy of his. In closing, I would like to address the subject of the book's photography. I was absolutely baffled by its mundaneness. I'm sure most of us agree that seagulls are very beautiful birds. Their antics are charming and they possess a great sense of grace, bravery, strength and even humor in their countenance. (I live by the ocean, trust me on this.) The photography in this book is decidedly \\"artsy\\" with many photos in black and white, and intentionally out-of-focus, blurry, and non-distinct. In my opinion, the text would have been far better served by photography which captured more of the natural beauty of this bird, both in flight and at rest.

I was forced to read this for my 10th grade english class. People claim that this book is actually about their lives. Obviously, since they don't even know Richard Bach, it's not.The story is about a seagull that likes to fly. He flies. The rest of the seagulls all hate him. He is banished. He flies some more. Then he meets a spirit gull, and becomes a hero to all other seagulls. He continues to fly.The problem with assigning this for high school reading, is that it takes up spots that a good book with redeeming value could be read. Students don't read outside of class, and if we continue to assign this sort of dribble, we will have a world of underread idiots trying to fly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is a worthless story about some stupid seagull who extricates himself from a group of mundane, materialistic seagulls in order to pursue a 'higher purpose'. He is then taught by equally stupid and like-minded seagulls about how to become stupider, until after much effort he finally reaches the level at which he can teach other gulls to be as stupid as he is. Lastly, Jonathan Livingston Seagull and friends, who are too good to collect food, abandon the less enlightened task of sustenance gathering and live off of the crumbs that idiots on the beaches throw to them. Unfortunately, due to their failure to migrate during the winter (because they began their journey by knowing that they had already arrived at their destination) when no one goes to the beach, they all starve to death (but the author fails to mention this fact, alluding to it only in a brief discourse towards the beginning of the story between Jonathan and his parents when the mother says \\"Why don't you eat? Jon, you are bone and feathers!\\" and the father warns him, \\"Winter isn't far away. Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep\\"). To top it off the book is written in a highly irritating style which is probably supposed to make everything seem ethereal but instead makes one feel as if they are in a delusional stupor.Make sure to buy this book so that the author and the publisher can reach their higher plane of existence by buying food and other banal necessities with your (possibly) hard-earned and now wasted money.

Bach spins a tale about a ordinary seagull who finds himself on an extraordinary spiritual journey. This book is a fascinating read, and Russell Munson's photography provides the perfect illustrations for the story. JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL remains one of my all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Of all the countless, thousands of books I have read, &quot;Johathan Livingston Seagull&quot; is my number one favourite book. It is so much more than a simple story about a seagull who learns to spread his wings and fly. The book can have many individual interpretations, depending on how you relate to it, and to me that is the magical wonder of this beautiful, inspirational book. For each one of us, the book has its own personal meaning. To me, it is about personal freedom and having the courage to be the person you want to be; the freedom to become all that you were meant to be, not what someone else expects you to be. It is about spiritual freedom and how our fate on this Earth, and in whatever worlds may follow, is determined by the choices we make. As a parent, it is about learning to let go, for giving your children &quot;wings,&quot; is the greatest gift they will ever receive. By setting them free, when they are no longer yours to hold, you are giving them the freedom to grow and the dauntless courage, strength and independence to fly on their own in an uncertain world.I have read this book so many times throughout the years that the pages are dog-eared and worn. The book is short, but the powerful lesson and message contained in these few pages is one many people never learn in an entire lifetime, no matter how many lifetimes they may live."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Chicken soup for this, chicken soup for that, chicken soup for the idiot-who-doesn't-want-to-think-for-themselves- soul. If you're as sick of this tripe as I am then you'd probaly enjoy this one.

I've been trying to move my life in THAT direction for some time so upon reading, I'm even more inspired to spread my wings and soar.....to transcend the imaginary restrictions we face in life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is Richard Bach's finest work. A simple story told with complex texture. The bird symbolizes the ineffable longings within humanity for a transcendental epiphany; a neon in the night of our stumblings; flash! I see! I hear! I fly! Valleys of failure and hills of hope are the topographic text through which the tale travels, and white-winged and wide are our stretchings towards self-actualization. This is a work of singular vision, aided by a slight editorial suggestion by me. Bach had just finished the final draft and we were sitting together on Santa Monica pier. Richard showed me the title and something just didn't seem to click. So I said, &quot;Rich, sure the bird idea's got legs, but Jonathan Livingston Turkey?? Take a hike along the beach and see what else you can come up with.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Sometimes I come to meet the force of tradition which is too terrible at least for me. I think that the more creative one should be -at least- protected &amp; given chances to realize his or her creative ideas as far as acceptable. But it is not so in my society just because such acceptances may result in the break of binding force of the long- lived tradition. Now I, who was very depressed at these situatios, have come to have courage that I will overcome all my difficulties till the days when I am good enough to love my surroundings."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"After I read this book, every time I saw a seagull I thought of Johnathan Livingston seagull and how even though his elders through great shame and dishonor toward him he didnt let that put him down and he still did the one thing he loved flying.

And a full 15 years to read & write English fairly well. That makes it around 1991. I picked up this book at a used book store in India when I was 16 years old. I was able to read it in under 30 minutes. But from then onwards I've bought at least 3 copies of this book and have read it umpteen number of times.The book had a huge impact in shaping my outlook to life, instilling and reinforcing my desire to be better at what I do [its quite another thing whether I was able to achieve it :)]. I guess its important that you have lofty goals. Aim for the stars may be you'll reach 100 feet into the air. May be you'll learn to fly - if not like Livingston Seagull - at least like his lousy flying brethern.Along with Ayn Rand, I'd rate Bach's this work at the very top of what one should read in one's formative years.I'm a Software Developer by profession and I at least once in a day think: It always works, when you know what you're doing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"God they say is a process.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is my role model. I feel that this story also helped me to develop strong charisma in my life.I strongly recommend this book for class readings for anyone with students age 12 or older. I am very thankful to my teacher, Mrs. Jimenez, for sharing this book with her class and me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book is metaphorical, simple, and very inspirational. Jonathan Livingston is a seagull who found it boring to crave for food and tried to fly in the sky, unlike his fellow earth-living seagulls. Jonathan was immediately proclaimed The Outcast and expelled from the Flock; he has been to Heaven and back; he had lots of followers in the end, and made his ideas of freedom popular. Jonathan Livingston overcame the contempt, social problems, and his nature of seagull for the sake of being able to follow his dreams.The book reflects the ideals of freedom; freedom of thought, of self-expression, and of dreaming is what keeps Jonathan going ahead. As every innovator, he must not be afraid of becoming an outcast - and he is not. In the end, he is rewarded with realization of his dreams of rapid flights.The book is somewhat simplistic; the idea is repeated in Gorkyi, Coelho, and many other inspirational writings. For that reason, many reviewers are lowering the rating. But simplistic does not necessarily mean primitive; most pieces of wisdom can be expressed very easily. Jonathan Livingston is a nice metaphor, and the book overall is a cute and inspirational reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I find more meaning to this great book every time I read it.

Several years later, I remembered the book as a good book about seagulls, but read it again on the recommendation of a friend. I was astounded at the wisdom that was written within the words to this simple story of a seagull learning how to fly. For me it is a magical and has taught me much of the path of life. I have read this book perhaps a dozen times now at various stages of my life, and each time it answers a question about my life that had been unanswered for some time. Of all of Bach's books, \\"Jonathon\\" is the most magical book for me, \\"Illusions\\" also touches a deep chord with its magical words from the \\"Handbook of Life\\". And \\"Bridge Across Forever\\" awakened in me a quest for a special soulmate to share this adventurous journey called life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"As a teen, I treated this story literally (imagine the look on my physics teacher's face when I told him I understood 'terminal velocity', because of a story about a seagull).Well, the physics lessons are long gone, but the true essence of Richard Bach's work lingers forever - namely, those of us who choose to fly where other would squat, who seek the clear unfettered skies rather than settle for the fish scraps, who dare to break away from the rank and file and forge their own path, are more likely to look back on their life and proudly say: &quot;This I Have Done.&quot;The Moral of this story is undoubtedly: &quot;Fly with the Eagles (in this case Seagulls), or scratch with the Chickens.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Being the 103rd reviewer of this wonderful book I do not think there is much more to say. However, I find something important missing from the other reviews (at least those I have read) and that is the notion of the &quot;liberation of desire&quot; as Sebastian Moore would say. I mean to say, we should be more open to realizing that the most important of Jonathan's characteristics was that he was the least affraid of learning ever... He trusted the mysteries of life. That was his source of courage to be an outcast."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Both my friend and former teacher had read this book and they both absolutely loved it. They said it was spiritual. I decided to check it out. I read the book in one hour and I couldn't put it down! It is such a motivational message wrapped up in a light-hearted story.

It is elegant by simplicity and not vague. Everything is said. It is not a book for children as well, although children have the ability to see the essence of it much better than adults.

Would recomend for anyone searching for an answer to what direction to take. Live in the moment and freedom is yours."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I read this book again recently - had a copy when it first came out that I gave away to a friend. It's one of those books that can help you to live in the here and now and to enjoy life simply by doing what you do best. Whether it's based on Buddhist or Christian ideas doesn't really matter, the story promotes the idea that each person (or seagull in this case) has a higher self - and it's important to let this higher self guide you to become a better person (or seagull). The central character, a seagull, is focused on flying perfectly, being totally in tune with himself and not distracted by greed, supremacy, belonging etc. It's a delightful tale, told simply with drawings of birds in flight, useful for those who get stressed out by the small things in life and need to learn about the bigger picture."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an easy read. Critics say trite, condescending, and literary drivel. I found the book fascinating. It is simply a short novella about growth. Growth as an individual, at times alone and at times with others. May I never stop learning and growing. The book is a hodgepodge of every philosophy at once while having no real tenets itself. It is not a religion. It came into pop culture at the end of the hippie era and the beginning of the leisure suit society. Although not the first, it does fit in with self help genre which ran rampant at that time. Richard Bach's personal life has no bearing on the positive message which is simple - Believe in yourself and your ability to overcome."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Literary EvaluationJonathon Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach is a fairly short but well written parable. The story concerns the main characters determination to perfect his flying skills. Not for selfish ambition or to dominate the flock but for the love of the knowledge. His banishment from his flock and through practice and learning his transition to a new level of existence where he also learns about love and forgiveness. It makes us consider the human condition. Are we just one of the flock or someone who is not afraid to take the path less traveled.The author relates a story in which he uses a flock of seagull as an example of the human group. Most of them have no particular ambition and because of that they are not particularly happy and spend their time squabbling and arguing with each other. \\"til a crowd of a thousand seagulls came to dodge and fight for bits of food.\\" Although written in 1970 we still face the same issues today. Are we someone that thinks independently and wants to learn and perfect our skills. \\"For most gulls it is not flying that mattered but eating.\\" But be careful, that independent line of thinking can get you into trouble. You may even be banished from your flock but maybe that's when your journey really begins.The author tells us that if you dedicate yourself to a task it will lead to much greater things. Eventually you will wish to return to help those that your path to knowledge made you leave behind.Even 40 years after these words were written they still speak to the human conditions, now as they did then. \\" Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight- how to get from shore to food then back again.\\" The individual who thinks differently is often marked as a trouble maker. Bach tries to explain to us that this can be why individuals are held back from doing extraordinary things. \\"Why, Jon, why? His mother asked. Why is it so hard to be like the rest of the flock\\" So the inability to achieve extraordinary things is simply a mindset. Sometimes the dogmatic thinking of the group is impossible to change, at least initially.The story tells us of the inertia of the group, but also how some individuals find a better world through the perfection of knowledge, love and forgiveness. Although the story is short, like a Japanese brush painting, a few carefully placed strokes can make a beautiful picture."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Ever have one of those days where something pops into your head, a distant memory of something you did once years ago that you suddenly recall as if it were yesterday? Well that's what happened to me recently when, for whatever reason, the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull came to mind. I had read it in 6th grade or so, and recalled the soaring tales of Jonathan Seagull and the life lessons taught through Bach's words. So I bought the book, had it shipped to my home, and read it in one quick sitting. I'd long since forgotten the intricate details expressed in this little book that packs a mighty message of self-confidence, the will and courage to be oneself, not being afraid to express who we really are, and importantly embracing even those who reject us. What a lovely book, as relevant to me now that I'm in my late 40's, as it once was when I was an 11 year old."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I was so happy to find both the book and the soundtrack.

The author casts beautiful imagery in one's mind while simply stating his message. As for the message itself, it is lovely. Maybe not the be all and end all of philosophy, but fulfilling and inspiring. Maybe if I had read it in the 70s I would have got more out of it.

It was about a Flock of seagulls that they thought that the only reason to even live was to fly for food to survive. Jonathan Livingston Seagull was the only gull in the Flock that thought otherwise. Jonathan wouldn't stay with the Flock. All that he wanted to do was fly. Everyday, day after day, he would practice flying. His instructor, Sullivan, taught him new things everyday. Jonathan then went a step further, he went for speed. When Jonathan was practicing speed, he came upon a shoreline where he met Elder Seagull. Elder was the fastest seagull and no one has ever been able to beat him, until he showed Jonathan his trick. Do you think that Jonathan learned how, or did he just walk away from Elder Seagull? I liked this book because it was very interesting. Jonathan Livingston Seagull was an Outcast and wasn't like all the others. He kind of went his own way,and what the others did didn't matter to him.

The photography in this book is a great addition and really makes you feel the story. Writing about the book doesn't give it justice. You need to read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is possibly my all-time favorite. It combines two subjects which I absolutely love! Seagulls and the search for enlightenment. I recommend this book to anyone who can read, and to those who don't posess that gift, I recommend either buying the Tapes, or getting somebody else to read it to you. I am planning on purchasing a large number of these books as gifts for both friends and strangers as soon as I get some extra cash. Read it!

May we all become enlightened like Jonathon Livingston Seagull."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This simple yet deep story brings together a wonderful spiritual message with the advanced research of physics and energy work. Timelessness, spacelessness, and the vibration of the human energy field are central to Eastern spiritual traditions and to advanced Western science. Bach weaved these together in a unique fashion and thus, the allegory can be understood on many levels - hopefully you will see this. Let your curiosity be piqued and try not to overlook the human potential to transcend the physical existence. Indeed, this is what being fully human means. As for the simple spiritual level and lessons, his words resonated deeply."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I first read this book when I was about eleven, and it's been one of my favorites ever since. It's a true classic, one that you can read over and over and over again, and never get tired of, and find new insights and nuances in it. Now every seagull is an incarnation of Jonathan to me. And there is a film of it as well! I didn't get to see that until it was out on video, but it was well worth the wait. I cry every time I see it--not because it's sad, but the photography is SO BEAUTIFUL!! Especially when coupled with Neil Diamond exquisite songs. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"After reading the book, one thing has become pretty clear in my mind. we are not here for mere earning our bread and butter. Life is all about exploring new heights, think about them till you reel under the pressure, dream about them and nurture them. It also tells us that to follow freely the promptings of heart, one must not conceal from oneself that life is coarse and ruthless in its own wayward course. The book is a bid to rekindle the sleeping Jonathan Livingston Seagull in us. Thru the seagull, the author explains us and takes us to the finer nuances of life. What does a man need, we always think. Bread, Butter and a bed to sleep on. NO, you will know after reading the book. There is much more to life than getting these things. You don't have to simply live for them. How about bringing a pose of roses for your beloved from the stiff cliffs of Alpine, when roses are out of season. This book will teach and prompt you to do that.

The characters were seagulls and the main characters were Jonathan and Fletcher. The main setting was by a coastline. It was three parts long. The book was about a seagull that was concentrating more on flying than eating, which seagulls are supposed to do. He didn't listen though. He kept flying and flying. He was later taken away from the flock and lead to the cliffs. There he met the best seagull. He taught Jonathan everything. My favorite part was when he learned to fly in the past and future. I think you would like this book because it seems pretty real.By Edward Ryan, Jr. Age 8"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Less than an hour, no guilt, and you feel really good when you're done (unless you don't get it. Try again in a couple years). I've probably read it fifty times.

Jonathan is a seagull who strives to perfect himself, unlike the rest of the seagulls who mock him for this action. It was very obvious to me that this is life in general. We try to improve ourselves but are often discouraged because we have been looked down upon for it by others who are insecure. We need to become like Jonathan and find the strength to brush off the hands that hold us down, and live at the best of our abilites and perfect what we can.

Every sentence has a special and important meaning. There is no word useless in this book. Analysing the Story about &quot;Jonathan&quot; makes you think a lot. You would never imagine that this book was written by a pilot, as there are so few technical expressions. The book is much more about how to behave in group that doesn't allow any change. Jonathan is different than the other Seagulls. He wants to achieve something, he wants to reach the limits and break them. He doesn't care about the normal life (eating, flying in the flock). Jonathan wants to convice the other gulls that there is more to live for. The book is very symbolic. You can profit a lot when you compare the achievements of Jonathan with our human goals in life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book Jonathan Livingston seagull was about a seagull that wanted to be better than the rest of the flock.The main character in the book was Jonathan. The story started when he thought he was a limited seagull but he kept trying to fly fast and finally he went 140 mph (miles per hour ) at 2,000 feet and it was under control! Then he thought how fast he would go at 5,000 feet. At 5,000 feet he went 214 mph (miles per hour ) the second time he went up to 5,000 feet he went 250 mph.When he went up to 8,000 feet and he learned to role, twist and curve and by that night he was so dizzy! The next morning the flock had a meeting and they called Jonathan to the center of the circle, and only honored gulls got to go in the center of the circle but when they called Jonathan to come to the center of the circle they said \\"Jonathan come to the center of shame\\" and they all laughed.Jonathan was always trying new things for a example, he was always trying to fly the fastest. He would fly up to a height of 2,000 feet fold back his wing and fly on his wing tips and then drops straight down reaching speeds up to 230 mph (miles per hour ). He taught eight other seagulls about the beauty of flying he also taught them how to fly really fast. Jonathan was special because he thought no one had limits.I liked Jonathan Livingston seagull because he thought no one had limits and I think that is true!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I first read this thin book with lots of black and white photos of flying seagulls at age 18, while taking a break from my intensive preparations for my &quot;A' level exams in the school library.It turned out to give me much more than a break: It set my spirits soaring as I read and identified with Jonathan for being so enthralled in doing what he loves doing that he &quot;forgets&quot; everything else. The other seagulls &quot;flew to eat&quot; while he &quot;ate to fly&quot;. In a way, Jonathan is symbolic of people who &quot;live to learn&quot; while many others merely &quot;learn to live&quot;.Since then, I've re-read this book two or three times at different ages - in my twenties and more recently, in my thirties.

Just reach out and read and read it all your life. The best part of this book is its simplicity of presentation."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This slender classic about a seagull who stretches the limits of Flight reads as fresh and emotionally exhilarating as when it first appeared. Disdaining the mundane existence of most gulls--who follow the garbage trails of men--Jonathan dreams of rising above such a demeaning lifestyle, on both aerodynamic and spiritual planes. He boldly pushes his body to perform increasingly difficult stunts, to achieve undreamed of aerial precision and velocity. Until he is callously ostracized for his achievements.We admire Jonathan's quest for excellence, his willingness to sacrifice everything in his noble pursuit of raising seagfull consciousness. To FLY for the sheer joy of it, to grow in wisdom, to chafe at any limitation of the spirit, to experience the ultimate in seagullness--to meet and perhaps briefly be one with the Great Gull.Beneath the surface of this seemingly simple tale of a gull, who literally rises above his own kind, lie themes clearly reflecting the 60's: civil disobedience for a worthy cause, social ostracism, the personal dignity of the sentient individual, refusal to accept the standard restrictions of life as imposed by Society. Bach presents philosophical gymnastics worthy of a seagull's Shangri-La; he includes Christian overtones and ideas of global spirituality as well.JLS proves a teacher of teachers both in Flight and Compasion, but could he really be the only son of the Great Gull? (The movie with Neil Diamond's moving score is a multi-dimensional treat, but read the book first.) Timeless enchantment!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Beautiful book. I bought the Jonathan Livingston LP as well. (found it at a garage sale for 2 bucks.) A good book to pick you up, almost like the opposite of a Dilbert book.

Follows along the same philosophy of being able to free your mind. Just don't take the book to literally, it is more of a figurative book.Have fun with the book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is outstanding. Richard Bach surely is to be recommended for his classic novel. He tells the reader about true human nature that is completely true in this world's setting. The Flock symbolizes having no freedom of mind but that you folllow the paths of those who came before you. Their veiws may not always be right. The boook goes much deeper than words.This book is a well spent time of reading"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"It's really amazing that this book, published in 1970, got onto the top sellers of all time list. It is barely 127 pages long - and that includes many pages of seagull photos, with very few words per page. The margins are very large :) It's a story about a seagull who, unlike his comrades, is not happy yelling \\"Mine! Mine! Mine!\\" for food. He loves to soar, and fly. He faces rejection and ridicule for his quest for greater heights. And of course, he inspires all of us to reach for our goals.So first, obviously this book is REALLY short. I just re-read it and, without racing at all, I was done in 16 minutes. It's very short. There aren't long, drawn out characterizations here. Jonathan learns to fly well in about 2 pages, and by page 31 he is fully aware of all of his skills. By page 57 he in \\"Heaven\\" - or at least in another stage of life in with like-minded seagulls, speaking with telepathy. Chiang is the elder there who tells Jonathan that there actually is no Heaven - that Heaven is the state of being perfect. Jonathan decides to return to Earth and help others. He spends a few pages teaching Fletcher his skills, and then vanishes, leaving Fletcher to teach the new seagull students how to fly. The story ends.Really, the story here is that Jonathan and Fletcher were not \\"special\\" in any way. The point is made many times that they were seagulls like any others. The difference is that they chose to strive to better themselves. They were not content to merely eat and sleep. They wanted to become really good at what they could do - fly. The elders explain that for many people, this process takes many lifetimes. If you do well in a given life, you graduate to a \\"higher\\" life where you can then work with people on your next stage of progress. If you just get by in your current life, then you get reborn into that same level, to have another chance to strive.So it's very interesting how different people have interpreted this book to be a religious tome. Christians often say that Jonathan stands for Jesus. He was born \\"with men\\" - he learns his special skills, and then he returns to earth to help guide mankind to be better. There's even a mob scene where the \\"normal seagulls\\" try to kill Jonathan for being different. On the other hand, the story clearly says there is no Heaven - that the point of life is to keep trying and trying until you figure out your own path to perfection. The reincarnation and perfection-from-within is very Buddhist. It's not an external God that gives you this perfection. You are born with the innate ability to attain perfection - but it is up to you to find the desire and take the steps to reach it.I've owned this book for many years and do enjoy it. But I do have to say that it is REALLY short and really basic. The whole Jonathan evolution is barely touched on. You don't get much sense of growth as he instantly goes from normal seagull to glowing Special Seagull. This is sort of a theological primer for those who don't normally read books on philosophy. There are many, many books out there that get into these sorts of topics in a far more meaningful way. But on the other hand, much as the Matrix series got many non-philosophy students to learn about some pretty basic philosophical ideas, this book also opened the door for many people on the ideas of striving for inner perfection. If you handed all of these people a complex tome on the topic, they probably wouldn't have read it. But maybe by getting that door opened, and that interest piqued, they then went forward and learned more. You have to get that interest started somewhere. If the interest came from a super-short, super easy to read, picture-filled booklet, does it really matter?On a personal note, I really do feel that people need to sit back and consider what they spend their hours each day doing. We only have one life - and most of us who can afford to buy books have an amazing wealth of luck that 90% of the world's population dreams of having. We have clothes, we have places to sleep, we have access to healthy food and water. It would be a wonderful thing if each of us spent even a portion of our day reaching out to help others, to help the world become a better place for us all to live in. We don't need to watch TV - there are other far more important things to do in life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"\\"Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight--how to get from shore to food and back again\\". \\"For most gulls it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.\\" That is what the author of this book says about the \\"hero\\" of this story, a seagull named Jonathan Livingston Seagull.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is different to the other gulls in his flock. He doesn't live to eat, but eats to live and pursue his passion: flight. But his search for perfection and speed doesn't endear him to the other seagulls, that eventually expel him from the flock for daring to be different. To know what happens afterwards, you will need to read this book, because I don't want to spoil the ending.The real question here, I guess, is whether you want to read a story about gulls... I mean, there are so many good books out there, why read a book about a bird?. The answer is simple: the story in \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" is a metaphor about things that can happen to you in real life. Have you ever felt tempted to do the same that everybody else, just for the sake of conformism?. Have you often felt like given up when something you really want to do demands too much work?. Just think about it...I believe that many of us are sometimes like most of the gulls in this book, and we need to learn the lessons that \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" gives us: the most important thing is to believe in ourselves, and always do our best without giving up.I would like to point out that some people say that this book is full of New Age ideas. I really don't think so. Okay, I certainly don't know much about those ideas, and I'm not interested enough to learn more about them. But in my opinion, we often find in a book what we want to find in it.For me, this is only a charming allegory with a very pertinent message: DON'T ABANDON YOUR DREAMS... For that reason, I recommend this book to you. And whether you read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" (English edition) or \\"Juan Salvador Gaviota\\" (Spanish edition), enjoy it !!!Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan I loved this book. Jonathan when he came back to help the birds on a lower level of spiritual development, is like, Michael in the book An Encounter With A Prophet, coming back to help Nathaniel. Their statements of truth seem rather hard to accept at first, even by those high flyers who want more than the \\"herd\\" or \\"the flock\\" are willing to blindly accept as truth."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"If there is anything that this book teaches, it is that we have the ability to change reality with the power of our own thoughts. This is one of those books that no matter how many times I read it, will never fail to amaze me. It's the kind of book that leaves you speechless, unable to do anything but think, and wonder.Presented in the form of a charming parable about a seagull's education in flight, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is about far more than the life of one seagull. It is about each and every one of us, struggling to find the answers, to reach something higher that we are not even yet aware of. We are all a little bit like Jonathan, and when we read Bach's story, we realize that we all have the same power inside. That we can do anything, be anything that we want, if only we can believe in ourselves. Bach's message is a powerful and timeless one that stretches across all barriers to reveal the simple truth that we all, at one time or another in our lives, knew: the most powerful force that exists is that of belief, especially in ourselves.I can't tell you exactly why you need to read this book. It's not about something as simple as plot or writing style. There is a rare magic in the words that cannot be conveyed by any other means than the experience of reading the book. All I can say is that once you read this book, you will understand."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"As a preface to my review, I would just like to say that as I looked at some others' reviews of this book, I found it interesting that almost every one of the 259 other reviews before mine either say that this was an amazing book that changed their life and made them understand the true meaning of things or say that it was a waste of time and is a load of 70's feel-good rubbish. This book did not change my life; the theme was fairly standard thinking and is easy to find in other books. However, I still found it an enjoyable quick read that was worth the short amount of time I spent on itJonathan Livingston Seagull is a story of a seagull who rebels against the traditional thinking of his kind: he flies for enjoyment and excitement, not just for food. This behavior is not tolerated by other seagulls, and he is banished from the flock. Throughout the rest of the book, he learns the true meaning of perfection and that what is most important is to always try your hardest.I would recommend this book to everybody. It is very short and should only take one to two hours for most people to read. If you are interested in philosophy and symbolism, you could study this book and find all sorts of hidden information; if not, it is still a good book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"He made me eager to yearn for learning and reaching my limit of learning. It is important for one to know his limits in order to improve them. Bach made me able to stretch my mind and to know my capabilities within some activities. It is not life that is unfair. It is us who are unfair to ourselves. We limit our potential to what is tangible, realistic and reachable. It is the fear of failure. The fear of disappointment. If we manage to break these limits, we impose on our ambitions and capabilities, we will reach a higher level of life. We will know what is the real life we really want to live. By exploring what we don not know, we can learn new things and actually realize who we really are. We can't be parts of others who we know. We will be parts of people we want to acquire parts from. he idea of perfection is too far from our thoughts. Perfection, like any other thing is there. We just need to go up and find it.

It's very easy to read and doesn't even take long to finish but the mark it leaves on your mind will never go away. It's a story that will actually make you feel safer about life itself and confident in whatever you're pursuing. This story could change someone's life around and make them believe what's impossible can be possible. If your in a situation where you feel everyone is against you this book will show that even though they're not with you there may be people out there like you but they're just waiting for someone to step up. This is truly a story that everyone should read and with all of the stories schools force on kids why isn't Jonathan Livingston Seagull one of them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"As a child I found this a riveting book. It revealed to me the possibility of being other than what I was. Upon reviewing this memory it has revealed that Jonathon Livingstone Seagull, against all odds, struggled for his own idea of perfection, and I applaud the author for his unique ingenuity in giving human attributes to a bird so that those wishing to go beyond the limiting social constraints can identify within themselves the architect of their constructs, and therefore bring about evolutionary change."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book is Richard Beak's finest work. A simple story told with complex texture, the bird symbolizes the ineffable longings within humanity for a transcendental epiphany; a neon in the night of our stumblings; flash! I see! I hear! I fly! Valleys of failure and hills of hope are the topographic text through which the tale travels, and white-winged and wide are our stretchings towards self-actualization. This is a work of singular vision, aided by a slight editorial suggestion by me. Beak had just finished the final draft and we were sitting together on Santa Monica pier, feeding bread to the gathering gulls. Hundreds of the wretched creatures, all squawking and pecking and flapping. It was like being in the centre of a feathery blizzard and we were covered in gull-goo and crumbs. Fearing for our lives and an exorbitant dry-cleaning bill, we decamped to the safety of a nearby bar. After a dozen or so fortifying flagons, Beak unwrapped the splattered manuscript and showed me the title. Something about it wasn't quite right, so I propped the stupefied scribbler back into his chair and said, \\"Richie, sure the bird idea's got legs, but Jonathan Livingston TURKEY? When those flocking gulls disappear, take a stumble along the beach and see what else you can come up with.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a novel about a seagull who wishes to improve himself and to be able to fly faster and better. He is expelled from his flock for this desire, so he continues to live life alone and establish his individuality. Jonathan struggles to reach perfection in his life by flying; this theme of striving for perfection is ever constant in his growth. The story is provocative and makes the reader think about his or her own life. I enjoyed this amazing precursor to the 70's, when people were striving to reach inside themselves to \\"find\\" themselves and be individuals. The novel by Richard Bach is full of great metaphors that can be interpreted by the reader in many different ways depending on his or her point of view. This book can be about anything you want it to be. It can be about life in general, a day in your life, a job, a goal, or almost anything. It's about making happen that which is important to you; its about making a commitment to accomplish your goal so you stick to it no matter what. In Bach's own interpretation of the book he says, \\"Find out what you love to do and do your darndest to make it happen.\\" He also says the book was the result of a series of visions; that he really didn't write it by himself, leading one to realize the book is open to interpretation. Setting and accomplishing your own goals and deciding on your own destiny is socially significant in any society; it is important to every individual. There really isn't much of a plot in this book, and most of it is set in the air. The whole story is a metaphor for rising to and meeting your goals, then setting higher goals. Jonathan tells his mother, \\"I don't mind being bones and feathers... I just want to know what I can and can't do in the air\\" (p.13-14). Once Jonathan reaches his peak, he is confronted by other gulls who tell him, \\"We are from your flock... we are your brothers...we've come to take you higher...One school has finished and it is time for another to begin\\" (p.53). As in life, we tend to reach a certain point where we are saturated with what is available and then we move on, to learn more in a new place. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a provocative story that induces the reader to contemplate life. It expresses the ability of an individual to succeed at his or her own goals with or without a group. It is an interesting book and \\"readers find themselves motivated and inspired by a book that reflects their desire for success, freedom, perfection, and love.\\" This simple story about an everyday creature is really a metaphor for life. Accomplish your goals and ambitions, then create new and higher ones. As Jonathan learns, \\"The gull sees farthest who flies highest\\" (p.86)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"What can I say of Jonathan Livingston Seagull that doesn't make me smile..From being referenced as Jonathan myself by family members to re-reading the book at every life milestone, this book has been a part of my life.It doesn't matter if you believe in idealism or realism.

We can challenge the status quo only if we believe in ourselves.Even if you have read this book before, try reading it again.

Miss Bock's class. Former nun. Pretty strict but very nice. One day when it was a little loud as we changed classes in our inner city school, she yelled at us; &quot;At East orange high School they may all be shooting heroin in the bathroom but at least it's quite in the hallways!&quot; Our assignment--read a book and build a diorama. You remember dioramas don't you? You take a shoe box, some construction paper &amp; some glue and you build a little scene inside of the box. Let's put it this way, I'm firmly convinced that my wife only wanted to have kids so that she could one day build dioramas with them.I, on the other hand, had no interest then, nor any now, in such projects. Racing through my fevered eleven year old's brain went various schemes and dodges to get out from under this burden. Sadly I did not have the kind of parents who were embarrassed by having me turn in woefully inadequate projects. Remember when your Cub Scout troop did Pinewood Derby and there were always those kids whose Dads had clearly built their car? In our troop we actually had two kids whose dads were Shop Teachers. The Derby cars they brought in could have been sold in stores. Meanwhile, my Father told me it would be a good learning experience if I built my own. The predictable result was that I produced this misshapen, day-glo green, bricklike car with the wheels accidentally glued into immobility. Suffice it to say, I was no challenge to the shop brats, but I did learn something: cheaters win. Absent any illicit parental assistance and devoid of the requisite personal motivation, I needed a really easy book and an extremely basic diorama scene. Thank you Richard Bach!I read mega-bestselling Jonathan Livingston Seagull--all of 127 pages with copious numbers of photographs. Then I took some blue construction paper and glued it into the bottom of the box, cut out the picture of a seagull from the cover of the book and glued it onto the blue background. Voila! Five minutes, project done. As you might intuit, Miss Bock was significantly less impressed by my ingenuity than I was. As I recall she took inordinate and sadistic pleasure in comparing my box to Mark Caldwell's Call of the Wild action scene, which included trees, snow, a moving dog and a little view portal like a binocular lens through which you viewed the scene.Returning to this book now, I feel compelled to defend my vision. The story of the book is almost ridiculously simple. A young seagull wants to learn to fly better. The elders of his flock inform him in no uncertain terms that a seagull only needs to fly well enough to feed himself, that flying is not the point of being a seagull. But Jonathan rebels against the proscribed ambitions of the other gulls; he yearns to explore the boundaries of flight. As he continues to test these limits, the Flock expels him, but eventually a group of younger gulls join him in his quest and together they transcend their seagullness. The message of the book is perhaps best expressed in the epigraph above and in a conversation between Jonathan and Elder Chiang:&quot;Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?&quot;The Elder smiled in the moonlight. &quot;You are learning again, Jonathan Seagull,&quot; he said.&quot;Well what happens from here? Where are we going? Is there no such place as heaven?&quot;&quot;No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is not a place, and it is not a time. Heaven is beingperfect.This dual message about freedom and the pursuit of perfection is simple but classic. In his own way, Jonathan fits easily within the mainstream of American Literature with heroes like Huck Finn (see Orrin's review), RP McMurphy (see Orrin's review), Cool Hand Luke and the rest. His quest to escape the limits accepted by the Flock is the quintessential quest of Western Man. And what image expresses Bach's allegorical notion better than a solitary seagull soaring? In retrospect, I think I deserved an A.This book is not particularly profound. It is sufficiently ambiguous that different readers will focus on different aspects of the story and take away different messages. But there is something undeniably compelling about Bach's fundamental faith in the individual. It is an especially appropriate book for teens and even adolescents, but adults looking to kill an hour will enjoy it too. Heck, if you and your kid read it, you can build a diorama together afterwards.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is one of my all time favorite books.

It is so much more than a simple story about a seagull who learns to spread his wings and fly. The book can have many individual interpretations, depending on how you relate to it, and to me that is the magical wonder of this beautiful, inspirational book. For each one of us, the book has its own personal meaning. To me, it is about personal freedom and having the courage to be the person you want to be; the freedom to become all that you were meant to be, not what someone else expects you to be. It is about spiritual freedom and how our fate on this Earth, and in whatever worlds may follow, is determined by the choices we make. As a parent, it is about learning to let go, for giving your children &quot;wings,&quot; is the greatest gift they will ever receive. By setting them free when they are no longer yours to hold, you are giving them the freedom to grow, and the dauntless courage, strength and independence to fly on their own in an uncertain world, wherever the journey may take them.I have read this book so many times throughout the years that the pages are dog-eared and worn. The book is short, but the powerful lesson and message contained in these few pages is one many people never learn in an entire lifetime, no matter how many lifetimes they may live."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"'The Wall' rises up as a catalogue of man's solitary and free application of the existentialist's understanding. Sartre leaves no dark corner unlit in what could be considered his most biting renderings of the human condition's anguish in the face of meaninglessness.'The Wall' itself is an astoundingly suspenseful glimpse at the fine line between life and death, the insanity in ultimate human will-power, and the psychological effects of foreknowing one's own time of death.'The Room' is stark and vague. Interpretations abound, all from absurd (in itself) to Sartre's most profound writing. Nevertheless, the story's 'insanity' brings about many insights into the world of the individual of nothingness.'Erostratus' follows quite well, asking whether it is moral, immoral, right, or wrong, to kill and whether a modern man is truly free to commit conscious evil. Furthermore, it questions our modern society's knack for making celebrities of villains.'Intimacy' is a wonderful story with heavy-handed, deadbolt dialogue, well-crafted absurd heroes, and philosophical wit, wound up in a woman's tale of love, adultery, loyalty, friendship, impotence, and existence.Finally, 'The Childhood of a Leader' reveals the facist's facade of strength, the soft scar-tissue of their idealistic youth, the true childishness of their anti-semite reactions, and the way in which men allow themselves to follow or hunger to be followed."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"&quot;The Wall and other short stories&quot; is a triumph in literature. Each story explores the depths of human thought and reason through an existential point of view. Each story can be interpreted different by all readers, therefore making this a great book for discussion.&quot;The Wall&quot; is the first story presented. It consumes the reader because of its brilliant writing style. The story is narrated by a man named Pablo Ibbieta, who is in a jail cell with 2 others awaiting execution the following morning. Every event that transpires that particular night is analyzed almost too thoroughly thus leaving the reader in a trance. I wont get into it too deeply, but believe me, this story is worth reading...i guarentee it will have to be read again. After finishing the story, I felt as though nothing mattered. Who cares if the dishes were not washed, who cares if I would be late for work. Believe me, this story will have a profound impact on the way you think. Don't be surprised if you have a new appreciation for life. This story enlightens the mind.Another great story from this book is called &quot;Erostratus&quot;. Erostratus was a character who wanted to be famous, so he burned down the temple of Ephesus, which was one of the 7 wonders of the world. This is the central symbol of the story, the quest for glory. It also brings up an interesting point when the narrator asks one of his colleagues &quot;Who built Ephesus?&quot; and the colleauge did not know, he only knew who burned it. &quot;Erostratus&quot; in short is one mans decent into madness because of his quest to be remembered. The ending of &quot;Erostratus&quot; is filled with suspense and makes your heart beat in fear. It serves as a grim reminder that there are people of this type, and we should be prepared at any time for them to strike.There are also 3 other stories, that being &quot;The Room&quot;, &quot;Intimacy&quot;, and &quot;The Childhood of a Leader&quot;, which also draw the reader inside the workings of the mind through an existential window (ie: we are all here by accident, man is condemned to choose).In short, these stories are all perfect, and leave the reader with a feeling of enlightment. Sartre is an extremely intelligent and clever writer. This is evident in these short stories. So turn off the television, buy this book, and start questioning your existence, you owe it to yourself. Besides, they are short stories, so you will be able to get through at least one a day...that isnt much to ask considering the benefits you will reap by reading them."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"To the above comment, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus are two compeletly different writers. Of course their wittings are different. If you find that Sartre is not understandable you are not alone. But just take another look at the last story of The Wall called &quot;Childhood of a Leader.&quot; This story best explains Sartre's ideas, especially ideas of 'the other' and how we go about dealing with them. But each of the stories well represent his thought at least up until the 1950s. The book is really a good introduction to the theory of Jean-Paul Sartre."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"The wall gives the reader the chance to infuse into the consciousness of characters with, seemingly, absurd & extreme behaviors. The depiction of the inner world of these marginal people, rationalize their conduct by using some common humane themes like willingness to survive, fear, submission to power, altruism etc."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"indifference, neuroticism, dissidence...sartre's heroisms...read &quot;the wall&quot; and understood and conceptualized eminent death...i know &quot;erostratus&quot; only because sartre knew him...what i mean is that sartre wrote so descriptively and honestly, his readers feel his words..."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"Every literary work contains some sort of conflict, some struggle that drives the story forward. Usually this takes place in the form of conflict between individuals or between an individual and his\\\\her outer circumstances. In Sartre's works, the conflict takes place inwards, man fighting with himself, his preconceptions, his unmet expectations of how the world should be, and his bitterness of not succeeding in finding utopia.Sartre's fiction is psychological. The plot doesn't involve actions and situations so much, but inner thoughts and feelings. He masterfully exhibits how people's minds can play strange games on them, and how senseless people can sometimes be.This is high quality literature, with texture, rhythm, and much suspense, although most of the action takes place inside the protagonist's head. Now that's something only a master can achieve! The stories are also very interesting from a philosophical standpoint, and I would recommend the book to people who are either interested in this psychological, meditative type of literature that tracks the inner procedures of people's minds, or interested in Sartre's philosophy."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"What a phycological journey Sartre is presenting us in every little story of this book. Wow! All the stories are perfectly written. My favorite ones are \\"The Wall\\", \\"The room\\", and \\"Erostratus\\". I must admit though, I found \\"Intimacy\\" a bit hard to follow.I recommend this book to everyone who wanna read a unique piece of work of existentialism. You won't regret :)"},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"In fact \\"The wall\\" was one of the best stories in the book along with \\"Erostratus\\" where once more Sarte makes his claim on the proof of freedom, and how most of us tend to pretend we are not that free and crawl behind our available and yet limited choices."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"This particular work of J P Sartre should be ranked as one of the masterpieces in modern literature...The author used to possess a penetrating insight in the complex mind and behaviours of a modern human being...It is true that he analyses different reactions of any human mind on the basis of the doctrine of existentialism, of which he is one of the main proponents...However one should not look upon his judgement as biased as the celebrated basis of his philosophical doctrine, ie. \\"Existence should precede the essence \\" is really logical and highly optimistic as well as humanistic....All the five stories that are presented in this book bear the mature signature of an efficient interpreter of human mind along with it's anxieties and the decisions and choices taken at such critical moments,eg., when a man is condemned to die.....It seems the stories in this book imply that one should always consider those anxious moments,those contradictions that are constantly perturbing the man and only his response and choices that he make, ultimately defines him and give him a relative meaning in this otherwise meaningless world..I feel this book should be read by those who are aware of the divine futility of human life but still are optimistic about the triumph of human mind and creativity....."},{"Title":"The Wall And Other Stories","review":"Well I started reading this book because my favorite author is Camus and I thought Sartre wrote simular work. I was greatly mistaken. Though the stories I read from this book started off well, I didnt understand where he was going. They seemed to be morbid and perverted for no reason. In short: These stories take you on a terrifying emotional ride, and then leave you at the end feeling lost and empty."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 6: Best Of The Forties Book 2","review":"While the first volume of \\"The Best of the Forties\\" concentrated on presenting the first appearances of Archie and the rest of the gang, the second volume is strictly slapstick. All of the stories from this volume are reprinted from Laugh Comics while the first re-printed stories from Pep, and Archie comics. The girls take a bit of a back seat in these dozen stories as Jughead becomes the main co-star. Even Mr. Andrews gets more strip time than Betty and Veronica. The stories are more slapstick, than other Archie stories relying on a lot of physical humor. While maybe not as historically important as the one in volume one, these stories present a side of Archie rarely seen by us baby boomers who were so used to adventures centered on Riverdale High and the ongoing love triangle. In this regard, the stories are less time-sensitive and could easily be dropped into modern times as references to current events of the 40's are kept to a bare minimum.Among my favorite stories are:\\"Mr. Blunk Comes to Town\\" from Laugh #21. Archie's dad is, of course, a real estate agent and a man named Mr. Blunk comes to town to buy a seemingly worthless plot of land. Unfortunately, Archie takes the contract out on his date by mistake. Through a series of car breakdowns and other mishaps, Mr. Andrews and Archie keep missing each other which turns out to be a good thing as Mr. Andrews soon learns that oil was found on the land and Blunk knew about it all along!\\"Go Fly a Kite\\" from Laugh #23. Archie and Jughead are trying to build a kite and their racket disturbs their fathers. Soon Mr. Andrew and Mr. Jones take over building the kite with disastrous results.\\"Double Trouble\\" From Laugh #25. Archie wonders why the new girl in school, Alice Adams changes from nice to mean to him at the drop of a hat. What Archie doesn't know is that the girls are twins!\\"It's a Dog's Life\\" from Laugh #27. Archie and Jughead agree to bathe Veronica's dog. Jughead grabs hair remover instead of shampoo by mistake resulting in a hairless pooch right before the big dog show!\\"Lady Killer\\" from Laugh #28. Archie decides to start an escort service to earn some extra money. He doesn't want to be recognized as a kid so wears a beard and dark hair to disguise himself. His first customer named \\"Peaches\\" turns out to be Miss Grundy! The pair go out to a nightclub and Archie has to dodge Reggie and Veronica who are there as well.\\"Nature Boy\\" from Laugh #36. Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica go out on a picnic and in wild slapstick fashion, virtually everything goes wrong from Jughead smashing a cake, to Archie burning the burgers, Betty and Veronica sitting in poison ivy, and Jughead playing with a skunk!While maybe not as historically important, these stories were very funny and a change to those of us who only knew Archie from the 60's and 70's."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 6: Best Of The Forties Book 2","review":"Not quite as fresh as the previous volume - &quot;Archie Americana: Best of the Forties, Book 1,&quot; but still a must read for the die-hard Archie afficionado. While Book 1 was lovingly crafted to showcase material with historic value (e.g. - the first appearance of key characters, locations, etc.), Book 2 comes across a bit more lightweight in comparison as the stories seem selected more for the zaniness of its humor and the timeframe that the stories were selected from (1946-1949) seems somewhat narrower. Still, this being Archie comics and all, it still manages to be an enjoyable read all the way through, but do make sure that you read/purchase Book 1 first."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 6: Best Of The Forties Book 2","review":"That is all that I have to say...

Good color, okay story selection, you get to know Mr. Andrews, his father."},{"Title":"The Growth of Southern Civilization, 1790-1860","review":"There are numerous interpretations on the nature of the South and southern sectionalism. In The Growth of Southern Civilization (1961) Clement Eaton sees the ante-bellum South as a multi-faceted region and seeks to present a federalism of cultures. Eaton describes not only slavery and plantation society, but also the Creoles of Louisiana, the middle class, the business class, town dwellers, and the southern mind in 1860. His approach is to record observations on the South and to reveal the humanity of the people of the ante-bellum period.When considering the conflict and differences between North and South, Eaton asserts that southerners were shortsighted in permitting the Republican Party to define the issue between the two sections as slavery extension and thus win for itself a moral advantage. It was unrealistic statesmanship for southerners to insist on extending slavery into a region where it did not fit the needs of the people. The majority of northerners probably did not understand the economics of slavery and the unlikelihood of its expansion into the West. Finally, by 1860 the South was differentiated from the North more by the character of its upper class than by the qualities of its great middle class, the yeoman farmers.Eaton maintains that there was not one South but many souths. Also, the southern mind displayed many facets. According to Eaton, no single theme explains the complex society below the Mason-Dixon Line. However, defense of the institution of slavery tended to unify the heterogeneous elements of southern society. Thus, Eaton presents the South as a diverse region but unified in the defense of slavery."},{"Title":"The Land of the Pink Pearl","review":"The content is without question five star, however the fact that there is no copyright on the original material means that a number of persons have done their own variation of it. Amazon sells three versions of this work. This one has some alterations to the original work to try to make it a little more consistent with his knowledge of the Bahamas, mostly wording. Sealey has has also corrected some proof errors in the original and done some other editing. My complaint is that it is simply too expensive. Buy the other versions on Amazon they are less costly.

It is biblical scholarship at its finest for those of us who want to turn to the bible not to use it to hurt and polarize but to use it to find understanding and, yes, comfort in the pain of our personal and community lives. Lamentations gives us more questions than answers and it maddenly \\"doesn't make everything better\\" in the final verses of the fifth chapter. Instead it gives us, as Dr. O'Connor points out, a beautiful, very intelligent design on the suffering and hopelessness of the human condition. Even though the narrator, Woman of Zion, the strongman, and the people cried out on the destruction of their city in the 8th century BCE we can empathize and learn from their pain. Dr. O'Connor has given us a gift to reexamine this text and food for thought as we look at the pain and suffering in our contemporary world where God seems silent and work as a community to provide comfort."},{"Title":"Lamentations and the Tears of the World","review":"As a Christian studying trauma and recovery there seem to be few mainstream theologies that can hold the depth of pain and death that survivors of trauma experience, which is needed for true healing to happen. Through O'Connors work on Lamentations we now have a picture of who God is and where God is in the midst of suffering. We see a God that values human experience and honors our suffering as sacred space. We are commissioned as the church to look at our own suffering so we can therefore be a witness for the suffering of others, and in that mutually find life. She weaves together thoughtful, intelligent Biblical scholarship with sound psychological understanding (referencing Dr. Judith Herman, leader in the field of trauma recovery)and a healthy, honest, unapologetic view on what it means to be human. To this end I am so grateful."},{"Title":"Lamentations and the Tears of the World","review":"I changed Dr. O'Connor's title to include what I strongly felt and believed as I peruse the first few chapters and her closing &quot;Theological Betweeness&quot; Summary.

Early reading her inspiring exposition...I was taken-up with her explicit combining of the depths of literary and psychological and theological themes discovered in Lamentations!When she described Lamentations as a short book of five poems, &quot;that expresses with searing clarity their fear, grief, and despair,&quot; I quickly remembered three families of professional friends who were all facing those same personal sufferings. She clearly articulates those issues which most of us faced in CPE!Her calling the book &quot;an artistic jewel, a theological enigma, and a courageous act of survival&quot;...leads to the rich metaphoric poetry which is able to embrace the sorrows of the world!Her summary begins: &quot;Lamentations is a theological watershed, an in-between place where the old theology of a punishing God no longer holds...&quot; Yet God's voice is largely missing from these poems and is not heard.

The fictional towns of Monkton and Blight must lie somewhere between New Haven and Boston. But there's so much snow that it's really hard to tell.Asey is vacationing in Jamaica when he gets three odd telegrams from Bill Porter, his old boss. On a whim, Bill made a $50,000 bet with fellow Hybrid Club member Harper Dixon that Asey could solve Dixon's Aunt Eugenia's grocery order. What? Yeah, Bill's wife Betsey doesn't quite understand it either. Asey finally pays attention to the call to head north. He tracks down Harper Dixon in the Monkton-Blight area, in the midst of a snowstorm. Asey and a ragtag group of stranded winter guests make their way to Harper's home, where they are lured inside and then promptly locked into a bathroom. When they emerge, they discover Charlotte Babb dead in her bedroom, facedown in a wash bowl. The poor woman must have had a heart attack while shampooing her hair. But wait! She's wearing a brand-new dress; she just had her nails done; and the containers around the bowl aren't the ones that she would be using if she were doing her hair. Yup, it looks as if she's been murdered. Drowned, as a matter of fact. And with many of the prime guests/suspects having decent alibis (having just been locked up with Asey), this case will take some doing to solve. You know what they say: \\"Out of order, comes chaos.\\"Unlike his previous investigations, Asey is not only out of his geographic element, he's also flying solo, for the most part. Here he has no positively innocent and neutral woman to help him puzzle out the situation. Sure, Betsey Porter drives in after a few days. But Asey uses her as a baby-sitter for Leon Sparks, a spirited local youth who keeps getting in the way and tells lies at the drop of a hat. There's Gerty McKeen, the hairdresser. But she seems to have an odd soft spot for Harper Dixon. And if anyone should be the number one suspect in this crime, it's Harper, what with that weird bet and all. But rest assured, Asey will get to the bottom of the matter. \\"[W]hen you got a lot of things massed together inside a circle, the usual an' proper way to get order is to start in the middle or round the edges, an' make a b'ginnin'. It's dawnin' on me this mess inside this p'ticular circle ain't even orderly enough for that. So I'm startin' from the outside.\\" And eventually, he figures out what really happened and how Aunt Eugenia and her grocery order really do fit into the mix.This installment is a bit more tedious to plod through than others in the series. There's a lot of snow, and there are a variety of guests. And for long periods of time, the investigation doesn't seem to go anywhere. But the finale and the resolution are good. It just takes some slogging along to get there. This book will still provide interesting reading for mystery lovers who are fond of the 1930s."},{"Title":"Out of Order (An Asey Mayo Mystery)","review":"First published in 1936, Asey Mayo-- the Codfish Sherlock as the author refers to him in other books in the series-- has dropped quite a bit of his Cape Cod dialect and is wintering in Jamaica-- bless his little pea pickin' heart. However, he is called back to New England in the middle of a February blizzard when he receives a long, incomprehensible cable from Bill Porter, scion of the Porter Motor Company Porters-- those who have met Asey before may remember that Asey drives a 16 value Porter roadster in some of the other books.Bill, you see, has an old college enemy-- a hard drinking, hard smoking, villainous looking fellow named Harper who lost the Big Game for them in college by running the wrong way with the ball into the other team's end zone. On the anniversary of that date Harper and Bill always get in a fight. But this year Bill is determined to end the tradition-- that is until Harper insults Asey's detecting ability-- Bill ends up involved with a bet of $50,000 that Asey can solve the mystery of a grocery list made out a year before by Harper's deceased aunt.However, the mystery that absorbs Asey is the murder of Harper's other aunt under very unusual circumstances. Once again character development and plot lose out to the biggest mess of red herrings that this reader has ever encountered. Figuring out who did it wasn't that hard having read a few other books by the author, but how it was done gives the deducting part of the brain a bit of workout.Again if you like puzzle mysteries--"},{"Title":"Gardens in Winter","review":"Southern garden readers are probably familiar with Elizabeth Lawrence, who published the classic &quot;A Southern Garden&quot; in 1942. She was the first woman to receive a degree in landscape architecture from the North Carolina State College School of Design and her books and newspaper columns chronicled her experiences growing plants in her gardens in Raleigh, North Carolina and later, Charlotte, North Carolina.Lawrence was obsessive about dates and she kept meticulous notes recording the earliest and latest bloom dates for every plant she grew. She was also an enthusiastic correspondent with other gardeners throughout the United States and she was eager to learn what was blooming in other parts of the country so that she could compare them with plants in her own garden. Among the many correspondents that she quotes often in her books are Mr. Kippendorf (Lawrence was the epitomy of a genteel southern lady and always addresses everyone as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Mrs.), a man who grew thousands of bulbs on his Ohio property, and Caroline Dormon, a Louisiana gardener who also did the line drawings for this book. Lawrence was also fond of E.A. Bowles, the English gardener who published several gardening classics and she quotes him often in this book.Lawrence's writing however is not just a chronology of bloom dates. She was a gifted writer and her descriptions of colors, nature, birds in her garden and the seasonal changes are wonderful. Her writing is pure enchantment and her enthusiasm is contagious. Her books are great for winter reading as well as a good reference source throughout the year (her &quot;Southern Garden&quot; includes her records for bloom dates in her garden). This book, &quot;Gardens in Winter&quot; begins in November and stretches through Feb. 14, when she says that spring begins in her garden. She writes about all types of plants but camellias, bulbs, hollies and viburnums are discussed at lenghth. Above all, Lawrence proves to the reader that the southern garden is anything but dead during the winter months."},{"Title":"Gardens in Winter","review":"This out of print book was delivered quickly, inexpensive and most appreciated.

And I forced myself to stick with it and finish it, even though I found it very difficult to do. It was only 205 pages... you would think I would have finished it in no time, but it took me weeks, mostly because I really wasn't enjoying it.Li-Young Lee is a poet whose work I have respected and often loved. This memoir is, however, written as many of his poems are, moving back and forth between memory, dream, imagination and symbol so fluidly that it can be, at times, excruciatingly difficult to follow.Still, high minded and poetic as I am, I was determined to love even this about the book. But, truth be told, I did not. Some passages were so unusual they just became nonsensical. Interspersed with indecipherable, dreamlike ramblings, were passages of more typical biographical storytelling, which were often wonderful and were the only parts that kept me hanging on, trying to make sense of this book. There were passages I truly loved. Clearly, the author has a story to tell. His life is very interesting and I wanted to know and understand what shaped him. The thrust of much of his writing seems to be trying to make sense of who he is in relation to who his father was, and the tragedies his family endured. This book is no different. But ultimately, for me, the book did not succeed. I really wish that the story could have been told in a more chronological, harmonious whole. A few poetic tangents could have been tolerated. However, it felt as if much of the book was written from some semi lucid state that left me lost and confused. It is rare for me to bother finishing a book and not give it a higher rating but I'm afraid it would be a rare person I would recommend this book to, and then with only with hesitation and qualifications."},{"Title":"The Winged Seed: A Remembrance","review":"Impressive impressionistic poetic memoir, powwerful and free, obviously not for everyone especially english instructors."},{"Title":"The Winged Seed: A Remembrance","review":"a very personal look in a rather unusal life of the author."},{"Title":"The Winged Seed: A Remembrance","review":"love it as you would a sleepless nite of rain and poetry one and the same.leaving a small imprint, claire"},{"Title":"First Lady","review":"It was always going to be hard to follow the action and drama of the vastly popular Madam President. The characters of Devlyn Marlowe and Lauren Strayer have a multitude of fans, and Blayne Cooper and T Novan faced a great challenge in extending their story into a second book. But in First Lady, Cooper and Novan give an impressive demonstration of just how far they have travelled as a writing duo. For as well as being a playground for their signature humor - the wedding night scene is hilarious - and quick-fire dialog, the writing in First Lady shows a greater maturity and confidence than their previous works. The developing relationship between the President and her soon-to-be consort is skilfully and subtly drawn, as the tensions surrounding running the nation and getting married at the same time are played out. These characters have real depth, and the result is that First Lady is both an enjoyable and satisfying book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"First Lady","review":"I enjoyed this book mostly for the chance to spend additional time with these likable and interesting characters that the authors created. There are some great moments in this book. It's highly entertaining to be along for the ride as the wedding is planned and executed. I also really liked the honest way they deal with Dev's handling of all of the trauma's and stresses of being President after almost having been killed, etc. They even bring up how she dealt with Samantha's death so many years before. There was a lot of poignancy here, and it felt real and gave Lauren and Dev some real issues to work with.Overall, though, there never really seemed to be a direction or a point that could have made the book stronger. I know that this was an earlier work for both of these authors, and you can see how they grow over the years in their storytelling abilities. There's still a lot of humor and emotion and romance here. But similar to the first book it was almost like a collection of well-written, amusing or touching scenes involving these characters, versus scenes that followed a strong narrative line to a powerful conclusion. Even up to the prologue, which was a precious look at this family in the future as they prepare for life after the White House, I would sometimes stop and think \\"what's the point of this scene?\\"So again, well-written in individual scenes. Strong characterizations and consistent motivations. There are a lot of good pieces here, if only the construction could have had more discipline or been stronger. An above-average 3 to 3-1/2 stars."},{"Title":"First Lady","review":"I couldn't be happier with this novel - the characters are absolutely charming.

Novan, and have read most of their published work. They certainly do not disappoint with 'First Lady.' A fantastic follow-up novel to their collaborative work 'Madam President,' 'First Lady' ties up all the loose ends while still keeping the reader fully engaged.Presidential biographer and fiancee, Lauren Strayer, plans her wedding day with help from the President's mother and social secretary. President Devlyn Marlowe and her bride-to-be deal with family issues (i.e., Lauren's father) and new relationship woes. They learn to trust each other more fully and redefine their life goals together.

They become perfect pearls strung together to provide a necklace filled with all the elements of an evolving and growing relationship. As Devlyn Marlowe must learn to balance her Presidental duties with the needs of her children and her own heart; so must Lauren Strayer, her chosen biographer, come to terms with her own growing admiration and affection for the woman she finds beneath the presidential image.Balancing out this book are a plethora of engaging supporting characters including a pug who has little use for the power of the Presidency. In addition, three precocious children insure that neither woman can ignore the reality and mundane aspects of building a family.I thoroughly enjoyed both books and all the characters warmed my heart. The dialogue and characterizations provided a pleasant read and I was overjoyed to continue their tale in the sequel.

Ronald Weinland is a prophet and an end time witness. He has nothing to gain by lying. He is terribly ridiculed on the internet, but people also laughed at Noah when he built his ark. But if you read this book, and see the truth of the Bible, you will be amazed!THIS WORLD HAS BEEN DECEIVED!!! It says that in the Bible, and people don't realize just how much.

I've read Revelations several times, however only focusing on the parts that I thought I would understand and fearful of the other parts. Ronald Weinland described this section of the bible in great detail and explained how current events move us towards the Apocalypse on a daily basis. I became more and more aware of how mankind has defied God with the senseless murders and other acts of violence that have jumped off of the movie screen and onto the evening news or various websites.I don't want to believe that our time on earth will come to an end soon. Oftentimes I try to keep those thought out of my head - unsuccessfully. This book gave meaning to those thoughts but now I await the signs of the \\"end time.\\" Weinland has stated that we were given 6,000 years of self-rule and God's kingdom will replace the \\"kingdom of man.\\" He also stated that to date, only one being has entered heaven, and that being is Christ. Weinland also mentioned that there will be an imminent power shift from the nation that is perceived as the most powerful. Now, keep in mind, these items were developed within the first few pages and then developed - in laymen's terms - throughout the book.Many people will be skeptical and refuse to believe that these events will occur. Weinland has prefaced his words with the basis for his findings (the bible) and the religious standpoint that he views these events from. In the end, the decision is yours and you must try to do what must be done to prepare for these events that have been prophesied, Weinland is offering advice and a course to follow.I respect the author's religious views and applaud him for placing his name and reputation on the line to bring these difficult facts to our attention. If we can unify as a planet and try to get within the good grace of God, by whatever name he takes in our hearts, maybe there's a chance. I'd like to believe this but in the meantime we will have to watch and hope. As I look at the world today and the course that it's taking, I pray that there is a resolution and a brotherhood of all humanity. If you say the Lord's Prayer, say the words slowly and digest each and every word, especially the following:Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven...\\"The Prophesied End-time\\" has opened a hidden door in my soul and as I step inside, I am beginning to grasp at what will become of the world if we continue this course. As every book should, it will mean something different for each and every reader - this review is merely what I've taken from this book. You, on the other hand, may gain so much more by reading these pages as well."},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"This book is easy to read and it is also very detailed in explaining many subjects in the Bible regarding these last days. Example the group that makes up the Temple of God. The failure of man governing himself. The 7th seal is well explained along with the battle of Armageddon and much more.Much truth for Jews, Muslims and Christians."},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"... but one must ignore a great deal of other things, as well. There's many books on the end times out there, and this one- like most of the others- is largely based on the book of Revelation and is intended mainly for Christian audiences. As such, and since I happen to fit this audience's description, I will review this work from a Christian standpoint.Author Ronald Weinland extensively analyzes a lot of the relevant passages here, and ties them into specific events that have taken place (mostly relatively recently) and that will supposedly take place in the near future. He isn't what he terms a 'traditional Christian,' and his writing reflects this fact. For the good first third of the book, I largely agreed with everything he said (perhaps unsurprising- I also don't count myself a traditional Christian) and was pleasantly surprised by how much scriptural reference he has.A few things started to bother me, however, around that point. The first is that he almost never cites other books of prophecy in the Bible. It is a rather commonly known fact, even among those that only casually read the Bible, that you can't understand a lot of Revelation without also reading such others as Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. There is cause for concern when they are referred to only a scattering of times in an analysis of Revelation.Another problem is the fact that much of Armstrong's argument that the end is near is predicated on the claim that Herbert W. Armstrong is the end-time Elijah. Having read about Mr. Armstrong in other sources, and considering his arguments for this claim, I remain unconvinced that this is the case. In particular, no analysis is done comparing him to the real Elijah (i.e. in 1 Kings) which is somewhat puzzling. This and several other very specific claims (e.g. which precise modern-day nations each verse in Revelation portains to) are made by the author, but without enough scriptural backing to be truly convincing. Though it is certainly possible that things will happen in exactly this fashion, and it's certainly less vague than leaving the reader to fill in the blanks, the Bible alone does not adequately support these claims.A great deal of emphasis is also placed on observing the Sabbath on Saturday, and on observing the Passover. Having extensively studied both topics in the Bible, I believe that although doing such certainly won't hurt, it's definitely not going to kill you if you don't. The arguments presented here were not strong enough to convince me otherwise.If there was ONE thing, however, that really turned me off, it has to be the fact that Weinland repeatedly states that the Holy Spirit is not a divine being but just the power of God. He provides no scriptural backing for this astonishing claim (a good reason for that: there is none) and this is an extremely radical and dangerous doctrine to subscribe to (see Matthew 12:31-32 if you don't agree). To say something like this without supporting it is incredible, but I'm certain a lot of people will just swallow it whole. Unfortunately, a lot of the other material is Scripturally valid, so a reader might be lured to trust the author at his word. Because of this fact alone, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to any Christian reader.Ronald Weinland clearly wants his message to be spread. In fact, I received his book free of charge via his website. A lot of it is very true- specifically, what was written about the Catholic church, the nature of man, the purpose of Jesus, and the fact that an end will indeed come. It's a well written book that provides many convincing arguments, but also has some that are unsubstantiated or weak. If you have a strong knowledge and understanding of the Bible, you'll be able to tell them apart. In this case, there is a lot of good to be had from The Prophesied End-Time. However, if you do not, I suggest you stick to the Bible and leave this for another time."},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"Weinland tries everything to trap the reader into believing this sensation-driven book, including giving it away for free, which implies he believes what is written. Maybe he does. But I highly doubt it. In fact, he probably tries to use it as a dating service. Ok, maybe I'm being unfair. But how fair is it to waste peoples' time and mess with their memory?As one of my favorite authors/pastors (Steve Brown) always says, \\"there is no lie so big that some people won't believe it; there is no guru so weird that some people won't follow them; there is no heresy so out of the box that some people won't run with it, and it happens naturally. It's the default of the fallen mind.\\"This guy is slick as a snake. He's smart and makes an extensive effort to use Scripture to back up his emotion-inducing claims. The problem is that most people will not be able to tell that the whole entire book is based on one great big lie- that he's one of the two witnesses described in Revelation. Certain things he says in his books will be things that will happen anyway according to natural statistical occurrences, i.e. the increase in deaths of notable people and saints...duh, naturally...the more people there are, the more people there are who will die... but you'd be surprised at how many people will nod their heads in agreement to this...I know I almost did. Well, both of the books are full of twisted truth that unfortunately slip in under the intellectual radar of some people.How you know if I'm not just one of those who won't believe him (predictably, he mentions there will those who will not believe)? Well, if you have common or Biblical sense, you wouldn't need to question...just kidding. Revelation tells a completely different story than that of Weinland. Before the two witnesses (whom many theologians believe are Moses and Elijah for many substantial reasons) even enter the scene, catastrophic events brought on by the opening of the seven seals and the sounding of the first six of the seven trumpets, will have already occurred. The two witnesses come in with their God-given supernatural power before the sounding of the seventh trumpet. Before trumpet 7, there is no mention of the two witnesses in Revelation, which is necessary for Weinland's claims to be Biblical. They are clearly not since the two witnesses make their appearance during the second half of Tribulation...only.\\"For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;\\" Revelation 22:18\\"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.\\" 1 John 4:1Note: I hope this review does not appear mean-spirited. We must pray for and even choose to love, with the perfect love that God has given us by His Spirit, (and obviously not with our human emotional or sentimental love), even those who do wrong."},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"This book is very poorly written. The author repeats himself several times, yet does not explain certain things. After reading this book, I find that this is his own opinion only. One thing that is very confusing is that he says the beginning of the week is Sunday. It is, on our calendars. But he says that Sunday is not the last day, the day of rest, to keep it holy. He says that day is Saturday, based on our calendar that the week begins on Sunday. I don't think he knows what he's talking about. He never really doesn't say what the signs of the end times are, even though I know what they are simply from reading Revelations over 30 years ago. I really got tired of his repeated words without saying anything new. I also have never heard the name Armstrong, and I've been around since 1949 in a very religious family (non-catholic but Christian, meaning we believe Jesus is the son of man and is our savior.) This author is trying to convince himself, I think. He knows nothing of the end-times. Only his speculation and his interpretations of Revelations."},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"I was wondering if there is a refund policy if the world does not end this year. Also wondering what is to become of the money he makes off of the book if the USA goes under the money will have no value. One editorial comment concerning the content. He states the the end of the world, WWIII is man created. If this was foretold thousands of years ago how can it be caused by people who were not even alive at the time? Perhaps everything is the result of a prior state of mankind and like the inertia of a spinning wheel and thus the end time is just the conclusion of an inevitable chain of events to mix my metaphors. My advise , don\\"t sell your time shares."},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"I am always interested in any reading material about the earths final destiny and I was glad to be reviewing a work on that subject.Author, Ronald Weinland certainly has the background to undertake such a writing being an Ordained Minister and a Prophet.He starts out his book by taking you through the Scriptures explaining their meaning and where we are in the timetable of the Word. You are aware that he has truly researched his findings, andhas a deep passion to warn the world of his findings.He gently takes the reader into the future and explains his perspective of what is about to take place on our planet and what you, the reader, can do to prepare yourself and your loved ones for these events.I found his writing and his research to be excellent, although in my own beliefs I did not totally agree with all that he offered in this work. I did however enjoy reading his perspective of the Scriptures and I was glad that there was another servant of the Lord sounding the alarm that time is indeed short for mankind.The work is well crafted and researched, the writing is easy to understand. If you are interested in end-time events you may find some morsals in this work, but as always in books written on this subject, you the reader must make the final decision where earths future and your future is going.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"The Prophesied End-Time","review":"According to religious fraudster Weinland, the sky is falling.

An Analog From Adam to Nero (2009) details Revelation.Adam is dated as being born in (2965). After, exactly, 500 years He made the Promise to Abraham. MOSES spoke to a burning Bush at 50 Jubilees.50 x 49 + 15, after taking a wife, = The Promise to Abraham.Exodus I: Genesis correlates with Enoch, and Abram fled to his wife\`s City State in kish. Abram became King of his wife\`s City State at the age of eighteen.Exodus II followed the eruption of Thera.Enoch was taken up by Sirus in the year (2777).A day, Biblical, was 1456 years and considering Enoch\`s technology available, this estimate seems quite reasonable.Enoch\`s day, otherwise, consisted of 18 parts. The length of day-light at Summer solstice was 12 of 18 parts. Because 12 of 18 is the same as 16 of 24. Enoch was banned by Irenaeus because it would be impossible for the Generation of Seth to be so removed from \`The Invisible God of the generations of David.Herbert W. Armstrong\`s ministry claimed that the Lost Tribes could be traced back in to Europe. Many years earlier Benjamin Franklin opposed this notion.The author is quite correct to bring to the forefront, that Jesus had to be taken up, before His legs be broken.Islam has it's own rendition of Revelation. I read the book, authored under a pen name, by a Medical Doctor from Road Island. It is very scary, as is this authored End-time prediction. Christian's are encouraged to believe all of these or none of these, and I would guess that more Christian's believe the given End-time scenario, but millions of others believe Islam\`s randition.

But it saddens me that she -- like so many educated women -- seems to accept the idea that Father Technology -- in the form of the medical/pharmaceutical industry -- offers the only possible solution to infertility, aside from adoption. Must it be either/or? Female intuition tells me \\"no\\" and there's a mother lode of healthful and nourishing traditions that modern women can profitably mine. I would highly recommend Katie Singer's book \\"Garden of Fertility\\" for any couples experiencing infertility and considering their options."},{"Title":"Off course;: From Truman to Nixon","review":"I found this little gem in my library. I had never heard of Mr Tugwell.He was involved in the FDR presidency and greatly admired him. In this book he examines what happened 1945-1970 and compares this to what might have been had Roosevelt not died.His main thesis is that the Cold War was unneccesary. He starts from the idea that Truman used The Bomb to intimidate Russia and keep her out of post-war Japan. He was too inexperienced to control his subordinates and allowed them to use the American nuclear monopoly to try to contain Russia. Eisenhower continued the policy of containment while allowing our cities and infrastructure to decay. Kennedy was in office for too short a time to know what he planned, but his early record was not good -- Bay of Pigs, missile crisis, \\"Ich bin ein Berliner.\\" These actions intensified the cold war. Johnson committed the worst excess with his escalation policy in Vietnam and then lying to the American people. Finally we arrive at Nixon and 1970.Tugwell can hardly conceal his astonishment at Nixon. Here was a committed communist-fighter and conservative Republican who began the process of tearing down containment and building up detente. He initiated social programs, welfare and food stamps. He visited China although that was in the future as the book was written. He began the withdrawl from Vietnam.For Tugwell the period 1945-1970 was a series of grand strategic mistakes. We could have developed better relations with Russia by granting them their sphere in eastern Europe and access to the sea through the Dardanelles. By engaging in land wars on the Asian mainland we over-reached our true frontier -- the Phillipines, Japan. By neglecting our domestic needs we allowed the cties to decay, brought about the alienation of youth and social disruptions so evident in 1970.This is interesting stuff. But best of all is his writing style. It was like reading the Pentagon Papers, very crisp and to-the-point. I intend to try to find some other of his writings. He re-appraises the presidency in 1977 which might be very fun to read. I would love to hear what he had to say about our current president but unfortunately that is not possible.Edit Jan 09:Well well. I re-read Phillip K. Dick's \\"Man In The High Castle\\" recently. And waddya know? Rexford Tugwell is the president! The book is predicated on Germany and Japan having won WWII, and now they are divvying up North America.This is another case of once having found something for the first time, it subsequently crops up everywhere."},{"Title":"Mr. Putter & Tabby Take the Train","review":"I love Cynthia Rylant books.

Pets are not allowed on trains, so Mr Putter & Mrs Teaberry _smuggle_ Tabby and Zeke onto the train with them.

On one level it is a fast paced thriller that surrounds you with the sights, smells and taste of Bangladesh and the kidnapping and rescue of two American Geologists. On another level it is the story of negative prejudice, corruption and greed, and how, to survive, one must overcome these flaws, both on a personal and global level.I have reread this book several times, and come away with something new each time. There is lots of information about everything from Geology and the way the big oil companies work, to the way the Bangladeshis live and arrange their society. There is also plenty of food for thought about how we each view other people, and the good and bad we get out of those relationships depending on how we let ourselves be limited by our personal prejudices."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"The begging is great, and I like the detail, but as you approach the end of the book, things don't nake any sense."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"This book was great!

Would highly suggest this story."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Fifth grader, Nora Rowley, is gifted and realized, early in life, that she is different from her peers. As she goes through school, she learns how to act normal so she does not show off her gifts. Nora has everyone fooled into believing she is an average student, including her parents. But 5th grade is a turning point for many students, this is the year that it is decided whether a students go on to advanced classes in middle school.Nora observes how test scores can make students feel good or bad about themselves based on scores alone. She sets out to prove a point, that test scores do not determine intelligence or lack thereof. So, Nora and her best friend Stephen convince most of the 5th grade to get zeros on their next quiz. The parents and teachers are outraged and Nora must figure out the next right thing to do.I rated this book a 4 out of 5 stars. I think most students can relate to this book. Test scores do tend to boost or crash an ego. I liked the story and I can see the point the author is making about grades not determining intelligence. As a parent, I think grades are extremely important and I hope my 7 year old, who read the book, and agrees with Nora's point of view, will not decide to get a zero on her next test."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"This book is great and it keeps u interested in it through out the whole thing.

Not sure why it doesn't work but I had to slog through it with my child (we took turns reading out loud together - the longer sentences were challenging even for me).The subject is important but not for every kid - I know my kid didn't really \\"get\\" it (exclusive emphasis on grades & test scores, singling out the smart kids & giving them all the tools to be successful as well as greater expectations but lowering expectations for \\"average\\" kids isn't fair). This book didn't seem to have the same elements I look for in a Clements book to help my child engage with the story & read actively (character motivation, change over time, point of view, figurative language, plot). Maybe because it was written exclusively from Nora's POV (a genius with an adult understanding of everything). Somehow the magic wasn't there this time."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I love it so much i have read it around 5 times!!!

I think the author did this because Nora is stating what happened in her life.I think Nora and Stephen seem like real people. They do real things, the story is set in a realistic place, and best of all, this book is not a fairy tale!Nora is pretending to be average by doing worse than she can on schoolwork. She has 2 older siblings, Ann and Todd.Some teachers recognize Nora as more accelerated than she presents herself. Nora and Stephen cook up a plan to prove that grades are useless, which involves the other kids in the grade.A great part in The Report Card is when Nora is not considered a faker anymore!The theme of this story is \\"Don't be average when you aren't.\\"That shows why you should read this awesome book. I think it might help you think of school in a different way."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I read this book to help cover for a judge that dropped out. I will admit that I was not too excited to read this book. There are far too many other great books in the tournament and being released each week that I need to read. However, I sucked it up, placed my frustrations aside and read this book.I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked this book. Actually, it was thought provoking to me on several parts in the story. Not because it is high level reading, but because I am teacher who deals with some of the issues mentioned.I read this book in about an hour or so. It is a fast paced read. It is a light read for me as it is geared for upper elementary.Yes, I recommend this book to elementary students. I enjoyed it and found it to be an engaging read for this level.Now I will read the other book for the tournament to see which I like better.This book raises many great points about the education. I earmarked a few passages so let me reflect upon these. Yes, these are my opinions and not of the place where I work.\\"Most kids never talk about it, but a lot of the time bad grades make them feel dumb, and almost all the time it's not true. And good grades can make other kids think that they're better, and that's not true either. And then all the kids start competing and comparing. the smart kids feel smarter and better and get all stuck-up, and the regular kids feel stupid and like there's no way to ever catch up.\\"I think this is a problem. We are in a society where everyone strives for perfection. Parents expect their kids to earn A's in all subjects. The problem is that scoring an A has become too easy. The curriculum has been dummy downed so bad that there is no excuse to not earn an A and at the same time the grades have lost their value. I am not saying we should increase homework because I don't really like that idea either, but our expectations for grades need to change. We need to get back to the place where an C means average and not stupid and an A truly represents mastery of the content and not just a hard worker or a nice kid.There was a reference to the Oak Elementary test where teachers were given a random list of students who were considered \\"bloomers\\" and since the expectations were raised, so did the performance of the kids. You can read more about it hereI bring this point up because I know that I work in a district with teachers who are awesome and have high expectations for all students. What is needed more than ever are more parents and the community who works with kids to raise their expectations. There are many, many fantastic families out there, but there are others who need to help push the expectations for their children.The last one. \\"I see what you mean, and it's true that these tests all require students to memorize a lot of information. But knowing basic information is important. It's like the foundation.\\"This is an interesting point. You have to have the basics before you dig deep. The problem is that we as teachers have so much \\"basic\\" information to get in that it is tough to always dig deep. I am lucky that I get to dig deep with great kids every single day of my job. That is what I do daily. This is almost impossible to do when you have class sizes of 30 with a range of intelligence from high school to 2nd grade in a 6th grade classroom.I post these all to get your thoughts. What do you think? Education is always a sensitive topic, but one that needs to continue to be talked about."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"A fast read that not only encourages children to do their best in school without worrying so much about what their grade says about them, but also inspires intelligent children to never be bored in school.

Its true. But don't tell anyone. Is that how you would want to live your life? Nora always gets average grades so she can forgo the pressure. But when Nora gets 100% fed up over testing and the fuss everyone makes about grades, she brings home a terrible report card just so that she can prove a point. Pretty soon her teachers, parents, and the principal are launching a massive effort to find out what's wrong. Can Nora convince them that tests alone are a stupid way to measure intelligence?Nora Rowley believes that testing is the most stupid thing that has ever been invented. She believes that getting grades on tests only makes some kids feel stupid and some kids really smart.It all started the first day of kindergarten. Nora walked into class and all of the kids were learning how to say the A,B,C's . Nora was saying to herself \\" what am I Doing here?\\" Nora thinks that she should be in a higher grade. While the class was first learning how to read Nora was already reading chapter books. WOW!! Have you ever herd of something like that?Everybody thinks that Nora is just a average student. But little do they know Nora is a Genius. You all are probably wondering why Nora doesn't want to take a step further and just show her classmates, her teachers, and especially her parents that she really isn't a average student. The real reason why is because she likes Stephan. Nora doesn't want to make herself out to be the really weird smart kid.Just to show that she is really not that smart she calculates how many problems she has to get wrong on a major state test. But when one of the teachers finds a college website on Nora's computer will they all still think that Nora is a average student or is she a genius.You could find out if you read the book THE REPORT CARD.
