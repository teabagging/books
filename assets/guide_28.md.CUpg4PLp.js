Phillips is an inspirational story of Dukes journey to the 2001 National Championship. Through the book you will find Coach K's schemes that helped lead the team towards their goals. Also the way he connects his players and his own emotions towards the journey in the book is very entertaining.There are many things I enjoyed about the book, but one thing I liked a lot about it was how often he used personal quotes from himself, other coaches, and players to connect you with there journey. Such quotes like at the end of the book after they have won the championship he says, \\"I just tried to sing my own song for this year's performance and not worry about things. It made me healthier and helped me coach for the right reasons. I had the most incredible year that I've had with a group of kids. I can't stop smiling.\\" You can always get media and other people's opinions on what happened, but when you get there personal quotes, you can actually see what they went through to reach their goals. Another reason I loved reading the book was discovering Coach K's elaborate plans and schemes to get players to build off each other and off their situations. But his main principle is the \\"Five-Point Play\\"; Communication, Trust, Collective Responsibility, Caring, and Pride. He has many other amazing schemes, but to get into detail you would have to read it yourself.Those are just a few reasons why you could get to liking this book. It's a very inspirational journey and you can find tools that Coach K uses for yourself in everyday life. Also you're never going to loose background or information in the story because of all the personal quotes and information. It is a very enjoyable book and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season","review":"Kind of sappy writing but it was great fun to follow the 2001 year and hear some of Coach K's strategies and his take on each of the players.

I couldn't make it past the third page before my gag reflex kicked in and I started to salivate. I would soon lose my Chalupa.

I didn't want to put it down, nor did I want the story to end. I'm drawn to books with strong feminine leading characters and smart, take charge men. The men have to exude confidence and manliness. This story met all those requirements and more. I will have to admit that Courtney was a bit unconventional for her time which may have not made her believable. She knew what she wanted and had no qualms about going after it no matter the consequences. Without giving away the story, you will see Courtney exhibit this trait numerous time and I believed that's what endeared her to Damon.

It was a \\"little green book\\" published by L. M. Ericsson, a large manufacturer of Telephone Exchanges ( Circuit Switches). It consisted of two sections: An introduction, with a recursion formula for computing the tables, and a collection of values of the Erlang-B formula. Inputs were A, the number of Erlangs, and N, the number of trunks. The value of Erlang loss was to about six decimal places. The formula for computation was a recursion formula which eliminated the computation of very large factorials. This formula is rediscovered, and republished every few years. My copy did not have tables of the Erlang-C formula, or the probability of delay longer than \\"so long a time\\". These are necessary for dimensioning the size of call center agent suites. It book was a necessary tool, and I have my own Xerox of the original that I used regularly when I was in the telephone industry."},{"Title":"Lords of the Middle Dark: (#1) (Rings of the Master, Book 1)","review":"I have just read all 4 books in this series, back to back, in the last week. I was hooked after the first book, and I think it was one of the more interesting introductory books I've ever read. I give the first book 5 stars. Tho, the series, probably only 3.5, I'll explain more at the end...A future earth, that seems to be stuck in the 1500's. Ruled by a \\"Master Computer\\" that was developed long ago, when man was at the brink of destroying himself. Now the computer has devolved mankind into a state of technology (1500's) that can be brutal and savage...but, doesn't have the ability or technology to wipe out the world in the process.This master computer controls all technology and knowledge in this world. However, it does use some of the \\"brightest\\" people from each culture to help it rule. These people are snatched from their primative cultures, trained, indoctrinated, and given the knowledge and technology, that the rest of the world is now ignorant of. The only caveat is, each person must return to his/her peoples for a couple of months every 2 years or so, to \\"stay in touch\\" with the culture they came from.This computer isn't malevolent, it's just following it's programming to protect humankind from itself. However, the methods it uses to do this can be quite extraordinary.The Master Computer has basically \\"de-populated\\" Earth, to a point where there is less than a million souls on the whole planet. It has done this by moving Billions off planet, to other planets. On Earth, it has basically created 1500's technology, and the small population's living there are ignorant of anything else. England now has kings, barons, knights and castles. China has Warlords and their peasants. And America is basically populated by Native American Indians.Earth has basically become a protected museum of what life was like 500 years ago.This is a story of Hawk's. Who is a Native American Indian, but was deemed bright and inquisitive enough by the Computer, to be taught about the knowledge and technology, that is prohibited to everyone else.On one of his mandatory pilgrimmages back to his people, Hawks discovers some secrets about the Master Computer. That the people who created it, also created a way to shut it down. Basically, it involves locating 5 rings, and using them in a certain way. This is forbidden knowledge to even one such as Hawk's. This book is about what he does with that knowledge, and how the Master Computer reacts to him having it.This was a great book, and the only book I've ever given a 5 star rating too. As soon as I finished it, I immediately went out and found the other 3 books in this series, and also got everything else I could find by Chalker.Unfortunately, Book 1 is the only book in this series I believe was 5-star material.The following is what I thought about the rest...Book 2 - 4 stars.Is actually a pretty good continuation of Book 1. Hawks has now been sent to a prison planet, where he has enlisted some interesting allies in his quest for the rings. It moves along pretty well, and we become more aware of where Chalker is heading in this series. Which is good...and bad.After reading several of Chalkers books now, it seems Chalker has specific areas he particularly enjoys exploring. Mostly, Alien physical form and culture.Chalker is big into alternative alien form. Much of this book, and the following books, revolve around these ideas. Alien physical differences, and how those differences can shape a society. It's not really my cup of tea...but, Chalker is good enough at it that I can appreciate his interest. He also approaches it in a unique way. Instead of having \\"real\\" aliens, he has given the Master Computer the technology to actual \\"change\\" humans into a form that is more suitable to a particular environment. Instead of terraforming a planet to meet humans needs...he changes the humans to meet the planet's needs. Interesting twist. The master computer does this through a process call \\"Transmutation.\\"By the end of these books...I was sorta sick of the Transmutation process :)Book 3 - 2.5 stars.This is where the series fell flat for me. We basically spend this whole book trying to get 1 ring (remember, there are 5). On one planet, with one set of \\"transmuted\\" humans..and the culture and society they have created.Hawks team has to infiltrate this society to be able to steal a ring. That means, they have to change themeselves into these \\"transmuted\\" humans, and live amongst them, to be able to get close enough to snatch the prize. It was an in-depth look at how physical form can affect culture, and a specific look at that culture.I can appreciate what Chalker was trying to do here, but, it really seemed to drag for me. This is where I realized where Chalkers real interests lay...societal/cultural/philosophical/religious explorations. Like I said, I can appreciate his perspective, but I guess I really wasn't in the mood for it after the first 2 books.Book 4 - 3.5 starsAfter book 3, I realized we only had one book left...and we've only got 2 rings!That means, we have to find 3 rings, learn how to use them against the computer, and have a final episode...all in the last book! I couldn't help but feel, even before I started reading it...that this one would be rushed.And, imho...it was.This was still a good book. Better than the 3rd. But, I couldn't help feeling that if we'd spent less time finding one ring in book 3, we could have spent more time getting the other 3 rings.My biggest complaint, however, was with the ending.There are things I would have loved to have explored further. What would it have been like for someone to interface with the Master Computer? What would they have felt, or seen? How would they go about changing things through that interface, etc...Instead, it just sorta ends and skips ahead. I was pretty disappointed in this. However, it did actually \\"end,\\" even tho more abruptly than I would have preferred.Overall, I would give the entire series 3.5 Stars. It still has one of the best first books I have ever read, and Chalker is an intelligent writer. I never felt I was reading something designed for a much younger audience, tho, I believe any age group could enjoy it. I may not have the same interests Chalker has...but, I can appreciate a good, intelligent writer when I see one."},{"Title":"Lords of the Middle Dark: (#1) (Rings of the Master, Book 1)","review":"I read this book in the late eighties when I was in high school and loved it. Recently I reread the series and found that it was not dated (besides the sheer size computers can take up) the results and effects of technology are still believable.

There is so much crammed into these four volumes. One of the best and most consistent series I have ever read."},{"Title":"Lords of the Middle Dark: (#1) (Rings of the Master, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book in its first printing back in the mid eighties (85 I think) While I was preparing for a canoe trip through Quebec. The whole plot line appealed to me for a number of reasons that I wont get into, however, I can tell you that the plot and charecter development were fabulously rich, and enveloped me in a Tolkienesque manner. I was drawn away from the rain and mosquitos, the biting flies, and the food poisoning we all suffered, to a world in the future that I felt could actually exist. I waited impatiently for the next few years for the forthcoming sequels to come out. The only disappointment in the whole series, was when I turned the final page, of the final book, and it was over."},{"Title":"KNOW YOUR OWN I.Q.","review":"This was the first book, as far as I know, that allowed a layman to test and know his own I.Q. Written by the famous British psychologist, who worked in both the clinical psychology and personality and intelligence testing areas, it contains a series of tests that you can administer yourself to find out your own I.Q.The tests are what's known as multi-factor or omnibus tests in that your average score is comprised of the results of three subtests, which is a now familiar strategy for designing I.Q. tests. Most tests examine verbal, mathematical, and spatial abilities, and this one does too, using vocabulary, number series, and spatial matching of figures to test these abilities. Number series are regarded especially as a good culture-free way to get at mathematical intelligence, which is good, since the vocabulary area is so socio-economically influenced.That having been said, ironically, it has been shown that the most elaborate I.Q. test is only about 10-15% more accurate than a simple, forty-item, 20-30 minute vocabulary test. Why this is isn't that hard to fathom. Since language is the tool for thought, a command of one's language is a good proxy for one's level of cognitive sophistication in at least linguistic terms, and perhaps for intelligence, also. However, many psychologists aren't comfortable basing decisions on the results of a one-factor test. (Although verbal analogies are similarly good and would work pretty well too, and those tests can be made with very high ceilings, as well. One of them, the MAT, or Miller Analogies Test, is used to test graduate applicants).After I got this book, it was a few years before I saw another self-scoring I.Q. test, this one with a blue and white cover that I recall seeing at many bookstores back in the 70s. I thought this was a pretty good test too, and it had a fairly high ceiling, going up to 150 or so. I noticed there are a number of these out now, and there are even websites offering tests that you can take for a small fee, but this book started this mini-trend or was nevertheless the first.The book also contains 10 of these tests, so you can take all of them and average your scores together to get a more accurate number. I noticed I did do much better, by 10 or 15 points, on several of these than on the others, so they perhaps vary in difficulty somewhat.There's also a fine introduction by Eysenck on the history and theory of I.Q. testing that I enjoyed, although this area was an interest of mine in grad school (although I was mainly a neurobiologist), but someone not knowing anything about the field will learn a lot from it.I also have to pass on a funny quote from Eysenck. He was a speaker at a psychological conference once, and one of the seminars was on human s_xuality. I think this was back in the 70s. Anyway, mast_rbation was one of the topics that came up, and Eysenck said that he didn't know why it was such a maligned practice, as it enabled you to meet a better class of girls that way. :-)Overall, a fine book by an eminent psychologist that is now probably a classic in its field and worth picking up if you can find a used copy."},{"Title":"KNOW YOUR OWN I.Q.","review":"This is an excellent work which provides some rough data onpersonal IQ measurement. IQ measurement is an inexact science;however, it provides some measurement of a person's abilityto do arithmetic compilation, reason and identify patternsvia manipulation of art forms.

While his books could definitely serve as a warm up, in present day America they are no longer adequate to get a fair estimate of your I.Q.

One involves unscrambling and identifying car models which is fine if you lived in England 50 years ago and drove a \\"Vanguard.\\" \\"Let\\" may be synonymous with \\"leave\\", but in present day America who uses it that way? Other examples include poets and composers, which may transcend time somewhat, but they clearly demonstrate a specific area of knowledge which many people intellectual or otherwise simply never developed an interest in. I was looking for a book that could serve as a quick and dirty tool for measuring my I.Q. since you don't learn this from the Mensa exam.

His books are a pleasure to read and his voice becomes part of my own inner dialog as I go through my days, and that is a welcome addition to my day.After reading his two great WWII novels, Winds of War and War and Remembrance, I wanted more. It took a long time for this book to be released on Kindle, but once it was available I was glad to read it.The scale of the telling of the war is smaller and more personal than his other two epics, but very personal and very real. Character is revealed, and people have an evolutionary arc. He manages to show each major character with all their flaws, some of them unredeemed, but always with an understanding of our own human frailty and potential.It is a very good read, and the themes are timeless, they are the themes of what it is to be human, to face challenges, and to make moral choices to strengthen, or weaken, ones own character.I recommend this book and his other two great WWII books."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is a book that reflects a great Navy made up of great men with damaged Captain.

It is still popular today because it takes the reader through the day to day angst of being commanded by a lunatic captain about whom many of us see in our day to day dealings with bosses in the business sector. Not as much is usually at stake in business however, the strategies employed to deal with the discomfort and sophistry of a bad leader are present even in contemporary times. I know I could hear the clicking of steel balls and the frustration of chasing matters that don't matter as I was metaphorically looking for strawberries and nonexistent keys to food lockers.

All 4 or 5 stars. So I was excited to read the Pulitzer 1952 award book of his The Caine Mutiny.The 537 page book read well with no boring parts. I read the book in 2 days and could not put it down. Wouk did a masterful job with character development and description of the old rust bucket WW1 type Destroyer/minesweeper USN Caine used in WW2 against the Japanese.We see a progression of Captains of the Caine starting at a good, fair to the crew Captain who got Caine's assigned jobs done with efficiency. However he allowed much slack of the crew and the Caine to be filthy. Next came a \\" By the book\\" disciplinarian Captain who terrorized the crew and INMO was a sick waco. Then we see an intelligent author/ Captain as a good Captain. Finally we see Willie the main character winning a Bronze star( put up for the Navy cross but for his actions against the mentally Ill captain only got the Bronze Star) for helping to save the Caine even after his Author friend Captain had issued an abandon ship after the Caine was violently hit by a Kamikaze plane that exploded on the ship causing a massive fire and destruction. Eventually Willie becomes the Caine's last captain.There is also a love affair with Willie and his girl. Lots more characters that are described very well. Wouk shows his characters as real human beings with strengths and faults like we all have.The real sicko was the Lt. Commander Queeg the crazed disciplinarian Captain going by the book and having to have his way at all times. Many times he was at fault and never would acknowledge he was wrong and always got a lower officer or crewman to take the blame for his ineptitude. Lots of discipline. No wonder why he was so hated and called Old Yellowstain for his cowardliness.We see the XO taking charge of the ship in the middle of a Typhoon and possibly illegal relieving the Captain's command of the ship. There is a Court Marshal for possible Mutiny. Fascinating. I won't ruin the great story for you.Great ending. I now know why Herman Wouk received a Pulitzer prize in 1952 for this great book The Caine Mutiny. Remember Humphrey Bogart playing the mentally disturbed Captain Queeg massaging the steel balls in his jittery hands. A great classic movie.Anyone interested in the Navy, small old combat ships and close personal involvement between officers and crewman will enjoy this Pulitzer prize winning book. 5 stars and proudly added to our family library."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"At first glance, the Caine Mutiny seems to be just another boring war novel. However, once you begin to read this capturing novel you find that this assumption could not be farther from the truth. This is the story of Willie Keith and his life in the navy. But the book grabs the reader and introduces them to Willie Keith, the person. At the beginning of the novel, Willie is selfish and naive. He is greatly spoiled by his mother and is unsure of his relationship with a young woman named May. But as the book goes on you learn a lot about his life. You watch this boy who is blind to the real world being transformed into a man who goes off to war. He soon learns that his mother can no longer look out for him and he that he will be treated just like everyone else. He faces many hard times but pulls throught. This is because he wants to prove to everyone else that he can do it, no matter what anyone else says. As the story goes on he matures and learns responsibility. The author's style captures the reader and you soon find yourself wraped up in the lives of the characters. This helps you to get more &quot;into&quot; the book and you find yourself not wanting to put the book down. Overall, this book was well written. The characters are believable and you soon find yourself sympathizing with them. This is one of the better novels I have read in a long time"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Herman Wouk won the Pulitzer Prize for this magnum opus centered on a mutiny aboard the USS Caine, a fictional World War II destroyer-minesweeper - and rightfully so, though an incongruous ending prevents it from reaching its full potential.Despite the military setting and the courtroom climax, The Caine Mutiny is more a coming-of-age tale than a war novel or legal thriller. It tells the story of Willie Keith, a rich, pampered momma's boy who enlists in the Navy during 1942 in order to avoid getting drafted into the Army. Willie soon learns that naval service is not the pleasure cruise he envisioned, and for the first time in his life, he encounters hardship, privation, responsibility, and death.Willie's antagonist on his physical and personal journeys is the unforgettable Lieutenant Commander Phillip Francis Queeg, the new captain of the Caine. Initially, Queeg is welcomed by the crew as a tough captain who will restore much needed discipline after the laxity and slovenliness of his predecessor. Soon, however, Queeg is revealed to be a lying, hypocritical, incompetent, cowardly officer. The ship's performance begins to suffer, Queeg's behavior becomes more and more harsh and neurotic, and the crew becomes increasingly hostile and insubordinate toward its captain - though the question of whether Queeg's behavior is the cause or actually a response to the crew's attitude is not opened until later on and a definitive answer is never given.After a particularly bizarre incident involving missing strawberries, the situation comes to a head when the ship is caught in a powerful typhoon and the mutiny referred to in the title ensues. The rest of the novel focuses on the subsequent court-martial, with the key issue being whether Queeg was \\"insane\\" for purposes of Article 184 of the Navy Regulations.In Queeg, Wouk created one of the most compelling antagonists in modern literature. Queeg's forbidding presence pervades the novel, even when he's not on the page, and his pathological tic of rolling a pair of steel balls when in a state of mental agitation is one of the great symbolic eccentricities ever written for a literary character. Queeg is a strong enough character to overcome Willie's blandness as a protagonist and function effectively as the story's proverbial anchor. Queeg's confrontation on the stand with Greenwald is the single best moment of the book and Willie is nowhere to be found.As good as The Caine Mutiny is, its one shortcoming is that the climax rings a bit hollow and artificial. It is impossible to get into specifics without spoiling the plot, but it does generally seem that Wouk in the end tries to have it both ways. The disjointed view expressed by Lieutenant Greenwald in his climactic speech just doesn't comport with what transpired in the rest of the novel. Nevertheless, The Caine Mutiny is a great read - it just isn't the flawless one it could have been."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is the quintessential, and arguably the best, American novel of World War II. It succeeds on a multitude of levels, not the least of which is as a pure, can't-put-it-down story. This was one of the first \\"adult\\" novels I, as an easily distracted adolescent, ever read. I can thank Wouk for helping to kindle and stoke a lifelong passion for reading. I've read this book at least a dozen times, and just like meeting up with an old, dear friend, it never bores or fails to delight."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is, quite frankly, my favorite book. I've read countless classics--Dostoevsky, Dickens, Tolstoy, Melville, and Hemingway--but no other book combines \\"can't-put-it-down\\" plot with characters so rich and real you feel like they're sitting next to you watching you read the book. If you want Dickensian character development layered on top of a sweeping drama, love story, and \\"insider's view\\" of WWII naval military, read this book."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Wouk first copyrighted THE CAINE MUTINY in 1951, fifty-six years ago as I write this, a fact that highlights one of the great beauties of books--when coming upon one for the first time, it is always brand new, a cornucopia of fresh images and a crowd of new characters whose acquaintances await the reader's making. Wouk's is a delightful novel, vivid in the mental pictures it draws for the reader, exciting in its plot, and realistic in the nature of its cast of characters. As is usual in real life, no hero emerges from these pages, only people with conflicts and challenges, which are met, again as in real life, with varying degrees of success.For me, the mark of a successful novel is that its fictional story be both entertaining and believable and that its characters act as though they were of flesh and blood rather than of ink on paper. THE CAINE MUTINY attains this mark with ease, and the complexity of its characters adds immensely to the fascination of the plot to produce a book that is as fresh and fascinating today as when it was first written. There is nothing antiquated or quaint about the book, even though I was but six years old when it first hit the bookstores.Wouk goes to great pains in his short preface to stress that his is purely a work of fiction and that it represents no ship, person, or specific action of World War II. Methinks, however, that he doth protest too much. I am reminded of Tolkien's strident protest that LORD OF THE RINGS and its companion books are in no way allegories, yet the allegorical presence of Hitler and the armies of Nazi Germany is undeniable, the author's unwavering proclamation notwithstanding. In Wouk's case, ineffectual, bullying, ranting, and cowardly military commanders exist just as surely as the fictional Captain Queeg exists, obtaining sulky obedience from their staff through nothing more than the threat that their rank allows them to exert over the futures of those benighted and cowed people. The character of Keefer is reflected in every self-righteous coward who preaches resistence to tyranny, yet is the first to avoid confrontation, who instigates actions by others but avoids the blow when such actions recoil. Then there is Keith, our omnipresent protagonist. We watch him mature in many ways through his three years of adversity in the Navy, yet at the end he remains in many other ways the same insecure, protected little boy literally chauffeured to and from his wartime service by his mother. His relationship with May, where his immaturity shows itself most blatantly, remains ambiguous throughout our entire view of him. The point here is that all of the principal characters do, despite Wouk's disclaimer, clearly represent types of people we all know in the world around us, yet, as with real people, they are not type-cast but reveal complex psychologies and comprehensible responses to the conflicts that intrude upon their lives.I find fault with only two aspects of Wouk's novel, the first of which is his apparent feeling that the actions of Maryk and Keith did indeed constitute a mutiny. The successful defense attorney admits as much after the court-martial has ended. Keefer's degeneration into cowardly ineptness upon his appointment as captain of the Caine and his metamorphosis into a Queeg-like person bent more on escape and avoidance than on leadership is nothing more than an apology for the despicable Queeg and tries to show that the adversity of command, not character flaws, made Queeg the unbearable boor that he was. It is as though Wouk has suddenly had a change of heart and has become an apologist for the antagonist he earlier created. The second weakness is Wouk's decision to leave the ambiguous relationship between Willie Keith and May unresolved. The story begs for a denouement in which May firmly and finally rejects the on-gain, off-again suit of the vacillating Willie, cementing his reversion to the spoiled \\"momma's boy\\" he was when we first met him.Still, except for Wouk's apparent change of heart toward the guilt of the mutineers and his indecisive conclusion of the Willie-May affair, the plot holds together admirably, the characters react to internal insecurities and external pressures as they might well do in the physical world, and the book remains an entertaining read from cover to cover. It is truly a tale of adventure and of war (both between nations and between individuals) on the high seas and in a modern setting, inasmuch as the characters walk the steel deck of a warship under steam rather than a wooden deck under sails. Anyone who relishes a good adventure and appreciates believable psychological development of the characters will, I think, enjoy THE CAINE MUTINY as much as I."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny is the best military fiction that I have ever read. It is well-written and engaging. The characters and situations rang true to me as a former naval officer even though I served more than 50 years after the story was set.I also recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand more about the leadership. It contains everything good and everything bad about leadership, and the lessons that Willie Keith learned aboard the Caine apply in or out of the military.Overall, The Caine Mutiny is a great story that does not require an interest in the navy or military to enjoy or appreciate."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I read this book several times in my high school years and was captivated by it. I picked it up the other day and sat down to reread it never expecting to make it to the end. But I found myself reading it over a weekend and enjoying every page.The novel is an amazing testament to Herman Wouk's writing skills in that even though it is now 50 years since it was written, and containing no foul language or any sex, it remains a page turner.Classic historical fiction. Highly recommended for teens or adults."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This fine novel runs from the time before Pearl Harbor to about the end of 1945, and focuses on Willie Keith, who we meet as a spoiled brat and Princeton WASP, who is living off Daddy and earning a few bucks as a piano player. He joins the Navy for no good reason except to impress a girl, and misadventures his way through his officer training. Slowly, he learns that this is more than a game, and learns to face up to the consequences of his actions, as he turns down a cushy position at Pearl Harbor, staying on the appalling Caine. But the arrival of the slightly warped Queeg both in some ways matures Keith, so that he pushes himself for recognition from the odd captain, and retards his maturity in other ways, so that at the pivotal moment of the mutiny, he joins in for unworthy reasons. It is not until he is nearly killed (and, by the way, saves the horrific Caine) that he is finally willing to face up to himself and decide what is really worthy in his life.There are many unforgettable characters in this book, not so much Keith, but Queeg, of course, and Lieutenant Keefer, author and cad, who provokes the mutiny out of pique and then runs for cover, and Steve Maryk, the not-so-bright exec who is manipulated into the mutiny and pays by being court martialed and losing any chance of staying in the Navy after the war. And, unforgettably, the flyboy and lawyer, Lt. Barney Greenwald, who comes in to defend Maryk and sees everything for what it really is. Forced by professional duty to destroy Queeg to save his client, he is appalled by his own actions and responds with one of the great speeches in literary annals.A classic. Wouk's best."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"If you have ever served aboard the decks of a man-o-war this is a must read. This should be a prerequisite to entering Naval training. Hell, if you have never seen a man-o-war or have never even had a boat for your tub this should be amoung the titles on your shelf. I have found in my new civilian career that there are Queegs running some companies, departments, divisions. This is a tale of a time when ships were made of iron and men were made of steel. The feeling of the deck rushing up to meet me and the smell of salt was in my nostrils the entire story. Do not deprive yourself any longer. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is one nice piece of literature. It is fun to read, and exciting, for starters- plus there is depth as well. Wouk is one of the best novelists that this century has seen- all of his stories are good and especially this one. Queeg, Keith and Keefer are great characters. There is tension as you turn the pages that grates like finger nails on a chalkboard, only you cannot stop reading as in the best of nightmares. I Don't want to give too much away, but once this peaks, the Court-Marital follows through and does not disappoint. There is a reason why Wouk won the Pulitzer for his work on this one!"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This book, The Caine Mutiny, by Herman Wouk holds it's readers as much today as it did in the 1950's when it was released. Anyone who is interested in military novels must add this book to their collection. From the first page you will feel as though you can actually step into Willy Keith's shoes and see life on the Caine as it was. The reading is interesting and easy for even the most novice military reader and interesting enough for the expert. Definately THE BEST book I've read in a long long time."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"At first, the average person may view this easily read novel as a book purely dealing with war. This is not the case, however, as it explores the depths of psychology among people, romance, humor, and unjustifiable mutiny. This book is the first of its time period to also elude to homosexuality, something unheard of in that time. The characters become very identifiable and jolt emotions- a good read for teens throungh senior citizens!"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"There are two types of books written by authors-those which appeal only to critics and those which appeal to the general public. This is a primeexample of the latter(the ease of the vocab usedhelps). With brilliant imagery and lots of Navyjargon (which I didn't understand before I readthe book), Herman Wouk conveys to us the storyaboard the USS Caine during WWII. He gives us deepcharachters with Willie Keith, Steve Maryk and TomKeefer,and he creates a legend with Captain PhillipFrancis Queeg. He makes us think. A classic."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny has been hearlded as a great World War II novel. I personally do not think that this is an apt description. Though the Caine Mutiny was set in World War II I don't think that's what makes it great.By first introducing us to Willie Keith Wouk gives us our first caracter impression--which is what makes this book great. With Willie as the lead caracter the reader is introduced to the military, a change in lifestyle, the confusion of love, and the hopelessness of war. Willie as a man changes drastically and as he changes so does the reader.Wouk's descriptions of his caracters leaves almost nothing to be desired. From the first captain of the Caine to the last you are given an impression of life through the eyes of the caraters.Questions could be raised such as, did Keefer manipulate the crew? or was the mutiny necessary? But this is all due to the reality of Wouk's writing. His caracters portray people who have reasonable problems and few solutions. The author's excellent writing keeps the reader wrapped up in his caraters.Though the novel is set in World War II it should not be read solely for that fact. This novel is for those who enjoy strong caracters who have weaknesses. It is a novel of life as well as war and should be read by anyone who loves true literature."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I have not read all, or even most, of the historical fiction out there, but this definitely tops my list of books in the genre. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it is also a challenging intellectual gem. Instead of getting caught up in the history, Wouk uses the history as a means to tell a character driven story about a spoiled Ivy Leaguer who joins the Navy to avoid bullets that might come along with being drafted in the Army.Keith shares the worries of young men (and women) - especially intellectual elitists - who wonder if they too can be men of action, and how to move from the context of a classroom to a war-room.Keith's character development, supposed maturity, epiphany - as presented to him by his lawyer who criticizes the one fellow Naval Officer Keith seems to truly admire - and final action in the face of danger show a journey through life we all travel. Like all of us, Keith stumbles heavily along the way. Along the way, Keith is defined and defines his life based highly on the characters and the books that surround him.Perhaps the most satisfying piece of the novel is having Keith receive a bronze star and a letter of reprimand on the same day. Wouk reminds us that there are no true heroes or villains, but only people of a mixed breed.If true story telling is based on character, then this is a good as story telling gets."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This story is not just fiction. Many of the incidents that took place in the book also took place on the U.S. Grayson during WWII. The outcome was different from the book, but the officer was finally removed from the ship."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I read The Caine Mutiny when it was a best seller in the early 1950s. Sixty years later, after reading Wouk's recent The Language God Talks, I was reminded of what a magnificent writer he is. The author is ever the master story teller, holds the reader, and never disappoints. The Caine Mutiny is as good today as it was when he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1951."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"One of the great war WW II novels, war at sea novels, and maritime (in any category) novels. And a great \\"people study\\"In short, the story follows the thread of young Midshipman Willie Keith growing through initial training, deployment to sea, battle, and eventually command. Along the way he encounters a romance with a woman, romance with the navy and the sea, dances with death, and hardship under the command of a horrifically unfit captain . . . Captain Queeg, which name has become synonymous with tyranical and world class eccentric leadership. Willie Keith is tested, tried and in the end . . . (I'll let the reader find out).Wonderful tale, told by one of my favorite novelists, Herman Wouk. In this particular work, besides the gripping tale, I was especially impressed with Wouk's accomplishment in creating the assortment of characters in play. The personalities remain faithful to their created character throughout. An incredible array it is --novelists, lawyers, crude mariners, singers, doting mothers, et al.A long time ago I was in the Navy (submarine navy) with over four years at sea. It is quite apparent to me that Wouk wrote from personal naval experience, and wartime experience to boot.Do read this one. It's a novel that educates, gives pause to self-evaluate, and is an absolute \\"page-turner\\"."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny, 2001, and To Kill A Mockingbird are my three favorite novels. The best one to \\"live in\\" is Mutiny. You can get so caught up in the story that you believe you're on board."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"One of the most impressive things about a truly well-written novel is the number of characters that stand out to the reader long after putting the book down. Maryk, Keefer, Keith, and of course Queeg are unforgettable, Queeg in particular, for every one of us--Navy or not--who has suffered under a paranoid perfectionist will recognize Queeg's style in a heartbeat. The strawberry \\"crisis\\" is a case in point.As the novel progresses, young Willie Keith seems to come around to a more Navy-oriented point of view--namely: incompetent and eccentric officers are part of the hazards of war; one must simply make do. At the risk of mistaking Keith for Wouk, I found this a troubling conclusion, given the madness of poor Stilwell, the life-risking incidents aboard the Caine--and of course my own vivid encounters with Queeglike imbeciles too perfectionistically by-the-book to listen to reason or feel even an ounce of empathy for their victims. Chains of command of any kind attract just such personalities. But the consequences should not be passed off as business as usual.Like any good novelist, Wouk paints the reader vivid pictures of events, scenes, little dramas and big ones. At times you can smell burning oil and hear the curses of overworked sailors. It's pleasant to see Willie Keith grow up with all this as his chosen context."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny seems to be a true story of the Navy in World War II and a vivid unusual story all-in-one. The Navy routines and duties are accurately portrayed and are entrancingly portrayed.Character development is exceptional in the book. Willie Keith, Captain Queeg, Tom Keefer, and even Steve Maryk were developed brilliantly so that you liked Willie, felt sorry and hated Queeg at the same time, puzzled over Keefer and felt sorry for Maryk.The plot was exceptionally done with some very detailed descriptions of the outrages of Captain Queeg and the shaky love affair between May Winn and Willie Keith and many other sideplots filling up the many enchanting pages of the book.One thing that I really enjoyed at the end of the book was that when you finished, you really weren't sure if the right or wrong thing had been done. Wouk leaves that to the reader's percerption insted of laying it straight out on the line. It was your choice whether or not to like or not to like how the story ended.This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. To finish my review I will quote my late grandfather, &quot;The Caine Mutiny is the perfect story of the Navy and Willie Keith is the personification of the enlisted Navy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk was one of the first works of literature rather than fiction that I read by my own will, and for that I am very thankful. When I saw 500 pages of small print, I wasn't looking forward to it, but once I got started, I found myself completely immersed. The story is a classic coming of age tale- Willie Keith's maturing is very interesting, and the characters have a lot of personality. You loath queeg, laugh at the funny stuff, and just cant help liking the seamen. And the story is full of high action and drama. You can't put it down! This book is perfect for teens up."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny is not merely another war novel. What makes this book special is the way in which Herman Wouk develops complex characters and relationships within the setting of World War II. He places emphasis on the depth of the characters, rather than the war itself. Because of his attention to the complex attitudes and relationships on board the Caine, it is not necessary for the reader to have a strong naval background in order to understand the situations at hand.Wouk's main character focus is on Willie Keith. The reader is able to understand his character more than the others because of extensive expository information in the first several chapters. At times the information seemed long-winded and irrelevant, but it achieved its main purpose of establishing the main character, the protagonist for the reader to follow throughout the novel. Because of this personalized insight, the reader receives a biased, yet deeper understanding of the events.Wouk provides some very intriguing twists and turns throughout the novel, the most poignant of these being the court martial trial. Because of the way Wouk chooses to slant the proceedings, the reader has almost every reason to believe that Maryck will be found guilty. Such elements of irony and surprise make for some suspenseful and highly engaging reading.Wouk achieves a high level of success with this novel. His use of locus, attention to complexities of character and relationships, and his ability to twist situations create a highly dramatic, touching coming-of-age story centered around the trials of war and command."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"A truly classic novel that tells the story of a young man's journey from a sheltered Ivy League life to a veteren U.S. Naval Officer. I first read this book when I was 15 years old and could not put it down because it was a grand adventure with exciting action. That was over 20 years ago and since then I have read it twice. Each time I read it I see a new dimension of irony and conflict. Its truly a classic story of organizational behavior, and military logic and illogic. Its a great story of loyalty and honesty. Its a sad story and an uplifting story. It has every element of great fiction with exciting and funny chapters mixed into the bigger picture of the slow crumbling of Captain Queeg. Queeg is one of the saddest characters in literature. He is however a perfect example of a person who has reached a stage in his/her career who is overmatched with his/her job, but too proud to admit it. Not even to himself. The story of Queeg should be taught in business schools training the future leaders of business. Read the book and study the characters. Keefer, Willie, Queeg, Maryk, Greenwald, and deVries are all wonderfully constructed and true to life in many respects. This is one of the finest books in American Literature. An all time classic. Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I had to replace my 30-year-old mass market edition--it was falling apart. At the end, I was having to stash it in a ziploc bag--I can't really say that about every book I've bought. Let's face it--most of us knew this story first on the screen. This was where we saw Humphrey Bogart as the insecure, embattled Captain Queeg--antihero of a standard sea yarn which was anything but my favorite of his films. Bogie of course played Queeg a lot more macho than he's portrayed here, but the main thing the movie did get right was the character Tom Keefer--a supercilious intellectual snob with a very low opinion of the military and those who serve it. But the main character in this story is young Willie Keith, a spoiled-rich kid who joins the Navy on a whim. The saving grace of this immature Ivy Leaguer, though, is that he lacks the level of arrogance usually expected from his demographic. This is how he manages to become a man, as well as a pretty decent officer--he's just plain willing to learn. This also stands him in good stead in his romance with a girl who's too mature for him but is willing to wait for him to grow up. I won't give away the irony in just what way Willie \\"comes of age\\", but Wouk later was to come up with a fairly similar character in \\"Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance's\\" Byron Henry, also set during World War II. So don't let having seen the film fool you into assuming this book is just another war story--it's a rite-of-passage tale very consistent with more than one other Wouk novel."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Before the Pulitzer prize joined the Nobel prize as a reward for political correctness, the Pulitzer actually recognized great books like &quot;The Caine Mutiny.&quot;Given the book's popularity, the decent movie version with Bogart et al, and the made-for-TV version of the court martial segment, the story should be familiar.Wouk props the reader on the fence often, forcing decisions (or at least provoking thought) on the true personality and motives of each of the detailed characters. Each situation presents a laundry list of moral and ethical dilemmas, with the obvious show-stopper being the relief of Queeg during a typhoon. Like &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty,&quot; however, this incident is the result of many smaller incidents and building tension.A healthy dose of humor keeps it all from getting too grim.I could do without the melodramatic storyline of Willie's romance with May Wynn, but I suppose this kind of soap opera fare was a convention of the time in which Wouk wrote the novel. It also serves as another fork in the road for Willie's character, since he comes from a blueblood family and May definitely does not.All in all, the story will stick with you, and so will the ethical issues it raises."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"A reviewer below wrote...\\"I have been reading the reviews written on Amazon about this book. Many readers refer to it as a great book, and some as the greatest that they have ever read. This is in stark contrast to the critical evaluation of the work given by professionals, academics primarily. For them Wouk is a ' middle- brow' writer whose powers of character creation, language, are not very great.\\"Well, the reason the so-alleged professionals think Wouk is \\"not very great\\" is that the books he writes SELL -- people buy them, read them and enjoy them! -- while the professionals/academics mostly \\"write\\" (\\"type\\" would be a better word) material that is stupefyingly BORING, and that nobody reads -- NOBODY!!!The Caine Mutiny is a terrific story, an interesting narrative in addition to being a realistic glance at 1940s wartime Americans.

Once I dove in though, it became an exiting adventure on the high seas. Military stories don't usually do much to capture my interest, but Wouk has a way of commanding your attention and opening your eyes to a very interesting situation. His characters are well-developed and the descriptions are very detailed. So much so that I was transformed into the The United States Navy of 1943. By the end of the book, I was actually thinking like a sailor. I really think the popularity of this book could be renewed because this is exactly the kind of story the modern American is thirsty for. Stories of corruption and power have been all over the airways and the big screen in the '90's. Movies like The Firm, several made-for-TV movies, and several news magazine shows have featured this type of topic. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get away--away to a rich time in our history, a time when almost anything could happen and ordinary people experienced some very extraordinary things. Open the book and enjoy the ride!!!Amanda Fritz"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is my favorite of the great World War II novels and I've read many of the great ones, which includes Mailer's &quot;The Naked &amp; the Dead&quot; and James Jones' &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot;Wouk broke much ground with this novel and the Pulitzer was well earned. The superb court martial, Willie Keith's coming of age, and of course who can forget Phillip Francis Queeg, perhaps the most famous modern naval captain in fiction?With a wonderful assortment of characters and a superb plot, we see Willie Keith go from naive and arrogant young college graduate, to a mature tempered man who has endured the fires of war. It is a novel to be read and reread. The movie version with Humphrey Bogart isn't bad either. But as they say, the book is always better."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"NOVELIST/PLAYWRIGHT HERMAN WOUK, with THE CAINE MUTINY, WINDS OF WAR, and WAR AND REMEMBRANCES, has established himself as just about the finest wordsmith in America. In MUTINY, he manages to bring a sense of drama to the endless daily onboard paperwork that is a necessity in running a destroyer-minesweeper during a major confrontation such as World War II. A dispatch not delivered gives newly-detached Ensign Willis Seward Keith a blot on his record, although the news of an impending transfer of a new captain has little or no effect on the war effort, albeit a complete change of personality on the bridge of the Caine. Ensign Keith is the vox popular, but the drama is fought out among the higher ranking officers: Capt. Philip Francis Queeg; Executive Officer Steve Maryk and Lt. Tom Keefer. Queeg, who has now become a byword for any executive promoted beyond his ability that succumbs to stages of paranoia (President Nixon, for example), is in turn quixotic, tyranical, appalling, and pathetic. In a surprise turn toward the end of the book, he is finally presented as tragic-heroic. Maryk, self-conscious about his own lack of formal education, becomes the man-on-the-griddle when his good judgment of ship handling and limited judgment of character are set at odds during the mid-Pacific typhoon of December, 1944. Keefer, undeniably the most brilliant man aboard ship, is shown to be the manipulative Iago whose revenge of a petty slight (told by the new captain to cut out spending Navy time on his novel-writing) sets lives and careers at peril, and nearly retreats into the darkness unpunished. A glass of whiskey thrown in his face, however, sets in motion a complete alteration in his self-perception--and his eventual downfall. Wouk, who himself commanded a naval vessel, achieves an incredible balance between the more obscure naval jargon of World War II and its translation through the civilian-turned-naval mind of Willie Keith. It is greatly readable without being in the least patronizing of the civilian mind. It is a war-within-a-war, where the rules and master plan were \\"designed by geniuses for execution by idiots.\\""},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Nine times out of ten the book is better than whatever movie they make out of it. This is that one time. This book would have been better 100 pages shorter, leaving out all of the Keith backstory that really wasn't that interesting to start off with. Sure, the Keith character matures over the course of the book; but it was his service on the Caine that made him that better person. The rest was, to me, just filler."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"When THE CAINE MUTINY was first published in 1952, it became an instant hit since the memories of the Second World War were still quite fresh in the collective minds of the adult American public. Further, the intense psychological give and take which forms the bulk of the last one third of the novel reflected the growing fascination with Freudian theories of personality. Adding to the sales was the engrossing film version with Bogie twirling steel balls on the witness stand. However, with the passing of decades, enough time has gone by to permit a more balanced view of Herman Wouk's attempt to portray the stresses that war has on a mind that lacks flexibility. What emerges is a novel that is so lacking in strong characters and reader involvement that one now can wonder why readers even now try to plow through the nearly 400 pages of mind numbing text before the only good part emerges: Queeg on the stand.The book opens with what is surely one of the weakest portrayals of a protagonist in 20th century literature: Willie Kieth, who comes across as a feckless and uninteresting naval cadet. As I was reading several hundred pages of his supposed growth from callowness to maturity, I soon enough realized that Kieth could not carry the book on his vapid smile and non-existent character. Fortunately, Wouk includes a number or secondary characters who spice up the action. Unfortunately, by the time I come across these backups, I have had to read more than one half way through. The romantic female interest for Keith is his feminine doppleganger, May Winn, who seems to exist only to prize the dubious value of her probably non-existent virtue over any revealing insights into her relation with Willie Kieth. Keith's comrades on the Caine are infinitely more interesting. Clearly, Wouk sets up his book to point to the courtroom confrontation between attack defensive lawyer Barney Greenwald and Captain Queeg. This part, despite the incessant references to Freudian illness, is Wouk's most compelling achievement.What one takes away today after having read THE CAINE MUTINY is a sense that war truly does warp personalities that are already inclined to be warped. Yet, an author owes his reading public a more believable set of literary conventions and writing skills that were so clearly lacking here. When Keith leaves the book as one who has been reviled even by the man assigned to protect him, I got the feeling that Wouk wrote THE CAINE MUTINY as a huge inside joke that illustrates that a book that masks a dearth of conventional literary tropes needs only a &quot;hook&quot; to reel in a series of readers eager to discover some eternal truths about warfare only to discover that the price to learn them is a Queeg-like capitualtion to those same harsh truths."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"One hesitates to say this of a Jewish novelist--and I think it is fair to say that Wouk trades upon his religious background for his novels--but The Caine Mutiny has always struck me as somehow fascistic. For most of the book (and movie) the story seems like a pretty straightforward riff on Mr. Roberts (read Orrin's review): in this case, of course, it's Captain Queeg (even the name seems intended to invoke memories of Moby Dick) who is mentally unbalanced and, unlike Captain Morton in Mr. Roberts, his seeming derangement is genuinely dangerous because the boat he commands is a mine sweeper rather than a transport ship. Wouk carefully lays the groundwork so that we understand and sympathize with the crew's eventual mutiny. Then, presto-chango, he whips the rug from beneath our feet:\\"Course I'm warped,\\" said Greenwald, \\"and I'm drunk, but it suddenly seems to me that if I wrote awar novel I'd try to make a hero out of Old Yellowstain.\\" Jorgensen whooped loudly, but nobodyelse laughed, and the ensign subsided, goggling around. \\"No, I'm serious, I would. Tell you why,Tell you how I'm warped. I'm a Jew, guess most of you know that. Name's Greenwald, kind of looklike one, and I sure am one, from way back. Jack Challee said I used smart Jew-lawyertactics--course he took it back, apologized, after I told him a few things he didn't know-- Well,anyway...The reason I'd make Old Yellowstain a hero is on account of my mother, littlegray-headed Jewish lady, fat, looks a lot like Mrs. Maryk here, meaning no offense.\\"He actually said \\"offensh.\\" His speech was halting and blurry. He was gripping the spilling glasstightly The scars On his hand made red rims around the bluish grafted skin.\\"Well, sure, you guys all have mothers, but they wouldn't be in the same bad shape mine would ifwe'd of lost this war, which of course we aren't, we've won the damn thing by now. See, theGermans aren't kidding about the Jew. They're cooking us down to soap over there. They thinkwe're vermin and should be terminated and our corpses turned into something useful. Granting thepremise--being warped, I don't, but granting the premise, soap is as good an idea as any. But I justcan't cotton to the idea of my mom melted down into a bar of soap. I had an uncle and an aunt inCracow, who are soap now, but that's different, I never saw my uncle and aunt, just saw letters inJewish from them, ever since I was a kid, but I can't read Jewish. but never could read them. Jew,but I can't read Jewish.\\"The faces looking up at him were becoming sober and puzzled. \\"I'm coming to Old Yellowstain.Coming to him. See, while I was studying law 'n old Keefer here was writing his play for theTheatre Guild, and Willie here was on the playing fields of Prinshton, all that time these birds wecall regulars--these stuffy, stupid Prussians, in the Navy and the Army -were manning guns. Coursethey weren't doing it to save my mom from Hitler, they're doing it for dough, like everybody elsedoes what they do. Question is, in the last analysis--last analysis--what do you do for dough? OldYellowstain, for dough, was standing guard on this fat dumb and happy country of ours. Meantimeme, I was advancing little free non-Prussian life for dough. Of course, we figured in those days,only fools go into armed service. Bad pay, no millionaire future, and You can't call your mind orbody your own. Not for sensitive intellectuals. So when all hell broke loose and the Germans startedrunning out of soap and figured, well it's time to come over and melt down old Mrs.Greenwald--who's gonna stop them? Not her boy Barney.

But for me, as compellling as the training, the days at sea, the mutiny and the trial were, the best of the book is at the end. After the trial, as first Keefer and then Willie assume command, we are treated to a very rich insight into the lonliness of command -- and the irony of newfound knowledge in making an ultimate judgement on Queeg by the these two officers. When the verdict is announced Maryk fades into insignificance and it is in Keefer and Willie that the author presents the issue of judgement, growth, heroism and responsibility. Keefer's honesty is brutal; Willie's growth is wonderful. This book is great."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I picked up this book on the way to the airport to read during a long flight. After reading only a few pages I was thoroughly engrossed following the exploits of Ensign Willie Keith aboard the obsolete minesweeper Caine under the abusive and neurotic Captain Queeg. There is more action and drama in the book than in the movie and the story is still relevant and quite captivating well over 40 years after it was written. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a good read. I literally could not put it down and I started reading it again on the return flight!"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The best book Wouk ever wrote ( Don't Stop the Carnival is second). Captain Queeg has become part of the culture, thanks in part to Humphery Bogart in the movie version. The character development, particually Willie Keith, is top flight, and the story itself is timeless...do we question our superiors or do we obey without hesitation at all times even when they seem crazy? More than a war novel, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; is a study in moral conflict, and is beautifully written. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Herman Wouk's \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" is one of the best novels I have ever read. It is a combination of a military drama aboard a World War II minesweeper and a great psychological drama among the strong personalities in the officer cadre aboard the ship.Wouk tells the story of the officers of the minesweeper Caine suffering under a difficult and overbearing commanding officer. He raises many issues as the officers struggle to continue to operate -good leadership and followership; the relationship between the Regular Navy officers who served in the pre-war Navy and the Reserve officers who joined the Navy during the war (many because they saw the Navy as an easier assignment than the Army); plus the psychological stresses of officers struggling under the demands of command.Wouk served in World War II on a minesweeper. He really brings the reader aboard and shows what it was like to serve in the World War II Navy.Wouk has weaved together a great story in a great setting with excellent characters to create one of the best war novels ever written, and as good as the movie is the book is much deeper and better. My only criticism with the book is that it, like many other Wouk novels, is saddled with a love story that does not do anything to really advance the plot. Anyone with any interest in World War II or historical fiction will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Years ago I read The Winds of War and War and Remembrance but for some reason never got around to THE CAINE MUTINY. Although I knew the story, until a couple of weeks ago I had never seen the Oscar winning movie of the same name. However, after watching the movie, and forever enstilling the vision of Captain Quegg as Humphrey Boggard, I was determined to read the book. Like other reviewers have said, its a wonderful read; a wonderful story and a trip down memory lane in terms of Americana; life in the 1940's and also life in the work place. And for those who loved the movie, an epilogue to what happens to the Caine, since the book goes on past the court martial.As anyone who has ever been in the work place knows, the minute you become a whistle blower, or want to expose a problem, you become a solitary act. All those who egged you on and told you how right you were suddenly get amnesia when it comes to backing you up - so found Captain Maryk.But one of the things that struck me about the book is its references to class difference - ie, Willie, the mama's boy from Princeton and money and May from the immigrant class of Catholics - a world away from the WASP world into which Willie was born. We never know the fate of Willie and May, but if I had to bet, I'd say that the marriage would never work. To many differences and a romance born in the passions of war.There are a number of openly anti semetic comments about Jews and Greenwald is made to be the epitome of the stereypes of the 1940's about Jewish lawyers.Catholics lived in a different world. Willie has to think long and hard about marry a Catholic.The US Navy of the Caine Mutiny was one were blacks in the Navy only served as stewards - not good enough to man a gun or work on an engine.The constant smoking of the characters, in virtually any and all situations is a world that it totally foreign to contemporary Americans.The taboo on pre-marital sex is a big element of Willie's relationship with May and his mother's dislike for her. The thoughts of a young couple like Willie and May going off for a weekend together and getting separate rooms is pretty foreign in today's world.All of this adds to the aura of the book and the lessons in American history that it provides. They are the signs of the America of the 1940's.Reading The Caine Mutiny was a wonderful experience. It's a classic that should be read by all! It provides many lessons on how America has changed for the better but also how many situations like crazy bosses and unlikely romances live on today and will continue to live on as long as humans populate the earth."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Many years ago, I read Winds of War and War and Remembrance. For whatever reason, I neglected to read Wouk's earlier works, including the widely acclaimed Caine Mutiny. Recently, I had the occasion to read Youngblood Hawke, and as a result made a concerted effort to explore other Wouk novels.Of course, I was familiar with The Caine Mutiny as a result of having seen the film classic starring Humphrey Bogart as the infamous Captain Queeg. I have to admit that previously seeing the movie detracted somewhat from the reading experience. Though the book was every bit as good as the movie (better in fact), knowing many of the details in advance spoiled much of the suspense that might have existed otherwise. Despite physical descriptions, I automatically pictured Bogart fondling the ball bearings or Fred McMurray as the pompous, holier than thou Keefer.Having said that, even having seen the movie, reading this work was utterly captivating. Rarely have I read a book that better shines light on the human psyche and human nature in the face of sometimes overwhelming pressure and stress. There are so many fascinating characters in this book, from the obvious (Queeg and Willie) to the seemingly peripheral but nevertheless vital (Keefer, Maryk).The story thread involving Mae, I thought was really unnecessary and perhaps filler, though it allowed the author to more fully explore the character of Willie. The complaints of naval jargon are valid, though in truth, knowledge of technical naval maneuvers or terminology is by no means necessary for enjoyment of the work. Understanding of the issues involved is easily discerned by context and is usually not central to the task of following the story.If you've never read this novel, you owe it to yourself to invest the time. If you have not seen the movie, I particularly recommend the book. Unquestionably, one of the finest war novels ever written. Having recently read Youngblood Hawke and now The Caine Mutiny, I can only say, it's on to Marjorie Morningstar."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"What a great book.On the U.S.S. Caine... an unimportant ship that sees little action during \\"The War\\" a mutiny is brewing. But its not a standard keel-hauling mutiny.Also, there is a trial after the mutiny.The author does a perfect job of taking you along for a ride. half the time you believe the captain was nutty as a fruitcake, and the other half of time time you think that the crew was just a bunch of whiny crybabies and that the captain was sane.I highly recommend this as an audiobook as well.There's a famous line in the book that I'll never forget:\\"Mr. Merick, you may tell the crew that there are four ways of doing things on board my ship. There's the right way, the wrong way, the Navy way, and *my* way. We do things *my* way\\""},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Herman Wouk portrayed a Navy in a way few others have dared. Generally, books about war fit their stereotype quite well--the hero is the commanding officer who leads his men courageously into battle. However, Wouk showed that even our most heralded commanders are human and make mistakes like the rest of us. Captain Queeg was unbalanced, but was he so unbalanced as to warrant a mutiny? That is one of the central themes of The Caine Mutiny, along with Willie Keith's change from an immature mama's boy into a man capable of commanding an entire ship in the United States Navy. Wouk seemed to have a much better grasp of war and human nature than most authors who have written so-called great novels, showing how most men are vulnerable, and military men are no exception. I would definitely recommend this books to everyone I know"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny is the perfect book to curl up with on a rainy day. It brings to life not only Navy life in WWII but 1940's-era New York City. I won't try to summarize the book, because many reviewers have already done so, but I found it to be a very well-paced, mostly believable war story. Forget grand heroics and ripping action, this is the war as the average Joe saw it- rather mundane, but full of characters from every walk of life and capable of changing immature young men into responsible and brave adults.Wouk will probably never be included in the Valhalla of literary giants, and for very good reasons. He employs quite a few stock characters (especially where minor characters are concerned) and his use of foreshadowing is heavy-handed and almost laughably predictable. Once I figured out how he used Willie Keith's opinions to set up the plot \\"twists,\\" it was easy to predict almost every occurence in the book, up to and including the final twist regarding Keefer's moral character. The book also has some outdated storytelling techniques and some classic 1950's social mores (pre-marital sex between loving adults! The horror!)This datedness doesn't really distract from the novel however; it actually adds another level of charm to an already very entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This a terrific WWII book, especially if you're interested in Navy life. I was turned on to this book by the film, which only told half the story. It's a detail rich journey that ultimately leaves you quite satisfied indeed."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This isn't really a review. I think highly of the novel and have left comments on what I think are its weaknesses elsewhere, including the movie version at imdb.com. However, I couldn't help noticing that Wouk apparently drew the names of some of his lesser characters from the names of destroyers and destroyer minesweepers. I'll just give a few examples that I happened to run across.Captain Blakely, president of Maryk's court martial is DD 150. Like most of the other names, Blakely's is drawn from an old World War I destroyer, built in 1918.Southard, the ship handling expert at the trial, is DMS 10.Ensign Harding, Willy's pal, was DD 625, converted to DMS 28.Ensign Braine, Willy's instructor at Midshipman School, may have been DD 630.Reversing the usual method of assigning names, Captain Queeg is said to have served aboard the fictional \\"Barzun\\" in the Atlantic. This is unquestionably an allusion to Wouk's distinguished professor of history at Columbia, Jacques Barzun.I think there may be other correspondences but the novel is filled with names and I'm not obsessed enough to check them all out against the names of all ships in the US Navy during World War II. In any case, the examples given might just be coincidental, although probably not.Wouk himself served aboard two or three DMSs but the only names I remember are Zane and Southard."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I bought this novel for my husband.

I was surprised at the extended ending in the book... carrying Willy Keith to the end of the war and the decomissioning of the Caine. I thought the film's ending was more effective."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This review is of the 537-page paperback version of THE CAINE MUTINY. Herman Wouk's bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about World War II naval service under a particularly disagreeable and querulous commander is a great deal longer than the movie it inspired, but also a great deal more eventful.The novel is very much the story of the maturing and moral formation of its central character, Willie Keith -- not just on board the U.S.S. Caine but beforehand, in his naval training and afterward, following the harrowing court-martial that is the climax of the movie, but not the book. The central portion of life about the Caine under Captain Philip Queeg is more detailed, and the reader gets a good feel for the continued festering nuisance that service under Queeg was, not only for Willie but also for his fellow officers aboard the Caine. Wouk also has the gift for maintaining interest even when relating in an almost documentary style how the greatest part of life on board the Caine consisted of boredom, routine and tedium, punctuated by the terror of warfare and the increasingly eccentric predations of Captain Queeg. Were Willie and two of his fellow officers correct in believing that Queeg's many character flaws and bouts of indecisiveness were sufficient to relieve him of duty while the ship was endangered -- in effect a \\"by-the-book\\" mutiny? The result of the court-martial offers one point of view, but Wouk's opinion, relayed through other characters, offers a different judgment based on different norms. And, lacking cinematic time constraint, Willie's life and naval service carry on for another 50 pages beyond the court-martial.While the naval engagements are gripping, to me the most pressing issues concern Willie: How does he develop a sense of honor? What is his place in the world? Will he come to earn the respect of men? And, since this is a Herman Wouk novel, romance has its place: will he get the girl? These are what kept me turning pages until the very end, even though I had already seen the excellent 1954 film. Whether or not you have, I can highly recommend THE CAINE MUTINY not only as a war story but as a very insightful coming-of-age tale of Willie Keith, told by a master storyteller, and set during a crucial juncture in American history."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This girly girl loves a war book because it is the second greatest American novel written ( see Harper Lee for number one ) and succintly , the characters created by Wouk are absolutely unforgettable .

I have never failed to be awed by a story he crafted , and am envious of his genuis, yet so thankful for the way his characters have become part of American culture .Rarely does a writer keep the reader wanting more as does Wouk.

But, he also seems to know the world of lawyers and courts very well to. When you get to the court martial, it's clear that he knows how good lawyers think and work. So the trial is accurate as well.

It is a novel striving to ask questions when no answers would do; of where lines drawn must be agonized over, stepped across, or go down with the ship. A watery \\"yellow line\\" crossed in the sea instead of the one drawn in the sand at the Alamo, but without the choice given those at the Alamo; of duty vs. common sense; did command and discipline override a life-threatening situation for many caused by the mental breakdown of only one?Mutiny is a serious infraction by anyone's book. But still, Wouk's more modern-day novel had parallels reminiscent of another high seas, high profile mutiny, that of the \\"Bounty\\" - where good men are pushed to a breaking point past limits of endurance and integrity. Bligh didn't roll steel ball bearings to relieve his ego (or his arrogance), but he had breadfruit trees to water and rogues to flog - with such full-flavored activity as that at his disposal, he likely didn't need the rollers to calm him. Many similarities were reminiscent, two of which stand out, in my view - the \\"strawberries\\" incident of the Caine paralleled the \\"cocoanuts\\" incident of the Bounty. The main difference for me was that Queeg became increasingly demented as he lost touch with reality, while it was fully apparent that Bligh was in full possession of his mental facilities at all times, and simply chose to rule with an iron hand, finding it almost enjoyable for some inexplicable reason. That fact was evident in the way he handled his small crew of castaway loyalists, bringing them safely through all kinds of unspeakable travails of the open ocean in a boat scarcely large enough to hold them all without taking on water, back to England barely alive, but safe under his sole wit and discretion. That was not the work of a lunatic.But Bligh also had better press afforded him than did Queeg. (perhaps deservedly so) To compensate, Bligh starred in a second, excellent book entitled \\"Men against the Sea\\" (also by Nordhoff and Hall) by which to redeem himself and prove his seaworthiness, but poor Queeg had only the courtroom drama to console him in the one book that was written of his rise and fall.A love story was feebly entwined and tried it's best to push it's way up from the soil and be heard, but it was a rather puny struggle, more as a diversion than of passion, as Willie cut his own umbilical cord and struck out hesitantly toward romance without knowing where he was going, why he was going there or what he was doing while he was going there. He was much more effective as the \\"Last Captain of the Caine\\"."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I enjoyed the movie years ago and wanted to read the book especially the sections about the typhoon and the court martial.

I recomend this to anyone who likes novels of World War II or just a great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk is the story of the trials and adventures of Ensign Willie Keith in the South Pacific during World War 2. The story begins with a young Keith going to the Navy yard to begin his training to become a Navy officer. It is evident from the start that his mother is the controlling factor in his life. As soon as he enters the yard he is leaving the nest that has sheltered him. He had gone to college for comparative literature, which creates a problem for him when he meets May Wynn on leave. She is from a poor background with little higher education. Willie is then hesitant to introduce May to his mother because of their diverse natures. Through a series of calamities where Willie is nearly expelled from the Navy, including a spring flying out the window during study hour and being caught trying to recover it, he gets his assignment to report to the DMS Caine, a minesweeper. This is the last place that Willie wants to end up, far away from his home in New York. However, when he arrives at Pearl Harbor, he learns that the ship has sailed without him. Upon happenstance he is invited to a party at the admiral's and receives shore duty. Months later, the Caine returns and Keith leaves with it. Willie is introduced to Captain De Vriess and takes an immediate dislike to him. However, De Vriess is loved by the men for his lackadaisical approach to the navy's regulations. Soon afterword De Vriess is replaced by Commander Queeg. Queeg states early on that the ship is going to be run by the book. This creates differences in opinion of how the ship should be run by several of the ships leading officers. Queeg displays tendencies that Lieutenant Maryk takes to be insanity which climaxes in the Caine mutiny.In my opinion this is an interesting portrayal of World War 2 from an angle that is unique from most other war time novels. This isn't a crude tale of life in a foxhole battling it out face to face with the Japanese or Germans. This story develops more the internal conflicts as well as conflicts between people on the same side. So many books are written about the bonds of brotherhood that develop as the soldiers fight side by side, but this has no direct confrontations between the enemies. My only complaint is that Wouk is a little dry, using too many words to say a simple thing. This makes the book have a tendency to drag. However, the story line is well developed and has a good variety of romance, action and intrigue. The story isn't a tearjerker and is a lighter read, despite its length. Because of its length, it has a developed plot that does not require much deciphering but creates an interesting story as well."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I'm new to this genre but I didn't have any problem keeping up with all the naval terms and character. This book has it all: a love story wrapped in adventure, intrigue, war, courtroom drama and most importantly psychology.

The U.S.S. Caine is such a ship and thus Mr. Wouk's depiction/description of life aboard one of these little tin cans is accurate in every detail. As a U.S. Navy veteran myself, I found it easy to picture myself walking the narrow passageways and climbing the steep, as well as narrow, ladderwells.The story concerns a series of incidents that lead up to the captain, CDR Philip Queeg, losing his grip and being relieved of command. But, did he actually \\"lose it\\"? One of the junior officers is a scheming little snot who bears some ill feelings towards the C.O. and manipulates the circumstances to undermine the skipper's credibility in the eyes of his fellow officers.As the story unfolds we see that while CDR Queeg is most surely not fit for command, he is done no justice by his officers. Events escalate with CDR Queeg becoming more of a mental wreck until finally, in the middle of a typhoon, he becomes catatonic forcing his being relieved of command in order to \\"save the ship\\".The story wraps up with a court martial with charges of mutiny being levelled at the junior officers. The courtroom scene is amazingly well written with Mr. Wouk proving himself to be an excellent writer of naval fiction."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This book was required reading for one of my classes.

Although the font size is miniature, and there are 498 pages of it, I found myself wishing there were more than 498 pages. I didn't want it to stop! A story of life in the Navy under a tyranical captain from a rising rookie ensign's view point gives the reader a first hand &quot;experience&quot; of the ups and downs of life in the Navy.

Many readers refer to it as a great book, and some as the greatest that they have ever read. This is in stark contrast to the critical evaluation of the work given by professionals, academics primarily. For them Wouk is a ' middle- brow' writer whose powers of character creation, language, are not very great. Here I must confess that ' The Caine Mutiny' is one of those books from which I have a stronger memory from the movie , than from the book itself. Many readers have referred to the masterful character creation of Captain Queeg, of his once contemptible and yet sympathy- arousing character, of the story of the development of Willie Kieth from crude and selfish young man to responsible sailor and hero. Many too suggest that Wouk's ending of the work is masterful. And all point out how wonderfully readable the book is.My guess is reading it will not only help the reader understand something about American life during the Second War but will also give an insight into American values and attitudes in the 1950's."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Part exciting WWII story, part romance, part gripping courtroom drama. \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" is a classic novel that hardly dates a bit despite being published in 1951. Wouk brilliantly explores the tension between the professional navy men and the part-timers during WWII. He appears to stick up for the sometimes strange and arbitrary ways of the long-time navy men but it's not an entirely convincing argument - the reader needs to make up their own mind. Wouk expertly explores the psychology of the main characters, especially the odious Captain Queeg and the cowardly Keefer. The actual \\"mutiny\\" scene still packs a punch.The book was made into an excellent film starring Humphery Bogart and Van Johnson in 1954 - and it is interesting to compare them. The film captures the essence of the book perfectly despite omitting or changing quite a few key scenes, and the ironic twist surrounding De Vriess puts the film one up on the book."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I usually go for more escapist fare in my reading, but when I came across a description of the court-martial parts of this book, I decided it was time to tackle a neo-classic. I'm glad I did. This is a long and absorbing book that will harken your psyche back to World War II era America, and take you on a voyage from New York to Pearl Harbor to Japan as you travel with Willie Keith, our protagonist through this mesmerizing tale.Be prepared to spend some time reading this book. Although it is compelling to read, each segment will make you want to savor it instead of rushing ahead to the next scene.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Great book in great condition. Quick delivery and a great buy."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny was an excellent read (that goes by more quickly than its thickness would have you believe). It was exciting and adventuresome. However, parts of it read like it was written directly for the screen. The predictable crescendos and love story lacked the depth that one hopes for from an otherwise great piece of literature. It is definitely a book that commands attention, and perhaps served as an inspiration to the screenplay author of &quot;A Few Good Men.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"While the beginning of Wouk's novel deals only with the foolhardy love and family life of future ensign, Willie Keith, it offers a good backround to the rest of the book. The multi-dimentional relationships aboard the Caine offer an interesting perspective to human interaction, while further propelling the plot. As Keith matures, Queeg, the ships captain becomes more paronoid and withdrawn. He exagerates minor infractions of rules, and enforces increasingly high penalties. As the story continues, Lt. Maryk relieves the captain during a storm, thus saving the ship, and &quot;winning&quot; himself a court-martial. The end is an interesting look into how the characters aboard the ship behave after Maryk's trial."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I saw the film some two decades ago, and I heard Bogart's voice every time Queeg opened his mouth. But this book is less like the film and more like the summarization of war (and my job in flight control at the airport)--long periods of leisurely description punctuated by brief explosions of action. Characters developed, their depths were plumbed, and then they transferred or got killed or were sent home.There's a long gentle arc to the story, for the most part, and the book is about Willie Keith's trajectory. I sometimes found myself tempted to flip ahead to see if anything started happening, but this was a well written book and if nothing else I know a lot more about the USN in WWII."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"How about a book where the ending is the same but the main plot depends on what you focus on? That's what &quot;Caine Mutiny&quot; is. Hollywood chose troubled, underachieving Captain Queeg, as played by Bogie, with his deteriorating mental health under the stresses of combat and command of a minesweeper. The bad guy is mid-level officer and intellectual snob Tom Keefer (Jose Ferrer), who chooses the solid command-material first officer as the fall guy for a plot against the captain. Like a lot of other people, I saw the flick first and said; &quot;War movie. Been there/ done that.&quot; This book, though, gives you an alternate hero--junior officer Willie Keith, who's the sheltered son of a New York doctor as well as a Columbia University rah-rah boy (I think Wouk later drew on Keith to create &quot;Winds Of War's&quot; Byron Henry). In the film, Keith is a forgettable supporting character (I don't even remember who played him), but in this book, we watch him as he dries out quite a bit behind the ears on the way to becoming a competant Navy officer. It's classic Wouk--some dude you'd never picture as a hero rises to the occaison. As well as a rite-of-passage tale as good as anything from Twain."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is a very cynical novel. It also lacks credibility.Captain Queeg is not a believable character. Ten or fourteen years out of the Naval Academy (depending on which passage in the book) and old for a Lt. Commander, his superiors would know that he cannot accept responsibility for his own actions. And yet for this and his many other shortcomings, including incompetence and cowardice under fire, he is portrayed as a typical Regular Navy officer.The trial is an travesty of the Military Rules of Evidence. And yet the novel is compelling. I felt emotionally drained when I finished. I give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book and was very positively impressed by it.It is a great plot that captures the reader's attention to the very last page. It combines details of war and specifics on ship handling with human interactions under such &quot;close quarters&quot; and romantic relationships. It is all written in a way that never feels overly detailed and the reader just wants to learn more.The central theme, the &quot;mutiny&quot; is very cleverly worked up to and during the event, it is very well presented in parts so as not to seem too boring.This is definitely a classic."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I got around to reading this book recently after being familiar with the Bogart movie since childhood. The book is surprisingly good. I had low expectations. The movie has some bright moments but it is mostly a stale slow paced war story with a dull court room scene at the end and some inappropriate humor added for no apparent reason. The book is much better. I spent most of my free waking hours over three days reading this 500 page book straight through. The story revolves around Ensign Keith and his coming of age as a naval officer in the Pacific during World War II. At the outset he is an aimless recent Princeton graduate who volunteers for naval officer candidate school to avoid more dangerous service elsewhere. He is happy to ride out part of the war waiting for his OCS to begin. Keith then arranges a soft temporary assignment at Pear Harbor waiting for the Caine to return from a combat mission. The details of the story from there are very close to the movie's storyline. The sloppy but competent captain, DeVries, is replaced by the incompetent martinet, Queeg. The executive office Maryk relieves Queeg during a storm and Keith passively assists this mutiny. Wouk makes some interesting points which I had never seen expressed in writing before. During a discussion of the myriad pointless rules and regulations that must be followed on a navy ship, he puts forth an interesting and apt theory. These seemingly pointless rules are intentionally crafted this way by the handful of smart people who are in charge. The goal of these rules is to permit imbeciles to safely operate a ship by following these rules without any conscious thought. Anyone who is not an imbecile will have difficulty with this; the only solution for an intelligent person caught in a subodinate position is to wear a mask of stupidity in order to please superiors. Just like real life! Wouk was obviously an extremely bright man frustrated by the halfwits he served under. By the end of the book there is nearly complete reversal in Keith's opinion of the Navy. He is captain of the Caine for its last voyage to the scrapyard and his thoughts reveal great empathy with the DeVries and Queeg. Overall a great book giving a feel for what it was like to live and serve through the second world war."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Don't get me wrong. I appreciated this book. However, about 80% of my appreciation has to do with the fact that I was told it had &quot;classic&quot; status before I even started reading it. Even though I can respect the precise knowledge of naval procedure and psychology that went into this book, I found it a humorless bore. The characters all either wishy-washy, like Keith, or basket-cases, like Queeg. Reading about Keith's romantic angst got especially boring after a few chapters. Personally, I didn't care for the guy, and I certainly wasn't interested in his coming of age.This book was selected by my English department as a representative book of the Age of Uncertainty. Since I happen to be living in the midst of the Age of Uncertainty, reading a book about doubt and confusion in the Navy is just a repetition of daily life to the nth. Perhaps that was the point of the book-- to get you to feel as antsy and dissatisfied as the prisoners on the U.S.S. Caine. I'm not sure exactly what I was supposed to take away from this reading experience. Reading it certainly took a lot of hours out of my life."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The novel deals with a most fascinating subject: the paranoid personality. It's fascinating because, first, mental illness is; and secondly because paranoids are the most plausible, convincing, sincere madmen that exists.But the rest of the novel is just so-so: the experiences of Willie, an initially immature night-club pianist who grows in maturity during his service as a naval officer in the Pacific in WW II.The trial of Lt. Maryk, the Caine \\"mutineer\\" (the officer who took over the Caine during a hurricane) is the best, and best-known, part of the novel, but it is totally implausible in at least two crucial respects.First, Lieutenant Keefer should have been a supremely favorable witness for the defense. Instead, the defense attorney insists on shielding him from questioning that would have helped save the accused Maryk. This is totally incredible and unaccountable failure on the defense's part and can only be explained as a gross manipulation of the plot by the novelist to keep up the suspense and achieve a surprise courtroom reversal.Secondly, the only thing that ends up saving Maryk is the cowardice of Captain Queeg under enemy fire. But cowardice is NOT characteristic of paranoia, and it is contradicted by the determined, fearless behavior of the captain during the hurricane. Stupid, stubborn, vicious, delusional, sick--yes, he is that; but not a coward except because the novelist needs him to be that, to get Maryk acquitted.Thus the critical part of the novel, the trial, is manipulated by the novelist, nearly ruining what is otherwise the novel's most dramatic part."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I know I should proceed at great caution in reviewing a classic or a near classic. And, I suppose, I shouldn't say anything bad about this book and much less use a crude football analogy to describe it. But... I do feel it is my duty to warn anyone else out there looking for a sure fire no risk classic like I was.That in my opinion. This book isn't it. The Author, not matter how great I'm sure he is, seems to have deserted the wonderful characters he creates to make a few points and create some Danille Steel twists that are pretty hard to believe. After all the Captain was absolutely crazy.Go buy the Red Badge of Courage"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The book has a broad range of plots, centering around the mutiny and the events preceding. Many other sub-plots, tiny ones, not easily noticed, help to provide a sense of reality to the book and fill in spaces between Queeg's explosions.May Wynn's love affair is the main theme that opens and closes the book. In the middle, the most important things happen, although very little time is spent in those situations in comparison to the rest of the book. The two consider getting married, write letters back and forth, and break up in the small amount of time given to their affair. This is the largest and most prominent sub-plot in the book.Although there are many other sub-plots in the book, one of the strongest parts in the book is its vivid detail of situations. The best points are not lengthy, but they capture the feel of the situation in the emotion of the character. The book is almost charismatic in the way it describes the rolling sea, and the raging wind. On page 324, the severity of the storm is emphasized by the words: \\"...it [the deck] was slanting steeply to starboard... so steeply that he could not stand on it... the deck was remaining slanted.\\"One point where the plot really was captivating was that things in Willie's life never seemed to go smoothly. He nearly was expelled from the officer school because of his demerits. Then, his late flight caused him to arrive in the port after the ship left. Where things could go wrong for Willie, they did.Captain Queeg's outbursts led to filling over two hundred of the book's four hundred ninety-eight pages, which seemed to be the more interesting part of the book. The pace of the book increased once he relieved de Vriess. His manner of thinking and dealing with his officers took up most of the storyline from the time the crew left the west coast of the USA to the mutiny, and was possibly the most interesting part of the book.In contrast to that, the plot seemed to lose momentum after the mutiny. The court-martial had very little action or plot advancement for over sixty pages. It is mostly a battle of words and definitions, and mostly the plot revolves around Greenwald's defense strategy. There was little suspense, little surprises, little plot. The court-martial is more of a review of the past chapters than new events.Another point which left a bad taste in my mouth is the conclusion of Willie and May Wynn's life. By the end, May seems little more than a filler, something needed to take up space in the novel. Except for the fact that she is Willie's girlfriend she bears no weight or effect on the focus of the novel. After the mutiny, the whole love affair sputters and dies, leaving little interest in the whole mess. Although useful in the beginning of the book, May Wynn did little to help the plot advance after Willie boarded the Caine.Overall, I feel that the book was worth reading until the court-martial. In the beginning, there are all sorts of challenges to overcome, puzzling situations, and brief yet vivid detail about the ship, the sea, and the emotions of the officers and men. The court-martial is mostly just questions asked and answers given, with little real action. The story afterwards really has little to do with the story before, like a doomed surgery patient with no chance of survival and no reason to go on, just living its pathetic life until the bittersweet end."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Every word that Herman Wouk has written unfolds the story in an enticing, but honestly realistic fashion. This book is a true-to-life portrayal of WWII, scandal and romance from the perspective of a soldier that we can all relate to."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I read the book after seeing the 50's movie. The book is much longer story but a very good read. It's a serious book with moments of humor and even a sprinkle of romance. It's a window on the life of some one in the navy. It also gets at the heart of what it takes to command. What happens when a bad commander is in charge, and just when is it appropriate to override his command.A very though provoking book that can be read by everyone. I am still wondering if they were right to over ride Queeg's command."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Masterful. Among the great WWII novels. Read Winds of War and War and Remembrance. Wouk turns out to be up there with Steinbeck and Dresier. A book you will go to sleep with and wake up to."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This is perhaps the third time I have read The Caine Mutiny and now with a little age under my belt, I appreciate it even more. Of course, the story is about a mutiny aboard the vintage destroyer minesweeper The Caine, during the Second World War. Most everyone is familar with Humphrey Bogarts outstanding rendition of Captain Queeg in the 1954 movie version of the book. Although other reviews have focused on the plot and character development (both which I think are excellent), I would like to address two themes which Wouk weaves throughout the book- the use, or should I say misuse, of psychology, and the issue of leadership.The mutiny, the defense and the acquittal of the Executive Office Mayrk, all revolved around psychological theories of mental illness. The officers, especially Keefer, see Queegs erratic behavior as symptomatic of psychological illness. As their dissatisfaction of the Queegs leadership grows, the more they theorize about his mental stability. Of course, as we see at the end of the book, Queeg did not suffer as much from a psychological problem, as he did from character deficiencies. Greenwald, the attorney for the defense, is able to turn the words of the Freudian psychologist (an expert witness for the prosecution) back upon him, so the psychologist admits that Queeg must have been mentally ill at the time of the mutiny. I find it ironic that using that logic, most readers of this review would be found mentally incompetent as well. What makes this novel successful (aside from good writing) is that Wouk taps into Americas love affair with psychology as the explanation for human behavior. The building of character takes second place to the building of ones self-esteem and mental health. It is a formula for disaster for our society today, as it was for the officers and crew of the Caine.This brings us to the second issue- leadership. It is particularly ironic that Keefer, the real instigator of the mutiny, the junior officer who most lack character, fails when he finally becomes captain of the Caine- he buckles under pressure and prematurely abandons ship after it is attacked leaving our hero, Willie Keith, in charge. As a result of his heroism, Willie becomes the Caines last captain. It is only under the weight of leadership that both Keefer and Keith begin to realize how difficult leadership is and the stress that Queeg was under. They discover that it is easier to complain than to lead, to foment dissension than to encourage, and to second-guess than to take responsibility.Any complaints? Yes one. The portrayal of the black seamen who served as orderlies reflects that time long past. Was there not one back sailor on board who spoke and acted like a man? Of course there was, but too bad Wouk restored to racist stereotypes in his portrayal of these sailors."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Quite simply the best you are probably going to find as far as books go in describing what life onboard a Navy ship is like. What I found amazing is that this book was written about the WW2 Navy and I served in the Desert Storm era navy and there was basically no detectable change other than some of the technology described.But all that aside I think that people who have no interest whatsoever in Sea stories will find that Mr. Wouk understood human nature very well and the characters in this fine book transcend the situation they are described in. Meaning that there are Queegs, Maryks, Keefers, and Keiths running around all over the place (I've worked for a couple of Queegs myself as a matter of fact, I kid you not) and the reading of this book will help them to better understand what motivates people at the core.I found this book fascinating on many levels and nearly impossiblile to put down after I became drawn in. I think there is a little something for everybody in this one, even if you aren't into the whole military setting.Highly reccomended - give it a chance and you won't regret it. Mr. Wouk has made the list of my favorite authors with one attempt, which doesn't happen very often."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Deep, multidimensional characters and an action packed plot make this a great book.

The chief impact of Wouks Caine Mutiny is that the competentestablishment is always in charge and &quot;masterof the situation&quot;. It's a grim lesson we all mustlearn. This is that rare type of tale in which anyreader can place her or himself in at least oneof these characters shoes and say, I've beenthere, done that"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This novel was one of the best that I have read in recent years. At first, I thought it was just going to be a boring story about the navy during WW II. This book turned out to be so much more.At the heart of this novel is a metamorphasis of a boy into a man. This person is, of course, Willie Keith. Herman Wouk really shows how this individual grows up and matures during the course of this novel. The first impression of Keith is of &quot;mama's boy&quot; who is getting into the navy only because it will be easier and safer than the army. As the reader progresses, you see Willie making fewer and fewer mistakes and becoming more responsible. He comes to grips with his relationship with his girlfriend and stands up to his mother.This transformation is so gradual that the reader may not even be aware of it. It hit me at the very end of this book when Willie saves the ship after the kamikaze attack: The Willie Keith that we saw at the beginning of the novel never would have been able to accomplish this."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Although \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" takes place within the context of the Pacific Theater of World War II, it is less a war story than a coming of age epic. There is precious little war in the story, the adventures of the obsolete destroyer-minesweeper, the \\"Caine\\", proving the adage that war is hours of boredom punctuated by a few moments of sheer terror. In the course of the entire novel, the ship participates peripherally in two invasions and suffers one Kamikaze attack that merely causes a single fatality.Much has been analyzed about the seemingly crazy, Captain Queeg, he of the rolling steel balls and the court-martial that follows his removal from command during a typhoon. But over many readings over many decades, he recedes from the forefront, reminding me more of a cranky, unpleasant employer than a psychotic monster. I've dated more fearsome personalities.The core of the story is Willie Keith who transforms much the way the United States does during the war, from being a frivolous and easy-going boy to a man who takes charge of his life and commands a presence; tried and tempered by the challenges of his life aboard ship.Having been a destroyer seaman himself, Wouk is familiar with the lingo, the rituals and the routine aboard a naval vessel to the degree that the reader can feel the pitching of the deck, the smell of the stack gas, the fatigue caused by boredom, humidity and lack of sleep. The characters are so richly drawn that one has to remind oneself that they are fictional. It tells more about the reality of World War II than most novels of its genre.If I had to pick five books to take to the proverbial desert island, this would be my first choice."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny retains its interest after sixty years because it is more than a riveting account of an interesting time and place: it also deals provocatively with two unsolved problems -- America's internal cultural divides and the authoritarian element in organizations.It's a coming-of-age novel where the protagonist must bridge between different socio-religious family traditions to stay with the girl he loves, and where he has to play a role in preserving a balance between organizational efficiency and authoritarian deviations.The social conflict is routine: rich and not-rich, Protestant Northern European and Catholic Southern European. Imho, Wouk gets it right, ironically making it the less engaging of the two conflicts.The work side is tougher. The Naval Court comes to the correct conclusion that the second in command on the Caine had adequate reason to invoke the Navy's exceptional authority to remove the ship's Captain from command, but curiously Wouk then has a number of authority figures contradict the Court.What the seven experienced field commanders composing the court would (or should) have understood in reality is that hierarchy, including the U.S. Navy's, and authoritarianism are not at all the same thing. A well functioning organization needs the one but should have little tolerance for the other.Our U.S. institutional culture continues to underestimate how common and damaging authoritarians like Queeg are. Possibly (I speculate) the intimidating force of authoritarianism made Wouk feel compelled to cover himself by contradicting the Naval Court's decision.On the lighter side, The Caine Mutiny also contributed several clich&eacute;s to our culture: the matched steel ball bearings, the organization \\"designed by geniuses to be run by idiots,\\" and \\"steaming over one's tow line.\\" It's a pleasure to enjoy these in their original setting -- although admittedly the film version with Humphrey Bogart is a pretty close substitute."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"This 1951 novel reads like nothing less than the Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece it is. Bear in mind, too, that this is from a reader who, in his cranky middle age finds very few novels worth taking away from the shelf area, let alone reading through.The story in essence is about a young Princeton blueblood's coming of age, as he is immersed in the crucible of war, mutiny, court martial, the society of those less \\"well-born\\" - including professional-military superiors who test him to the breaking point - a woman whose love is not there for his accustomed, mere plucking - and, of course, the eternal Sea.With symbolism, beautiful sometimes to the point of heart-breaking (war's transformation of Saipan from an idyllic garden island to a smoking, fiery hell affected me deeply - my father took part in that invasion); with lucidly believable dialog and characterization, and a page-turner of a plot (there is no point, during 500 hardcover pages, where the reading even threatens to flag), Herman Wouk has written on the theme of Character with the groundedness in realism, but also all the grace and dignity, such a theme deserves.Review by Woodrow S Charles Willow"},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Herman Wouk's novel of a young ensign entering the Navy an irresponsible youth and exiting as a man he first abhors begins as a coming of age story and ends as a personal rebuke. For most of the story, this rebuke is hidden behind the supposed madness of the ship's unfortunate captain and the increasing angst of the ship's officers. Once removed from the stresses of sea duty and filtered through the hindsight of a Navy lawyer, though, the rebuke becomes clear, as does Wouk's lasting tribute to those who guard our shores and borders in war and in peace.For most, Wouk's story of mutiny at sea has become a classic tale for its empathic characters, twisting plot, and hair raising mutiny. The subsequent trial is absorbing, its cross examinations especially withering. All of these aspects of the story are well appreciated. But for me, the highlight of the book was discovering the rebuke and tribute above--first in Wouk's heroic lawyer, next in his eventually competent protagonist, and finally throughout the midst of his fascinating tale."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Having loved the movie with Humphrey Bogart, I always wanted to read the The Caine Mutiny--and I wasn't disappointed. The book provides many of the same highlights as the film...and more. For example,1. As I had hoped, given the greater depth and insight that a novel can provide as compared to a movie, I found Captain Queeg and his slow descent into paranoia to be more interesting to read than they were to watch on screen. The book seems to make the points (a) that Queeg's psychological problems were the result of a perfect storm of a paranoid personality, an unsupportive crew and a highly stressful environment, and (b) that rather than attempting to tear him down, the men on the ship should have supported Queeg, a volunteer naval officer, for his willingness to fight and support his country. I appreciated this more nuanced approach to Queeg's character than the more superficial treatment given the movie.2. Never having been in the military, I was fascinated to read the description of the system by which the Navy was designed and operates. As one character described it, \\"The Navy is a master plan designed by geniuses for execution by idiots.\\" Initially, right along with the characters, we rebel against the apparently senseless details and rigid structures. Eventually, like the characters, we learn the value and strength of that system--particularly in a time of war, where the ships were populated with a mixture of regular navy and enlisted men.3. We see the maturation of the narrator, and nominal main character, Willie Keith, from a careless mama's boy to a brave, thoughtful and respectful man.4. In the movie, I enjoyed the courtroom scenes and Jose Ferrer's excellent examinations. I thought that Herman Wouk did even a better job with those--other than his cross examination of the psychiatrists, which sounded really dated. Again, the literary form lends itself to a much deeper presentation of the courtoom scenes.The one area I felt the book really fell down was the hot and cold relationship between Willie Keith and May Wynn. Read in 2008, its laughably dated, adds very little to the story, and frankly, is not very well done.All in all, though, even with its shortcomings, I highly recommend this book. The plot moves along swiftly and interestingly (a real page turner), the author's writing style is good (if not great), the character descriptions are fascinating, the courtroom scenes riverting, and the descriptions of the ship and naval procedures opened my eyes to a new world. The moral and ethical implications of a mutiny in a structure which is based almost entirely on blind loyalty to a superior is what takes this novel from being merely a good read, to a classic."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I stumbled across The Caine Mutiny by accident. I was looking for a Tom Wolfe novel and I saw the current cover of this book, which shows a naval officer holding two silver balls. Jokes aside, the cover got my attention. After reading the jacket material, I decided to forget about the \\"new journalist\\" for awhile, and pick up The Caine Mutiny. I enjoy reading WWII history, and figured a pulitzer prize winning novel set in the Pacific theatre of WWII wouldn't be a bad choice.Wouk introduces the reader to the WWII U.S. Navy through the eyes of Willie Keith. I was not impressed with Willie Keith, the protaganist, at the start of the novel. I soon realized that was Wouk's point. The strength in this novel is in character development. Not just with Willie Keith (who grows from momma's boy to confident naval officer), but every character in the novel is more than the cardboard cut-out frequently found in military fiction.The deterioration of Queeq and the growing despair of the officers of the Caine made for great reading. I could not put this book down during the court martial section of the book. I read it over half a day in one sitting.I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Wouk's novels in the future."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I first read this book when I was seventeen, and the passage of nearly forty years has not diminished my regard for it. The characterizations are masterful; the plots and subplots are seamlessly woven together; and, the situations are eminently believable. Anyone having served in the military (irrespective of branch of service, and perhaps even regardless of nation of service) will recognize that the writing perfectly characterizes military life. And, this is not meant to be a detracting comment. Too many Americans believe that life in military service resembles popular TV programs or movies. Nothing is further from the truth (been there, done that!).

Much of what Herman Wouk wrote was; quite possibly, this is his best book although the 'Winds of War' and 'War and Rememberance' are also REALLY good. Obviously, this is a long book: it's also of the kind of book that you, as a reader, would not be overly inclined to put down once you start reading it. As such, I wouldn't get this book unless you have a lot of spare time on your hands (or else you'll have to make it!!!)This book is a must-read for fans of historical fiction. Also, it's a pretty good psuedo-history for people into WWII: it presents a pretty vivid of what life must have been like then.... or so I suppose, having been born a few generations after it's close...."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I picked this up because I loved the movie with Bogart.

This is an engrossing, ingenious, and well-written story of ordinary men at sea, placed in an uncommon predicament. Their predicament is simple: their captain is a spectacularly bad leader. This leads to consequences that Wouk develops brilliantly. Wouk's own experience in the US Navy gives this book a gritty authentic feel. The reader really gets a flavor of what it must have been like to be a junior US Naval officer aboard a destroyer-minesweeper. The discussions of officer efficiency reports, the codebreaking duty, casual discipline, and more, all ring true.The real story is the maturation of Willie Keith. At the beginning of the novel he is a spoiled, overprivileged lad living an aimless life. His time in the service, and the unusual predicament in which he finds himself, hardens him into a true fighting-man in a way that has happened to countless thousands of servicemen. Wouk tells this story exceedingly well, in a manner that most readers will be able to easily relate to. I found this novel to be an unusually good read primarily for this reason. Wouk's writing is first-rate, and it is easy to see why this novel appealed to readers of the early 1950s, many of them with fresh memories of World War Two. The flavor of that war lingers in the novel even today, and gives the twenty-first century reader a notion of what those times were like.This is altogether a remarkably good novel, deserving of every one of its five stars."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Please read this book.I was assigned it in high school English, and thought, &quot;Oh great, another war book.&quot; I took it home, began my first 4 chapter assignment, and realized 3 hours later that I was halfway through it. I finished it the next day. That was ten years ago, and I have been rereading it at least twice a year ever since. I read it to my husband on a cross-country journey and the miles went by like nothing. It never fails to involve me, and I never fail to be moved by the ending.A few reviewers have said that the book is hard to understand, or that there is too much military jargon, but there really isn't; there was nothing in there that a seventeen-year-old girl couldn't understand (at least, a seventeen-year-old who knows how to spell &quot;squat&quot;.)This book is powerful, funny, insightful, and moving. Don't pass it up."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I first opened this book late one summer evening at the age of twenty-two. Even then, I knew after the first few pages that I was beginning to read a classic. And there is nothing more enjoyable than knowing you are going to be entertained for hours on end by a great story.It's about a care-free Willis Seward Keith, who enters World War II and the navy as a rich, immature boy, and develops his manhood and maturity through the backdrop of war, and the sufferance of an emotionally disturbed captain.The boy that goes to war is not the responsible man who comes home. He has the confidence of a man who has learned to lead men, and developed self assurance through his accomplishments rather than his wealth. It is probably how each of us wish that we would develop to the challenges of manhood that define us.As the book says, Ensign Keith is not the center of the mutiny, but he is to the mutiny the same as the single jewel bearing that opens or closes a vault door.Herman Wouk is a story-teller of classic stature. His work will always be counted amongst the finest literary achievements.This is one of the two most memorable books I have ever read. It has been 33 years since I read \\"The Caine Mutiny.\\" I bought another after the pages of my original could no longer be kept between the covers. That's the best recommendation I can make."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny was my first adult novel -- I was 12 when I read it, only a few years after it won the Pulitzer. I had just seen the film, and was surprised to find the book far richer. However much I enjoyed it, however, I nevertheless failed to grasp the points the author was making; that clarity did not appear until I read it again many years later as an Army officer with over fifteen years' service.I recently read quite a few online reviews, and they reflect a much more contemporary viewpoint -- the original context of the novel is lost in time. One reviewer thought the mood and point of the book were \\"Faschistic\\"; others concluded that the point was \\"it's okay to buck the system.\\" I was reminded of a colleague on the faculty at West Point who was teaching a cadet elective in psychology of abnormal behavior who used a clip of Bogart's performance on the stand at the court-martial as an example of disordered paranoid ideation. Sometimes I wonder what book all these people read!This is a novel of war, seen through the eyes of a nonprofessional officer of incisive intelligence, one both inside and outside the Navy system and possessed of ability to look beyond the moment. Many readers (or movie fans) somehow completely miss the story's central issue and the critical turn of plot. Captain Queeg was not crazy; he was overwhelmed by the burdens of command, but would probably have muddled through if his officers had managed to put aside petulant resentment and work to compensate for the captain's flaws. Instead, they put a combat vessel out of action during a critical period in the Pacific campaign.How anyone can misinterpret Wouk's intent is a mystery to me -- the author sets us up for the lawyer Barney Greenwald's famous demolition of the slippery intellectual Tom Keefer, then hammers the point home after the climax when Keefer proves himself no more fit for command than Queeg.We see this through the eyes (though not the narrative persona) of Willie Keith, whose character matures as the result of hard lessons in the affair; to an extent, this is a Bildungsroman for the character. Are modern readers less perceptive than the frivolous Willie? The author neither proposes a Fascist call for blind obedience nor justifies bucking the system for the sake of independence of thought.The relevance of the novel is undiminished after more than fifty years; moral dilemmas are the stuff of war, all wars, since war is the most daunting dilemma of all."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Why is this book so great? Why did it win a Pulitzer Prize? Not because it was an engrossing story of the WWII Navy, which it was. Rather because it has all the elements that make a novel great. Herman Wouk is brilliant at characterization and unlike many other good characterizers such as Steven King, he does it almost with the brevity of a Hemingway. With just a few descriptive scenes of Queeg, the reader can already understand him and pity him recognizing that he is not a traditional villain but a flawed and sad neurotic. From the rolling of the balls to the &quot;sinking of his head into his shoulders&quot; to his way of saying &quot;kay&quot; instead of okay, Queeg's flaws are laid out. When he manipulates reality to justify his actions, one can feel sorry for him rather than hate him. He ultimately comes across as a sad and tragic figure. As for the others, Willie Keith is the protagonist and no character undergoes greater growth than him. This is really what the novel is about, Willie's coming of age and it is a great coming of age story. Rather than have his protagonist mature against the crucible of great battle (as he later does with a number of characters in War and Remembrance which is much more of an epic but not as great a novel), he chooses to portray the day to day existence of a backwater minesweeper which is just on the periphery of the war. And by doing so he avoids all the standard cliches which is also what makes this novel great. In the end, the book clearly has no villains except circumstance. Even Keefer, the pseudo-intellectual who really causes all the trouble, is way to self-aware of his own flaws to be villainous (he is mentally healthy by contrast with Queeg who cannot face up to a single flaw or mistake in himself) I could go on and on but this book is an American classic that doesn't seem one bit dated despite its 1951 publication date. I recommend it to anyone who likes literature."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"For good reason, Herman Wouk was awarded the Pulitzer prize for his writing of the Caine Mutiny. The book has everything one could ask for in a book. It is incredibly well written. He has in-depth character development. It takes place during a war so action is a prevalent theme. A love story lurks in the background. The conclusion holds one of the greatest courtroom dramas in modern writing.First the war backdrop: no one describes it better. The reader truly understands the feelings of the crew of the USS Caine. We can see the tension of war as well as the feelings of serving in the Navy. Wouk does not hesitate to illustrate the good and bad of this perspective.The love story just hangs on throughout the book and keeps the reader on edge attempting to find out what happens. For much of the book it seems the love story is forgotten. Just when it seems that we will never hear what happened, Wouk ties it in unexpectedly but in a very shrewd manner.Of course the courtroom drama (which went on to spawn a separate play) is the best military court martial story I have read. The reader truly feels as if they are in the courtroom.Wouk never hesitates to provide a greatd deal of descriptive visualiazations and in-depth character development. These truly aid the reader in his quest to finish teh book. Honestly, I was moved at times and could not wait to find out teh conclusion. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Most Americans have probably seen the classic Humphrey Bogart film adaptation of this book. Indeed, the plots are very similar, and the casting, with one exception, was terrific.Which brings me to the surprise... Willy Keith. Turns out Willy is really a rich, musically talented New Yorker, a little chubby, and quite immature; not the wooden pretty boy we saw in the Film. Indeed the first 100 pages of the book deal with Willy, his musical career, his relationship with his girlfriend, his troubles as a Navy cadet. Beore he sets foot on the Caine, we have the makings of a film in and of itself.Wouk carefully shows how events, even facts, which we see with our own eyes, can be interperted in dramatically different ways, how very few issues, and NO people, are drawn in black and white. The characters are robust and multi-dimensional, and the relationships between the officers and crew of the Caine, as well as the seemingly all-powerful Naval commands all boil down to decisions and interpertations of flawed men -- and as the doctors tell us during the court martial, none of them is without some form of mental instability; it's simply a matter of how we compensate or adjust to those shortcomings. All of the major characters go through a fascinating self-assessment process, and wind up as different people by the end.An engaging, enjoyable book, even for someone who's seen the film a dozen times."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"The Caine Mutiny, by Herman Wouk, is an exceptional novel that really brings the navy to life. Joining the navy to avoid the army, Willie Keith, a young, restless piano player from New York, gets swept into a world of water, lunacy, and honor. He draws duty on a rundown old destroyer-minesweeper, the worst job in the entire navy. On top of this is his incompetent and mentally disturbed captain, upon whom a monumental controversy is centered.I recommend this book because it offers insight into life on a naval ship during the heat of the pacific conflict. Typhoons, kamikazes, and mutinies are just some of the surprises that you will encounter as you read the book. Surprisingly, there isn't any traditional combat, but that just emphasizes the uniqueness of the book. As if that were not enough, add in one loony captain nicknamed Old Yellowstain. You will enjoy searches of the entire ship for a single key, secret logs, and court-martials. Another reason to read this book is that it is a great adventure story. You really get to know Willie Keith as he climbs up the ladder of naval command, defends himself in a courtroom, and dates May Winn, his singer girlfriend. Sometimes you will wish you were right there next to Willie as he sails into combat, and sometimes you will be glad you are sitting at home reading as he is attacked by a kamikaze.If you are a real action lover, you may be initially disappointed when you cannot find any traditional fights. If gun blazing duels are all you are looking for, this is not the book for you, but if you want high seas adventure, with lots of drama, unexpected incidents, and the ever-present slightly corny love story, dig in! If you are still reading this and not ordering the book already, you should. This book has it all, adventure, romance, drama, and what every book should have, a bit of lunacy. But don't just take my word for it, listen to this opinion from... John Johnson; \\"This is a great book\\". Wow, that says it all."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"I think I read this book some 15 times. Still every time I close the back cover I feel like I lose contact to good friends: Willie, Steve Maryk, Tom Keefer... and even LtCmdr. Queeg. My all-time-favourite, a must-read."},{"Title":"The Caine mutiny","review":"Good literature can transport the reader into the world of the book. Great literature enters the world of the reader. &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; is great literature. Many have seen the movie so I can say a little about the story. Set on an obsolete destroyer-minesweeper during World War II, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;, seen through the eyes of a young officer, Willie Keith, tells the story of an inadequate captain whose mismanagement leads to his relief from command when a crisis confronts the ship. With romance and a domineering mother, the book intertwines several stories which hold the reader's interest.Perhaps a Navy veteran would see much about the service in &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;, I do not know. Although it is set on a naval vessel in wartime, it is much more than a war story, although that it is. I saw much about life in it. It contains instances and characters which I encounter in a life about as far from the Caine as one can imagine. This ability of this book to enter into the world of the reader, even as the reader enters the world of the book, earns &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; a place in the canon of great literature.I enjoy reading, but I cannot remember a book which I was so loath to set down. This book is a real page turner. Years ago my father told me to watch the movie, which I did. I finally took his advise the next step and read the book. Since I cannot return the favor, I will pass it on.

This perceptive collection identifies the issues and analyses what is behind this Europe-wide antagonism.A new antisemitism is sweeping Europe, and Britain is not been immune. A rise in 'street-level' violence against Jews and synagogues has allegedly been accompanied by an 'elite', or salon, antisemitism - manifested in the media, university common rooms and the dinner parties of the chattering classes. For some commentators, such contemporary expressions of old hatreds represent a 'new antisemitism'. But is this really a new phenomenon? Is it antisemitism - or something else? How does it compare with earlier incarnations of Jew-hatred? Who are its perpetrators? And to what extent has the situation in the Middle East contributed to the rise in anti-Jewish sentiments and rhetoric? Has demonisation of Israel only inflamed the issue - or are claims of antisemitism being used in an attempt to silence criticism of Israeli policies? This book debates these questions in greater depth than can be found in the print and broadcast media in a collection of essays by leading Jewish intellectuals, including Geoffrey Alderman, Richard Bolchover, Douglas Davis, Ronnie Fraser, Jonathan Freedland, Howard Jacobson, Antony Julius, Edward Kessler, John Levy, Tony Lerman, Melanie Phillips, Winston Pickett, Peter Pulzer, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Kate Taylor, Michael Whine and Robert Wistrich.A valuable contribution to analysis of the current surge in anti-SemitismWill stimulate debate in Britain, Europe and the USAGives an unusually broad range of divergent and contrasting opinionProvides a lively mix of written formats: journalism, scholarship and polemicWritten by leading commentators and expertsPaul Iganski is Lecturer in Sociology and Criminology, University of Essex, and Civil Society Fellow at the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, London.

British attitudes towards the Jews of Israel have had their ups and downs. This book tells us where things now stand.We see that violent antisemitic incidents have gone up somewhat in the past couple of decades. And I noted with interest that such incidents tend to occur at about the same time as anti-Jewish violence in Israel. That is, we're seeing violence that is in sympathy with the terrorist attacks in Israel.Jonathan Sacks makes some excellent points. First that antisemitism exists whenever people simultaneously believe that Jews are so powerful that they are responsible for the evils of the world and that Jews are so weak that they can be attacked with impunity. He dismisses the possibility that such attitudes are caused by Jews, given the extreme antisemitism we see in countries where there are no Jews at all. And he points out how this hatred puts the hater in at least as much risk as the hated.We see a silly essay from Antony Lerman explaining that antizionism is not antisemitism. But surely, the fact that one makes antisemitic remarks is insufficient to prove that one is Not an antisemite!Jonathan Freedland also argues that antizionists may be sincere, consistent, and not antisemites. After all, they say that Israel's existence caused the dispossession of Arabs! But he's wrong. Yes, they say it. But they don't care if they are telling the truth or not. And in fact, what they say is false.Douglas Davis writes an excellent essay exposing outright antisemitism by the BBC. And Winston Pickett examines the use of standard antisemitic \\"topoi\\" by some of the British media.My favorite of the articles was by Melanie Phillips, on Christian theology and the new antisemitism. She shows how many so-called liberals, for theological reasons, have decided to support the terrorists and describe the victims as monsters. And that's a problem that I think extends well beyond the fate of the small nation of Israel."},{"Title":"Stones from the walls of Jericho: The Official Bicentennial History of Bainbridge, New York","review":"This hard cover book is the official bicentennial history of Bainbridge, New York. The most famous person who ever came out of that little village is Jedediah Smith who was called \\"The Pathfinder of the Sierras\\". He was the first white man to find a way through the Sierra Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. He was killed by Commanche Indians and died at a young age. He also was mauled at one time by a bear. He was a real man's man.This book is based on the historical notes of Dr. Edward Danforth. He was the village doctor for decades and when he was waiting for a woman to deliver her baby he would ask about the history of the home he was in. He was also exceedingly curious about all that he experienced and took copious notes. These notes were arranged by the members of the Bainbridge Historical Society into a fluid, cohesive history of the village. Some of the chapters cover such subjects as: the churches, businesses, education, library, transportation, houses, early settlers and the village fathers.Along with the notes are hundreds of historical photographs as well as contemporary photographs of the village. The photos would easily justify the price of the book and at $24.00 it is still the same price it was when it was published 23 years ago. The notes of the doctor along with the over 500 visuals make this book one of the most remarkable histories ever produced by such a small village.Currently the book is in its fourth printing and has sold over 1500 copies. It has gone to almost all 50 states and a number of foreign countries.

I found myself easily believing I was reading an account written by a young woman in the 18th century, with matter of fact observations on race and men consistent with that time. The language is a delight to read, but as I was pleasantly carried along I began to wonder where the story was going. When a character using the occult entered the story, I had hope of the plot thickening but, alas, it didn't. Part II, which seemed very contrived and rushed, was disappointing."},{"Title":"Cambridge","review":"I enjoyed Cambridge. The story is told from multiple perspectives which would explain the open ending. Who's version is the truth? How are their interpretations of events determined by their different cultural backgrounds? How do these multiple versions of a history comment upon the historical representation of actual Caribbean and African colonization? The characters are complex and contradictory - likeable and detestable all at once. One gets a glimpse into colonial life, attitudes and beliefs - not just one sided but as they probably were, complex, multiple, and contradictory.

I cannot even think of a place to begin describing my intense, deep hatred toward the book Cambridge by Caryl Phillips. I think that it might have been more fun, and less painful to gnaw my arm off and beat myself with it. I found the story's characters confusing. I didn't even know the main character's name until the Epilogue (page 177). The title character, Cambridge, didn't seem important enough to name the book after, and I didn't understand his personality. Nor could I interpret what Stella's (another key character) intents were. I also thought that plot was filled with gaps, and was never concluded. I finished the book with many unresolved ends. The book reads as poetry. For example: &quot;I stepped out into the night to breathe the delicious mildness of the air, and to refresh my spirit (46).&quot; I found this not only difficult to read and distracting to the plot, or lack there of. More importantly than that, I don't think that anyone speaks like that, not even in the books intended time period. This made the book unbelievable to me. Because I could not read more than 20 pages at a time without falling asleep, I couldn't get into the book. When Phillips used African American speech habits they too were not believable. for example: &quot;Misses, misses, you please to bye me a comb for me to tick in my head (Phillips 124),&quot; When Phillips made a character talk, I thought it was awkward, and it broke the mood of the paragraph.I would Strongly suggest finding another book.Their Eyes Were Watchin God, by Zora Neale Hurston is a book that I would suggest for a better read on a similar topic."},{"Title":"Dinkelmann's Rules: A Dot-Comedy of Errors","review":"This book takes you deep into the inner world of the rollercoaster lives of the early dotcommers.

The authors discuss the differences between concepts and ideas distinguishing of each quadrant, particularly as they relate to passive income and tax advantages. As a self-help author, Kiyosaki invites readers to consider their own ideas about money.Some readers may find the examples given in the book as false, misleading and even dangerous. Please treat these examples not as direct recipes but as fiction illustrations. Those who scrutinize these cases simply cannot see the forest for the trees. Debating Kiyosaki's assertions is a nitpicking. Some people may also criticize the authors for being overly repetitious in his teachings. They consider this a tactic to produce \\"filler\\" material in order to make it appear the authors are covering more material. I do not agree with these accusations.

If you are Catholic, or even Protestant--because Van Loon does justice to neither--Chapters 16 and 17 of Light of the Nations (Catholic Textbook Project) will give you a much better idea of the errors of the Church then, and of the Counter-reformation. For an older, wiser History student it would be OK, as Van Loon does have some delightful style bits and innovative History-telling perspectives. The book, is important to note, changes drastically in format midpoint, as if if the author pieced together things he had done in the past. The chapters become much longer and the reading/student level quite older.

But is it also an opinionated, old-fashioned, wistful, and occasionally angry snapshot of the state of civilization, and more importantly **how educated people in Europe and America thought**, right after World War I, before Fascism and Communism were to wreck the world once again.Van Loon was born in the \\"old Europe\\", immigrated to and was educated in America. In 1921 he found himself on the threshold between a destroyed civilization and the rebirth of a new one. Now, as Earth begins to endure yet another cycle of destruction and renewal, those with open and especially young minds should read this book, put themselves in the shoes of Van Loon in 1921, duly note its anachonisms, and put aside policial correctness to think constructively about the never-ending cycles of history."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"Written in 1922 , this book is a history of the world from pre-historic man to the First World War , written in a rather satirical , philosophical and whimsical style that makes it a great piece of literature.He deals quite comprehensively for 400 pages with this broad work on civilization.It also flows nicely.It is fascinating to read of the murder by the Bolsheviks of the Romanov family , as described by the author as a recent event.It is indeed written from the perspective of 1922:\\"The world has just passed through an agony of pain compared to which the French Revolution was a mere incident. The shock has been so great that it has killed the last spark of hope in the breasts of millions of men. They were chanting a hymn of progress, and four years of slaughter followed their prayers for peace. \`\`Is it worth while,'' so they ask, \`\`to work and slave for the benefit of creatures who have not yet passed beyond the stage of the earliest cave men?'' \\"That being said , the work is not free of the authors own prejudices.A incorrect bit is his refferal to the ancient Land of Israel as Palestine , when speaking about he entry of the Hebrews into that land in 1700 BC.The term \\"Palestine\\" came from the name that the conquering Roman Empire gave the ancient Land of Israel in an attempt to obliterate and de-legitimize the Jewish presence in the Holy Land. The name \\"Palestine\\" was invented in the year 135 C.E. Before it was known as Judea, which was the southern kingdom of ancient Israel. The Roman Procurator in charge of the Judean-Israel territories was so angry at the Jews for revolting that he called for his historians and asked them who were the worst enemies of the Jews in their past history. The scribes said, \\"the Philistines.\\" Thus, the Procurator declared that Land of Israel would from then forward be called \\"Philistia\\" [further bastardized into \\"Palaistina\\"] to dishonor the Jews and obliterate their history. Hence the name \\"Palestine.\\""},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"Every child should read this book.

I'm an avid student of history, and this is the best. More critical history of the world is compressed into this tiny book that I ever imagined possible. I continue to re-read it to gain perspective on history.Additionally, it is a great pleasure to read. A tremendous pleasure. It's like reading Arabian Nights. It will instill in kids a love of history, and that is as good as a hundred books on history.Furthermore, it taught me a few critical things about history:1. Histories from one man's viewpoint really are the best kind. It is precisely the fact that Van Loon is with us, telling us the story, that makes it so exciting. A textbook with multiple authors and diligent weeding out of all viewpoint makes for passionless writing, and pleasureless reading. On the contrary, points of view animate us. They may indeed bias us, but they will motivate us to seek other points of view.2. Be kind to people and places different from your own. You might have done the same thing in that situation. Van Loon has a lot of sympathy for the people of history, and he explains to us why they did the things they did."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"I have seen some criticism that this book isn't religiously sensitive, glosses points or seems to be from one man's perspective. The thing about history is that, like the present, everyone interprets things differently. If Van Loon was to explore every opinion of every historical event in human history the book (apart from filling a stadium) would lose its blatant charm. For religiously historical stories of a less practical nature, one should really read their particular religion's prescribed texts.I found the book to be flambuoyant and enhanced by humour and opinion - qualities rarely found in history books. I have a copy of the original book and will be buying the revised version to bring it up to date.As Van Loon said - why buy story books when history is far more exciting?"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"I came across this book several years ago.

Beginning with probable cavemen's cultural dawn, Van Loon describes Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and European civilizaitons and histories (except one chapter for Indian and Chinese). This book must be especialy good for teens to start with human history. It is written in easy way but doesn't miss the major historical episodes and how the history flows and transits. The book also makes me smile often because it has plenty of jokes. And I like also van Loon's way of expressing and metaphores. It is too bad I could not find his other books from the stores."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"I returned the book because it was only the text. There are NO illustrations.

But when I ordered \\"The Story of Man\\", I had no idea the full-color illustrations and maps he designed to accompany the text were missing. Instead I got an A4-sized bound copy that advertised on the cover \\"High Quality Paperback\\". Hardly. The font is suitable only for manuscripts, not finished books, and the type is so light it's hard to see the text. Curiously, the editors used (sic) to point out mistakes in the original copy, but added many typos of their own, which of course were left untouched. But much worse is the missing maps and illustrations, which are an intimate part of the story. For example, his chapter on how hieroglyphics were invented and developed is incomprehensible without the four accompanying illustrations. It is worth reading his spirited histories (there are many of them) and contemplating his frequent original observations -- if you can get the illustrated version. It's a pity that of all the books the publishers could choose from, they picked this one and then left out what makes it special."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"I read this book in my 30s or 40s, many years ago.

It is a too typical mis-history, spawned from the British school of \\"let's white-out the real genocidal history of Protestantism\\". I am reviewing the 1984 edition. Despite its wonderful presentation, this book is too radical and too slanted to be recommended as a properly balanced source for use in educating children.Uniformed Catholic bashing is ubiquitous in our Anglosphere. I realize many will think I am mistaken in my opinion However no one should excuse jingoistic historical amnesia, no matter how commonly it is accepted.For example, the sadistic exploits of \\"Bloody Elizabeth\\" are swept under the rug. An a small antidote to this book's unbalanced Catholic versus Protestant view of British history, I might recommend the recent book, \\"God's Secret Agents: by Alice Hogge (Harper Collins Publishers).The book's analysis of the Middle Ages is characterized by self-justifying inventions rather objective accuracy.

I presented it Jan 29 and have not heard how she likes it. I think it will be a favorite since it was a winner of the first Newberry prize."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"All of us have that book which we remember fondly from childhood, that one book we saw in the school library which we wish were ours so we could keep it in our own private place and read over and over again. Van Loon's Story of Mankind is that book for me. Van Loon does a tremendous service to the study of history. Even though this is a childrens book Van Loon does not ignore or alter the facts of history so that he can comfort instead of educate the child who may be reading the book. And even though the book reads like one big bedtime story, Van Loon always tries to remain objective and never force his opinion on the reader. When he talks about Napolean he makes it very obvious that he does not like the man or what he stood for, but he also tells the reader that his grandfather fought alongside the man and that he(Van Loon) would have probably fought alongside him as well, that's just the kind of man Napolean was. At an age where you will believe almost anything told to you, especially by a man who has written a book, Van Loon tries to give the child both an appreciation for history and a sense of objectivity about events. This was one of the first books, if not the first book, that showed me that everything is not always black and white, good and evil, but shades and gradations of good and evil. I read this to all my nephews, and when they don't know what to read I hand them this book, hoping it will make them a wiser person for listening to Van Loon's lessons."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"THE STORY OF MANKIND is a delight. Contrast its wit and insight with the typical history textbooks to which our young are routinely subjected--as ably described by education historian Diane Ravitch:\\"The dullness of history textbooks is legendary. I am involved right now in a study of history textbooks, and I must say that I have trouble reading them because of their jumbled, jangly quality. I also have trouble lifting them because they are so heavy and overstuffed with trivia and pedagogical aids. With one or maybe two exceptions, most textbooks put more emphasis on visual glitz than on the quality of their text. By the time that these books emerge from the political process that is called state adoption, they lack voice and narrative power. They lack the very qualities that make historical writing exciting. Our history textbooks are distracting, and I don't know how students learn anything from them.\\"Van Loon's book won the first Newberry Prize, quite an achievement for a book on world history. \\"The Story of Mankind\\" remains a great read for any child thirteen and up (and up)."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF MANKIND","review":"This is a classic history book written for children (probably ages eleven to fourteen) which can be fascinating even for adults. The book still rings true in 1999. In 1922, it won the very first Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature (the Melcher family had just established the John Newbery Medal). It concentrates mostly on European history since van Loon, in the early 1920s, is attempting to explain those factors that were present in the world at that time. His son William has written several new chapters which expand this view (his father had passed away in 1944). And, I have seen editions that are furthur updated. But, the elder van Loon simply had a style of writing history that seems attractive to children. I saw a previous edition of this book by van Loon when I was a kid and always wanted to read it.

It sparked an interest in history in me that has burned bright ever since. It, by itself, almost caused me to become a history major in college. Van Loon's style and presentation was the key. Instead of a dry recitation of dates and people, Van Loon puts you on the scene, you can smell the campfires, the thoughts the common folk might have had as they participated in the events, great and not so great, of our roots. As a sublime introduction to history for the young adult, a perfect follow-up for the adult reader is the &quot;Outline of History&quot; by H.G. Wells.

Modern editors have tried to bring the book up to date by including major world events since van Loon originallywrote the book, but their writing doesn't have the insight that made van Loon's writings what they are.Van Loon traces the history of mankind from the beginning, starting with a brief geologic description of planet earth.His writing makes it seem as if you are reading a docu-drama, and you'll keep wishing that he could spend moretime on each topic.I especially enjoyed the sections on the middle ages and renaissance, and this book serves as a goodintroduction to history for children with writing that brings history to life.At times, given when this book was originally written, you may be struck by van Loon's eurocentric flavor, butoverall, he does a remarkable job in providing a well balanced presentation of all major world events. He does a great job oflooking at major world religions.This is not an exhaustive epic of the history of humanity, ratherit is an excellent introduction to history.

Sure there are more scholarly volumes written on the rise of humanity but the author takes our collective tale and puts it in a form in which children can understand and adults can draw joy from. By all means this is a kids book but when you consider how many of us have been pushed away and unknowingly punished by history professors who thought it more important to tell us dates and not the story of the people making the dates significant, this book can be a valuable asset to adults. In a world which is being dumbed down this story, written on a childs level, may even be more apperciated. However to say this text is &quot;DUMB&quot; or lacking intelligence and well crafted words would be an injustice.. It's an incredible book. I have the hard back volume and it will stay in my family for the rest of time. I look forward to the day when my youngest son returns it to me after reading it and says, &quot;Thanks dad&quot;.

So far I haven't encountered such a well-written book that is dedicated to teaching children about history. The schoolbooks may have fancy pictures, text, and so on, but they always drone on and on using whole pages for one simple thought or idea. The Story of Mankind is different, in a simple but extraordinary way. The book reaches out to all parts of history yet does not run around important details to get to a slightly larger event. In my eyes, The Story of Mankind is more interesting and teaches more than the typical schoolbook. I can't understand why schools don't include this book in their history program. If this book were a part of the curriculum I would be very content knowing that a great Newberry book is being read in every school and possibly by every person in the world.

One interesting rant about his major premonition about the Roman Empire and how it was defeated by a child in Bethlehem.

They focus only on the aspects of working with spherical gemstones. While they attempt to deny the validity of working with minerals in their natural forms, there are many useful lessons to be learned from this book.Each Gemstone Guardian is met in his or her own vignette, and the reader really does begin to feel the excitement of the stories presented. However, there are many names invented for the use of this book and all of Katz's successive works. Gemsiphere Institute only works with a limited number of stones, although that number is growing. While they have greatly helped the crystal healing communities by providing concise, updated information in an original format, as well as stressing the importance of safety measures and the necesity for a certain standard in healing, I feel that they have also done a slight disservice to the community.Natural crystals are thought to be sub-par, despite the fact that their uses and energetic blueprints are being very well mapped out. Physical alteration of a minerals outer form, such as shaping it into a sphere, in no way changes the inner morphologies and symmetries presented by the internal arrangements of chemical elements and mineral bases. While the symbology of gemstone spheres runs deep, the energy emitted by them is not necessarily any different from that of any other piece of a given mineral. The inner lattice creates a very precise arrangement of the energy transmitted by a crystal, whether or not the external form is visible.Aside from that, this book truly is an exciting read, which is the main reason that it received 4, rather than 3, stars."},{"Title":"Wisdom Of The Gemstone Guardians","review":"I highly enjoyed this book. I read some of the other reviews and I understand how opinions can differ about it. It is true, it is probably not a book for beginners unless they are very openminded about certain things. I also understand how the author's emphasis on the spherical form of crystals can be a matter of controversy. However, it does make sense to me that the energy emanated from spheres would be different than from any other form. The guardians he interviews emphasise actually that the consciousness of mankind is now ready for the use of gemstones in spherical form. That means it is a development that humankind is growing into right now, so there still naturally is a transition period and it doesn't mean that crystals in other form are not valid or working. The sphere works differently, more potent for todays consciousness, that's how I understand it. I personally don't work with crystals, but read this book more for interest in the background information about our planet, history, and the subtle bodies (astral, causal, mental bodies and so on). As for the mentioning of extraterrestrials planting certain crystals, or trading for crystals, well it depends how openminded one is. I have been around these ideas for a while so they are not 'weird' or foreign to me (I grew up in a household where it was common to discuss that extraterrestrias really had helped mankind along in their development, such as helped build the pyramids, offered knowledge about agriculture and so on; so why would it be strange to think they also help the development of crystals along. With that being said, as the author also says in the book, keep some discrimination as not all extraterrestrials are of good intention!). It helps to remember that the universe might be far more fantastic than what we commonly assume, and this book is a good reminder for that."},{"Title":"Wisdom Of The Gemstone Guardians","review":"I bought this book since it has a chapter on building a crystal pharmacy. Little did I know that the author was referring to himself and reveals nothing to the reader as to how he/she should go about it with the exception of 'buy my line of presumably overpriced, crystal necklaces'. The author has written this book as a pretense to sell you his product line of necklaces and I RESENT IT. Here are two examples: the book comes with a postcard inserted in it to order the author's catalog and on pg 287 (I paraphrase) 'Anyone fortunate enough to own a strand of Lapis Lazuli spheres are really lucky to own such a wonderful tool.' The author 'talks' to the 'guardians of each crystal and they have explained to him what their powers are and how to construct these special necklaces that only he knows now how to do properly. But lucky for the reader, he can sell them to you...Blah, blah, blah, This book will end up in the next garage sale.

This simple but very pleasing tale of Kipper and Tiger enjoying the snow really is a popular one in our house. They love hearing about the dogs rolling down the hill, Tiger being sure the snow will be gone soon, and the dogs making their version of snow animals. Recently when we got a good sized snow, both of my boys acted out a lot of what they had heard in this book in the real snow!"},{"Title":"Kipper's Snowy Day","review":"very good book my 4 y.o love it disk is in very good condition too thank you so much!very"},{"Title":"Kipper's Snowy Day","review":"In this fun and cheery book, Kipper awakens to find that it has snowed outside. Grabbing his scarf, he heads outside to explore the new-fallen snow. Soon, he's making tracks and snow dogs all across the garden. He ventures to Big Hill, where he finds his friend Tiger. Tiger is dressed in silly clothes that the snow sticks to. Kipper shows his snow dog game to Tiger, but Tiger is unable to get up, and soon he's rolling head over heels down the hill. Instead of being scared, Tiger enjoys this activity very much. Tiger and Kipper spend the rest of their day rolling down the hill, and they build a huge snow dog at the bottom.This is an excellent book for preschool children. The story is very fun, and the pictures are bright and colorful. My children are big fans of the Kipper television show, and this is one of their favorite books to hear when going to bed. I highly recommend this fun book. Your children will enjoy watching Tiger and Kipper play in the snow."},{"Title":"Kipper's Snowy Day","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. This book reminded me of all the fun times my friends and I had when we were younger. I liked this book also, because of the things that Kipper, and Tiger do together, they make their own fun. Even though Tiger dos not like the silly woolly snow suit, they make it funny. I liked when they were rolling down the hill, then how they used all the snow to make a dog.Kipper and Tiger will always find ways to have fun. This great variety of books as well as the television series, and movies that have been made, Kipper is vey popular. I would recommend this book for children ages 2-8, because I think anyone can enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Rogue Asteroids and Doomsday Comets: The Search for the Million Megaton Menace That Threatens Life on Earth","review":"Three events in the past decade have caused a great deal of interest in objects around us in space. Giotto's encounter with Halleys Comet, Hubble Space Telescope pictures of the Shoemaker/Levy comet crashing onto Jupiter and lastly the naked eye sightings of the Hale/Bopp Comet we have enjoyed earlier in the year. Originally from Somerset, Duncan Steel now works at the Anglo-Australian Observatory and his book provides a very readable account of the nature and movements of these very varied objects.Ever since the first pictures of other planets and in particular their moons arrived, studies have been made of their cratering records. Pictures from space have also been the main method of detecting craters but this time down on earth where plate tectonics, erosion, sediments or vegetation tend to erase them.Astronomy and Geology linked up when cosmic impact events were suggested as possible cause or trigger for some of the major extinctions we find in the fossil record. The effects of both solar and cosmic cycles on all aspects of life on the planet are now widely studied.Mr. Steel gives an account of a very bright meteor seen by many people in 1993 in New South Wales. When asked for an estimate of how soon it would before another such sighting to occur the answer was given in years. One week later, however, an object estimated to be 2-3 meters in size and traveling at 30Km/Sec exploded 18Km overhead with the amount of energy produced by a Hiroshima Bomb. Events such as these and the trail of impacts left on Jupiter show that objects in space are certainly not solitary. Lines of craters have been found on other moons in the system. Comet Hale/Bopp provided a spectacular sight a few months ago but for now the interest is in the debris and dust they and asteroids can leave behind often in highly eccentric trails across our orbit. Gravitational forces and solar wind affect the objects and the trails have a structure and it is the &quot;busy&quot; parts of the belt which give the peaks to meteor showers as we pass. The widely varying time scales which have been linked with extinctions and other cycles are the result of earth and solar system moving round the galaxy.The possible effects of a large impact, global warming, ice ages, large fire storms or basalt floods have all been discussed elsewhere but the book considers several other theories. A large object landing in the ocean could cause a truly instant catastrophe.This is the tsunami wave which can be caused by earthquakes or large undersea slope collapse. Islands in the middle of the Pacific can feel the effects of activity right across the ocean. The sloping continental shelves amplify the height of the waves and in low lying areas they can reach well in land. Observations of the cratering pattern on Mercury led to one theory where the shock waves from a large impact travel round the globe and fracture the crust on the opposite side. Reconstruction of the continents at the times of suggested impact events seems to make it possible to link basalt floods such as the Deccan traps with their &quot;opposite&quot; partner.The remainder of the book deals with the problems involved first in detecting objects which may be a threat to the earth and also discusses what or how anything could be done about it. The pictures of S/L 9 described as a &quot;string of pearls&quot; as it approached Jupiter show just how much of a problem this could prove. For a book foundon the astronomy shelves in the library this one provided a very interesting read and shows that we on earth are not alone in space."},{"Title":"Rogue Asteroids and Doomsday Comets: The Search for the Million Megaton Menace That Threatens Life on Earth","review":"I liked the book, but do not rate it as highly as \\"Rain of Iron and Ice\\" by John S. Lewis and \\"Impact\\" by Gerrit L Verschuur. However, it is much better than \\"Fire on Earth\\" by John and Mary Gribben.My chief reservation about Steel's work is that he seems easily drawn to flights of whimsy such as Clube's and Napier's contentions regarding Beta Taurid cometary impacts that have affected history on a mammoth scale. While these are captivating proposals, perhaps, there isn't enough hard scientific evidence for them clutter up what was otherwise a hitherto fine scientific presentation of a real problem by Steel. Up to the author's dalliance into the speculative, the book is a good read about a serious, overlooked, preventable threat. His admonitions should be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Rogue Asteroids and Doomsday Comets: The Search for the Million Megaton Menace That Threatens Life on Earth","review":"Duncan Steel is one of the best known advocates for a near Earth observation system, and he and others like him should be listened to.

Culver was not the least bit happy, however, to be teamed up again with the one true love of his life, Pilar. Eight years ago Pilar loved him and than destroyed him when she left without an explanation or a goodbye.Pilar was no more eager to work with Culver again, but she knew that she must in order to help save Morgan's life. Pilar knew that there was a lot at stake, but it was a risk she had to take. Pilar and Culver have a deep love for one another that has been shoved under lies and secrets. If they are ever to have a future they must put all of the truth on the table and survive this mission.I was not impressed with the story of Pilar and Culver. I realize that coming from South America that Pilar is at more of a disadvantage as a woman. Pilar's mixed blood also works against her, but to me, that is no excuse for the decision that she made to keep Culver in the dark about the past. She made a terrible mistake that I have a hard time looking past. When Culver discovers the truth he dismisses it with the wave of his hand. Culver accepts what she did, forgives her, and he even takes most of the blame. Yes, he had some responsibilty, but he let her off way to easy.I was also disgusted that our beloved character, Morgan Trayhern, was tortured the way that he was. Morgan and his family have already been through so much. I was just as disappointed with what happened to Morgan as I was with what happened to his wife, Laura, in McKenna's earlier story-Morgan's Wife. I must admit that I am dreading reading Morgan's Marriage, the next book in the series. Hopefully, Morgan and Laura's love can overshadow all of the disgusting things that has happened to them over the past several books."},{"Title":"Follow your dreams: Secrets to getting hired as flight attendant","review":"I sincerely hope that no one edited this book.

Adams was an interesting fellow. In the 1920s, he won the trust of the Blacks in his area and they told him raw stories filled with their true feelings about racial oppression as well as other aspects of their daily lives. Adams collected these stories into two volumes that are collected here (as well as some additional material)that hold up quite well today. No patronizing of his subjects, stereotyping, nor overexaggerated &quot;Negro dialect&quot; which marred similar collections of this kind of material by White writers. I would recommend this and Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Mules and Men&quot; and &quot;Every Tounge Got to Confess&quot; for anyone who wants to know the real deal on African-American folklore.One minor complaint, the editor mentions the existance of some other tales that Adams colected that exist in his papers that do not appear in this collection.

How beautiful is God's gift of our body, I realized after reading it. This world proclaims that the human body is made for gratification and manipulation, but we know deep down there has to be more. Pope John Paul II has given the defining answer through his writings on the theology of the body. Sadly, many of us have not heard it or cannot comprehend it. This book by Dr. Shivanandan clearly and concisely elucidates the reader on the mind of this Pope. In Crossing the Threshold of Love, the layperson can see the link from the creation of man, of men and women, in God's image to day-to-day relationships with others.Married couples, single persons, parents, priests, seminarians, teachers -- all can peel away years of misunderstanding the true theology of the body with their read of this book. So much of life's beauty is revealed. A profound sense of serenity with one's sexuality can be the result.It is not for wimps, though. It took time to read and upon reflection to appreciate this work. It is more than worth the effort.Crossing the Threshold of Love will remain a timeless resource for meditation and for improving relations with one another."},{"Title":"Crossing the Threshold of Love: A New Vision of Marriage","review":"My wife and I read this book as we prepared for marriage, and it's the best book we've read on the subject.

Sophy, now twenty-three, has been in love with Justin, from afar, since she was eighteen. But Sophy is no fool - she knows what marriage entitles, and she refuses to lose her independence. But if she was to be married to Justin, with his name attached to hers, she just may be able to flush out the man who seduced, impregnated her sister, then left her, causing her sister to take her own life. For Sophy, that's the same as murder, and she's determined to find out who it is. Barganing with Justin, she agrees to marry him. Only, things don't go as planned for either of them. Justin does not want a repeat of his first marriage - his first wife had married him for convenience and did everything to make his life miserable, including infidelity. He doesn't want another wild woman on his hands and does everything he can to tame Sophy. What he ends up realizing - Sophy is nowhere like Elizabeth, and comes close to losing her to the man who'd murdered Elizabeth. Sophy believes she made a mistake when she admitted to Justin that she loved him. She vows to be the dutiful wife Justin wants, even if her love isn't reciprocated. But can Justin now convince Sophy that he loves her the way she is?**A beautiful story. I loved the history and the intrigue. Justin, domineering alpha male, wants everything out of Sophy while giving nothing in return. Sophy wants equal ground with her husband, and fights hard to get it, much to Justin's dismay. I loved watching them come together, to love each other and accept each other for who they truly are. While Justin's dominance bugged me a little, I could understand it. For in that era, that's the way it was. LOL, I can say I'm glad I don't live in those times - I'd resent being ordered about.SURRENDER: Heiress Victoria Huntington refuses to be married. After her father died while she was still a child, her mother had remarried to a man who only wanted her money, one who became violent when he was drunk. Her mother's death while out riding had been deemed an accident, but Vicky was convinced that her stepfather murdererd her and did the unthinkable to get a confession: pretending to be a ghost, she flitted about the estate in her mother's gown, driving her stepfather to come after her. While he did so, with a knife, and a confession, another accident occured, and he died after falling down the stairs while chasing her. She's kept this her secret and vowed never to be married. Meanwhile, having been hurt and left for dead on battle grounds, Lucas Colebrook has recently inherited Stonevale and the title of Earl. The only problem? His uncle drove the estate into the ground. Lucas desperately needs to marry and heiress, and sets his sights on Victoria. Vicky loves her life the way it is; she loves to take risks unbecoming a lady, and Lucas appoints himself the one to help her. But Vicky has fallen in love with him, and after being caught after their one night of passion, a hasty marriage ensues, and Vicky finds out the truth: Lucas wants her money. Now Lucas is trying to convince her that she can no longer take the risks she was taking. Vicky is furious, for all the reasons she'd refused to get married are being thrown at her. And now, her past is coming back to haunt her; for little things are starting to pop up, convincing her that her stepfather is back from the dead. Both want to find out who it is that is trying to drive Vicky mad. And while Vicky is still in love with Lucas, she refuses to acknowledge it. And now Lucas has to convince her that he's just as in love with her.**An excellent story! I liked the history and intrigue in this one more than the first. And while I felt the \`distaste' between two of the charactes, I never concluded who it was that was after Vicky until it happened. I really felt for Vicky, for after she and Lucas married, everything she didn't want was being thrown at her, and I could feel her anger and frustration. I loved how Lucas indulged her when he could, doing what was necessary to protect her, but I did find him a little unfair at times. Even if that was how it was back then, I still felt that Lucas could have gone about it in a different way. I loved watching them together.

If one were to suppose that every reader of Talk Spanish had made its' purchase with the intention of relocating at some time in the future, (once the language had been properly assimilated of course), then the UK population will surely begin to dwindle?The book itself is of a similar format to many other 'learn to speak..' texts: the structure is a simple combination of word and grammar familiarising exercises, along with frequent tests, both written and oral, designed to confirm one's level at each stage and build confidence through familiarity.Additional aids,(in the form of cassette tape or cd), may be purchased with the book. These work alongside the text to help with oral familiarisation, and, as such, are an important factor. Especially if you, like me, tend to attempt any foreign language with an accent copied from 'Allo Allo'. The particular downfall of these listen and learn type exercises is the abundant use of bad music used to link sections together. Combined with the inferior mixing, (the music is rather louder than the speech), this factor alone was enough to make me hesitent of using the tapes.As a learning tool, Talk Spanish is intended to give a level of understanding of light general conversation after a period of ten weeks, (if, like me, you are using it as the text for a weekly evening class), and, as such, is ideal for the beginner.As with learning any language, familiarity leads to confidence, and the excercises in Talk Spanish are simple and repetitive enough to ensure that the information sticks. I would recommend, however, that the additional tapes or cd are purchased with the book, as pronunciation is key in being able to converse. And on completion of the book, of course, we have given ourselves a valid excuse for that holiday in Spain, in order to practise what we've learned. Perhaps free BBC holiday vouchers should be given away with every hundredth book sold?further comments from james alabaster may be found on www.animadesign.co.uk/contemporary writing.htm"},{"Title":"Military Leadership in the British Civil Wars, 1642-1651: 'The Genius of this Age' (Cass Military Studies)","review":"Aware that Dr. Carpenter is one of America's leading experts on Tudor-Stuart British History, I couldn't wait to read this book -- and I wasn't disappointed!

However the work by and large remains the same book that appeared in 1941.To my mind the work breaks down into parts. The really outstanding part of the work traces Joyce's life and work from the beginning through 'Ulysses'. Illuminating readings are provided of 'Dubliners ' 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' and 'Ulysses'. The second part of the work is a commentary and introduction to 'Finnegan's Wake'. I found it far less interesting than the first half of the book. It is almost as if Levin takes on some of the character of the Wake itself and supplies us with an endless hash of mythical details which somehow seem to overwhelm the greater themes and meaning of the work.In the first part of the work Levin superbly traces the whole enterprise of Joyce. The three- fold renunciation, of family, country and religion and the legendary oath to by silence, exile and cunning forge in the smithy of his soul 'the uncreated conscience of his race'. Levin writes with a great knowledge of Comparitive literature and makes many brilliant analyses of Joyce's connections with other greats of world- literature.He sees Joyce as mastering two great literary traditions- the naturalistic and the symbolic and carrying both to extreme development.Levin too connects Joyce's masterwork with contemporary developments in the general Culture of the time.\\" Thus the very form of Joyce's book is an elusive and ecletic 'Summa' of its age:the montage of the cinema, impressionism in painting, leit-motif in music, the free association of psychoanalysis, and vitalism of philosophy.Take of these elements all that is fusible, and perhaps more, and you have the style of 'Ulysses'.Levin also cites many of the remakably beautiful and lyric passages of Joyce's work. Just for the sheer pleasure of reading it again I close this review with the final sentence of Joyce's greatest story 'Dubliners' \\" His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descend of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\\""},{"Title":"Winter's Tales","review":"This is a terrifc book by a unique writer.That's no surprise, because Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen) wrote a number of fine books. Her ledger contains a couple of volumes of reminiscence about her life in Africa, a pseudonymous novel of adventure (_The Angelic Avengers_), and posthumously published books of stories (_Carnival_) and essays (_Daguerrotypes_). Despite the interest and occasional excellence of these books -- especially in the case of _Out of Africa_ -- it's as a writer of long stories that she exhibited her greatest artistry and achievement.She published 4 collections of short stories in her lifetime: _Seven Gothic Tales_, _Winter's Tales_, _Anecdotes of Destiny_, and _Last Tales_. She also published a slim novel (really a novella), _Ehrengard_. As a devoted reader, I've enjoyed every one of these books. Still, it does her no disservice to point out that some are better than others.Her first book, _Seven Gothic Tales_ is usually the book of stories that people remember first -- deservedly, because any book that contains \\"The Deluge at Norderney,\\" \\"The Monkey,\\" and \\"The Poet\\" gets high marks. The other stories in the book aren't exactly chopped liver, either.However, I will submit that _Winter's Tales_ deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the earlier book. I approached _Winter's Tales_ the first time expecting to be disappointed after the bravura performance of _Seven Gothic Tales_. I was surprised in the most pleasant manner imaginable. Indeed, in some ways, _Winter's Tales_ surpasses the earlier book as a work of art. The level of writing is uniformly high; the style is still ornate and surprising, but better controlled. And there are still the touches of melodrama and the gothic that give much of her work a strange feeling of having emerged from the 19th Century, while at the same time being very modern.Although I found the whole of _Winter's Tales_ to my taste, some of the stories stand out. Some stories that I particularly liked were \\"The Sailor Boy's Tale,\\" \\"Alkmene\\" and \\"The Fish\\"; but what puts this book over the top is that it contains \\"Sorrow Acre,\\" arguably the best example of Blixen's fiction. In fact, one could argue that \\"Sorrow Acre\\" is one of the finest stories written in the 20th century by *anyone*. An historical and philosophical novella that reconstructs a day in 19th century Denmark, it plays out personal tragedy and comedy on an aristocratic estate with a subtle irony worthy of Theodor Storm or (dare I say) Thomas Mann. By itself, it was worth the price of admission. I've read it many times since. The thematic connections between this story and the earlier \\"The Deluge at Norderney\\" are patent.Her two later collections, _Anecdotes of Destiny_ and _Last Tales_ have their moments. In particular, several stories from _Anecdotes..._ have grown on me over the years, such as \\"Babette's Feast\\" and \\"Tempests.\\" Still, to my mind, she hit her high water mark in _Seven Gothic Tales_ and _Winter's Tales_."},{"Title":"Winter's Tales","review":"Isak Diensen's book of ornate, Baroque prose is on an unreachable echelon separate from any writer writing literature today or even from her era. Her stories transport readers to a period where thinking and intelligence were elegant and refined, smooth and intermixed with tints of religiosity. Stories such as &quot;The Invincible Slave-Owner&quot; and &quot;The Sailor-Boy's Tale&quot; show Diensen's strong knowledge of Danish folklore and Baroque description. Mind you, this is not easy reading! The messages are simple, but yet they are dense, and it is very easy to overlook these simple truths as a result of that flamboyance and extravagant complexity for which she has become internationally recognized. Her themes are like those of any writer: strength, courage during adversity, love, etc... But it is how these themes are conveyed that make these tales remarkable. Isak Diensen a.k.a. Baroness Karen Blixen's childhood was not one of the best, and these tales seem to indicate that. They transport the reader, take him or her away to places that seem unreachable, but her life does not mitigate the beautiful intelligence and language that she is able to convey. Diensen was twice nominated for the Noble Prize in Literature, losing to Ernest Hemmingway and Albert Camus. For more on her life and stories, read Judith Thurman's Life of a Storyteller: The Biography of Isak Diensen."},{"Title":"Winter's Tales","review":"Karen Blixen wrote a number of fine books, but only 4 could be called short story collections.

Winter's Tales holds together from beginning to end especially well, and includes my favorite tale of all, &quot;Alkmene.&quot; Isak Dinesen's stories are like fairy tales remembered in a dream (or is it dreams remembered in a fairy tale?).

Born of the Sun is about the clash between the Celts and the Saxons in the 6th century. Although it is less based on outside sources than the other two (just the the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle instead of legends or historical records), it is a powerful, moving novel about what might-have-been, and indeed probably was. The main characters, the Saxon Ceawlin of Wessex and his Celtic wife Niniane, have a beautiful love story, set against the turmoil of the times. Ceawlin did exist, and, as Wolf says in her afterword, was one of the few kings in the AS Chronicle upon which the Saxon title of Bretwalda, or &quot;ruler of Britain&quot; was bestowed. BUT, don't read this book for the history. Read it for the writing, as always superb - Joan Wolf is in top form. Do yourself a favor and buy this book today!"},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"As the sequel to the best seller \\"The Road to Avalon\\" I can only imagine that with the novel \\"Born of the Sun\\" Joan Wolf hoped to firmly establish this trilogy as a view of the great Dark Age's political minds of England. That makes this book sound boring, but please don't forget that it is a romance novel.As the author admits in her postscript the characters in this book are largely fictional-although the expansion of the Saxon kingdom of Wessex probably did go as happened in the novel, and the final merge of the British people with the Saxons did occur around this time. So the two characters in this book, Ceawlin, a [..]Saxon prince who will be king, and his bride, Niniane, a Celtic princess, didn't really exists. This is sad because this book has one of a hell of a love story about them. In that aspect the book is great, romantic, sweet and exciting.But the book is also largely about war, and so it seems almost every 50 pages someone new was attacking the lovers, or they were at war, or they had been kidnapped, or just something was happening. It got very tiresome after a while. There was also an unresolved, unrequited love triangle thingy going on that just distracted from the main story, and I think, affected the character in a way that was unrealistic.So, while this book is ok, even compelling at times, largely it did not meet up to the expectations that reading \\"The Road to Avalon\\" gave me. This one is good, but not great.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"I loved this book! The characters were real and raw, the plot moved smoothly, and the elegance of the writing made the love story even more touching. I felt like I was transported into the story, and I never wanted to put the book down! I highly recommend this novel -- this is some of Wolf's best work. I cried more than once!"},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"I had previously read another Joan Wolf book - The Road to Avalon - and quite enjoyed it. Actually, quite enjoyed it is not saying enough. It was absolutely wonderful and I laughed and cried and cheered and cursed and lived along with it. That was an Arthurian book. This book takes place almost 100 years after Arthur's death when the Saxons and Britons really start mixing, peacefully and at war. Definitely an engaging book, one that I could barely put down."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"It's 80 years after Arthur (this is a sort of sequel, at least chronologically, to Road to Avalon) and the Britons are disorganized and are constantly raided by the Saxons. The story involves a Celtic princess, Niniane, who is kidnapped by the king of the West Saxons after a raid on her village. She lives in the king's household for several years, becomes close to the king's favorite mistress, learns to fear the king's evil wife and is promised in marriage to the king's equally evil son. When there is a duel between the king's legitimate son (the evil one) and the king's bastard, Ceawlin and the evil son is killed (even though the story is a bit more complicated than that) Ceawlin is forced into exile. He takes Niniane with him intending to marry her, and eventually organized to take the kingdom back from the king's evil wife who is ruling as regent with her newborn.This is a very well written story filled with complex characters. There is very little romance, despite the cover illustration but what you will get instead is a page turner of a saga, filled with intrigue, loyalty. A story that fills in the gaps in a little known time in British history. Wolf does a terrific job of describing what makes a leader, something she did well with Arthur and does equally well with the next book about Alfred the Great. She never makes her characters seem modern, yet she successfully explains their motivations. She's a great story teller, I will dig up more of her books."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"This book is absolutely outstanding. I could not put it down and wanted to read the whole thing over again as soon as I finished. This book is filled with history, love, treachery, intrigue, a truly evil villaness, battles and more. Ceawlin and Niniane are a wonderful couple -- I enjoyed the pairing of the pagen Saxon who would be high king and the Christian British Princess Niniane. Learning to make a marriage with such two opposing lifestyles and customs, the hatred and mistrust between the Britains and Saxons make for compelling reading.This is a must read for any lover of historical fiction, and sheds light on a little known period of England in the dark ages."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"This is the compelling, never boring story of Ceawlin, illegitimate Prince of the King Cynric, of the West Saxons & Ceawlin's soon to be unlikely bride, Niniane, Princess of the Celts, a captive of his father's.It begins in the middle of the 6th century, in Wessex, England. Ceawlin is challenged to a duel by his younger legitimate brother, Edwin, who is in league with his mother to kill the popular prince. Prince Ceawlin wins the duel but at a great cost and he and Niniane must flee to escape the wrath of Guthfrid, the bitter and jealous Queen.The adventures of these two are the sweeping tales of well-loved and often told sagas (or should be). The plots and subplots abound and the desire to know what happens next to Ceawlin, Niniane and their friends and enemies is gripping. The differences between pagan and Christian are intricately described as are the differences in the Celts and the Saxons lifestyles.I've read the first in this \\"loose\\" trilogy, \\"The Road To Avalon.\\" This novel picks up 80 years after the death of King Arthur and continues with the story of Alfred the Great in \\"The Edge Of Light.\\" In fact I've just started on \\"The Edge of Light\\" and it looks to be a genuine page turner as the first two. Read these books if you like historical fiction of The Dark Ages in England! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"This make me want to read more books by Joan Wolf. Her historical novels are great. I'm not such a big fanof her regency romances."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"I read this many years ago when it first came out in paper back and have re_read it several times since then. This is a book that examines hate, love, loyalty, friendship and how they change, develop and can erode overtime. The central characters are strong and draw the reader in. It is not a typical romance. So if you are looking for a light read without detailed descriptions of places, events and sometimes everyday life this book is not for you. I love it and will no doubt read it again."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"I say this because the historical backdrop was as big a player in this book as the romance.While I'm not sure of the accuracy of everything, the author certainly draws a clear picture of life and the times and what is motivating the main players.One of the points I really like is that while the norm is noted, we are told the story about the unusual ones that make it. Like the story of the one in a million hero that lives (rather than the many who end up, realistically, dead.)Here is a couple that gets their start from political circumstances (they are both somebodies but with limitations and together they have the potential to be a political powerhouse), then grow into a full blown romance. We follow the young couple from their young, penniless, marriage to growing into a more mature family with rising power. They struggle with politics (they came from opposing sides of the warring factions), religion (she is christian an he is pagan), and family loyalties. Also explained realistically, people wonder why he would bother to stay faithful to his wife (in their times when it's so good to be the king) and his reasoning is superstitious --- his good fortune always seemed to be tied in with his wife in one way or another and by remaining faithful to her and having her support, he has always triumphed. Huh. Good explanation to satisfy a romantic ideal but not make him be viewed as weak (whipped) in such a macho era.Fans of history and romance will probably enjoy this although it may seem slow paced and tame to others who enjoy a more modern style tale."},{"Title":"Born of the Sun","review":"This book is absolutely excellent! I wish the author would write more books about less publicized times in historical Europe. These are the most fascinating books to read. Never read a book by Wolf before, however, because of this book, I have since.

Jim Cutter kept a journal of his last month leading up to his wedding to track his thoughts and reactions to all the stuff that went on. He's not a wedding professional or anything, he's just a regular guy, which is what makes this book so good. The reader gets very helpful guidance from a groom who's going through the process just like the reader is, but the book isn't broken into chapters based upon advice type like most other guides.The good news is that this abnormal guide style is ok because grooms-to-be (and even brides-to-be) of 20-something first-time brides will thoroughly enjoy reading the entire book and will extract the good advice contained therein almost by accident. The writing style is very conversational, and this guy has an amusing way of putting things and a very insightful way of looking at everything that happened. Also, his frustration with everything going on lead to some great ideas that brides would never let us get away with (I, myself, would have loved to have been fishing while a groom-stand-in went through the motions for the crowd). Of course, some of the tips he comes up with are also quite helpful, such as planning out the groom's wedding day - no one else is going to do it for you, veto-authority registering strategies, wedding gift observations, and a many others.I also must confess that I found the story of his wedding by itself very interesting, and I kept turning the pages to find out what would happen next. Since the book is dedicated to his wife, I don't think I'm spoiling anything by writing that things work themselves out, but it was frequently amazing to read what was going on in that month. Of course, what can you expect when you have friends in the entertainment industry?For grooms and recently married husbands, this book is both excellent advice and amusing commiseration. Brides and recently married wives will also enjoy the book, both for humor value and for the wedding-horror-story aspects. Plus, brides-to-be will also like the fact that the author suggests that the groom do whatever he can to give the bride the day she wants. She might not like the reasoning, but she'll like the end result.Also, someone in the wedding industry or anyone who finds themselves attending several weddings of relatives and friends each year will also enjoy this book for its humor and for the fact that it rings so true."},{"Title":"A Groom's Guide to Surviving a Wedding: One Groom's True Story","review":"This book helped me soooo much with my fiance and it's sooo funny! It doesn't have a lot of the typical tips and checklists that most guides have, but after my fiance read it, he didn't keep complaining about price everytime I tried to plan the details of our wedding with him. It's like a guide to putting your man in the right state of mind on your wedding. After the book, mine actually enjoys helping plan the wedding. Of course, he does still pick the most annoying moments to quote the book, but I just quote back to him, &quot;suck it up and be a man.&quot;And wow, after reading what went wrong with this guy's wedding... Let's just say that I would FREAK!

Mr. Cutter does a great job walking you through the utter insanity of preparing for a wedding. Future grroms: This will help you more than any other book out there.

It is a quick read, and one you will appreciate more and more in the days before THE day."},{"Title":"A Groom's Guide to Surviving a Wedding: One Groom's True Story","review":"My bride-to-be bought this book for me, and I highly recommend it. I do have one beef: it's a very odd &quot;guide.&quot; There is advice throughout, and it does highlight a lot of the issues that can pop up, but it isn't laid out like a normal guide. The guy kept a diary of his last month before his wedding. Leave it to a lawyer to write a guide in case-study form.Aside from the irregular presentation of this guide, it was still very helpful. I especially liked his veto-authority-only idea on registering. That has prevented a lot of frustration for me and my fianc&eacute;e. I'm also going to make sure my schedule is thought out for the wedding day. Also, seeing the various problems that popped up, some big, some small, and seeing them all get handled helped to keep things in perspective for me. He's also right about letting your fianc&eacute;e get a little crazy on the wedding stuff - it's really not worth fighting over and I don't want to be hearing about her &quot;not getting the wedding I've dreamed of&quot; for the rest of our marriage.My fianc&eacute;e also seems to enjoy the book. Frequently, when we're making plans for the wedding, she'll bring up one of the problems they had in the book in an &quot;if so-and-so ever did that to me, I'd kill them&quot; or &quot;I can't believe such-and-such happened&quot; sort of way. I don't want to spoil any of the book's surprises so I can't get more specific about the problems - sorry. She also speculates a bunch about who the unnamed celebrity in the book is. I couldn't care less, but at least we both enjoyed the book, even if for different reasons."},{"Title":"A Groom's Guide to Surviving a Wedding: One Groom's True Story","review":"This book is awesome!

It was like sitting down and shooting the breeze with another guy about all the whacked-out stuff that happens right before the wedding. Jim Cutter wrote all the things I was thinking. It was great to find out I wan't the only one thinking these thoughts before the wedding.So, check this book out, but get yourself a good groom's guide too.

There was also no reference in the book to the author drinking to excess, so I am unsure from where that reference comes. I am not a gun-toting member of the NRA with an arrogance \\"boardering on stupidity\\", a \\"conservative moron\\", or a name-caller, but I still recommend it.Overall, through its honest commentary the book affords readers the opportunity to look at weddings in a different light and understand that there are many ways for grooms to approach the first step to the rest of their lives. It also helps us rationale people of the world remember to not take ourselves so seriously."},{"Title":"A Groom's Guide to Surviving a Wedding: One Groom's True Story","review":"I bought this book for my fiance and actually read it myself first.

The collected essays (5 of them) are cleverly argued, detailed, and weighty. This German giant was a master of the material. He also had this sort of anti-climactic yet provocative style where he builds up to a certain conclusion or states with apparent confidence the viewpoints of other scholars only to immediately or somewhat later demonstrate its inadequacies or tear into it with his own insight. It isn't too conspicuous always, but it's enough to detect the trend. With due props to R. A. Wilson the read isn't difficult, although there are a few untranslated Hebrew and Greek expressions. This should apprise laymen that the book isn't generally for them.But I forbore a 5-star rating on account of what I perceived the first time around as flaws. For a scholar of Alt's standing these otherwise venial oversights and examples of carelessness really can't go unscrutinized...Besides, I just feel like being a tough critic. :)I felt Alt mused over a lot of conjecture at points, building from only the tentative or admittedly hypothetical. At other points it seemed he dismissed as unhistorical what doesn't dovetail with his theoretical schemes. One instance involves Solomon's policy of forced labor which in Alt's view was only imposed on the northern state even though the texts in question read 'all Israel'. (nn. 137, 140, 158 in the essay 'The Formation of the Israelite State') He contradicts himself in acknowledging that even under the United Monarchy Israel and Judah were distinct entities, but he later states that mention of them as independent before the division following Solomon's death is an anachronism (contrast p. 208 & n. 114 with p. 273 & n. 91); and moreover he says this even when he makes the acuminious observation that the break after Solomon was really more of a repristination to earlier times, since Israel and Judah had always been in some sense 'divided'. (see pp.308-9) I could go on, but one final mistake I'll mention is Alt's confusion between the sacral cities of refuge in the Code of the Covenant (see Exo xxi.13-14) and the evidently secular cities of refuge, owing to its idiosyncratic centralization law, in Deuteronomy. (see nn. 65-6, p. 139-40) These are some of the reasons why I can't give *Essays* a perfect score, but the 4 remaining stars are well-earned.In my opinion the best essays are the first two: 'The God of the Fathers' and 'The Origins of Israelite Law'. It might not be contingency that these chapters make the most ingenious use of form-critical methodology. In the first Alt dismantles the layers of later tradition in the relatively late text of the Pentateuch to lay bare the pre-Yahwistic religion of Israel. Apart from the local 'Elim' or local deities at the sanctuaries founded by the patriarchs according to their narratives, there is the distinguishable tradition of the 'gods of the fathers': individual deities of the pre-literarily separate patriarchal epics assimilated to Yahweh by the three sources of the Tetrateuch and forming the bridge between Israel's ancestral religious past and the later national Yahwism. Alt's conclusion is that it's 'impossible to doubt that the Israelite tradition of the God of the Fathers presents us with a type of religion that was a living force among other Semitic tribes both in the desert and for centuries after their settlement' (p. 58)In the second essay Alt again utilizes form criticism to uncover pretextual stages of Pentateuchal law and its origins. He starts out enunciating the essential correctness of the theory of the conflate, conflicting, and multi-provenient literature of the Pentateuch; then he marks off two kinds of its laws: the casuistic, a form adopted from the Canaanites, and the apodeictic, peculiarly Israelite. The casuistic is earlier but both, Alt states, go back to before the settlement or soon afterward. (p. 175)The third essay, 'The Settlement of the Israelites in Palestine', is the most difficult and will be an exercise in tedium for those not interested in matters like Egyptian suzerainty in Palestine and the effects of climate and topography on its territorial divisions and politics. Anyway, it doesn't seem the independent study Alt attempts of the history of Palestine's territorial divisions contributes too great a deal to the history of the Israelite settlement. Maybe I missed something...The fourth (named earlier) and the fifth, 'The Monarchy in Israel and Judah', which was originally part of the fourth, are the least best argued in my opinion, but the last is the shortest and has no footnotes, which I liked in this case.The *Essays* is a valuable addition to any OT library.Fun Fact:* On p. 228 the superscript in the main text for n. 128 is missing."},{"Title":"Bette Davis Speaks","review":"As a newspaper editor for over 30 years, I've learned how to judge a writer -- If he consistently comes up with quotes &quot;too good to be true,&quot; they usually are."},{"Title":"Bette Davis Speaks","review":"These &quot;interviews&quot; sound nothing like Bette Davis as anyone who ever read the scores of bona fide interviews she gave over the years.

(Remember she had a feud with her last film director because the film included a dark comic joke concerning Joan Crawford which Miss Davis thought was in terrible taste. And Joan was of course no friend of Bette's!!) This frankly reads more like a drag queen's nightclub act not an interview with a star.

The work is a compilation of more than a dozen interviews conducted with the author from the mid-1970s until her death in which she candidly expounds on a broad spcetrum of people and personal feelings -- many which probably displeased the person discussed. Topics range from her philosophy on acting and the public's misconceptions of Hollywood personalities to steamier topics such as casting couches, cheating spouses and rival co-stars. While the question-and-answer format used by the author helps reproduce the interview setting, the reader may find the flow a bit choppy at times. This didn't, however, depreciate the value of many of the witty and catty remarks she made to the author, with one stellar observation being made about &quot;Dynasty&quot; stars Joan Collins and Linda Evans: &quot;My dear, it takes more than draping a body in something expensive to create real glamour. Hah! What's elegant about all the cleavage? My God, they might as well be at the beach.

I have read a great deal of Bette Davis-related books over the years, and this book contain about 80% fresh materials, which is nothing short of a miracle more than 10 years after her death. The style of the book is simply the text of several extended interviews the author had with Miss Davis, as well as with others who had worked with her. The questions are interesting (as are the answers), and the style makes the information seem much more interesting and believable. A must for any fan, and, once again, I was particularly impressed with many fresh topics.

Well, it's iffy. But who cares now? Her photos included here are lovely - it breaks your heart. Anyone who has worked in the industry knows they all dished the dirt - it was their world, present and future and they reveled in it. They were all larger than life.

This is quite possibly his best book, displaying a wide range of topics and an incredible maturity and intelligence that only comes when one's perspectives have been expanded. In one essay, &quot;Letter to a Troubled Student,&quot; he deals with the Zapatista uprising of Chiapas, Mexico, telling his student that it is not scary that a group of Indians are taking on the Mexican government, but that, in any war, the truth is always the first victim. To him, and to a lot of us, that is truly scary. Through this essay, marked for its open-mindedness and its intelligence, Hogan is able to explain how his fears transcend the egocentric level, acheiving a greater understanding and universality.This is the modus operandi for the rest of the book, which is a collection of essays written in Mexico over a period of the past ten years. They relate the expatriate experience, but they differ from other expatriate books because these essays are observations told through the eyes of a person who is committed to the lifelong quest of knowledge, a person who is committed to learning about his surroundings. All the essays are examples of a deep thought process, and one gets the realization that the author is just as much the teacher as he is the student.One of the best examples of this, and also one of the defining elements of the book itself is the obvious influence that Mexican Poet Octavio Paz had and still has on Hogan's life. Paz's presence is everywhere in the book; the musicality of his poetry helping Hogan the young boy overcome his stuttering problem, the incisive nature of his essays helping Hogan the teacher in teaching the Odyssey to his ninth graders, the profound depth of his social critiques helping Hogan the human being understand humanity and the Mexican better.This book is a deep, insightful study into the psychology of the expatriate. In my opinion it is a peer to that other great book about the human condition, &quot;The Labyrinth of Solitude.&quot; It is also the only expatriate book that is fully able to document the reasons why a person chooses to leave his home country. It interacts with the reader on many levels, displaying intelligence, while appealing to the poets, the teachers, the scholars, the human beings in all of us. It also displays a deep love for a country that is not the native land for the author, nor for many expatriates. And it is this love that makes the book, and the essays within so compelling. I am reminded at this point, while searching for the place to end my review, of some lyrics from the song \\"Atlanta\\" by the Stone Temple Pilots.&quot;Visions of Mexico seduce me,It goes to my head so carefully.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mexican Mornings: Essays South of the Border","review":"I am always skeptical about books written on Mexico by foreigners. However, Michael Hogan who has lived in the country for more than a decade is a careful, although often critical and sometimes humorous, observer. He also has an obvious love and affinity for the Mexican character and writes about it accurately and well. The book contains observations on the effect of globalization on the Mexican economy, a night at a Mexican concert with the Tigres del Norte, a revolution in Chiapas, a university riot,a meeting with Fidel Castro when he comes to Guadalajara, as well as more tranquil moments riding in the forests or hiking the mountains.The book is far better than any tour guides I have read, especially of the Guadalajara area, both with its descriptions of the people and the flora and fauna. It is an expatriate equivalent to the Labyrinth of Solitude by Octavio Paz, who by the way, is an inspiring presence in several of the essays.For someone visiting Mexico for the first time, this is a valuable handbook. For someone who has chosen Mexican as their adopted country it provides clear evidence that it was a correct choice. For all Mexicans living outside the country, and for those who have visited and not yet returned, it clearly evokes the love and the longing that so many have for this land south of the border. Hogan writes lovingly of the person and the poetry of Richard Shelton here as well. For those, like myself, who are enarmored by the Tucson poet, it is a refreshing visit to an old friend who also has strong conenctions to Mexico. All in all, a wonderful read. Hogan has an accesible style with occasional flashes of brilliance and a quiet but poignant wit."},{"Title":"Parables of life","review":"This book truly is a little treasure. Wonderful parables to ponder and savor!"},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"I am fairly familiar with Polanyi's work and I thought it might be helpful to suggest who could benefit from this book. I would recommend this text to scientists and students who are interested in the philosophical issues and implications of their work, epistemology enthusiasts, philosophy students, and anyone trying to grapple with why Cartesian philosophy doesn't seem to explain reality.Personal Knowledge is a dense read and Polanyi expects the reader to be familiar with many scientific and philosophic histories. It will require several reads to begin to get a grasp on the core of the material, but even a cursory reading is enjoyable and will challenge your thinking.If you are not hip on philosophy, but are still interested in Polanyi's view of knowing reality, there are several texts available. If you don't know what the Cartesian Enlightenment is, then Meek's text &quot;Longing to Know&quot; is an excellent lucid primer that a high-schooler can understand. Drucilla Scott's text, &quot;Everyman Revived&quot; does a good job of expositing Polanyi with some biographical data as well.The reason I rated this text 5 stars is because it is one of the best books I have ever read. However, it is not for everyone. not even a small minority of people will truly enjoy this book. So I hope I helped you become a member of the fractional minority or vice versa."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"I have read this book numerous times over the last ten years and I think it offers the only truly hopeful path for the current impasse that exists between philosophy/religion and the numerous popularizers of contemporary science. What Polanyi shows (himself a chemist turned philosopher) is the way that in reality scientific knowledge, like all knowledge, has an ineradicably personal element to it. That is, you learn to be a scientist not by studying test tubes but by being an apprentice to someone who already is a scientist, who teaches you, disciples you, so to speak, trains you in how to know things in a scientific way. The key element is personal trust, you must trust them, have faith in what they are teaching you, believe in them and the truth, the reality of what they're teaching. This trust aspect is the 'tacit dimension' to all scientific (and every kind of human)knowing. Not only is it interpersonal at the start, all of our knowledge also includes our involvement in a community of fellow knowers (not unlike a church!). They help to validate our knowledge, they correct us, they serve to adjudicate our discoveries. Polanyi's point is that this personal knowledge is the only kind of knowing there is, even though it is not the kind routinely set forth by scientists in their own accounts of what they're doing and what they know. The force of his description is to take away the false dichotomy between supposedly objective 'factual' knowledge and purportedly subjectively impure 'beliefs.' All knowing has a faith-based foundation to it and we're all on the same ground when it comes to arguing for coherent views of the world, of what is and what's not. It's a great book, far from easy, but as important as any book of the last century. Read it!"},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"Books on epistemology tend to be dreary affairs. Epistemology, which is the branch of philosophy that studies how human beings acquire and &quot;validate&quot; their knowledge, tend to be largely speculative and logical. Most theories of epistemology that are inflicted upon the world are nothing more than the highly artificial constructions of some philosopher telling us all how we &quot;ought&quot; to attain and validate our knowledge. Any correspondence to how men really attain knowledge is usually pure coincidence. Moreover, in many instances, the epistemological philosopher has some special agenda which he is seeking to impose on his readers by confusing them with a mass of epistemological pedantry. He may be trying to prove the validity of a largely speculative form of &quot;reason&quot; or of definitions or of certainty or of a perfect and immaculate form of &quot;objectivity&quot; or of some other equally utopian and irrelevant principle.In the light of all this philosophical pretension, it is refreshing to come across a book like Polanyi's &quot;Personal Knowledge.&quot; Polanyi was a chemist trained in the methods of science. He understands, as few merely speculative philosophers do, the necessity of deriving theories from facts, rather than facts from theories. Yet Polanyi is more than just a scientist; he is also a very shrewd and critical thinker who does not shrink from challenging long cherished assumptions within his own discipline of science. &quot;Personal Knowledge&quot; is, among other things, an attack on what might be called &quot;naive objectivism,&quot; which can be defined as the epistemological view which holds that the only valid knowledge is that which can be articulated and tested by strictly impersonal methods. Polanyi demonstrates why this view of knowledge is untenable. Some of man's most important knowledge, he argues, is tacit and inarticulable, like the knowledge of how to swim or how to judge a work of art. Yet men use such knowledge and even depend on it for their survival.Polanyi's book is rich in such insights. Anyone interested in epistemology needs to read this book. It will change one's thinking about human knowledge and give one a great appreciation of the depth and wonder of the human mind."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"Since many of Polanyi's main ideas in the book are given in other reviews, I thought it might be helpful to mention some other figures that are often associated with Polanyi so as to provide more of a context for his thought. First, the philosopher Marjorie Green, acted as Polanyi's interpreter to the philosophical community while he was alive. Her most accessible work is called The Knower and the Known. She did think that toward the end of his life he started to change some of his ideas (for the worse according to Green) although my cursory reading of the issues surrounding this claim have led me to conclude that it is mostly philosophical hair-splitting. I consider Thomas F. Torrance, theologian and former moderator of the Church of Scotland, to be Polanyi's best living interpreter. He is particularly important to understanding trends in theology that have been influenced by Polanyi's thought. Most helpful is a long article that was published elswhere but is now found in a book called Transformation and Convergence in the Frame of Knowledge. Torrance does an excellent job of comparing Polanyi to the another big name in epistemology, namely Karl Popper, arguing that Polanyi's views are more inclusive and therefore superior. Some instructive comparisons between several seemingly disparate figures such as Kierkegaard, Piaget, Einstein, and Torrance can be found in a book entitled The Knight's Move by Loder and Neidhardt. I think someone has also mentioned it but Everyman Revived really is a nice little summary of Polanyi's main ideas. If you are a philosophy student you must read Personal Knowledge as it is the magnum opus of a very influential but often little recognized figure in the history of epistemology and the interface between science and philosophy."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"Polanyi's book is hard stuff, indeed. His arguments and examples especially from his own field, i.e. chemistry, are often not too easy to understand let alone to be verified. But the book lacks any kind of obscurantism. The difficulties might stem from the actual thesis of the book itself: Knowledge is not gained by an objective flow of events and therefore the necessary outcome of a determined scientific endeavour, but it's grounded in so human conditions as the sense of beauty and passion. There's always a foreshadowing of the kind of enterprise and even of probable results that make scientists follow some line of argument or experiment and letting the other, so Polanyi's thesis. The decision therefore is not guided by any objective and given fact, but mainly lies in the realm of the scholar's interest, which gains a sense of reality, yet. I'm not sure, whether Polanyi would be pleased by that, but certainly he stands in the tradition of Kant and Wittgenstein, who in their respective develepment of a theory of knowledge point to the fact, that it's always human condition that shapes knowledge. There's no such thing as the being itself but always being as perceived through our senses (Kant) or language (Wittgenstein). In a time, where in the so-called life- sciences the human being is in danger of being reduced to his/ her genes and by that to the raw material of any kind of possible experiments, the voice of Polanyi should be heard, because the refutation of objectivism gets into the heart of the matter."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"&quot;Personal Knowledge&quot; by Michael Polanyi is still a valuable contribution, even now.&quot;Magellan&quot; has said that subjectivist investigations don't buy you much anymore, but consider this:Objectivist investigations don't tell you anything about how to use your own mind- the only tool you have for understanding Science to begin with. Yes, our brain is incredibly complex- yes, it has scientifically-investigatable structures which may be responsible for our consciousness- but without the actual, unavoidably personal use of your brain, you have nowhere to begin. I have all the structures that Magellan discussed in my brain, serving me at this very moment- but their function is underneath even what Polanyi calls &quot;subsidiary knowledge&quot;. We can be aware of how our mental processes appear to behave to our conscious mind, but we are not aware of the work and usage of our individual neurons. If Magellan can show me how to become aware of the individual structures in my brain with all their individual neurons, and consciously micro-mangage their function in a way that results in me obtaining a better understanding of the world than I have only through the subjective perspective of my conscious mind, then I will say Polanyi is useless.Until then, exclusively Objectivist investigations of the conscious mind won't buy you much, in terms of understanding how you (necessarily working out of the perspective of your own state of consciousness) comprehend the world we live in. If you want to learn something, anything, from science-- and still retain a sense that you can legitimately use your own subjective mind (albiet carefully) as you learn-- then it is worth reading Polanyi."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"The naturalist, materialist, and empiricist will cringe at Polanyi's book. True knowledge for Polanyi is derived as the mind becomes an active contributor to knowledge and appropriates knowledge through reason. In this regard he is similar to Kant.Dogmatic and exclusive science is thereby dethroned and caste not lower than other forms of knowledge, but along side them. Knowledge based on authority and experience is shown to be interpersonal and relational. As a result, knowledge truly is personal and is not abstract. Therefore, knowledge derived via philosophy, religion, or authority can be just as valid as that which is derived from the chemistry set. This is a difficult task, but Polanyi works hard and ends with a compelling accomplishment."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"Polanyi's rational quest began with concrete science and was transformed into the pursuit of philosophy whereas it ultimately concluded with the discovery of the unambiguous epistemic status of the individual in \\"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy\\" (One \\"fallacy suggests a criterion of consistency ... Only by accrediting the exercise of our intellectual passions in the act of observing man, can we form conceptions of man ...\\"). Michael Polanyi (3/11/1891 - 2/22/1976) was a Hungarian born polymath whose study and work incorporated physical chemistry, economics, and philosophy. He was a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford and died in the UK.The Christian theist or TA advocate will obtain a great deal of insight and application from Polanyi's neo-Kantianism constructions. The professor discloses that the a priori truths of the mind are dynamically concerned with gathering facts and empirical data and making them intelligible for the individual. Concepts about the material elements of human experience would lack the epistemic conditions that properly relate to rational ability without the conceptual apriori assemblage that corresponds to the world. This necessitates the notion that the mind operates the cerebral hardware, it is distinct from the material brain; consequently material reductionism is self-stultifying and not epistemically viable.The author furnishes a thought provoking analysis that demonstrates the sufficiency (perhaps not the necessity) of a pseudo-kantian mindset that makes intelligibility possible. Reductionists, various materialists, physicalists, and sundry naturalists will recoil at the prospect that universal immutable immaterial concepts, forms, and laws are essential epistemic conditions for human experience.If you have read Kant, Strawson, and Van Til and pine for TA style analysis then Polanyi's book with its potent epistemological approach is for you. \\"Personal Knowledge\\" is powerful addition for the library of scientists, ministers, philosophers, epistemologists, and academic minded lay people; how many treatises can one state that about?The Necessary Existence of God: The Proof of Christianity Through Presuppositional Apologetics"},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"\\"The story of the Laplacean fallacy suggests a criterion of consistency...

In such a universe there is no one capable of creating and upholding scientific values; hence there is no science.An Encounter with Polanyi:I was searching John Philoponus of (7th Century) Alexandria, whom Dr. John Mckenna of Princeton proposed to elaborate on his being a forerunner of J. Clerk Maxwell in scientific renovation, by reading his mentor, Thomas Torrance, \\"Theological and Natural Science\\".

Most epistemological theories are highly artificial constructions imposed upon the world as to how humans should acquire and/or validate their attained knowledge. Epistemological philosophers may have a 'personal agenda' which they seek to impose on their readers, trying to prove the validity of speculative reasoning or definitions of certainty or limits of objectivity.

Even though this book is about fifty years old, Polanyi's language is contemporary and easy to understand. His concepts (to me) were revolutionary. And although there were gaps, as there always are in revolutions, the book was educational. I especially enjoyed his application of tacit knowledge to the written word. (Yes! The scientist speaks on the text!)"},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"Michael Polanyi's \\"Personal Knowledge\\" is often mistaken as some excuse for advancing a subjective epistemology. Alfred North Whitehead admired his work, and Bertrand Russel perhaps knew of his work, and if he did, he would have agreed with him I am certain. As a graduate student in a required graduate research seminar, two of the many required textbooks impressed me greatly: Personal Knowledge by Polanyi and Thomas Kuhn's The Nature of Scientific Revolutions. The two really should be read together.I have read both several times since. As philosophy and as a personal guide to my own thought processes. They both have served me well. A thinking person, I advance, must be, at bottom, some form of empiricist at minimum, Cartesian problem or not. On the other hand we can over-geek and miss the point, the big picture. The creative process in science, letters, and the arts hinges on thinking outside the box. Polanyi's greatest contribution here, as I see it, is his step by step dismantling of ideology qua ideology--confuting ideologies of any sort: scientific, religious, philosophical, moral, political, economic, historical, and so on. Ideologies persist because they are useful day to day for those that have trouble with ambiguity and need thought simplified and codified, referring to authoritarian personalities. Ideology does distort reality and makes it difficult to get beyond such rigid cultures of thought in order to breed new, fresh discoveries. \\"Schools of thought\\" tend to calcify thinking processes, often ending in orthodoxy...blinders and blunders.To me, that is the essence of Polanyi's work. His thought has permeated my mind for my entire life. Its impact on me, personally, has been, and continues to be, profound. I live a version his philosophy, and do ascribe to his anti-ideology ideology, as strange as that may sound, personally. Oh!

As one other reviewer noted, books on epistemology are normally \\"dreary affairs,\\" but PK is an exception. Polanyi uses science as the backdrop for his philosophy of \\"what we know\\" and to prove that \\"we know more than we can tell.\\" Polanyi illustrates the contraints of using physics and chemistry in the explanation of our understanding of \\"things.\\" He points out: \\"A physical and chemical investigation cannot convey the understanding of a machine as expressed by its operating principles.\\"There is much to admire and I'm not quite sure where or how to start (I plan to read this again after some time to reflect) so here is Polanyi in his own words toward the book's conclusion:\\"Thus, at the confluence of biology and philosophical self-accrediting, man stands rooted in his calling under a firmament of truth and greatness. It's teachings are the idiom of his thought: the voice by which he commands himself to satisfy his intellectual standards. Its commands harness his powers to excercise of his responsibilities. It binds him to abiding purposes, and grants him power and freedom to defend them.\\"And we can establish it now as a matter of logic that man has no other power than this.\\"He is strong, nobel and wonderful so long as he fears the voices of this firmament; but he dissolves their power over himself and his own powers gained through obeying them, if he turns back and examines what he respects in a detached manner. Then law is no more than what the courts will decide, art but an emollient of nerves, morality but a convention, tradition but an inertia, God but a psychological necessity. Then man dominates a world in which he himself does not exist. For with his obligations he has lost his voice and his hope, and been left behind meaningless to himself...\\"This book tries to serve a different and in a sense perhaps more ambitious purpose. Its aim is to re-equip men with the faculties which centuries of critical thought have taught them to distrust. The reader has been invited to use these faculties and contemplate thus a picture of things restored to their fairly obvious nature. This all the book was meant to do. For once men have been made to realize the crippling mutilations imposed by an objectivist framework---once the veil of ambiguities covering up these mutilations has been definitively dissolved---many fresh minds will turn to the task of reinterpreting the world as it is, and as it then once more will be seen to be.\\"Monumental and classic book.

Skills such as music can only be inarticulately known, that is, they can somehow be understood tacitly and though our cognition may understand the relation of their parts we have difficulty describing these relations through our ability to communicate, i.e. explicit language.

Skills such as music can only be inarticulately known, that is, they can somehow be understood tacitly and though our cognition may understand the relation of their parts we have difficulty describing these relations through our ability to communicate, i.e. explicit language. This is only the tip of the iceberg in Polanyi's thought but I highly recommend this in-depth study of personal knowledge. If you can get through the first few chapters the book gets easier to understand. It's heavy but it's very much worth your time."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"Absolutely first-rate. It's really easy to read because it uses a historical and mini-biographical perspective to express a great deal of its ideas.

What interests me the best - at the moment - is the problem of &quot;tacit knowledge&quot; that is explained very exactly in the book. I appreciate its/his ethical viewpoints as well"},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"I don't think much of personological/subjective explanations of science, such as Kuhn's and Polanyi's, but I think their views should be heard and considered nevertheless. Western writers seem to have an odd fascination with this sort of approach, for reasons that are understandable historically but that I believe are still untenable, most of which is related to the west's obsession with the individual ego and individual consciousness and with the phenomenological and existential approaches to reality that grew out of that.While I respect Polanyi as a scientist (he was a noted physical chemist), unfortunately I think he's sort of gone off the deep end in terms of his subjectivistic interpretation of scientific method and of the work of the scientist, which amounts to an extreme form of neo-Kantianism.The first problem I have with this is that by making the human mind the final arbiter of all knowledge and sense data, a systematic ghost of an illusion pervades all Kantian threories, because there is no strong connection to external reality anymore. While I would agree with Polyani in regard to Kant's basic thesis, that the mind is actively involved in organizing the data of the senses, and that ideas about the external world could not exist unless there were corresponding mental capabilities and constucts to match, this idea, although fine for its day, really doesn't buy you much anymore in my opinion. This is for two reasons, which is the problem of illusionism which I just mentioned, and the second is the approach that has now emerged from the last 75 years of work in neurobiology and the brain sciences, of which these writers seem blissfully unaware.Although we still have a lot to learn, the picture that has emerged so far is both fascinating and impressive. For example, there are 60 trillion cells in a human brain organized into 14,000 major and minor brain centers, and they are all networked together. Each individual neuron has between 3,000 and 100,000 connections with other neurons, producing a neural web of unbelievable complexity. Most sensory neurons are devoted to using feature-detecting algorithms that require advanced calculus to understand, as David Marr has shown, such as the DOG (difference of two Gaussians) function pre-filter for optimization of spatial frequency versus bandwidth that the retina scans by means of a two-dimentional convolution integral to analyze the initial light distribution, and which is followed up with a Laplacian of the Gaussian or second directional derivative for detecting line segments, borders, and other visual \\"primitives.\\"At least at the level of basic sensory processing of visual images, the level of mathematical sophistication as well as just brute computational power and that is being devoted to the process is beyond anything we could have imagined. There is very little reason anymore to insist on its fundamental subjectivity in the Kantian sense. It is true that there are visual illusions at the higher levels of sensory perception, but those are now regarded as special cases, and they are being shown to be explainable in terms of mathematical visual field-distortion theories of these mechanisms that can be quantified just like the basic sensory processes.Another reason neo-Kantian theories don't buy you much is to consider the work of cognitive psychologists and psychometricians like J.P. Guilford. Guilford has evidence for 120 different, discrete mental abilities. We have only just started to find out how all these areas and abilities actually work, but the resulting theories will far surpass in detail and complexity the simplistic philosophical generalizations of previous centuries about how knowledge is acquired and ideas are formed.The bottom line at this point is that classical ideas like Kant's really aren't wrong, but they are like what classical Newtonian physics was after Einstein, when it became a piece of a much more profound, bigger picture. And the rest of that picture will be filled in by work in neurobiology and cognitive psychology, not by further vague philosophical speculation, which can only propose the most general explanations about these epistemological questions, rather than demostrate in detail how the mind and the brain actually perceive and extract information from reality and then use the information from sense data to generate ideas about the real world."},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy","review":"I don't think much of personological/subjective explanations of science, such as Kuhn's and Polanyi's, but I think their views should be heard and considered nevertheless.

For example, to mention just a few of his important ideas, Marr's demonstrations that retinal receptive field geometry could be derived by Fourier transformation of spatial frequency sensitivity data, that edges and contours could be detected by finding zero crossings in the light gradient by taking the Laplacian or second directional derivative, that excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields could be constructed from &quot;DOG&quot; functions (the difference of two Gaussians), and that the visual system used a two-dimensional convolution integral with a Gaussian prefilter as an operator for bandwidth optimation on the retinal light distribution, showed that the level of mathematical sophistication as well as just brute computational power that is being devoted to sensory information processing is beyond anything we could have imagined.Since Marr's time, there has been further progress in this area, such as the Bela Julesz's demonstrations that the visual system can extract and compute binocular disparity cues point-by-point for depth information from abstract, non-representational pictures such as random-dot stereograms. There is also the extension of Marr's ideas about monochromatic edge detection into color edge detection, the mathematical theories of nonlinear visual field distortions present in optical illusions, and many other areas.Finally, consciousness itself may yield to research on the brain. In the last few years, consciousness has been shown to be composed of many different separate mechanisms in the brain that are being coordinated in time in order for consciousness to occur. It isn't a single process or central program that runs in the brain, nor is there a &quot;master&quot; brain center that one can point to where it can be said that consciousness resides, contrary to classical philosophical models which regarded it as unitary and indivisible.Hence, there is very little reason anymore to insist on the fundamental subjectivity of perception in the Kantian sense.

Almost every book includes a detailed schematic of an example ship, and some of the schematics are fold-outs.My first introduction to the set was The Frigates -- excellent writing about a crucial but little-know piece of American history. After that, I was hooked. My other favorites were Fighting Sail, The Armada, The Racing Yachts, and The U-Boats. The weakest books are The Luxury Yachts and The Great Liners (although Liners has the best schematic in the whole series, a gorgeous four-page fold-out of the Normandie). The early histories -- Ancient Mariners, Pacific Navigators, and Vikings, are fascinating reading, too.Got the bug for nautical history?

Yes, it's a biography of a minor original Trek actress who lasted only one season and in a rather \\"fifth wheel\\" role at that, but fortunately for readers the stories of Grace's pre-Trek Hollywood days are damningly interesting, while her post-Trek days are interestingly damning.As has been noted elsewhere while the book is an autobiography, its main purpose is to serve as a mea culpa for all the disservices done to her friends, lovers, self and career due to alcoholism. But not just alcoholism - in a broader sense Grace suffers from an addictive personality, which when combined with a rather nave outlook serves only to reinforce her problem. These issues alone could have resulted in an extremely ponderous book on recovery and religious conversion (is Grace simply trading one addiction for another?) but fortunately it's an interesting trip that probably would not have been written if not for the fact that Grace has little to lose by doing so.Grace is not a deep thinker - she tends to stop analyzing things once she comes up with a rationale that fits the way she'd like them to be, and when it comes to her understanding of other people's motivations, of religion, of cause-and-effect... the simplest explanation is often the chosen one. One can only consider that \\"The Executive\\" was already aware that she was to be written out of the series before making his detestable (re-)casting couch pass, that the writers were never quite sure what to do with the character of Janice Rand, and that her lengthy grudge against Roddenberry for not sticking up for her is the main motivation for the rather hypocritical character-assassination chapter where Grace the Sexually Unfaithful Alcoholic Converted Jewish Atheist Turned Dry Born Again Christian lambastes Gene for being a secular humanist in an open marriage. Oh, the irony.It's best to stop here - much more could be said, but my main thrust in writing all this is to hope that readers will not be scared off by the religious or recovery overtones and enjoy the book. I would have liked to have read more about working with the rest of the Trek cast (only Spock & Kirk receive much mention) but it's fascinating reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"Grace Lee Whitney is a hero for those recovering or considering recovering from alcoholism and addiction.

I would recommend it for anyone, you don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy it......."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"I was very impressed by this memoir. Grace Lee Whitney went through some terrible ordeals in her life and her account of how she eventually recovered from them and found spiritual peace as a Jewish Christian, while somewhat unorthodox for me to fully comprehend at first, ranks as one of the most inspiring accounts I've read this past year. Probably what impressed me most however, was her willingness to challenge the late Gene Roddenberry's long-standing diatribes against religion and faith in general by using herself as an example of what happens to one who decides its better to reject God in the name of doing one's own thing and thinking it's somehow \\"liberating\\" when ultimately it leads to the worst consequences imaginable.POSTSCRIPT (2005)-It is time for me to update this review to specifically respond to the 2004 review of \\"Colonial Jedi\\", a militant atheist who lets his own views slam Grace for her spiritual rebirth. Grace's defense of religious faith from the secular silliness of Gene Roddenberry needs no further defense from me, but his sarcastic \\"figure that one out\\" regarding the fact that Grace is now a Jewish Christian, is a demeaning insult to thousands of Messianic Jews who would characterize themselves in the same way Grace does."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I am having a difficult time deciding how much. It certainly was one of the more interesting and truthful ones, as far as autobiographical information goes. It was not however, one of my favorites, as far the Star Trek Alumni Biographies go. George Takei's and Walter Koenig's take the top two spots there. Her battle for sobriety was forthright and made for good reading. I can't really buy into her claims to have had visions from God, although I do believe that SHE believes them. Whether that affects the overall \\"rating\\" for the book, I guess you will have to decide for yourself. Otherwise, I found her forthrightness to be a refreshing aspect, although the writing here is not quite up to par.She does vididly describe her Star Trek experiences and those since, and finally reveals the truth behind her departure from the show (a really stupid mistake on the producers part; Yeoman Rand would have continued to add a lot to the series). Overall, the book was a worthwhile read, and most people won't be disappointed, but you might find books from the other Star Trek Alumni to be better written."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"There is, say, everything from a photo of attractive Whitney from the 60's when she was on guest starring Batman (playing opposite also-guest Victor Buono, a man she describes as one of the sweetest men she ever met) to her early 80's shot when she was imitating Bo Derek with a braided hair style. But the main text is fine too. This bio (with more depth) confirms facts we TOS Trekkies already knew about her, like how her life style just sank to the bottom and of the ocean and then much deeper when she was suddenly dropped from the original ST series. We learn that James Doohan (Scotty) was the man she was mutually closest to on ST:TOS and other new facts as well."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"I'm a life-long fan of the original Trek series. I had the hugest crush on Yeoman Rand since my childhood. I've always wanted to hear Ms. Whitney's story and clear up all the rumors I heard in the 70's about the reasons she left Trek and what really happened to her afterwards. This book clears it all up. It was also interesting to hear about all the movies and celebrities she's worked with, pre &amp; post Trek.The thing I didn't like about this book was all the religious ranting she goes off on. I sympathize for Grace's alcoholism, but she must have really gotten brainwashed by this particular group of AA religious folks. She seems to blame herself for everything that went wrong in her life, before and after alcohol-- even getting raped! She even calls herself an alcoholic when she *stopped* drinking for 8 years in the 70's! Hell, every chapter ends with &quot;this is what alcoholics do&quot;. It was so sad to hear her self-loathing rants. This book often sounds like it's written by a cult member. And I think it was. Especially since she claims to be a &quot;Jewish Christian&quot;. Figure that one out.I will never ever stop being a fan of Grace Lee Whitney's. She's an extraordinary woman. She's 73 years old now and is still a very attractive woman. But as an atheist, it was hard for me to read this book. But if you can get past the self-loathing and religious dribble, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"Grace Lee Whitney was a large part of Star Trek in the beginning and I always wondered why she just disappeared from the series..Well, this very insightful autobiography tells you, along with other very interesting anecdotes about her involvement with the series. Yeoman Rand was an interesting character and it would have been neat to see where Grace would have taken this character if she had been allowed to continue in the role.It's quite revealing how Grace plunged into the depths of alcoholism and other addictions and how she literally \\"ruined\\" her career in Hollywood with a bad reputation. However, it's quite inspiring to read how she pulled herself out of this hole and gradually came in touch with her religion and the realization that she needed to change her aberrant behavior and start respecting herself again..For anyone who has experienced great lows in their life, they should read this book and be inspired!Of all the autobiographies written by former castmembers this is the one that is most heartbreaking..however it does have a happy ending!

I had the pleasure of interviewing Ms. Whitney and reviewing this autobiography for The Detroit News when the book was first released. I was struck by her graciousness and kindness, but I was also struck by the gritty strength she conveys in this book. Frankly describing incidents like her hit-and-run on Grand River Avenue in Detroit, and her guarding the bathroom door of a Chicago club while the heroin-addicted Billie Holiday was getting shot-up inside, she just puts it out there, none too concerned what her cult-TV fans will think of her. You've got to appreciate that. And it's pretty clear, throughout the book, that her motives are not to make herself look good, or bad, but to shine a light on the effects of a gruesome and very common illness."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"I am a long time Star Trek fan who bought this book because I have had the honor of meeting Ms. Whitney at a couple of conventions, and she has impressed me with her warmth and wit. I read this book in a single sitting because I could not put it down. Unlike the other Trek memoirs I've read, this one focuses not on a TV series, but on the incredible story of a woman's fight to find peace with God and herself. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever experienced tragedy, loss of self esteem, or addiction. The one thing that concerns me most is that I feel too many people will look on this as just another Star Trek book when its audience should be far greater than just Trek fans. The author has bared her soul in an attempt to help others, and the courage that must have taken is awe-inspiring. Bravo, Grace Lee!"},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"I found this author's openness \\"amazing.\\" The story of the original Star Trek is very little because the author kept the story line mostly \\"about her life\\", her ideology and personal affairs more than about Star Trek. Star Trek is used as a vehicle to tell her story of alcohol, sex, drugs, religion, recovery and survival; which makes it an Important book for anyone who is suffering from addictions. I found the book educational about what one goes through when in the throes of addiction; i.e., dry drunk where alcohol is replaced by pot, medical issues about circulation in the legs, etc. from alcohol and drug abuse, etc. I find the story of her ex-husbands being able to railroad and take her to the cleaners financially very informative and a \\"wake up call\\" to others in a similar situation, meaning, being drunk or stoned blinds one and makes a person a victim to those who are opportunists. I found the recovery part of the book great -- the author's lifelong longing to feel connected, loved and accepted by those she likes and respects and she finally feels all this when with the actors in the AA meeting she'll finally attend and accept sobriety. This is a wonderful thing she shared with us readers as many in our society do feel this same sense of longing. The author also showed an iron will throughout her life, which I'm sure is why she was able to survive such a tragic, horrific life of abuse. It's a good read, well written and one I'd recommend to those who learn and grow from another's experiences, i.e., marrying someone without really knowing their attitudes about women. The first ex-husand in this book is a great example. His looks, talent, being in the music industry became more the author's focus than him being from a background that is known for their horrific neglect of women and total male authority over women. And, the second ex-husband is a great lesson in that a person can go over the edge when an alcoholic or drug addict when getting involved with someone who is one also. There is much to gain from reading this book when one is struggling with abuse of any kind, whether it's emotional neglect, men with anger outbursts in marriage, to women who marry not really knowing the other person, to those afflicted with addictions.

She tells more of what went on behind the scenes than most of the other characters did in their books. She is so open in writing this book that it really should not go unread."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"I remember when I first laid eyes on Grace Lee Whitney. It was an airing of the Star Trek episode \\"The Man Trap\\". At the time the only woman I know who's on the show was Uhura, so I thought she was one of those girls-of-the-week guest stars. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was a recurring character in the show's early episodes..in fact, one of the main characters. I never understood why her character disappeared and it was a shame, as Yeoman Rand character certainly added a lot to the show, especially in episodes like Miri, Charlie X and The Enemy Within.Grace Lee Whitney's autobiography is easily one of the more overlooked of the Trek bios as even though she was a major character in the show, and it is also one of the more disturbing and eye-opening.Grace Lee Whitney was adopted by the Whitney family while still an infant. I have to said that her adoptive mother was a real \\"B\\", as she revealed to Grace while she was in her early teens that she was not her \\"real\\" mother. This seem to marked a turning point for Grace as she embarked what became a life-long quest to fill that sense of emptiness and belonging. Being born with an addictive personality, booze, drugs and sex naturally and coveniently filled that emptiness.Grace had a career that any actor would kill for. While not famous, she was a prolific actress and worked constantly. When she was casted as Yeoman Rand in Star Trek, it seems she has finally find a surrogate home she can called her own. That came to a crashing end when Yeoman Rand was written out of the show. Sure, actors loses jobs and get written out of shows all the time, for the most part, they moved on. But not for Grace Lee Whitney. Star Trek became her lifeline and for years afterward, Whitney tried to numb her anger and sorrow with more booze, drugs and sex. The rest of the book chronicled her continual descent and eventual recovery and her road to sobriety.After reading the bio, I have to say that Grace Lee Whitney doesn't give herself enough credit for her recovery. Her story could have easily been a \\"poor me a victim of 400 years of oppression\\" story, but instead, she blamed no one but herself for what she went through (yes, even when she was sexually assualted by an un-named TV exec, she realizes that she should have known better than to place herself in such a vulnerable situation). Her story could also easily have ended like that of Heath Ledger, River Phoenix, Judy Garland, James Dean and even Elvis Presley. We easily could have been reading her obituary, but instead luckily, we are reading that she is alive and well and probably more happy than she has ever been.In any case, her bio reminds us that in the end, where we eventually ended up is the result of the choices we make. Life is not fair and some people are dealt with a better hand of cards than others..in the end, we still have the freedom to choose where we're going."},{"Title":"The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy","review":"Grace Lee Whitney truly has written &quot;The Longest Trek&quot; with her heart and soul. She has bravely, and with love, held nothing back as she relates the incredible adventures she has lived in her journey through life. It is hard to imagine how such a beautiful person could possibly feel inadequate, but you feel her pain as she strives to reach her goals. The Hollywood &quot;Tid-bits&quot; are fun to read about. It is evident that Grace Lee wants to help others to learn from her painful mistakes. With time she has grown to accept her experiences, live with the memories and look forward to the future.

In addition, it was great to read a female account of the Star Trek phenomenon NOT written by a woman hell- (or heaven!) bent on proving she is a better man than any or all the men in the known universe.I think Ms. Whitney was mis-served by her publisher or, perhaps, her collaborator, however. Her book is choppy, repetitive, and contains some misstatements. (Was the character's name \\"Uhura\\" or \\"Uhuru\\"? How many kids does Shatner have?) A good editor or ghost writer could have limited the meandering, tightened the focus, fact-checked, and improved some of the diction without losing the author's own voice. This is not a criticism of the author (who is a professional actress, not a professional writer) but of the people who printed the book. It is insulting to literate readers to find the equivalent of the following sentence on virtually every page of this book: \\"I was a green kid wearing bobby sox with my high-heeled shoes, taking it all in with my youthful fascination.\\" (p. 29) (No, I did not red-pencil the book as I read--I opened to a random page to cull that example.)I'm writing this because Ms. Whitney has points to make about religion and the human spirit that risk getting lost beneath the bad prose. Many educated (perhaps over-educated) people who might benefit from her points will, sadly, refuse even to consider them as they are written; these are the people who know they know everything and turn down their noses on the literary efforts even of C. S. Lewis and Thomas Merton. There is definitely a sharp mind and an excellent psychologist within Grace Lee Whitney, as are shown in her analysis of Gene Rodenberry and some of her throw-away points (such as the religious nature of Star Trek to some of its fans). By her own account she is a person with a lot of energy and perseverence. She deserved the help of someone who could have produced a book that might have transcended both the \\"Star Trek\\" and the \\"Twelve Step\\" genres."},{"Title":"The great comedians talk about comedy","review":"I first read &quot;Great Comedians&quot; in 1972 when I was starting out as a comedian. I found it to be just what I needed as a young aspiring comedian. The interviews of Woody Allen, Shelley Berman, Jack Benny, and Phillis Diller resonated with me and helped me immensely in my standup comedy development. It also inspired me to write my own book probing the methods of my generations great comedians (&quot;Comic Insights&quot;) in order to help today's young comedians get a better idea of what it takes to do quality standup. I recently read &quot;Great Comedians&quot; again, and my original verdict still stands. This book is still of immense value to all aspiring comedians."},{"Title":"The great comedians talk about comedy","review":"It's no secret that comedians -- great and not-so-great -- are influenced by the WORK of other comedians. The advent of film in the 20th century made this a lot easier since when a comedian died the work was still available...and now with videos etc. it's easier than ever.But what about HOW these comedians made laughs...how they were inspired...what specific techniques they used and did not use...and what advice they would give anyone interested in going into any area of comedy?Those have been tough answers to get. To do it you'd have to buy a slew of good and sometimes rotten bios, many of them out of print. Until now. Stand-up comedian Larry Wilde's Great Comedians Talk About Comedy brings it all together.Great Comedians is a superb, singular achievement that collects within one lively, 402-page, info-packed volume, detailed interviews done over several years with some of the 20th century's greatest comedians and comedy actors.The selection is absolutely mind-boggling: Woody Allen, Milton Berle, Shelly Berman, Jack Benny, Joey Bishop, George Burns, Johnny Carson, Maurice Chevalier, Phyllis Diller, Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Dick Gregory, George Jessle, Jerry Lewis, Jerry Seinfeld, Danny Thomas and Ed Wynn.Each interview is presented in straight Q&A; format so you get to \\"hear\\" the question and \\"hear\\" the response, from what the comedian/comedy actor says to his/her own speech pattern. These folks worked in venues from vaudeville, to radio, to night clubs, to radio to early silent movies to talkies to TV. And their responses to questions contain revelations and constant inspiration.A key theme: how \\"making it\\" in comedy requires timing, good material, dogged persistance, constant analysis of jokes/laughs and being LIKEABLE to an audience. Copying someone's stage personna or stealing their jokes just won't do it.My favorite interviews were with Woody Allen (how he writes ten jokes on everything from matchbooks to napkins and only uses a few; how he won't try jokes out on friends since they're often too negative; how audience appeal MATTERS...and his pointing to Jackie Gleason as someone who often had a lousey show but people loved him), Jack Benny (the importance of learning comedy and advancing step by step...an explanation of his legendary timing), Joey Bishop (\\"...Luck cannot sustain you.Only talent can sustain you..\\"), George Burns (tips on timing, attitude and the importance emulating but not copying other performers), Phyllis Diller (five truly SUPERB short inspirational tips that can advance MANY careers...Her high laugh per minute standards), and Jerry Seinfeld (timing, getting into a focused mental framework and how his love of comedy as a kid blossomed).This book an essential for ANYONE interested in comedy, or for students of comedy, public speakers, or anyone who simply wants to be funny in public. It's ALL HERE: the inspiration, the tips, the stories, the bios...the TOOLS.It's now a cliche to say \\"comedy isn't easy\\" and the whole process is mysterious. Larry Wilde's Great Comedians Talk About Comedy makes it less mysterious and -- a a bit easier."},{"Title":"The great comedians talk about comedy","review":"There is very little to dislike in the content of the book. He interviews some of the great comics,comedians,funnymen of the 20th century about craft. The candidness of each interviewee is what struck me upon first reading. It often seems that comics can be quite elusive when it comes to discussing their craft. The general consensus among the subjects is that one has some innate funniness present that he can hone and sharpen in order to become a truly great comic. Wilde asks some very poignant questions about each one's process: writing, performing, and breaking into the business. He also requests of each that they divulge their major influences and what specific things they might have picked up from each. Very interesting stuff (I found out about several comics I had never heard of). There is also the requisite interview fodder of personal history and amusing anecdotes. This book seems to be the only one of its kind and is invaluable for its diverse perspectives from some of the greats. Berle, Hope, and Burns in particular provide interesting contextual history of their vaudeville days starting out (and the transition to post-vaudeville). The subjects chosen each share an unparalleled longevity in the business. I especially enjoyed the Berle and Woody Allen interviews. Each sheds light on specific aspects of &quot;technique.&quot; The comics chosen represent a wide range of comedic styles: the reader is bound to be a fan of at least one. The book is an interesting historical document and quite unique: +5 stars.I do have some criticisms of the book (-1 star). During later interviews in the book (chronologically), Wilde becomes a bit too referential. For example, he might begin a question with &quot;Milton Berle once said to me...&quot; Though it's interesting to see if a particular comic agrees with the others on certain points, this is not a terribly effective way to ask a question. Who in their right mind in the business would say that Milton Berle is full of it? The question can be asked without reference to the source (and therefore without the consequence of bias). Furthermore, the price is outrageous considering that the book could have been half the length if such a massive font was not used. Many responses to questions in the book have been edited and ostensibly continue beyond the transcription. You will notice the liberal use of elipses in nearly every interview. Perhaps if a standard font was used more of the abridged interviews could be included at no additional cost. This 2000 edition adds an interview with Jerry Seinfeld, but I'm not entirely certain how he was chosen as the only modern comic included. Could the book (originally published in 1968) have been put out cheaply in paperback? Only Larry Wilde's accountant may ever know."},{"Title":"The great comedians talk about comedy","review":"If you want to learn about humor - go to the best. Larry Wilde's book Great Comedians Talk About Comedy does exactly that - Wilde interviews many of the great comedians of our time to discern the essential skills of their trade. As a former stand-up comic, Wilde knows exactly what questions to ask and the result is a priceless collection of interviews with comedians like Bob Hope, George Burns, Jerry Seinfeld, Jack Benny, Milton Berle and Johnny Carson.What makes people laugh? This is a hard question to answer. Even these masters of humor find it difficult to pin down. Perhaps this is so because humor is an emotional reaction which we are trying to explain in intellectual terms. In the book Wilde addresses this problem and at one point poses the question directly to George Jessel. &quot;Why do you think people laugh at what you say?&quot; Jessel answers &quot;At what I say? Because there's an honest quality...&quot; A surprising answer - don't you think? People laugh because they like you? Yet this same theme weaves in and out of several interviews in the book - starting with Woody Allen who elaborates &quot;What they want is an intimacy with the person. They want to like the person and find the person funny as a human being. The biggest trap comedians fall into is trying to get by on the basis of their material. That's just hiding behind jokes...&quot; In a crisp exchange with Jerry Lewis the same point comes up. Wilde: &quot;Be yourself?&quot; Lewis: &quot;Exactly.&quot; Wilde: &quot;What you really are?&quot; Lewis: &quot;Right.&quot; But the interview with Jimmy Durante summaries this point best. Wilde: &quot;What is the greatest quality a comedian can have?&quot; Durante: &quot;Heart. He's gotta have heart. Otherwise he's nuthin'&quot; Amen!It is impossible in the context of a short review like this to summarize all the priceless gems interspersed in the pages of this book. The interviews disclose the rock-solid advice of the world's best comedians. For example, Jack Benny: &quot;...there is nothing as important as editing&quot; - Joey Bishop about Sammy Davis Jr.'s philosophy: &quot;I don't know the meaning of success but I do know the meaning of failure - trying to please everybody.&quot; Jimmy Durante on imitating other comics: &quot;There's never been an imitator that ever got to be a big star - that I know of.&quot; And so on.As someone who does stand up comedy himself I have two precious books in my library on this theme. This book is the first one. The other is Larry Wilde's book How the Great Comedy Writers Create Laughter. Both summarize the views of the world's best humorists. They are, therefore, truly the greatest. I strongly recommend them to readers everywhere.

I think of how much Jack Benny meant in the old days to my parents. And how when we were growing up Tuesday night had to be with Uncle Miltie or it was not. I think of the great heart of Jimmy Durante \\" Good Night, Mrs.Calabash wherever you are.\\" And also of Shelley Berman( \\"Some people say Aristotle died in Chalcis Euboea. I think Aristotle died 'of' Chalcis Eubeoa\\") Also others featured here, Carson who passed away this year who gave so many Americans their nighttime entertainment, and George Burns who with his, \\"Gracie.Say good night\\" always brought a smile. And even Joey Bishop who never seemed to me in the least funny , and Woody Allen( Unlike everyone else who reviewed this book I did not find his interview either interesting or funny, though I admit he has made a few clever remarks in his time. ie.\\" I don't want to be an immortal.

I followed his routes on my atlas and discovered that he did not always follow a west to east route, but rather zigzagged north to south to east as his interests changed. In India he narrates his fascination with the role of monkeys in society, the strange vestments and customs of the people there, so alien to anything he had ever seen or experienced. Then he spends years and years in the Orient, befriending the Chinese emperor, learns to speak Chinese to the point where he practically forgets his native Italian, even becomes governor of a Chinese state. From adolescence intoto adulthood, Marco travels with his father and uncle during 30 years, discovering the marvels of a world unknown to the west, by ship, elephant or camel, or on foot over some of the world's highest mountains, against all odds but driven forth by endless curiousity and optimism."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"I bought this book for kindle version, and when it was transferred it appeared to be the sample version, on the cloud it was complete and I tried to send it again, the same stuff: uncomplete, sample version on kindle again.

I very rarely quit reading books, but this one wore me out. On the plus side, I did experience what life was like for early explorers. Distances were described in days of travel rather than miles. Hardships \\"on the road\\" were extreme. But the heart of the book, the descriptions of the places visited and the people of these places, left me truly wondering about the veracity of the experiences. Lush gardens with mellons piled high in the middle of a desert seemed highly improbable. But even more annoying was the feeling of being lost in an unknown world. Although Polo did not have any maps when he traveled, having maps would have helped the modern armchair traveller to know where Polo was so the reader could more easily determoine where in the world was Marco Polo. It all seemed too fanciful and disconnected for this reader."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"\\"The Travels\\" of Marco Polo is easily one of the most important books in Western literature. Written during the Late Middle Ages, this book has been widely read and appreciated for nearly 700 years. Yet modern readers should note that this is not a modern work meant for pure entertainment. Furthermore, \\"The Travels\\" is not a narrative work in any sense, but rather a collection of anecdotes, observations and impressions of places little understood by Europeans during Polo's time. Considerable attention is paid to the products, wild-life, climate and various customs of the places visited by Polo (if indeed he did visit them), yet from this book we know almost nothing about Polo himself or his life during the decades he spent abroad. Thus don't expect a rousing adventure story, but rather a loose collection of stories - some real, some plainly fantastic - similar to those found in the first half of \\"The Histories\\" by Herodotus. Yet this book still offers much to enjoy and is a great read if you can accept the literary conventions of Polo's time and take the information presented here with a grain of salt.Regarding the Penguin edition: this version provides a very useful historical introduction to pre-Renaissance Europe and interesting biographical information about Marco himself. Furthermore, the numerous footnotes throughout the book make clear the differences between the early manuscripts of this work (at times, the extant MSS differ considerably) and the editors do a decent job (for a non-scholarly reader at least) of providing an \\"accurate\\" version of the text."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"During the 13th Century the Mongols conquered most of the world from China to the Black Sea, providing a rare window of opportunity for people to travel from Europe to the Far East. A few adventurous Europeans accomplished it. One actually wrote about it: Marco Polo. Many years later, as he lay dying, family members and the attending priest begged Marco Polo to recant all the outrageous lies he had told about his incredible adventures. He refused, insisting that everything he said and wrote had all been absolutely true.The record Marco Polo left of his travels stirred the imaginations of Europeans about the possibilities that existed beyond their own limited horizons. Little more than two hundred years later they had established a trade route around Africa to reach the Far East, and attempts to do the same thing by sailing westward had revealed the existence of two hitherto entirely unknown American continents.The Travels of Marco Polo is one of a handful of books that can truly be said to have changed the world. This is not merely another adventure story, it is THE adventure story of all time! The Polos traveled thousands of miles through unknown and hostile territory in order to reach lands hitherto only vaguely rumored to exist. They accomplished it entirely on their own, and not at the head of a conquering army, but as simple commercial travelers.On the down side, this is not the most convenient of books to get through. A good map is an absolutely necessary accompaniment to the text. Even then, many of the names commonly applied today to many of the people and places alluded to in the text have been changed. In fact, some of the places mentioned in the text don't even exist any more. That is, of course, only to be expected after the lapse of more than 700 years. This edition is provided with copious footnotes which, like the map, are an absolute necessity. However, the editors might have made things a lot easier by altering the names of the people and places to their current spelling, and providing a map with locations plotted on it, without really altering the content of the text."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"I bought this book as a requirement for a class.

It to you"},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"I have read this book while traveling in China by train. It is a very interesting description of past times, and essential reading for those interested in historical geography. Several points need to be clarified, though. First Marco Polo is not what one would call today an aeunbiased observer. He traveled on the trips he wrote about while being employed as an emissary for the Mongols, and his admiration for the Mongol regime shows throughout. People and civilizations are judged by their proximity to the Mongol Khan. The point of view of the Chinese and other victims of Mongols is completely absent.Second, Marco Polo was obsessed with power, money, prostitution, and religion. Most of his descriptions center about these things, to the neglect of other aspects of human life. He divides the cities he encounters upon religious lines, even in places like China where the inhabitants themselves weren(tm)t aware or didn(tm)t care about such divisions. His admiration for Christianity and his contempt for Buddhism (whom he erroneously associates with idol worship) shows through. He often writes as if drunken with admiration for Mongol power, praising the Khan for massacring entire cities, while at the same time labeling peaceful people as aepusillanimous.Having said that, these travelogues are still interesting to read. The short-chapter format is very well-suited to reading in the bathroom. The translation by William Marsden is very well-done and easy to read. However, my edition (Wordsworth Editions, 1997) could be improved in several ways. A map for instance showing the route of his travels would go a long way assisting the reader to follow along. Otherwise one has to reconstruct the places from the crude narrative (aeand then we traveled 3 days by camel heading East, then turned to left and walked 1 day ). Frankly, quite often I had no clue about which location he was writing. So I ended up copying a map from a history book and pasting it inside the back cover. Still one desires a more detailed map, with marks designating locations chapter by chapter.Another desperately needed improvement is a translation table. Many of the place names he used had long been ignored and replaced with new place names. In my edition there is one page glossary of place names, but that is far from adequate. For example, the glossary only translates 5 place names in China, leaving dozens other names in oblivion, and leaving me wondering whether the city of Kin-Sai, the one Marco Polo praises the most and devotes the most pages to, is modern-day SuZhou or HangZhou. This is an important deficiency that needs to be corrected. Whatever edition you decide to buy, make sure first that it has a good map and a good glossary of names!"},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"A very remarkable book written in the 13th century. Many secrets were reviled when Marco returned. And may interesting explanations of things like the origin of cinnamon.Marco writes well enough of his travels and you feel that you are there. You can actually follow the trail if you have a map. He describes the flora and fauna of each region and describes the economics and industry of the region.Example: \\"The women of the superior class are in like manner free from superfluous hairs; their skins are fare, and they are well formed.\\"It is interesting to see how little has changed from Marco Polo's 13th century and now.The Nutritional Trace Metals"},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"Though after reading authors such as Edward Said I should know better, I greatly enjoyed Marco Polo's description of his travels. And I think that it is \\"Messer Marco's\\" somewhat simpleminded, straightforward, naively \\"Western\\" and \\"Orientalist\\" approach towards what he saw that makes his book so entertaining. His breathless, hyperbolic descriptions of his travels seem calculated, whether consciously or unconsciously, to give the reader a vision of a world so strange, so wonderful to the Western mind, that they could only comprehend it if they saw it for themselves. And in many ways he (and his ghostwriter) succeeds in producing that effect. His accounts of the Great Khan's feasts and huge array of riches and servants, and well as his descriptions of \\"strange\\" (usually sexual) native customs definitely strive to highlight the differences between what he sees as Eastern and Western civilization. As such, he chooses only the most spectacular and different aspects of life under the Great Khan, aspects that are not coincidentally the most exciting and interesting to read about.Of course, Marco's evaluations and interpretations of what he sees are not to be taken too seriously, but this doesn't make them any less entertaining. Marco's outdated biases and ethnocentric, simplistic interpretations of Asian life give the book an underlying comedic effect.For pure (somewhat trashy) reading fun Marco Polo's account of his travels is a genuine success. Of course, from the standpoint of East/West relations it has more disturbing implications. However, to fully analyze Marco Polo's significance to later Western thought about China, it's implications in the general \\"Orientalist\\" framework as laid out by Said (if you believe in that sort of thing), and how his own prejudices (slavish respect of power, extreme interest in material wealth, dogmatic Christian religious ideas) colored his account is beyond my power."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"This volume will enthrall anyone interested in true adventure. Marco Polo was the original Indiana Jones and then some. Please do not waste time on Gary Jennings' The Journeyer. This is the real deal and needs no dramatic embellishments. The Travels takes you on a trip from 13th century Venice to &quot;Cathay&quot; and back again. You will learn how Europeans found out about fireworks, paper currency, printing and pasta. The harrowing journey across the Gobi desert is particularly well reported. Marco Polo was more than an explorer. He was one of the world's first anthropologists. This is an exciting read, an account of how medieval Europe initially perceived China and the far east, and of how the Mongol rulers and Chinese emperors perceived them. Highly recommended. As to the print quality of the Penguin edition, I have had my copy since the early eighties and it has yellowed only slightly. Viking is now printing on acid-free paper. One must remember that these editions were printed primarily to reach the widest audience for the least amount of expense at the time. For years, Penguins were accessible to students and to the collector who couldn't afford an elaborate, fully illustrated, fully mapped volume of a particular work. I couldn't have read as many of them as I did in my late teens and early twenties if that were not the case. I owe a lifelong debt to the editors for their efforts. I've also never read a bad translation of any Penguin Classic."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"This is a fascinating and timeless narrative for many reasons. On a somewhat superficial level, Polo's book is a must read for lovers of travel or adventure stories, as it reads like a great lost book of the Bible, rife with historic vengeance, heroic warriors, eccentric mystics, penultimate battles and rallying speeches that seem torn out of the best passages of Thucydides. Many of the practices and beliefs Polo witnessed -- specifically, polygamous peoples, perspectives on sexuality, methods of execution and the dazzling ways in which the people Polo came across attempted to please the gods and interpret the cosmos -- offer a memorable glimpse into a unique historical epoch. Particularly engrossing are the stories of violent tensions between Christian and Islamic sects in Polo's day and region. One gets a sense that not much has changed in the past 800 years as Polo details the struggles between the eastern and western world even then, many of which redound to financial issues (sound familiar?). Polo's insistence on portraying Moslems and Buddhists as savage rogues does make for a one-dimensional and distinctly Christian view of the world as it was in Polo's day, and his language is hardly the most attractive aspect of the book, which is written in a particularly conversational and redundant style. But the stories and characters contained within these pages are epic and unforgettable. I encourage lovers of Tolkein, C.S. Lewis and Rowling to read this book. Lovers of ancient history and philosophy are also bound to adore it. Most impressively, though, is the insight Polo offers into the birth of the now-infamous rift between the western and eastern worlds. This enduring relevance guarantees that we will be reading Polo's \\"Travels\\" for centuries to come."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"If your desire is purely technical, you can't do any better than this. However, if you plan to read this book strictly for enjoyment, then thumbtack your eyelids up.

It is brutal and requires every ounce of perserverence to read from cover to cover. I was in pain as I forced myself through countless redundancies in thickly worded prose that left me yearning to drop the book and set off on another. It was a battle to stay engaged.

I had always believed that this book was an adventure story about the first European explorer into the mid east and China. I do not know where this notion came from but on both counts, it is wrong. I picked it up and read it because I continually see references from other modern, authors.What is compelling about the book is the writer's anthropological approach (however primitive) to viewing the societies that were racially and culturally different from the upper crust European society he was raised in. There is a generosity of spirit in this book that will be detailed more further down.It should be noted that like, Benvenuto Cellini's Autobiography, this book features hyperbole if not out right fantasy throughout. There is more than one version of The Travels as well. This book is not written in the first person as it actually is an \\"As told to\\" account that apparently was \\"told to\\" more than one transcriber. There has been much debate over the years about its veracity but that is for someone else to write about. I chose to read this book as if it were fact and not to fret over the overall truth or its details. That being said lets get into the story.Over a period of about 24 years, the young Marco Polo joined his merchant father and his uncle in pursuit of the expansion of their mercantile trade into new regions. This concept should be familiar to any reader who reads about venture capitalism and Red China today. The dynamics may differ but the logic is the same. While this effort led the Polos to discover spices, material and trade routes, it also provided Marco, the opportunity to explore and log his experience with new cultures.He is pretty magnanimous in his descriptions of the peoples he met as he traveled from Asia Minor through cities we hear about today such as Hormuz and Baghdad onto China (known then as Cathay) and into parts of Mongolia and Russia. I say that he is big hearted because he added very little value judgment in relating his experience with these cultures. Unfortunately, he limited what he could describe to a small variety of things.Religion was broken into three categories. There were Christians (he did break them into a few groups such as Nestorian and Greek Orthodox), followers of Mahomet (Islam) and Idolaters (the rest). In some cases though few, he describes the cultures as having no religion as unlikely as that is. It is my suspicion that they were not devout peoples or their customs were too unusual for Polo to understand their worship. He did not render serious value judgments to the religions that were not Christian though he sort of favored that belief system. Specifically, the heroes of battle between people of differing religions was biased toward the Christians just as the performance of any miracles was.Polo described the Great Kings, such as Kublai Khan and the lesser kings who gave allegiance to the former. This was important to him and was noted ad nauseum. He had great respect for Khan including the addition of a Genealogical Chart at the end of the book. He wrote of the Emperor's largesse-assisting the poor, providing examples of fair play and Solomon like wisdom. He also described the ruthless ability to hold power, destroy his enemies and land/nation plundering. He describes these latter events without a hint that anything was wrong with that. Perhaps at this juncture in history, Khan's methods were more civil and humane than the kings in Europe. Based on the North American conquests and slaughtering of Natives 200 years hence, this would seem possible. In my own opinion, the description of Khan reads something like Mario Puzo's Godfather.Another area of special interests lies in Polo's interest with the spices, foods, material for clothing and adornment as well as native wood and building styles. This makes sense because that was Marco's career. He was a merchant. He describes in detail, the reasons different techniques were used to build a ship for instance. The description shows that he had a rudimentary scientific method and imparted that to the reader by explaining why certain procedures were performed based on supplies, climate and water conditions among other things.Polo was a man of the world and that is obvious by his travels but he was clearly educated well. He brought to his journeys and writing, a skill and perception that would only be a result of solid education. His minimal judgmental phrasing also suggests to me that he saw the world as a big place and was not fettered by provincialism that might be expected from an upper crust 13th century European.It is important to note however that the book reveals some of the Magical Realism that undoubtedly prevailed largely in his time. He believed in miracles, reported them on a second hand basis and claimed to see a few himself. It seems again, that by imagining the times and place that this was written, it would be nearly impossible to write a book that denied miracles. He does however toss a tiny bit of skepticism when describing a faith healer (a non Christian one of course). \\"You must not suppose that because I speak of \`Diabolic Art' that that is their account of the matter: They attribute their knowledge to the power of the gods working through a medium of their art\\". He continues to describe these healers having ready made answers when their \\"cure\\" fails and of course it is Divine. Perhaps Benny Hine was acquainted with this book.Polo was fairly interested in the sexual practices of these cultures and he reported some of the more lurid ones. In several cultures that he visited he found that the practice of entertaining visitors (of which he was one) by providing them with the sexual favors of their wives, sisters, nieces etc. The men would make the introductions and then depart to some distant retreat while their dear ones essentially prostituted themselves for the visitors satisfaction. He ended one such description by indicating that a man of 16 to 24 would find such a visit much to their liking. This made me wonder how Polo himself liked it but he did not mention such. Another thing to wonder, based on frank discussion of this and details of a pregnancy test in one of his towns, whether sexuality and the Christian's 6th commandment was considered as taboo as it was in say the Victorian Era. I don't know, it is just a thought.The reader can enjoy this book for the fantastic descriptions of unicorns (probably rhinos), enormous and scary beasts (probably crocodiles) and men with tails. The reader might enjoy the descriptions of royalty which is one place that hyperbole abounds, for instance it is not uncommon for the story to pronounce that some king had thousands of concubines and thousands of servants and hundreds of thousands of soldiers for single battles.The reader might also notice miracles which are plentiful, stories about hens with no feathers, cannibalism and people who live for 150-200 years. They might also marvel at the science that did prevail at the time. There is a description of a messaging system that is easily comparable to America's own Pony Express. Likewise the details of a sewer system that essentially matches our more modern ones, the logic behind curfews and birthing customs all suggest something of interest to me. Specifically, while technology has grown at an extremely rapid pace, people and their logic and belief systems have not really changed dramatically. Nearly, if not all stories that Polo related, have easy counterparts to something or someone that is visible in the media today.There is a down side of this book. Previously it was mentioned that the veracity of The Travels was subject to question. Apparently in Asian historical chronicles there is no mention of this Italian visitor though there is mention of other European guests. He also describes many societies the same, almost verbatim. This may be due to very little difference between one culture and another or perhaps Polo simple cheated and threw in information that he did not have first hand (a little like the ever growing band of journalists, historians etc. that get revealed regularly in our current world).Perhaps the most significant negative comment that could be said about this book is that by our 21st century standards it is just very poorly written. At times it is simply torturous to wade through a meaningless and repetitive description. The book is also written much like we talk. By that I mean phrases like ...\\"I nearly failed to mention...\\" are used throughout. Of course in our day the forgotten piece would simply be edited into its correct location and there would be no need for the brief apologetic line.I assigned this book to myself for this book review. I enjoyed it despite its flaws and quite frankly, it may be all the fantasy of Polo or his transcriber, but I think the book gives us some insight into the 13th century mind of a learned traveler. For that it passes the litmus test of worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"NO ACTIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS = NO NAVIGATION = READER'S NIGHTMARE.The first 6% of the book consists of three Prefaces in which the scholars who worked on the volume praise each other.

There are funny stories (the Khan who employed dancing girls and troughs of milk and honey to convince his warriors that they were living in Paradise) and magical ones (the manufacture of asbestos, called &quot;salamander&quot;). Bigotry had more to do with religion than race; Messr. Marco will describe the marvelous works of some &quot;Saracen&quot; or an &quot;idolater&quot; and then say something nasty like &quot;but he eats the unclean parts of animals, because he knows not the true God.&quot; But his employer, the Great Khan, ruled wisely over people of many diverse creeds, and Marco deeply respects the Khan's tolerance. A recent book by Frances Wood questions the details of the journey, but I prize these tales more for the images they evoke of the lost world where (for example) Iraq was widely known as a center of learning and culture, an exporter of high-quality rich, luxuriant cloths."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"I have read this book while traveling in China by train. It is a very interesting description of past times, and essential reading for those interested in historical geography. Several points need to be clarified, though. First Marco Polo is not what one would call today an &quot;unbiased observer&quot;. He traveled on the trips he wrote about while being employed as an emissary for the Mongols, and his admiration for the Mongol regime shows throughout. People and civilizations are judged by their proximity to the Mongol Khan. The point of view of the Chinese and other victims of Mongols is completely absent.Second, Marco Polo was obsessed with power, money, prostitution, and religion. Most of his descriptions center about these things, to the neglect of other aspects of human life. He divides the cities he encounters upon religious lines, even in places like China where the inhabitants themselves weren't aware or didn't care about such divisions. His admiration for Christianity and his contempt for Buddhism (whom he erroneously associates with idol worship) shows through. He often writes as if drunken with admiration for Mongol power, praising the Khan for massacring entire cities, while at the same time labeling peaceful people as &quot;pusillanimous&quot;.Having said that, these travelogues are still interesting to read. The short-chapter format is very well-suited to reading in the bathroom. The translation by William Marsden is very well-done and easy to read. However, my edition (Wordsworth Editions, 1997) could be improved in several ways. A map for instance showing the route of his travels would go a long way assisting the reader to follow along. Otherwise one has to reconstruct the places from the crude narrative (&quot;and then we traveled 3 days by camel heading East, then turned to left and walked 1 day ...&quot;). Frankly, quite often I had no clue about which location he was writing. So I ended up copying a map from a history book and pasting it inside the back cover. Still one desires a more detailed map, with marks designating locations chapter by chapter.Another desperately needed improvement is a translation table. Many of the place names he used had long been ignored and replaced with new place names. In my edition there is one page glossary of place names, but that is far from adequate. For example, the glossary only translates 5 place names in China, leaving dozens other names in oblivion, and leaving me wondering whether the city of Kin-Sai, the one Marco Polo praises the most and devotes the most pages to, is modern-day SuZhou or HangZhou. This is an important deficiency that needs to be corrected. Whatever edition you decide to buy, make sure first that it has a good map and a good glossary of names!"},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"The kindle edition lacks any navigation features.

It is a scan of an older edition, but the mis-scanned bits have not been touched up or corrected in any way.

The one benefit of this text is that it allows students to see what a truly bad edition looks like, making them realize, in real time, the importance of using a good edition of something.I was hoping to get an inexpensive version of Polo's Travels for my great books class, and ended up with the Modern Library Classics version.Negative five stars!"},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"I am almost finished with the Four Voyages of Christopher Columbus and he was determined to follow Marco Pole's travels so naturally I had to see what this explorer had accomplished."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"I was highly impressed by this book.

There are some tales that are completely stupendous, and cannot be believed at all and then there are some great, anecdotes, a favorite of mine is one were Marco challenges the ability of Kublai Khan's empire to function using a paper monetary system, at which Polo is completely incredulous, a monetary system, everyone in the world uses today. There are some excellent recounts of native islands, unspoiled back lands and an excellent feeling for the travels of a trader that took that original silk route over 600 years ago.

Reading this book helped to teach me how life along the silk road was by connecting with because I could relate to the actual feelings of the author. This book was written by Marco Polo himself, which allowed him to contribute the real thoughts of the traveler, instead of having a hitory book format where the content in emotionless and simply rambles details. With text books, the information goes in one ear and right out the other for me, however by reading this book I was actually able to comprehend the information provided.The Travels of Marco Polo contained bits of info on things such as Africa and India and their culture, China in all its wealth, along with the Mongol empire. When reading this book, you may want to watch exactly what you believe because although it may be true, there are many facts Polo provides that may very well be untrue.

It's an INCREDIBLY interesting book and a fascinating tale, but can it possible be said in a more dry and flat way? There is no energetic spark that makes this adventure jump off the page. Perhaps this is due to the times, but I suspect the translation is a bit literal and bland as well. The writing never changes tone, even in parts that are clearly exciting and amazing. All the facts are there, but the reader is forced to put too much energy just to make it interesting.Marco Polo had a most fascinating journey. Any history buff should snatch this book off the shelves (unless they decide to read the even longer, more annoying records that I'm sure can be found floating around), and anyone interesting in Marco Polo should as well.

He and his uncles were just savvy businessmen away from home on a 24-year business trip. In these memoirs, you get none of the self-conscious, self-justifying, self-aggrandizing introspection so common in the journals of the great 18th and 19th century wanderers. Even Polo's greatest feat--three years spent running a province for Kublai Khan--gets a mere one-line mention. As history and anthropology, this is a superb original source; as exploration, it reveals almost nothing about the minds of the explorers themselves.This edition requires a certain patience. It isn't cleaned up for modern readers. I actually went through it twice--once for the text itself, and then again for the copious footnotes added later. The good news is that Polo's story itself is a surprisingly easy read in this translation. Facts were never the strongest point in the original narrative, and much of the book amounts to a sales pitch for Polo's employer, the Grand Khan.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"Excerpt from my post at [...], 2/4/10:We had another great Marco Polo reading session while the little kids rested upstairs. My Ambleside Online curriculum suggests a few different children's picture books for learning about Marco Polo's travels from Italy to China, but I had accidentally ended up with the actual 300-plus-page unabridged travelogue. With just a few two-color engraving prints as art. When I skimmed through the book, though, it sounded pretty interesting, and I thought it would be fascinating to experience reading the full story, and imagine being like Marco Polo's Italian contemporaries experiencing these travels vicariously through the book's descriptions and no pictures.So I had figured out we would need to read 10 pages per week to finish the book in a school year. With stopping to look up words now and then (salubrious??), follow the route on the map and in our children's atlas, and discuss various events as we go, these 10 pages usually take 45 minutes to an hour. Usually the AO readings are limited to 15 minutes.We ended up reading this time about ruby, salt and lapis lazuli mines, Tibetan monks, ladies in giant fat-hip pants made from huge pieces of pleated fabric, villages carved into \\"clay\\" hills (that sounded a lot like the pictures in our atlas of the volcanic rock villages of Cappadocia in central Turkey), and the Man of the Mountain, Hassan, who stole village youth and brought them to his \\"Paradise\\" garden, where he also trained them as assassins. We also learned that the word assassin comes from hashish, which the Man used to drug these young men so they wouldn't find the secret passage into the fortified garden. We learned that Alexander the Great had married the daughter of Persian king Darius, and that a herd of fine horses along Marco Polo's travels was said to be descended from Alexander the Great's horse Bucephalus.

I'd like to know more about them,- It is worthwhile to read this. In addition, I found a great many references from modern life back to Marco Polo.

Whether it actually happened or not is up for debate. I went into this text with an open mindset and have accepted that Marco Polo did indeed go on this trip with his father and uncle, but not to the extent as surmised. Instead he travelled and added stories he collected from traders and others to fill in gaps or points of interest to him. The book is broken into four sections now. Part One is his trip to the Great Khan's courts in Cathay (China). Part Two is his travels throughout the provinces of Cathay. Part Three concerns going to Japan, Southern India, and the Islands of the Indian Sea (Java, etc). Part Four is travelling into the 'northern countries' (Russia, etc).In general, Polo gives very brief descriptions of most regions, accounting for their religious beliefs, money used, fealty to the Great Khan Kublai. There's some intriguing customs (visitors will be taken into a home and the man of the house leaves until they are gone but the visitor has full access to the household including the wives, daughters, sisters, nieces), talks of cannibalism, dress, unfamiliar animals they encountered, and contributes to the whole messy history of Prestor John. It does get repetitive and dry after a while. Polo's talk of Kublai Khan is almost obsessive and he was obviously completely enamoured of this new culture. Overall, it was fascinating to read although I had to push myself through some parts due to repetitive descriptions. Any history buff should read this story about one of the purported most well-travelled explorers ever, not to mention he was possibly the biggest best-selling authors before the printing press was invented."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"If people really try to think back, to how things were in the ancient world, and see how improbable a journey Marco Polo and his father and uncle undertook, and then completed nearly 30 years after they started, they would probably realize how unlikely such a journey was and why so many people attack Marco Polo as a fraud. Nevertheless, simply as an historical Atlas of China, and with an incredible historical context, warts and all, it is a very illuminating book, showing Chinese cities using their ancient Mongol names (in what other context would someone serving the Mongol emperor record the city names?) and allowing the reader the opportunity to research and discover for themselves, just how fascinating and mysterious other ethnicities and other cultures were to a European of the middle ages.One of the most fascinating aspects of \\"The Travels\\" is not just some of the factual innaccuracies, but the apparent perceptions of Marco Polo, fully willing to believe he had found the final resting place of the first man, Adam, and the wizardry of other peoples, the ability to do magic, and a legend of giant \\"Rocs\\" near Madagascar, and how the Khan sent a small expedition to investigate the rumors of such.If you want a book that makes you ask searching questions about humanity, cultural bias, and the importance of lore and myth in cultures, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"You may have heard in school about Marco Polo and his journey to China and India.

So the brothers from Venice brought many dazzling jewels and set out from Constantinople by ship to Sudak and onward to Barku. A war broke out in Barka's Land forced the brothers to travel the opposite direction from which they had come. After they had crossed the desert, they came to Bukhara (in Persia) and by fortuity met a Tartar (Mongol) envoy on the way back to the Great Khan in Khan-balik (Beijing). On learning that they were merchants from Venice whom had never been seen in the country, the envoy invited the brothers to accompany him to Khan-balik to see the Great Khan.The Great Khan received the brothers honorably and welcomed them with such lavish hospitality after a year's journey. The curious Khan asked the brothers about their Emperors, about the government of their dominions, about the maintenance of justice, about the Pope and practices of the Roman Church, and about the Latin customs. He decided to send emissaries to the Pope, and asked the brothers to accompany on the mission with one of his barons. He entrusted them a letter written in the Turkish language for the Pope and asked him to send a hundred prominent men learned in the Christian religion to condemn idolaters' performances and shun devil. These well versed were to demonstrate for the idolaters their capability of doing diabolic arts but would not, because only evil spirits performed such enchantments.As the brothers approached Egypt, they got wind of the Pope's death and so they would go to Venice and visit their families pending the election of a new Pope. During the homeward voyage, Niccolo learned that his wife had passed away and left behind a 15-years-old son Marco Polo, who authored this book. After staying in Venice for about 2 years, they left for Jerusalem to get the oil from the lamp at Christ's sepulcher which the Great Khan had requested for his deceased mother, who was a Christian. The Travels chronicles the three years' journey back to Khan-balik from Venice, via the ancient trade corridor now known as the Silk Road, and details all the peculiar sights and peoples along the present Iran, Iraq, India, Tibet, Pamir, Mongolia, and China. It also records the many regions Marco Polo traveled during his numerous emissaries for the Great Khan during his 17 years in China.The Great Khan found favor with the then 21-years-old Marco Polo, who had acquired a remarkable knowledge of the letters and customs of the Tartars. Observing his wisdom and perspicacity, Khan sent him as his emissary to Kara-jang (Yunnan) in the far southwest, a mission Marco polo fulfilled brilliantly. When he went on his mission, being well aware of mistakes of previous emissaries, he paid close attention to all the novelties and curiosities that came his way, so that he may report them to the Great Khan. On his return Marco Polo would present himself before the Khan and first gave a full account of the business on which he had been sent. Then he went on to recount these remarkable things he sighted on the way. In The Travels, one will find detailed account of interesting, if not bizarre, customs and practices at which Marco Polo marveled, the very same stories that entertained the Khan who became well disposed to the young lad.For 17 years, Kubilai (the sixth khan in the Yuan dynasty) was so well satisfied with Marco Polo's conduct of affairs that he held him in high esteem and showed him such favor as keeping him so near his person. He observed more of the peculiarities of China than any of his contemporaries, because he traveled more extensively in these outlandish regions, and not to mention he gave his mind more intently to observing and recording them. The Travels reflects the stupendous extent of his travel, as Marco Polo often bypasses many places that were of no particular interest to him.Emissaries sent Marco Polo all over Manzi (southern China) and Cathay (northern China), rendering a vivid delineation of the native people, customs, cultures with amazing verisimilitude. For example, he marveled at the funeral customs in which the deads were provided with horses, slaves, camels, clothes in great abundance - all cut out of paper (a tradition that still prevails among Chinese) and burned alongside. For the Chinese believed the deads would have all the money in gold and all the necessities in the next world, alive in fresh and bone, and that all the honor they did while he was burning would be done to the deads correspondingly in the next world by their gods and idols.Marco Polo also wrote a detailed account of India and its practices of diabolic arts and similar funeral customs. From other historical resources, he probably acquired his knowledge partly when he was there on the Khan's business, partly on his return trip with the bride for Arghun, and that he derived some of it from first-hand observation, some from reliable testimony, and some from mariners' charts. He also wrote about the life of Sakyamuni Buekhan, who was revered founder of the Buddhist religion, for he refused to be the successor of his king father but continued to lead a life of great virtue, chastity, and austerity.In 1293, the Great Khan reposed such confidence in the brothers that he entrusted to their care not only the princess of Kokachin but also the daughter of the king of the Manzi, so that they might escort them to Arghun, Khan of all the Levant. The Polo brothers' adventure in the East thus completed on the note of a successful escort to Kaikhatu. The Travels, also known as The travels of Marco Polo, chronicled all wonders of Marco Polo's encounters in the East for 33 years.2004 (42) MY"},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"All the annotations make this unreadable for anyone other than a dedicated scholar. I'd like to read what Polo wrote not what generations added to it.Not worth $.95."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"Marco Polo's memoir of his life and travels in the medieval Asian empire of Kublai Khan is the ultimate adventure tale, a true one-of-a-kind. As a teenager, Marco Polo, scion of a Venetian trading family, embarked on a two-decade adventure into the remotest corners of the known world through his family's connection with the Great Khan and his court. Year later, (after dictating his story in a prison back in civilized Europe), Polo published a dazzling account of sights he witnessed in lands little known to Europeans of the Middle Ages. So extraordinary and exotic were his reports, that Polo's tales both fired imaginations and inspired skepticism. For the modern reader, the book offers a fascinating picture of a lost world and a sense of ultimate adventure. One element that makes this an appealing edition of an opt-published classic is the use of 32 woodcut illustrations by Witold Gordon originally created for a 1930 edition of the book."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"The translator included in his translation many notes on variations between the 'original' texts he used as source material, but he also includes a lot of interpretations and theories developed later on which diverge from the narrative. If your favorite part of a book is the footnotes/endnotes, you'll enjoy this version, but if you'd actually like to read the text itself, find a different translation."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"It has been a pleasure to revisit the travels of Marco Polo. I was transfixed by these stories of travel and adventure when I was a child, and never questioned the veracity of the narrative. I know today that the narrative has been corrupted over the centuries, that \\"The Travels\\" can scarcely be used as an historical reference, and that a more tantalizing and complete manuscript has probably been lost to the ages. Still, there are glimpses and insights within the narrative that could only have come from first-hand experience, and these describe an enormous, exotic world that titillates even today, while readers in the 13th and 14th centuries must have been enthralled.I was most keen this time around to Polo's descriptions of the cultures and wildlife he encountered, of the whales and lions and leopards and bears--he even describes a white bear, and the people who hunted it were surely of the group often called Eskimos. He describes dog-sledding in the far north and the cannibalistic practices of the people of Java far to the south, both of which are extant in our current era. There are also the fascinating observations of the Mongol Empire, of that group of nomadic people who somehow rose up, like an event in an Isaac Asimov novel, to conquer much of the known world.Somewhat depressingly, though, are Polo's observations of the tensions that existed between the Islamic and Christian worlds, tensions rooted in the competition for hegemony over trade in the Far East. Seven hundred years later, these tensions are still acting themselves out.This translation by Ronald Latham from 1958 includes an introduction that puts Marco Polo's life in context with events and includes footnotes to help the reader make sense of the myriad manuscripts that make up the travels of Marco Polo. This is a somewhat dry read; even Latham comments on the paucity of skill employed by Polo's chronicler. Once I put my mind in context with the narrative, however, I was able to roll with the repetition and sycophancy and enjoy the text."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"There is so little a reviewer could say about a classic that has not already been said. But, whether your interest is in travel literature, ancient history, military history, or anthropology, this book will excite and inspire you. The writing is conversational, witty, and addicting. Though the author repeats some stories, each telling seems to bring out nuances and connections that would have been missed otherwise and each telling takes you deeper into the Asian frontiers and its people. A fascinating traveller's story that never grows old. Must have for any serious student of history especially with regard to the Asian steppes and the empire of the great Khan. Rediscover the wonder of the travels for yourself, not second-hand but from the traveller himself."},{"Title":"The travels of Marco Polo,: The Venetian","review":"A very low four stars here for this journal style book that has come down to us from Marco Polo.The book itself is not overly inspiring at first until the reader gradually is able to put himself into the shoes of a person of the time, as much as such a thing is possible, and the longer you ponder the technology of the time and the mindset of the people the more you come to appreciate just what an achievement this journey really was. While it is true that the somewhat staid style of the journal makes for a not particularly free flowing read there is one heck of a lot of stuff written between the lines. Tales that at first seem somewhat childish can often actually mean something. For example Marcos discussion of great serpents able to eat men and cattle comes across as something not really worth wasting your time on until you twig that the guy is actually describing crocodiles. Having seen specimens over the five metre mark in captivity in Australia I can quite assure you that they can eat a man or darn near anything else they set their mind to.The journey described herein by Polo starts innocuously enough in medieval Italy soon find its way into the heart of the Mongol empire, thence to travel about the place at the behest of the Great Khan himself and from that position Marco is able to deliver numerous descriptions of local people, their customs and news of sites and nations he wasn't lucky enough to visit himself such as Japan.While it is fair to say that the level of understanding Polo achieved of some of the things he saw was limited which in turn limits what we can glean from his account the fact is that with very few possible exceptions he is pretty numero uno when it comes to eye witness accounts that have come down to us means that we really should not ignore his contribution. I must also point out that my own enjoyment of this book was greatly increased and my understanding of what I was reading greatly enhanced by also reading \`From Venice to Xanadu' by Laurence Bergreen.Ultimately I would not buy this book if you are after a breezy Sunday afternoon read. Instead this is probably best tacked by someone with prior experiences of taking on \`classics' of bygone eras as you will be used to some of the idiom and the other main audience I can see for this book is probably travel addicts looking for inspiration.

And her character development is superior.It was indeed refreshing to read Ms. Newcomer's book, as she uses a vocabulary that is significantly more prolific than the average Romance Novelist. Her book, based on historical realities, is not just a romance novel, but in addition, a work of historical fiction. She deals quite extensively with Atilla the Hun, and the time period 450 to 500 AD or so.But at the heart of the novel, is the exposure of the most intimate and private thoughts of her protagonist. Ms. Newcomer takes her reader into the mind of a lady with great knowledge and sophistication, in a very barbaric world. The character allows us to see this barbarism, and understand how she was able to come to terms with it, in her own way, which is certainly unique.The book is a real page turning novel and will provide several good hours of entertainment.

Naipaul is the most important and well-known writer from Trinidad -- a small country in Central America. His powerful fiction has surpassed the frontiers of his country, he is widely read and studied as has already been deservedly honored with a Nobel award. For one thing, his novel \\"The Mystic Masseur\\" sometimes may read as many things we have already read -- but don't be fooled, this is as original and touching as anything sparkling new that any experienced reader may find around.By the way, experienced readers and book lovers will certainly find another pleasure from this novel. At some point, \\"The Mystic Masseur\\" is about the love for books and all the pleasures it can bring to readers. The main character, Ganesh Ramsumair, the masseur from the title, loves to buy and read books. Shelves at his home are filled with many and many volumes from the most different book collections. Like a dream heaven for readers.But he also wants to write and produces his autobiography which also changes his life and his family's and friends' -- sort of. But it is not only about books that Naipaul wants to talk about in his novel. The printed word turns out to be the metaphor for life itself -- both Ganesh's and Naipaul's. As the narrative moves forward, the reader can realize that the eccentric characters of the book -- very Dickensian people -- are a slice of life.The fact that the narrative of \\"The Mystic Masseur\\" is set in Trinidad doesn't change its universal appeal. Naipaul's words are sometimes dream-like, sometimes evocative, but when it is required they are sharp and cut as a brand new knife -- and they hurt. But he never loses the witty. He creates the perfect environment to place his characters, filling the pages with smells, sounds and atmosphere. As Ganesh writes in his book, \`everything happens for the best'. Naipaul seems to agree with him -- so should we."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"Naipaul got Nobel for his treatment of suppressed history - that is what the citation said. How a war and the preceding economic depression can give shape to the cultural, moral aspects of a society is depicted in an astounding detail which is every bit credible! How a corruption infested socity or a corrupt individual with many qualities inextricably get involved in the downward journey when under pressure it overlooks the basics.The dialect the Indians use among themselves although many of them are capable of the English version of the correct form, ironically separates Ganesh Ramsumair, the chararacter under study, from his folks. The centrality of standard English is here directly a trapping of the corrupt establishment to which he surrenders. An extremely significant item for the post-colonial literature studies. Naipaul again is unparalleled in his clarity, language, imagination and forceful assertion of his views. The Greatest living author of our time."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"This was Naipaul's first published book (and the third he'd written). It's a hilarious narrative about life in Trinidad, during WWII. Ganesh has finished his BA in the college at Port of Spain, when he is called home to his father's funeral. Once home, he marries the daughter of a friend of his father's. Ganesh needs a profession. He tries running a small \\"institute,\\" writing, traditional Hindu massage ... he succeeds at nothing, until his aunt, \\"The Great Belcher,\\" introduces him to mysticism. As the Mystic Masseur, he becomes known throughout Trinidad. Eventually he is pulled toward politics, and thus closer to the British colonial culture that will clash with his Hindu values and eventually absorb him.\\"The Mystic Masseur\\" has unforgettable characters: the-father-in-law, Ramlogan; Beharry, the \\"nibbler,\\" whose wife, Suruj Mooma, never passes up an opportunity to remind us that she \\"read to the Third Standard.\\"Later in his career, Naipaul tackled the subject of colonial schizophrenia with much more somber work: books like \\"Bend in the River\\" and \\"A Way in the World\\" touch on many of the same themes as this one, but not with the priceless humor."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"One of Naipaul's early works. Intensely funny but the characters shine through all the humor. Books is a delight to read and Naipaul's English rests easy on the eye. Nothing really happens in the story and VS hints at some message but we dont really get it. But it is an insightful and multi-dimensionally nuanced portait of East Indian culture in the West Indies. A culture that seems to still retain a lot of India while at the same time rapidly acquiring other influences."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"Ganesh,after an unhappy spell at school, decides to become a masseur despite his education and the fact that half of Trinidad are masseurs.On marrying Ramgolom's daughter and extracting a dowry, he moves to Fuente Grove where he flourishes as a Hindu scholar, a mystic healer, author of such tomes as 101 questions and answers on Hinduism where such mysteries as 'What is Hinduism' are answered;'It is the religion of Hindu's'.Eventually he enters the world of politics...Naipaul's first novel is a comic look at the Indian community in Trinidad, a theme he pursued in the (better) 'Miguel Street' and perfected in his timeless comic work 'A House For Mr Biswas'. Having read those two works before 'Mystic Masseur' I found this very much a first novel and a prototype for his later comic works. This has all the ingredients of educated fools, the absurdities of religion and politics and martinet wives that hallmark Indian humour-probably all influenced by Naipaul's observations.Worth a read if you haven't read 'Miguel' or 'Biswas' and still so even if you have."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"What a strange (but fun) little book. Naipaul's intermixing the patois with normal Brit-speak was fascinating. Since education, or lack thereof, is a recurring theme, you never knew who fit where on that spectrum. The characters are a hoot. Though the story takes place in Trinidad, their interactions could be taken from Small Town Anywhere.This is a quick read and there are many laughs in store for you."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"This novel tells the story of Ganesh Ramsumair in Trinidad. There is not much mystical or magical about this fellow, except, perhaps, that he is unique from all the others in the community. These are the trials and tribulations of someone not in a first world country but who knows that he wants more than the status quo. The way to go about this is to be a writer. Writers, he's told, are important and special.A hefty portion of the novel describes how Ganesh goes through encounters with his father-in-law, his wife, his neighbor, his Aunt and others while insisting that he is a writer (although his writings are.... sparse... to say the least). The humor of the novel appears matter-of-factly during the conversations with Ganesh's friends and family and in the convoluted conclusions Ganesh reaches. The idea is to not take the book too seriously, although there are parts which depict the inauthenticity of Westernizing Eastern cultures.Some readers too steeped in a rigid Western mindset might become frustrated with the novel. The characters are not 'dumb,' they are colorful and robust - willing to accept life as it comes and complaining only when complaining seems the right thing to do. Also, the inherent connection between Ganesh (as an individual) and his community is very clear. This is something else that might be challenging for some readers, since it is a somewhat diminished phenomenon in some cultures.Overall, about 30 pages less and I would have given the book another star. The middle of the book bogs down a bit and stalls out. But I think this is Naipaul's first effort and as such it is very worthy. Readers who enjoy books about culture should be pleased."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"V. S.

It was a nice low key whimsical tale, with pretty good character development, acquainting us with the simple, humorous, pretentious characters making up Trinidad Indian society. Ganesh's rise from a bumbling boy, to a sought-after mystic, to an important polititian, has some lessons in it I suppose (value of education, power of and hunger for spirituality, and the dulling of the spiritual by world, wealth, and fame). But this book did not leave me crying out \\"Nobel Prize!\\" (as did Pramoedian Ananta Toer's recently released books). A quick read, view of Trinidad culture, and a few chuckles. So not bad - maybe 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"I just started the book, but it is very interesting and well written so far."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"This is a charming novel. And this is his first work, to boot. A literary debut like this has got to make a few would-be writers wince. At least it's hard for me to imagine how writers could paint characters with even less brushstrokes than Naipaul and still succeed in making them so warm and lively.The magic of this novel is that, even though the setting is in remotely foreign Trinidad-Tobago, it will still secure any reader's attention from the very first page, the idiosyncratic conjugation of the verbs \`to be' and \`to have' in the native patois notwithstanding. What helps is the abundant humor largely of two types: one where you laugh along with the characters in the sheer fortuitous turn of events, the other where you smile at their forgivably human foibles and the narrator's wry observations.The plot itself is humorous. A bookish student named Ganesh Ramsumair is wedded to the plucky Leela through the machination of a crafty penny-pincher named Ramlogan. Having found out prior to the wedding that Ramlogan is charging him for his relatives' food without his consent, Ganesh proceeds to swindle his father-in-law, during an elaborate Hindu marriage ritual - details of which are hard to explain. Having realized that he must now make a living, he tries a few odd jobs, before he hits by luck on the one profession that his island needed most: a mystic. A mystic? Even Ganesh himself is half-incredulous, but sooner or later people flock from all over the country, wanting his help in driving some demon out of someone or other. From there on, his fortune never wanes. The final metamorphosis converts Ganesh into a democratic politician (hah!), a destiny that culminates in his transformation into the thoroughly anglicized \\"G. Ramsay Muir OBE\\".What supports this edifice is a wonderful cast of characters, quasi-cartoonish in their presentation, but still very human. To take an example, the Great Belcher is thus named because of her unfortunate habit of eructation. But she redeems herself to the reader through a string of remarkably level-headed advice. Ramlogan is almost a cardboard cut-out villain, but his fluctuation from resentment to respect for Ganesh is so transparently tied to his greed that it's almost understandable.The exchanges between the characters are also wonderful. One morning Ganesh decides that he and his neighbor should speak grammatically correct English. Neither Ganesh nor Suruj Poopa, his accomplice in literary endeavors, can suppress a smile at their ridiculously polite English. When his wife Leela chides him at night for forfeiting his resolution so quickly, the terse response is that she \\"cook food good\\". The stuff is classic.But the irony of it is that he will end up speaking impeccably correct English and irony is where this novel truly shines. The matter-of-factly narration (peppered with a few general observations) remains fairly detached from his subject, the end result being innocent pokes and wry fun. The sign at his house welcomes the customer with suitably mystic overtones in Hindi, but in English the message is harshly business-like. His \\"election\\" is hardly democratic, and very corrupt. His abrupt transformation from a leftish politician to a right one comes not from conviction but from petty affront.In the end, it would be endless to point out this novel's charms and witty sides. Anyone looking for a fun book should find it for themselves. I can't see how any reader could go wrong with this provided they are not looking for serious profundity. But you can't be reading Dostoevsky all the time. So take a breather."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"The Mystic Masseur was Naipaul's first novel, and it is probably the best known of his works (a movie has been turned out by Messrs. Merchant & Ivory). The main character is one Ganesh Ramsumair, the son of an Indian immigrant to Trinidad, who seems to be blessed by fortune. Each time he is in danger of taking a wrong turn, his fate steps in and gently nudges him in the right direction. Ganesh first attends school in Port of Spain, where he feels inadequate and has only one friend, clever anglophile Indarsingh, who leaves for Oxford upon graduation. Ganesh then attends a teacher's college, and takes a position as an elementary school teacher. He is not a success and resigns his position for a life of idleness, which is ended when his father dies, bequeathing to him some land and some royalties from an oil company. When attending his father's funeral he meets his formidable relation, The Great Belcher, who is one of these wise elderly Indian women who are accostumed to running funerals, marriages, businesses and lives for their younger folk. He also meets Ramlogan, extremely unpleasant owner of a rhum shop who is quarrelsome but cowardly, and not above any underhandedness (he will turn up again and play a crucial part in Naipaul's \\"The Suffrage of Elvira\\"), whose daughter Leela he marries. Much more devious than would appear initially, Ganesh takes advantage of Ramlogan's pride and extracts from him a house in a remote village and a significant dowry. This is fortunate, because at this time the oil royalty checks stop coming in. Ganesh and Leela move into the Ramlogan's house, and quickly become acquainted with the local rhum-shop owner, Suruj Poopa, who becomes Ganesh's true friend and sounding board. Ganesh spends several years doing nothing much except reading and trying to launch a career as a masseur, but he is apparently not very good at it. He even writes a short book on the Hindu religion, but it doesn't sell. Leela, desperate at his lack of direction tries to convince him to take a job working for the Americans in their military base (WWII is now in force), but fate takes a hand when the Great Belcher and Suruj Poopa advice Ganesh to become a mystic. As a mystic he is extremely successful, performing miraculous cures and eventually becoming a public figure. His prosperity communicates to the entire village where he lives, and to his friends the Surujs, and even his father in law, with whom he quarrels again and again. Eventually, after defeating his rival Narayan (peculiar, this choice of a name) he becomes a leader of the Hindu vote in Trinidad, and a Member of the Legislative Chamber. Initially a leftist (he and Indarsingh try to articulate the theory of Socialinduism, a melange of Hindu nationalism and scientific socialism) and a firebrand (frequently arrested for criticizing government corruption), he then becomes a pillar of the establishment, and is finally rechristened Sir Gordon Ramsay, OBE. His Trinidadian dialect becomes the cut-glass accent of the BBC and his Indian garb is replaced by a bespoke vested suit.The story, thus told, loses the sense of destiny that Naipaul is able to weave in through the expert use of atmosphere and character. The self-discovery of Ganesh from his humble origins is very well-rendered, and many characters are memorable(especially Leela, Ramlogan, Suruj Poopa and an unnamed boy who helps Ganesh edit his newspaper). The liberating power of reading the great books (which is what Ganesh reads, rather than the lowbrow fare that Mohun Biswas gobbles up in \\"A House for Mister Biswas\\") is something that must have rung true for Naipaul (as it did for this reviewer). Several themes (the power of small events to have great consequences, and the almost unlimited scope for personal re-invention) were probably also derived from the author's own experience. This book is a triumph and a jewel."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"I try to keep up with Nobel laureates because I am always looking for good reading, and, often, I have never heard of the authors before. I found this book in my local used bookstore. I was intrigued that it was his first novel, and I was especially intrigued by the back cover (1980 paperback edition). There was a quote that comes early in the book:\\"Leela,\\" Ganesh said, \\"the boy want to know how much book it have here.\\"\\"Let me see,\\" Leela said... \\"Four hundred Everyman, two hundred Penguin--six hundred. Six hundred, and one hundred Reader's Library, make seven hundred. I think with all the other book it have about fifteen hundred good book here.\\"Up in the upper right corner was the symbol of Penguin Publishing. It struck me funny that they would be so bold as to use a quote from the book that so blatantly plugs their line as being \\"good books\\" that I had to buy it.And it's actually quite good. It's not just well-written, it's funny, something I was not expecting. I'm glad I began my Naipaul reading with this one. I believe it seems to be the consensus to begin with A House for Mr Biswas, but, to me, that would be like starting John Irving with A Prayer for Owen Meany--there's really nowhere to go but down.The story concerns Ganesh a man from Trinidad who fails as a teacher, then as a masseur (he seems to hurt more than he helps), but then finally finds his calling as a healing mystic, all along keeping his one vice--books. Throughout his life he writes books, starting with 101 Questions and Answers about Hinduism. Here is a sample:Question one: What is Hinduism?Answer: Hinduism is the religion of the Hindu people.Question two: Why am I a Hindu?Answer: Because your parents and grandparents were Hindus.And so on. Ganesh's book career does not really take off until he reaches fame as a mystic. Then he writes his autobiography, which becomes a best-seller, relatively speaking.It's hard to tell how Naipaul feels about his characters sometimes. He often seems to be making fun of them, yet also shows great affection for them. However he feels, I had a marvelous time visiting these people and will definitely pick up another Naipaul work in the future."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"This was the first Naipaul novel I read and I read it straight through in 2 days because it was so much fun.

In these early books, he laboured over every word, and his jokes are funny, his characters idiosyncratic, his use of language not like everyone else (I never saw anyone else write \\"had had\\" before him.) There is genuine innocense of a young writer, writing what he knows, and not yet spoiled by the world.Now, since he was awarded all those prizes, V.S. thinks himself better than his earliest -- and his only realy good -- works. In interviews and writings, he seems a bit embarassed by them.Its like what happened to Mose Alison, who fancies himself a competent jazz pianist, and refuses to play the simple southern philosophical songs that he is so loved for -- he calls them \\"flour sack\\" songs, and will bore you to tears with improvization if you are ever foolish enough to go see MOSE live.One more thing, I had the good fortune to go to Trinidad a few times, where he grew up and where these books are set. In these books, he captures the essence of Trinidadian culture, that one can still see, despite more Western influence.Maybe he did not get the Nobel Prize for these books, but he got me to write my first review on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"This short novel is interesting mainly because it is the first by the author. No one could call this a masterpiece on the level of A House for Mr. Biswas or A Bend in the River but it makes for an interesting read nonetheless. This is the story of Ganesh a masseur, mystic and faith healer in rural Trinidad. Ganesh, a Hindu Indian, makes an improbable rise to political power and eventual knighthood. This provides a opportunity for Naipaul to playfully describe colorful characters and village life among Hindus tranplanted to Trinidad. Naipaul's trademark ironic style is more over-the-top here than as seen in later works. The quirky characters are lovable but not completely believable. This is not to say that the book is bad but that it would be of much less interest were it not for the fact that it is the new Nobel laureate's first novel-length work. Paul Theroux makes a reference to The Mystic Masseur in his memoir, Sir Vidia's Shadow. He suggests that Naipaul, by turning his back on Theroux and their decades-long friendship, has become a pompous self-important figure, much like Ganesh at the conclusion of The Mystic Masseur. A movie has been made of this novel and is as yet unreleased."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"The first thing that is truly amazing about this short funny book is that it is Naipaul's first; no wonder he went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. The second that he is barely 25 years old; it is amazing that someone so young can write such a witty book that has so much to say about religion, politics, colonialism, education, and the island as a society. The third that he is a native-born Trinidadian; yet he writes the kind of concise descriptive English, the type that brings people and places directly to life for the reader, that so many other authors can only dream of.I found both his use of dialog and native dialect absolutely amazing, making me feel as if I was listening to real people speaking as they might, though in a somewhat comic fashion, in the 1940s in Trinidad. Be warned that there are a few \\"n-bombs\\", but this was a multi-pluralist society (in race, color, and creed).It is also refreshing that the British colonialists and the WWII Americans are mainly just a mere presence throughout the book. We know Trinidad is a colony, but we experience it entirely through the eyes, ears of native Trinidadians, who, most thankfully, are neither perfect nor perfectly awful. They are just human beings trying to live out their lives in a rather difficult if difficultly ordinary situation. And it is most interesting that without hardly disparaging either the natives or the colonizers, the protagonist ends up becoming a thoroughly westernized and pro-western politician, one who embraces the colonial situation.While reading it the one other book that came to mind, at least in a general sense as to the rise to greatness of a rather non-great man, is Jerzy Kosinski's great work, Being There (1971), which was made into the marvellous movie with Peter Sellers. Naipaul's character's rise seems more believable and a bit funnier.This is the first book by Naipaul I've read. It won't be the last. I can't wait to read his other early books describing Trinidadian society! Where RK Narayan, who started writing in the 1930s, brings his beloved rural India to life, Naipaul brings forth his beloved Trinidad. Both write some of the finest modern English anywhere in the world. Interestingly, one of Naipaul's antagonists to the hero Ganesh is named \\"Narayan\\"!"},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"The Mystic Masseur was Naipaul's first novel. And indeed it looks so. One could not think of so great a writer to begin so humbly. This is not a novel with a grant theme, or an aim or mission. Yet it is not like the modern novels which take their main aim to be aimless.What strikes us is the genuineness of Naipaul in accepting his humble subject. He takes his Trinidad, his birthplace as his subject. The intellectual honesty, which later became the hallmark of Sir Vidia, was not an attribute which was acquired or which evolved over the course of time. It was there from the very beginning of his career, from his very first novel, The Mystic Masseur, from his very first book of non-fiction, The Middle Passage.In his last book of non-fiction, \`A Writer's People', he discusses about his initial quest for a subject. When he reached England, in 1950s, he had to choose his subject. Having chosen writing as a vocation, the choice of his subject was yet to make, not only the subject, but also the style of writing. After looking for inspiration to many writers, one day he came to a conclusion which would make him, the V S Naipaul, we know:\\"I bought a copy of The Painted Veil from a W H Smith news-stand, read some pages standing up, and soon came to the conclusion that Maugham was not a writer I could go to for instruction. Not because Maugham was bad. My material was too far away from his; it was my own; I had to adhere to it and do the best I could with it, in my own way.\\"We can see our future writer coming into his own. He chose to imitate nobody. He chose to go for what seemed to him his own, original, not yet written, however simple that maybe.This is what we see in \`The Mystic Masseur'. It is not concerned with global politics, not specifically with politics, religion or society. It speaks in small but honest way about the small society of Trinidad. In effect it speaks about smallness, the smallness which pervades the Trinidadian society so completely.The hero Ganesh gets an idea into his mind of writing a book about, India, Hinduism and his heritage. He takes upon himself the enormous task to write a book explaining everything about Hinduism, \`101 Questions and Answers on the Hindu Religion'. The book itself is quoted, which heightens the comedy of the whole episode.You get a sense of boredom while reading the novel, a boredom of a people who have nothing much to do, nothing much to think about. They have no history, a past only vaguely memorable, a religion remembered only in rituals. They have no native writers. Ganesh earns his fame by becoming a masseur. He then discovers that a little taste of mysticism adds to its charm, and so he becomes a mystic masseur. But the wish of his life is fulfilled only when he writes the book and becomes famous.But then he engages himself in politics, and later on leaves his job of massage.This is a world which Naipaul chooses as his subject. True it is small, but it is real and honest. It reflects the people of Naipaul's world at that time.\\"I myself believe that the history of Ganesh is, in a way, the history of our times; and there may be people who will welcome this imperfect account of the man Ganesh Ramsumair, masseur, mystic, and, since 1953, M.B.E.\\"We read in \`The Mystic Masseur', of a world, which is half and small, forgotten and poor in ideas. A land where there is no intellectual life, where people just try to live up to some social success, trying everything which comes into their way.The reader doesn't need to know the geography in order to sense the smallness of Trinidad. It is too pervading in the novel.From his very first novel, Naipaul conveys his tragic-comic style. This is not to refer to the classical Shakespearean one. There is no Shylock in \`The Mystic Masseur'. The tragic sense of Naipaul is not concerned with characters, but with history, with geography and with life itself. Naipaul's is a sneer of man who sees life as on outsider, who sees the world as it is, accepting all its faults and drawbacks. But the final sense is not one of despair, but of true detachedness, objectivity. This paragraph illustrates it well:\\"It was their first beating, a formal affair done without anger on Ganesh's part or resentment on Leela's: and although it formed no part of the marriage ceremony itself, it meant much to both of them. It meant that they had grown up and become independent Ganesh had become a man; Leela a wife as privileged as any other big woman. How she too would have tales to tell of her husband's beatings; and when she went home she would be able to look sad and sullen as every woman should.\\"Even in this early novel, he takes a dig at Gandhi. Discussing a difficult situation, Ganesh says:\\"What would Mahatma Gandhi do in a situation like this?\\"Then answering himself:\\"Write. That's what he would do. Write.\\"The language itself conveys a very comic sense, at least to a person who is either native English speaker or comes for the subcontinent. Naipaul remains honest even to the grammar of Trinidadians, which is appalling. I was afraid of imbibing some wrong English from these novels of Naipaul."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"V.S. Naipaul's first book, The Mystic Masseur, transports the reader back in time to the pre WWII era in the quaint town of Fuente Grove in Trinidad. The book talks about Ganesh, who starts off as a directionless young boy still trying to figure out what to do with his life. Being one of the few people in the area with some literary exposure, he is revered by the locals as a pundit. He tries his hand at several things from teaching to massaging to a local medicine man to a famous politician.The book is very vividly written and the narrative is smooth and fluent. The dialogue uses a native dialect to bring about a feel of the Carribean Islands. Overall a nice read that shows that with common sense, good intentions, luck and a little mischief anyone can change the world around them."},{"Title":"The Mystic Masseur","review":"The Mystic Masseur is a novel about a man who uses his educated mind in a most unusual and inspiring way. Ganesh Ramsumier, the main character, becomes a revered problem solver in his community. But because Ganesh's community is governed by the chaotic forces of a neglectful colonial government and chronic poverty, they see Ganesh as a mystic and a bit of a savior. In reality he is just an ordinary man though. His secret is simply that he is honest, he studies, he tries hard, he uses common sense and logic, and he is devoted to improving things. These qualities, along with a good education, are everyday things in modern societies, but in the Trinidad that V.S. Naipaul so beautifully evokes, they are very rare and they hold incredible transformative powers.I think the book does a nice job of showing that one individual can indeed change the world. The idea of changing the world is staggering. The dimensions of the problem and the complexity involved make it appear nearly impossible. But if you ever doubt that the only way a society changes is as the adage goes, \\"one person at a time, one community at a time,\\" then read this book and be reminded. Granted, even the best intentioned and best suited person for the task can sometimes need a little luck, as does Ganesh in this story. But he gets the luck, he gets the education, and he does something with it. Genius! But I ask: How many people in today's world are getting their chance? The answer clearly is: Not enough. We've got hundreds of millions MORE people living in poverty and amid corrupt governments than there were when V.S. Naipaul began his writing career with this, his first novel.In some ways the author himself must be very much like his main character Ganesh. After all, the writing of V.S. Naipaul has opened millions of western eyes to the developing world. And the author works in something of a mystic method himself, conjuring characters and scenery, smells, sounds, and tastes out of thin air, and rendering them on the page in an imagined world that readers can fall into and absorb. As the world woke up to the injustice of colonization, Naipaul delivered for us his creation Ganesh, The Mystic Masseur-a man who can make right and make sense in a badly damaged world, and who combines modern day logic and ancient tradition in service of something larger than himself."},{"Title":"When Elephant Goes to a Party","review":"Jeff Seaver illustrates When Elephant Goes To A Party, an intriguing picturebook story which invites young readers to take an interactive role in deciding what kind of gift Elephant should bring to a birthday party, and how to be a good guest.

A fun book."},{"Title":"Victory in the Opening!: The Art of Winning Quickly in Chess","review":"I'm always surprised how badly organized and presented most chess books are, and this book is no exception.There are 3 main opening objectives, speedy development,central control and king safety. Therefore there should only be 3 main chapters. However, Gary Lane's book has 9, which obviously means that most of these should be sub-sections of 3 main chapters relating to the 3 opening objectives, not chapters in their own right. For instance, Chapter 1, called Greedy Openings. is mainly about pawn grabbing at the expense of development, so it should be a sub-section of a chapter relating to development, not a chapter in its own right.However, most of the games are very instructive, although the sparse commentary frequently misses the most important aspectsof these games."},{"Title":"Sentence Composing for Middle School: A Worktext on Sentence Variety and Maturity","review":"I first learned about this author at a CATE Conference in 2001.

It goes well with the philosophy in education that children need to be taught how to use their language and how to write, not just given a topic and required to write something down. I'm so pleased with the book I'd like to pick up the college level book just for me since it looks like so much fun, playing with and manipulating language.One note- After looking at the Look Inside feature for some reason I thought it was consumable, possibly because of the use of the word \\"worktext\\" so I purchased two books. This is a non-consumable. That may have been more obvious to me if I had looked at one of the pages that says \\"copy the sentences\\" but I didn't notice until I had the book in hand.

The publisher reviews for this one say \\"unadorned by the clicheed moral epigrams\\" and \\"The retellings are brief and do away with the stated morals.\\" The morals ascribed by Aesop are what make his stories. If you take the moral away, you might as well read something else. So if you'd like to see the morals that accompany each story (which is the main reason to read it), and make up your own mind whether or not you want to reinforce them (instead of some editor and publisher deciding for you ahead of time - isn't this called censoring), then buy a different version of Aesop's Fables, like the translation by Sir Roger L'Estrange, or the one published by SeaStar Books."},{"Title":"The Fables of Aesop","review":"This edition of Aesop's fables is a beautiful book, but the only thing that is the same as the description and \\"look inside\\" is the cover!

Nobody Gets the Girl is the best superhero novel ever. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it is a huge hit and will spawn imitators half this good.It a tough novel to talk about without giving away the plot. There are surprises in every chapter. It's also a tough book to put down. I read the whole book in a weekend and was never bored for a second.The biggest surprise for me was how funny the book was. The dialogue is sharp and clever. It's the sort of book I keep quoting passages from to my friends.The only thing that I worried about in the plot is that early on the bad guys are this group of international terrorists. I kind of rolled my eyes at this use of the current pop culture boogey man. But, later in the book the master terrorist get center stage for a couple of chapters and it's one of the biggest surprises of the book that his character is so three dimensional and thought out. These aren't typical cardboard bad guys. The whole book winds up being a kind of critique of the current war on terrorism. The good guys go to such extremes to stop their enemies that it gets difficult to tell whether or not they might be a bigger [danger] than the bad guys.This book is thought-provoking, action packed, and funny. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"James Maxey paints a colorful, imaginative portrait of an unwilling superhero amid other heroes who have serious issues.The plot was engaging, the characters interesting if not always likeable, and the moral themes were complex. Don't let the broad heroic strokes fool you - this story has a lot of layers.There were, however, a few glitches: there's a romantic situation which seems to spring from nowhere, and as a result I really couldn't buy it. Since the romantic situation is closely tied to the overall plot, this created a bit of a problem for me. I also felt the protagonist needed a bit more fleshing out - I felt that some of his actions were out-of-how-I-perceived-his-character; in retrospect I have the feeling that Maxey simply did some mental shorthand that not all readers will grasp.But don't let those put you off buying the novel - it's a lot of fun, and it'll make you think. I'm looking forward to more of Maxey's work."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"This is an incredible first novel.

The plot always remained one step ahead of me, with just a *bit* more twist than I expected. I read lots of SF, and seldom find as many genuine surprises as I found in here.There's also plenty of hard-hitting superhero action inside, including one scene that tops anything Superman (or any nemesis of his) would ever dare attempt... you'll know it when you see it, and it *will* force you to think.I made the mistake of picking this book up at bedtime, and ended up missing *lots* of sleep.

One morning, he wakes up in a world where no one can see or hear him, and after being discovered by super-scientist Dr. Know, he finds himself fighting evil alongside nubile super-heroine-sisters Rail Blade and The Thrill. But in his new life as Nobody, Richard finds that good and evil may not be so easy to identify. Will he make the right world-saving choices ... and get the (right) girl?James Maxey's debut novel is, overall, a fun, fast read for fans of superhero comics and fiction. That said, the plot jumps around from idea to idea like a drug-crazed ferret, and so much happens so quickly that it's difficult to relate to or empathize with any of the characters. Maxey's writing is workmanlike at best, and I often found myself craving more fine or rich details. Having also just read Soon I Will Be Invincible by Austin Grossman, I'd recommend the latter over this book, as I found it a more comprehensive and better-written homage to the superhero genre.Recommended as a library loan for fans of light superhero fiction. Two-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I found this comic book novel to be a wonderful play on the imagination. Humorous, fast-paced, and full of wacky gadgetry galore, I laughed, cried, and wondered my way through this intensely engaging story. Maxey skillfully leads you through an \\"almost\\" normal world, populated with some exceptional people. The twists and turns in this plot caught me by surprise every time, until I gave up on trying to guess where it would take me and just rode the roller coaster ride through to the spectacularly odd end."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Kevin Anderson once said that the one of the perks of writing the X-files books was that he got to have an unlimited budget.Well, James Maxey's gone and one-upped him.In his debut novel Nobody Gets the Girl, Maxey has not only created a world with characters that special effects budgets could only dream of, he's also given birth to a whole new genre. Phobos calls it a \\"comic book novel.\\" Or rather, a graphic novel without the graphics. At the beginning, I found myself wishing that I had the artistic talents of Jim Lee or Alex Ross following me along with the text. I have a friend that works at DC, and I started devising ways to slip this book into his bag the next time he came to visit. This should be one of the best comics out there.And then I realized it couldn't be done.Because the main character doesn't exist.Richard Rogers is an average Joe in an average life. Until he wakes up one day and discovers that he's invisible. Scientist Dr. Knowbokov finds Richard and breaks it down for him. He no longer exists. Life as he knew it is gone. So what does he do with his supernatural powers? I mean other than wallow in self-pity. Why, he becomes a superhero, of course. Wouldn't you?Richard becomes Nobody (thus the title) and joins the cause to save the world from evil. He teams up with Dr. Know's daughters, who have superpowers themselves. Rail Blade has the power of \\"ferrokinesis\\" (a fabulous word), which gives her complete control over the iron in everything from the earth's atmosphere to the human bloodstream. Her younger sister, the Thrill, can manipulate both gravity and human will. Oh, yes, and there are bad guys too; they would give the X-Men themselves a run for their money.It's a whole new world on one level. It's smash-'em-up fun on another. And still there exists that underlying morality that all comics play upon. It is the notion that there can be no true good without pure evil, no peace without war. There is a justifiable reason for things to go wrong in this world, and not even Clark Kent can stop them all. Perhaps that's why we identify with comics so easily. We do all we can to make our own lives turn out all right, but some things in this life -- good or evil -- are simply beyond our control.If you like comics, buy this book. If you know who Alan Moore is (without me having to tell you), read Nobody Gets the Girl. Throw it in your shopping cart and meet your $... limit. In fact, buy two copies. Or three. I've already given all mine away and ordered more. It's a 244-page summer blockbuster, and you'll enjoy every minute."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Superhero fiction is a strange genre. It thrives in comic books and movies, but it doesn't always work in book form. In \\"Nobody Gets the Girl,\\" James Maxey did a fine job of creating a world where superpowers make sense, villains have personalities and motivations, and the reader gets to think about the ethics of saving the world.One of the most taunting things about this book is that it's impossible to write a synopsis without giving away the twists and surprises that make it so interesting. In a nutshell, it's about time travel paradoxes, the moral ambiguity of superheroes (as well as complexity of supervillains), and a very dysfunctional super-powered family.One important caveat that other reviewers haven't pointed out: this book is not suitable for children. If you're a fan of superheroes, comics and all that good stuff, buy the book for yourself, but you might not want to give it to the Junior for his 8th birthday. There are a few chapters that describe characters having sex with saucy detail. Here is just one example: \\"Her panties were drenched, more with sweat than excitement.\\"This is Maxey's first novel, and he wrote in just six weeks. It's not clear whether the book is a bit sloppy due to his lack of experience or his self-imposed deadline. (\\"His goal was to complete the book by New Year's Eve, so that he could claim to have written the last novel of the Millennium,\\" it says at the end.) The book's pacing is awkward: some conversations take up several chapters, while some chapters provide brief descriptions of what the protagonist was up to for several months. It would definitely work if this were a movie, but the constant change of pace is not easy to get used to in a book. The protagonist is a stand-up comedian, and pretty much everything he says is an attempt at a joke. If you don't \\"get\\" the author's dry and slightly goofy sense of humor, you might have a hard time reading the dialogs. Finally, there are several secondary characters who are introduced in the beginning, make several appearances throughout the book, and then disappear without a trace or an explanation of any kind. They are not vital to the plot, but I felt a bit cheated when I turned the last page and didn't find all the answers I was looking for.Because of these minor flaws, I give this book only four stars instead of five. Then again, maybe I'm just being too picky. The bottom line is this: if you like comic books, or superheroes, or time travel stories, pick up this book and you'll get your money's worth - just make sure to keep it away from your kids."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"This was a good read and a not too bad superhero novel for when it first came out.It deals with the life a of a newly superpowered person and how they they begin to deal with their new situation."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I am a comic book fan and I love the characters in this book. They are original and interesting. The overall ideas and depth of the book is great as well. The problem is in the story. It jumps around a lot, it doesn't flow, and needed more development.

But it does make an entertaining read. Take one part *Mystery Men*, two parts Alan Moore's *Watchmen*, mix thoroughly and enjoy.This book is both a parody and an exploration of the comic book superhero universe. The protagonist is a man whose superpower is that he no longer exists . . . sort of. He's employed---sort of---by the man who created the universe . . . sort of. Nothing is quite as simple as it should be in this novel. While Maxey doesn't acheive quite the same character depth as Orson Scott Card, he shares his tendency to explore the mind even of his darkest characters."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"\\"Nobody Gets the Girl\\" is a takeoff on super-heroes, somewhat reminiscent of Grant Morrison's \\"Superfolks.\\" Maxey, however, veers in a different direction. Where Morrison asks the question, \\"What happens to a super-hero when he can't keep going anymore?\\", Maxey asks why such people should exist at all--and comes up with a creative answer.Others have tackled the same issue, both in novels and in the comics (see Valiant Comics' revival of Dr. Solar, Man of the Atom, as an example), but Maxey's approach is lighter, somewhat tongue-in-cheek. It might not be to the taste of those who prefer their super-heroics written straight, but it works."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"As you find out at the end, two brothers (with bad pun names - Dr. Know and Rex Monday), are born with strange abilities. World encompassing telepathy, and the reverse, and super genius level intelligence. So, one sets out to make things better, one eventually to stop him. Their incredibly powerful children, are, of course, horribly screwed up. A time travel mistake produce the title character, a man who has never been born, and is hence invisible and immaterial most of the time, except to this extraordinary family, or the occasional other sensitive. This, of course, can be used a superpower. It also makes him immune to the mental abilities of the two brothers. One of the super powered sibilings fancies him because of this, because he is one of the very few men her father cannot mind control, while, basically, he is shagging her.Things spiral out of control, escalating into violence, and assassination.In a twist, the end of the story encompasses areoforming, after the two megalomaniacs are out of the picture, Thanks to Nobody and their wife."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"As a fan of just about any super-hero book, my review is from a rosy-glasses perspective. I enjoyed it. It was an easy read, the plot was pretty good, but at times it seemed to go off topic. There were parts of the book that had no reason to be there or any tie in to the overall plot at all. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the romantic part came out of thin air and didn't seem to fit. I just started reading 'Other People's Heroes' and think that's a better book."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"If you love to read, buy this book. If you love science fiction, buy this book. If you love comics, buy this book.Nobody Gets the Girl is a daring, innovative, exhilerating ride. This is the kind of book you've been hungry for, the kind you can't put down even though it's 2 in the morning and tomorrow you have the most important business meeting of your life. Nobody Gets the Girl grabs you by the lapels and whisks you away on a fabulous, unforgettable journey.There's been a great deal of talk lately about the way James Maxey has skillfully blended the genres of science fiction and comic books. Believe the hype, fellow readers. James Maxey has captured the joy, the momentum, the grandeur of the most exciting comic book between the covers of Nobody Gets the Girl.I used to think that the comic book was a singular medium, that there were certain things a comic can do that you won't find anywhere else--city-wide battles, colorful splash pages, heroes in flight high above the Earth, ...costumes, etc. Yet James Maxey has proven me wrong.It's all here, folks. It's all here, and more. Nobody Gets the Girl isn't just a prose comic book, it's also an inventive science fiction novel, a romance, a character study, and the most original use of quantum physics I've ever come across.Nobody Gets the Girl also has the best characters I've seen in ages. How can you go wrong with names like Panic, Pit Geek, Sundancer, The Thrill, Rail Blade, and Nobody?Every author enters into a pact with the reader. The author is saying, \\"If you read this, you will be entertained, informed, delighted.\\" Too many writers fail to uphold their end of this deal. Well, James Maxey delivers.So buckle up and take a few deep breaths. This is one wild, wonderful ride."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"After meeting James Maxie and loving this book, he gave me the go-ahead to write a mini-soundtrack to his novel.Nobody Gets The Girl: songs for the novel by James MaxeyThis is the only time I've done something like this and it is because I was totally enthralled with the book. The first few chapters make, I think, one of the strongest opening for a novel that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Maxey excels in fusing an action-packed plot with a surprising range of bizarre super-science ideas. I love books like this that use the rules of the alternate reality to surprise the reader, but still create a credible and engaging story that has just the right amount of world background. This book is a fine combination of creative world-making, superheroics balanced between seriousness and humor, and a love story to carry you through to the end. This book gets the feel of superhero comics right."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I had reservations about the book at first since I am not a comic book hero fan, but I sure had fun reading this story. The premise was very intriguing and I thought Maxey handled it well. How do you explain an invisible man? The humor was so tongue-in-cheek that I bit mine quite a few times. The villians were so absurd they were laughable. If you are looking for action and laughs give this one a try."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I liked the book.These are some similar books which you might enjoy:-Confessions of a D-List Supervillan (Jim Bernheimer)A story of an underdog anti-hero.-Ex-Heroes (Peter Clines)Superhumans vs Zombies.

All the superhero-ness and action that I love of comics, but without the art and with added depth of character, description, and exposition. A quick, fun read, I would have loved it even more if I had read it in grade school - the style is effortless to read, and it holds interest well. The reasoning behind the characters' origins and the way things progress seem to have been well thought out. I will probably pick up another of Maxey's books for a vacation read."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I had reservations about buying this book based solely on the title and the cover art. It had received good reviews all around, so I gave it a chance.The novel turned out to be fine; a fun read all in all. I felt that the characters were strong and interesting, even if some of their powers weren't. Nobody's plight of being invisible drew me into the world, with the beginning portion of him haunting houses being particularly amusing.I only had one issue with the story, that being how the world was formed. Sounds weird, I know, but if you read it you'll understand - I'm trying to remain spoiler-free.If you like superheroes, then this novel is a safe bet. If you're a fan of fiction in general, and you don't have a problem with superheroes, then you'll most likely have fun."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Time travel is hard, but Nobody pulls it off. I liked it. I did see the twist at the end comming, but only because Maxey tried so hard to cover it up. A great book."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"An interesting take on the world of superheroes. Limited in scale with an eye to making both hero and villain as flawed and real as possible. While I think it's very well done and accomplished the writers goal it lacks something. All the characters seem comfortable with the idea that the end justifies the means. It makes bonding with the hard as I didn't really like them. In the end it missed the morale center that most comic books have. Again well written but not for me. I do highly recommend Devil's Cape if your looking for a good superhero novel."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Man gets sucked into alternate world -- superheroes exist in both -- and involved with mad scientist and super villain.

There is not much emotion from the main character despite what he gets put through, this left me feeling disconnected. Also about the main character? He doesnt do anything, he is mainly a passenger in this story, watching while things progress for the most part. The book was ok but there is better out there especially for the $5."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Got on a superhero book kick again (something I do every few years), searching through amazon and reading anything vaguely superhero related/themed.This was one of the highlights of this run. Nice world, with just enough explanation of how things work to make it not trigger my disbelief. The general theme of super hero's as overworked super celebs and villains as terrorists feels very real, even if it isn't that original.The characters are sympathetic and honest. Though at times a bit over blown and a bit too \\"broken\\".Overall, a great read that left me wanting more from that world. Looking forward to reading the next in that world (though not in the series, as this is a standalone story)."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I got this one at Half-Priced Books and it far exceeded my expectations. The main character was a hero only by accident, recruited by a character we'll refer to as the primer-mover of the novel. He's the one leading a group of heroes against a group of villains, hoping Nobody will tip the scales.There are a few splatter-punk places, but they're all funny. The ending was shades of Watchmen."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"One of my favorite superhero stories not connected to the Marvel or DC universe. The author has done an excellent job of coming up with a unique hero whose \\"power\\" is that he technicially doesn't exist. The beginning of the novel does a great job of characterizing the protagonist as a every day guy who is experiencing some doubts about his life and career choices. Then due to an unfortunate accident involving time travel he loses what little impact he's made on the world and is forced into a miserable semi-existence. I don't want to spoil too much, but the story gets more interesting and involved as he's dragged into the machinations of the mad-scientist responsible for creating his condition. The ending get a little meta-physical at points, but its a good read with a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"For months I avoided this book. Because if nobody gets the girl, why should I be interested? Happily my fears were unjustified. But no other spoiler here. It is indeed a comic book novel, and I was surprised to find that, for me, it was a much fun as many graphic novels I've read. And a better deal if you measure dollars per fun reading time.I will say that the Kindle version seems to be missing the full size cover art, which would have been fun to have."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"If you are looking for an easy read that is lots of fun and keeps you turning the page, this will do nicely. I'll have to admit the title got me hooked right away - I wanted to know who nobody was and how he got that way. The superhero powers in the book are all as outrageous and entertaining as the premise. The dialogue is crisp and often witty, the action is engaging and the faults and foibles of the charaxters true to life. I generally like Sci-fi, comic book or not, to have a high plausibility factor, something that projects present possibilities forward to a surprising yet possible future and this is where I feel the book loses some effectiveness. Still, it's a fun book to read and worth the time.James Cox, Author of U.R.B."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"I've read a zillon comics and a few \\"comic style\\" novels but it took me almost a year to finally take the plunge and take this off my my wishlist.I was glad I did. Nobody Gets the Girl was one of those books that I couldn't put down. It wasn't that it was the best book I've ever read. It was just really fun, light, and got me back to thinking about being a superhero. Like I did when I was a kid.The book is worth buying for $10, and a steal for $5 on kindle. It is easily a better time/price investment then a movie ticket to whatever horrible superhero flick DC or Marvel is currently vomiting out.The book did have some flaws (IMO) though, probably due to the inexperience of the author and editing of the small publishing house. I kinda wish I could rate it a 3.5 instead of a 3. It isn't really a 3. But it isn't a 4 star either.I found that I really didn't like the main character that much. The author does a good job of setting him up for likability (he has pretty funny dialogue and declines an opportunity to cheat on his wife) but I just found something off about his actions during the book. It also didn't help that he was the least interesting character in the novel.The romance in the book did seem rather odd. It was as if the protagonist was going through the motions of the various romantic situations instead of actually feeling them. I got the impression that the author had never been in a serious relationship/married and didn't really understand how to convey those type of feelings.I also wasn't surprised by any of the plot twists in the book. Maybe it was because of the forward to the book (DO NOT READ THE FORWARD), or maybe it was because I am a geek- but I think there were several points in the story where the author intended to startle me with a Celtic knot style twist- but they fell flat against my nerd powers of deduction.Conclusion: I liked this book. I was glad I bought it. I'm going to buy another of the author's novels. You should buy this too. Just set the right expectation- she isn't a supermodel but she is a fun date."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"It is a pretty good story and a quick read. Overall I liked it and thought it was worth the money. The only things I didn't like about the book was that there was not enough character development.

Usually with characters that feel so flat I don't finish the book, however the storyline was strong enough to keep me reading."},{"Title":"Nobody Gets the Girl","review":"Can't imagine why major publishers didn't jump all over this, but here's your chance.

Therefore reading a book on the topic can be difficult at times, if one focuses on the brutality of the methods used and the zeal in which they were. This book, by comparison with most others on the Spanish Inquisition, is very short, but it does introduce the reader to the reasons for it and its historical legacy.The author summarizes the Spanish Inquisition as being \\"350 years of terror,\\" which is an accurate description considering the horrific acts that were committed in this time period. These acts are delineated in detail in this book, beginning essentially with the papal bull in 1478 that was targeted towards Jewish converts to Christianity. Those Jews found guilty of \\"reversion\\" were promptly executed. The three dominant religions, Islam, Christianity, and Islam were of course in existence at this time, and were, according to the author, not tolerant of each other and each was convinced that it held the keys to truth. If there was tolerance to any degree, it was a \\"de facto\\" tolerance argues the author, i.e. \\"suffered rather than desired.\\" It is interesting to note that de facto tolerance is also the predominant form for these religions in the world today.The social tensions between Jews and Christians in Spain at this time are brought out in detail in the book. On the surface these tensions even seem comical because of their absurdity. As examples of this idiocy, marriages between Jews and Christians were forbidden; Jews could charge interest on a loan to Christians, and vice versa, but never to members of the same faith; and Jews were blamed for economic recessions, and for spreading the plague. Reading of the persecutions against Jews at this time reinforces the opinion that the more economically industrious a person was the greater his danger.In fact, envy is viewed by the author as a possible cause of the Inquisition, rather than merely from religious zealotry. Fray Luis de Leon of the University of Salamanca, who was denounced to the Inquisition by some of his own (jealous) colleagues, is given as an example of this. Other university professors were subjected to the same treatment, by those who, according to the author, wanted the \\"university chairs\\" of these professors. The author quotes Unamuno as stating that it was the \\"terrible Hispanic envy born of incompetence and pettiness\\" that was responsible for the Inquisition. Considering the typical attitudes of many in the academic community today, an environment that is typically polluted with envy, this assertion by Unamuno does not at all seem farfetched.The author does not want to end the book without a discussion of the consequences of the Inquisition on Spanish society. One might think that such a horrific series of events lasting for as long as it did would have devastating effects on any society. The author argues that the Inquisition was responsible for some of Spain's misfortunes, but not all of them. Its economic impact was minimal he says, with the decline of Spain economically being due essentially to the ability of wages to keep up with prices, thus lowering incentives among investors. The author is aware that this argument deserves more scrutiny however.Science and literature suffered greatly from the Inquisition however, due in large measure to the infamous book burnings and Indexes. All of these are discussed in detail in the book, terrifying as they were. This horrible destruction of knowledge is something that along with the brutality against \\"heretics\\" will be etched in the minds of all those with independent minds and who have deep respect for human life. Those individuals who launched and practiced the Inquisition should never be forgiven for their savagery against Jewish people and others who differed from the entrenched dogma of the Catholic church. The Inquisition served no constructive purpose, had no moral validity, and deserves daily condemnation. Only then can we be more confident that such a series of events does not happen again."},{"Title":"The Spanish Inquisition: A History","review":"I found the book to be very informative and inviting to read.

It is a lively and compelling history that absorbs the attention of the reader.Perez did a great job of myth-busting, especially in regards to the religious tensions of medieval Spain. For example, he correctly points out that the scholarly flowering between Muslims, Jews, and Christians was based on a temporary detente based on expediency rather than a twenty-first century pluralist mindset. He is extremely fair to all the religious persuasions of the era. His analysis is reasoned, measured, and precise.Anti-semitism was at the heart of the Spanish Inquisition. Perez did a great job of narrowing the topic to cover the experiences of the forced conversions of Jews to Catholicism. His assertions are factual and based on the best primary sources available.

No wonder then that for almost 2000 years most people did not regard her as important enough to write entire books about. That all changed in the 1980s after the publication of Holy Blood: Holy Grail by three British authors who proposed that she was really the bride of Christ and that they had children whose descendants are alive today. In the 1990s Mary again slipped into obscurity until the publication of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code made her the historical buzz word of the early third millennium. In the last couple of years dozens of books have been written about the enigmatic female disciple who may have been the sinful woman that Jesus saved from a stoning. However, in my opinion, none of these books actually produce solid, physical evidence to support their various claims about her - except one - this book by Graham Phillips. In the Chalice of Magdalene the author claims to have found a cup that was made in first-century Palestine and was used by Mary to collect a few drops of Christ's blood. This, Phillips argues, was the original Holy Grail, the sacred cup of the early Christian faith. This book requires a few leaps faith by the reader itself, but it is an entertaining and thought-provoking experience. Even if you don't accept the authors claim to posses the original Grail then the book is still worth a read. It's a mine of information about the development of the Grail legend throughout history."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"I recently saw a documentary about this book on the Discovery Channel and doubted that anyone could really have found the Holy Grail in this day and age. When I read the book I was expecting it to be some kind of New Age mystery adventure. I could not have been more wrong. Phillips' claim tohave found the Chalice of Magdalene (a contender for the original Holy Grail) is a serious historical investigation. What's more: this book also includes the latest archeological discoveries that may have uncovered a real Camelot and a geophysics survey of what may be the grave of King Arthur.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Arthurian enigma."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"I found this book fascinating, whether the chalice Mr. Phillip's found really is the grail or not, the way he deciphered the clues left to the where abouts of this item was incredible to read. How he took you on an investigative quest that unfolded itself made you feel you were right there beside him. I thought the way it was written along side the history of the Arthurian times was easy to comprehend, and it was illuminating to discover King Arthur may actually have been a real man and not just a myth.Thank you Mr. Phillips, keep writing these books, truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"I was initially very impressed with one of Mr. Phillips' numerous \`sensational' books, and was particularly interested in one of his alleged sources, which I have continued to pursue for a number of years. Unfortunately, Mr. Phillips has based two of his books (The Search for the Grail and The Chalice of Magdalene) on the existence of an alleged Grail prose, La Folie Perceval, that he claims may in turn be based on the earliest Grail source. He claims that this prose is found within a manuscript preserved in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, which is catalogued as MS fonds franais 12577. This manuscript does indeed exist, and it does contain an illustration that is reproduced in Mr. Phillips' book (which he claims accompanies the prose), but the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale itself has verified in writing that this manuscript does not contain the alleged prose, La Folie Perceval. A Professor of English in the U.S., with a Ph. D. in medieval and renaissance literature, and who teaches Arthurian romance, has informed me that he is completely unaware of the existence of such a text, which would be extremely important and certainly known to Grail romance scholars if it did exist. A very well-known and respected Arthurian scholar, translator and author, in the United Kingdom, has also informed me that he is almost certain that the manuscript does not contain the La Foli Perceval prose, that he has never come across this prose, that he has not seen any reference to it in any serious scholarly work, and that he is almost certain that La Folie Perceval prose may be a fabrication. I have contacted Mr. Phillips by email and asked him for further details concerning the actual location of this prose and/or other references that discuss this document, on four separate occasions over a period of almost four years (the last time was over a month ago, addressed to an email address on his own website), but unfortunatly, he has continually refused to respond and help establish some credence concerning his increasingly dubious source. The reader is warned that, based on the results of the research I have conducted concerning this source, it is my opinion that there \`may' be some significant concern about the credibility of this author, and the reader is therefore encouraged to check the sources very carefully on his/her own before seriously considering any of his \`sensational' claims."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read about the Grail legend. It answers many questions that most books on the subject fail to address. Chiefly amongst these is how the Grail tradition ties up with the legend of King Arthur. In the first half of the book, the author takes the reader on a fascinating step by step investigation into the origins of the Arthurian story, identifying an historical figure behind the myth. In the second half of the book, he examines the development of the Grail legend and how the relic may have been an historical artifact which he rediscovered hidden in central England. Unlike many authors on the subject of the Holy Grail, Graham Phillips examines the original sources for the legend, and presents his conclusions in a logical and readable fashion. This is an excellent historical investigation into a complex and controversial subject."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"I have read nearly all of Graham Phillips' books and have always been enthralled by his exciting and new approach to historical mysteries. In this book he searches for an ancient chalice that may have been the original Holy Grail. Whether or not it was is open to debate. Nevertheless, it is a truly fascinating historical adventure story, full of secret codes hidden in old books, statues and a stained-glass window. If Mr. Phillips is right then the search for the Grail is finally over."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"I was interested in this book because it was about the Alabastar jar that Mary Magadalene used to collect the blood of Jesus. It had nothing to do with the cup that was used at the Last Supper.I find the review by \\"Shar\\" to be interesting. As a Catholic all of my life and a grand-daughter of Spanish immigrants, this cup she speaks of was never mentioned in my home or church. It was never mentioned in the 12 years of Catholic school I attended either. I find it interesting that this cup in Spain shows up now in the news just as the DaVinci Code comes out when it was never heard of before."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"If you think this book is gonna read like a Dan Brown book you're gonna be disappointed.If you think you're gonna read a book with science to back up anything in the book, again, disappointment.If you think you may find something that's in the very least as plausible as the Shroud of Turin being the real deal then you're gonna find this on the mark.As I remember, been a year since I read it, my biggest disappointment is all the history that's in the book that goes on and on and doesn't seem to have anything to do with the subject. Ultimately, it does all come together but there's so much in the first 2/3rds of the book that frankly I think it may have been filler.The real subject itself would fill a pamphlet, or two. But this part is quite good and worth the read. It does appear this guy may be more on the mark than off it. I do think that at one point someone hid that little jar/cup thinking they did have the real McCoy.At the heart of this book is the story of a small perfume jar from the apparently correct time period and region of the world to have been used the hold a small sample of Christ's blood. It's intriguing in the least. The author seems to have done his research, although the early part is hard to follow as stated earlier.This read reminds me of Second Messiah: Templars, the Turin Shroud and the Great Secret of Freemasonry by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. I read this also and couldn't put it down. These two books are very kin to each other although Knight and Lomas are clearly better authors in the way of representation.If you're into this sort of thing then this will be a good read once you finally get to the meat of the book. Too bad it's like the last couple chapters or so. I realize the first stuff is there to present his historical argument but damn it drags like a text book.

From there, the medieval literature and legends surrounding the Holy Grail were explored. The \\"The Chalice of Magdalene\\" covered a lot of territory, but at the same time provided a great deal of historical information. It is a must read for anyone interested in the legends of King Arthur and the Grail Romances."},{"Title":"Chalice of Magdalene","review":"As Janice Bennett documented and verified in her book in 2002 -St. Laurence and the Holy Grail, the cup which Jesus used in the Last Supper currently resides in the Monastery of San Juan de la Pena in the Pyrenees in Spain.Her investigation provided exacting documentation that just before Pope Sixtus II was arrested and executed by Emperor Caesar Valerian on Aug. 6, 299 (Old Roman calendar which corresponds to the year 261 a.d.), he gave the Holy Grail to St Laurence along with the rest of the relics the Church had in its possession. St Laurence, who had been born in Spain, knowing he too would be arrested and executed gave to another disciple and countryman Precelius the relics along with \\"the most distinguished Cup in which Christ our Good Lord and Master, consecrated with his precious blood on the night of the Last Supper\\" (pg 93) with the order to take them to Spain for safe-keeping. Precelius took the Holy Grail to Spain. In 1982 Pope John Paul II said Mass with the Holy Chalice during his visit to Spain. In 1996 the Holy Grail (known in Spain as the Chalice of Valencia for where it is kept) was taken to Rome to be blessed by Pope John Paul II. To this day the Holy Grail is kept at the Cathedral of Valencia in the Chapel of the Holy Grail.It appears Mr Phillips' story is fiction masquerading as nonfiction. It is my belief that the author is simply trying to cash in on the money being generated from The Da Vinci Code hoax."},{"Title":"A Century of African American Art: The Paul R. Jones Collection","review":"Paul R. Jones differs from the typical collector of world-class art in too many ways to enumerate. For one thing, he is not independently wealthy nor did he inherit a fortune - no, this son of a miner grew up in a work camp, and for most of his life, his \\"day job\\" has been public service. But he has brought to his collection - and therefore, to us - a personal passion, curiosity and creativity unsurpassed by the likes of Guggenheim or Getty.The \\"dean of African American collectors,\\" Jones avoided trend buying and operated outside the more traditional acquisition modes. He occasionally purchased work he \\"did not understand by artists he did not know\\" because, in his words, \\"something in it drew me in...and I trusted it to take me somewhere...\\" Buying from (at the time) relative unknowns, his purchase often paid the month's rent or put food on the table.The result of this 40 year commitment to African American artists is a magnificent panorama encompassing 1500 works by the likes of Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, Lois Mailou Jones, Betye Saar and more than 60 others. This astounding collection has been donated to the University of Delaware's University Museum, and this book helps celebrate the first major exhibition of works drawn from it.The book presents gorgeous reproductions of more than 100 works by 66 artists, with biographical information about them and also about Jones. But it's not a mere exhibition catalog; it also presents ten thought-provoking essays which intentionally strive to \\"de-race\\" African American art, placing it within the larger picture of the nation's history and cultural traditions. For example, Ikem Stanley Okoye's essay \\"Reign(ing) in Color: Toward a Wilder History of American Art\\" explores how the systematic use of color serves purposes other than surface appearance.A magnificent book to celebrate a magnificent collection."},{"Title":"A Century of African American Art: The Paul R. Jones Collection","review":"A Century of African American Art: The Paul R. Jones Collection is a great introduction to works by the Mid Century Masters. It was an excellent source for learning about the greatest African American Masters of the Mid 20th Century. The detailed and colorful works were a great depiction of the movements of subjects or images of the African American people, especially from the WPA Era to present. The autobiographies provided insightful information to help expand my knowledge of the black masters. The curator did an excellent job in presenting the great life perspective of the late master colletor Paul R. Jones. I enjoyed, appreciated and learned a lot from the author's writing, which has further increased my appreciation of the value of many of the works of the Master Artists that. This book, in my opinion provides for the proper recoginition African American Artists in the American Art communities; job well done by Dr. Amalia K. Amaki and I look forward to reading her next book on African American Fine Art by the great Master Artists and Sculpture."},{"Title":"The Unsung Season: Gardens and Gardeners in Winter","review":"The book was a joy to read. Focuses on about thirty gardeners who have distinguished themselves with their winter gardens. Covers different styles and techniques as well as the lifestyles of the gardeners.

I found the book inspiring and the bright photos motivating."},{"Title":"The Unsung Season: Gardens and Gardeners in Winter","review":"For the gardener, unwillingly housebound in winter, Eddison has interviewed gardeners who keep on going after the leaves fall. 'The Unsung Season' features gardens designed to look beautiful in winter, greenhouses and hydroponics, gardeners who make things for or from the garden (dried flower arrangements, wooden gates, dyes), gardeners who compete and gardeners who build. Eddison visits each, describing their winter set-ups, their homes and activities. There's plenty of inspiration here and plenty of pleasure for those who prefer armchair winter gardening."},{"Title":"Online Dating For Dummies (For Dummies (Psychology & Self Help))","review":"If you are a newbie to online dating, this book will help a lot!

If you know absolutely nothing about a computer, email, chat rooms and other types of social sites on the world wide web, then this book will be a good investment for you. If you consider yourself technically savy and comfortable with all things related to the internet, you may find yourself skipping entire chapters but the book is still worth the read for all the practical advice it offers from both a male and female perspective.Overall the book was a quick read as are all the books in the \\"for dummies\\" series.

Almost all of them suffered from the same weakness: they were about one person's personal experiences. While they might make interesting stories, they weren't much help to me, since my circumstances were invariably different from the authors.I was pleased and surprised that the authors of Online Dating for Dummies avoided writing \\"their personal expose\\". Instead they provided only tips and techniques for improving one's odds in the tricky waters of online dating , many of which I had not yet discovered even after some months online.I've used lots of dummies books and they are invariably true to their style: light and airy, a fast read and most importantly, they are fundamentally reference books, meaning you can start anywhere in the book without reading the entire text and not feel lost. Online Dating for Dummies is also true to form and though I skipped around to the parts I was most interested in (I'll admit, I went to the sex chapter first!), I ultimately read the whole book anyway.The authors obviously did their homework on the chapter which discusses the idiosyncratic features of various dating sites. I thought I knew all of the tricks, but I guess I didn't. (I wasn't aware of the prevelance of \\"snoop ware\\" on certain sites for example.)One thing did however mystify me: the book costs about $12, but it has coupons buried in the back worth many times the cost of the book. The coupons are for most of the mainstream dating sites, including the one I was using. I didn't notice them when I bought the book, but I will certainly use one or more of them, making the book essentially free. What I can't figure out is why the publisher is trying to hide the coupons."},{"Title":"Online Dating For Dummies (For Dummies (Psychology & Self Help))","review":"After 30 years of marriage I thought my dating days were behind me. Then came my divorce and I discovered I had no dating skills. I tried to meet people at various places but found my shyness kept getting in the way. So a year ago I joined the online dating scene and had some success but that was after a huge effort. This book would have saved me countless hours of time, dozens of rejections and made the experience much more enjoyable. I finished it last night and have already started putting into practice insights from the book.One lesson the book teaches that I had to learn the hard way was the danger of having a long term email relationship before talking on the phone or having a long term phone relationship before meeting in person. I made both of these mistakes wasting weeks at a time.The importance of a good photo and a good profile cannot be underestimated. They are on target with both. I found as I improved both, my responses improved. They have some very clear guidelines and I'm getting my pictures redone. I'm also going to rewrite parts of my profile based some of their great tips.For way less than the cost of a date or less than one month's membership to an online dating service you will dramatically improve your online dating experience. This is a must buy for online daters."},{"Title":"Online Dating For Dummies (For Dummies (Psychology & Self Help))","review":"I just finished reading this book and I must say that I am very impressed. I am already in the thick of online dating so I thought I wouldn't learn much, but I did. There are two areas where I felt the authors were the greatest help to me. First, I was one of those people who was deathly afraid of posting a photo, but the authors did a nice job of coaxing me over the line (and giving me a clever work around solution if I couldn't bring myself to do it). Second, Online Dating for Dummies contains some really good ideas of on how to manage those confounding essays. I always felt mine was lame, but I didn't know how to fix it. I think I've got mine right now.I appreciated the light and humorous style which kept me engaged, and the Dummies style of funny icons made it easy for me to spot the all important \\"secret sauce\\" tips.If you are new to online dating, you will save yourself a lot of trips down dark alleys by reading this book. If you are a semi-pro, you will probably still be surprised by what they found.

The others tended to fall into two catagories. Either books about someone's personal escapades on the internet or a compendium of internet horror stories from people who have had bad experiences. If you are looking for reasons to hate internet dating, you will be disappointed. The authors wrote a basic how-to book which kept me engaged and amused. I dare say that if you followed the recommendations of the authors, you'd do pretty well with online dating. Sure, some of the stuff is obvious (like post a good, but not too glamorous photo), but if you go online you'll see how many people don't even know that. On the other hand, some of the advance tips clearly took some digging to find and were much appreciated.

They sound uncomfortable enough with computers that they seem to expect readers to prefer reading a generic description on paper to reading the online descriptions that the dating services provide.Their idea of backing up email is to print it out.They say on page 183 that meeting in person gives away your anonymity completely, then on page 237 they describe how to meet in person anonymously.

It's another great rock solid book from the fantastic \\"For Dummies\\" series of books from Wiley.Singles who are super sophisticated from certain metro areas like Seattle, LA, New York, and San Francisco might turn up their noses at the section which talks about what kind of computer needs you will have. However, when leading a Seminar in Las Vegas with daters who are less technologically savvy than the tech elite, indeed, some don't even have a computer at home. What I so appreciate in the \\"For Dummies\\" series is how thorough they are about covering at topic and indeed addressing it as \\"A Reference for the Rest of Us!\\"What is so unique and marvelous about OLD4D is that the co-authors are a now-married couple who, yes, met each other via internet dating.

No. Is this still an excellent book with page upon page of useful and relevant information pertinent for current online dating? YES!Throughout the book, Silverstein and Lasky provide their female perspective and male perspective on, everything, and I mean everything including a full (tastefully addressed, still retaining a PG13 rating)chapter devoted to Sex.

As a consequence of that, several chapters are taken up explaining things like \\"you need a PC, a mac will do\\". I guess that is partly because it was written in 2003/4 though, so we will forgive it that.An entry on page 68 entitled: \\"Steering clear of those e-mail order brides\\" bugged me a bit. Having thoroughly researched the \\"e-mail order bride\\" arena, I thought their comments that \\"these sites border on scams\\" and more, to be wholly inaccurate and very misleading. Rather than dismiss all Eastern European and Russian women in a few paragraphs as they did, far better to explain that the book is unable to cover such a large side topic in much detail, and steer those interested toward specialist books catering to that genre, such asRussian Bride Guide.Chapter 6 covers the big known dating sites like Yahoo, Match, Lavalife, etc. We all know about those, but there are some handy tips in there.Assuming you know your away around a computer already, know how to set a email address up, and all the mundane stuff like \\"how to find an internet provider\\", you can safely start reading at Part III (page 91) as all what goes before will be of no use to you.On the whole, there is nothing earth-shattering you will read here, but it is worthy of a read nonetheless if you can get it inexpensively.

There is guidance for every detail of getting setup in an online service. There are especially good chapters on how to handle sex online, e-mail etiquette, and safety tips to consider when meeting people. The authors point out that unhealthy experience can happen, but they emphasize that most experiences are positive when common-sense precautions are taken. They recommend taking a long time with e-mail as the best way to get to know people before moving on to telephone or in-person contact because, they say, it is easier to get more personal and even intimate in thoughtful e-mails than it is in more direct personal contact.As a veteran of online dating, I thought this book would bore me, but I was wrong. It is very entertaining, especially when the authors speak in their own separate voices and disagree with each other. They say their guidance is based on hundreds of interviews with online daters as well as their own personal experience which culminated in a long-distance romance.

I thought this book was an easy read and had some basic common sense tips about dating online. One thing she emphasized was having a pic and safety, two important concepts.Many other common sense tips as well. One thing I noticed in the book that I wasn't thrilled about, she says if you are not happy in a date, then go to the bathroom and call a friend to show up and pretend you didn't realize they were coming. ( well you still would not break a date if you were happy). Another tip, tell them you have to go home to take care of your kids... \\" just make sure you have kids\\" etc.I believe that 99.9% of people do not want to be lied to. If you are not happy and not miserable, why not cut the date short, but be polite. Such as I need to get going in the next 10 minutes. I have some work/laundry ( or whatever honestly) there is.She says never go for dinner on the first date. Well some enjoy dinner even with someone new. She says it can be like a 90 minute prison. I don't agree. I feel unless a person is acting out of line that you can learn new things about someone and you can even help put a smile on someones face even if you aren't interested in dating them. Bottom line: Treat the other the way you would want to be treated, no need to stay hours longer if you are not happy, and no need to make b.s exuses, polite honesty is what everyone likes.You wouldn't leave a sales call after 2 minutes if you didn't like the person's hair or voice, so treat a date as you would a sales call, be polite be honest and be nice, try to make the experience a good one for both even if you are not compatable, you may have made someone's day and you are a better person for that.

The examples deal very well with the personal parts of an executive's life, such as buying a home, allocating family resources, and so forth. Although the concepts in this book could be applied to business situations, I think most readers would have a terrible problem doing so in the absence of business examples. My experience has been that people need to see examples and problems to work through that are closely related to their own situation before they can easily get the message. I hope the authors do decide to write another book on the same subject that is filled with business examples. In the meantime, this one is great for your family and your personal life. Better questions with pertinent business examples can be used to make people consider their assumptions and ordinary thinking habits. I try to always use that approach in my writing and consulting. Otherwise, your progress will &quot;stall&quot; as you are held back by bad thinking habits that keep you from seeing the full potential of the circumstances of your business life.

It outlines a really clear process for decision making, with numerous examples. It's very easy to read. I would disagree with the reviewer who said it was boring. I found it fascinating.

First, because people have trouble making decisions, and second, because people usually make the wrong decisions. Smart Choices provides a yellow-brook-road to follow one step at a time to end up with the optimum decision. Optimizing decisions are much harder to reach than maximizing decisions because they do balance all elements. The PROACTive process works, I have used it. The other book I recommend you read along with Smart Choices is The 2,000 Percent Solution, by Donald Mitchell, Carol Coles and Robert Metz. The 2,000 Percent Solution explains why people are &quot;stalled&quot; and why they cannot make a good decision. It describes these &quot;stalls&quot; in everyday examples: The Communications Stall (our messages are not understood), The Disbelief Stall (We can't do it), The Tradition Stall (We've always done it this way), The Bureaucratic Stall (too many unproductive policies and procedures), The Misconception Stall (based on poor assumptions) and The Unattractiveness Stall (Not wanting to wade in murky waters). Then it leads you through the Eight-Step Problem Solving Process to identify how to make decisions that result in 20 times the benefit or get there 20 times as fast or at 1/20th the cost. To become an expert decisions maker read both Smart Choices and The 2,000 Percent Solution. It's all you will need."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"The talnted trio of John S Hammond, Ralph L Keeney & Howard Raiffen have joined forces to help people understand a more logical approach to decision making. When faced with difficult decisions, many of us have a tendency of relying too much on \\"intuition\\", instead of cold hard facts. Usually, those decisions prove to be bad ones.On the other hand, sometimes our decisions are completely random; statistically a dead heat between two options. That happened to me years ago when faced with a choice of two different job offers. I remember writing the \\"pros & cons\\" of each possibility on a piece of paper and still couldn't figure out which way to go. Finally, I tossed a coin. It came out: Enterprise Rent-a-Car (then called Executive Leasing Company), and I wound up having a nice career; I even wrote a book about the experience (Life Under the Corporate Microscope: A Maverick's Irreverent Perspective)Admittedly, that particular decision was random, dumb luck. After reading this book, I know more about making more informed choices, by analyizing the data in a logical manner. In that particular scenario, I've got to believe without using a coin, the decision would've been the same; I just don't recall every detail. Maybe I'm smarter than I thought? Naw."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"Most books on decision-making fall into two categories--anecdotal and analytical. The anecdotal ones provide insights, motivation, and case studies of decisions, but few specific techniques. The analytical ones provide powerful techniques, but require mathematical sophistication and often lose sight of the more subjective aspects of decision-making. This book provides the perfect balance. There are specific techniques, clearly stated and backed up with case studies involving common personal decisions. It addresses the key concerns in any decision--understanding the problem, goals, and alternatives, balancing multiple conflicting goals, and dealing with uncertainty.You can read this book quickly, but I'd suggest you then give it a more thoughtful re-reading since it is full of powerful techniques for making decisions. The Even Swap method alone is worth the price of the book. This simple technique helps you make a decision when you have multiple, competing goals or considerations, as is usually the case in the choices we all need to make. It surfaces the key issues and succeeds in cases in which more complex, analytical techniques fall apart. This is an excellent book for anyone who makes personal or business decisions...and isn't that all of us?"},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"The underlying principles in \\"Smart Choices\\" are intuitive: be focused and be thorough. While trudging through its tedious explanations can be a chore, \\"Smart Choices\\" raises several thought-provoking points in good decision making.First, decision alternatives aren't always as they seem. With some effort, finding new, creative alternatives can often provide a better reward than looking at the obvious choices. Moreover, the decision itself may end up being a completely different one altogether, once one takes the time to define it.Chapter 11 also contains compelling information on the psychology of a decision. Word phrasing, anchoring, heuristics and a host of other \\"traps\\" can affect an otherwise soundly conceived decision. As a reader, Chapter 11 also provides a much-needed interesting finish to the dullness of the material in rest of the book.You'll find that much of the information communicated in \\"Smart Choices\\" goes well beyond the \\"OK, I get it\\" phase. Superfluous explanations abound, as the entirety of the book could be conveyed in under fifty pages (opposed to its current 244). Even so, more case studies and graphs, and less verbal filler, could do the book justice in communicating its ideas effectively.Like so many business-applied-to-life systematizations, the practicality of \\"Smart Choices\\" only goes so far. Nevertheless, the elements that are practical can have a huge impact in how you formulate decisions.

The material in here will be original unless you've already studied the art/science of decision making, and it is not material that is intuitive, or 'common sense'.

I had been worrying about making the right decision literally for months, as my whole future seemed to be at stake. I worked right through the book in a few days and came out with a range of options with which I am happy. Most importantly, I have greatly increased my confidence in my decision and am better able to articulate my reasoning. This confidence will help me come across well in interviews and improve my chances of getting the right job. I feel relaxed about moving to the next set of decisions- which company to work for.I found this book accessible, practical and useful. Most impressive was its holistic approach to decision-making, ranging from solid theory (clearly presented with realistic examples you can relate to), through practical tips (like &quot;remember that your decision cannot be better than your best alternative&quot;) to a well-presented chapter on psychological traps to which people often fall victim. You will recognize many of these from your experience at work.The first five chapters should be readily understandable by anyone. The next four (&quot;Tradeoffs&quot;, &quot;Uncertainty&quot;, &quot;Risk Tolerance&quot; and &quot;Linked Decisions&quot;) are more complex. Although the topics are explained in a prose style (with realistic examples) the material is unquestionably heavier going and requires careful study, particularly for someone who hasn't been exposed to decision trees and probability and statistics. I believe that anyone with some high school math will be OK- just be prepared to put your thinking hat on. It's worth the effort.After reading this book you will have a toolkit that you can carry around with you to improve my decision-making. In the office, these techniques should help you work with your bosses and colleagues to reach better decisions and avoid some mistakes. In your life as a whole, you should make smarter decisions and be happier as a result."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"I was taught all of the techniques described in this book in their most complex form. I loved the ideas when I first learned them, and have used them with great success for the last 30 years. Professor Raiffa is someone I admire greatly, as a result. I was delighted to find that this book addresses these complex tools in their simplest possible form, and applies the lessons to everyday living (especially the most important financial decisions that most people have to make like buying a home). A strength of this book is in the many detailed examples of personal decisions that are used to explain the authors' concepts. I immediately bought copies for everyone in my family as a way to help coach them in how to have more effective lives. You should do the same. I also suggest that you use the book as a model the next time that an important decision comes up that your whole family should participate in, such as whether to take a new job in a different state. This will not only help you develop better choices, but it will greatly improve the communications in your family about the decision, overcoming stalled thinking that could otherwise harm your family. I strongly hope that the authors will write a similarly simple version for business people, that applies these concepts to important business decisions.

The more we get familiar with art and science of decision-making and be skillful in using it, our move in the path towards success and progress will be more facilitated and secure and definitely our quality of life will improve. No doubt such knowledge has many uses. Perhaps we forget some stuff that we learn during schooling because they do not do anything for us and virtually have not any impact on our life. However, decision-making is useful not only in sensitive and fate making stages of our life but also in betterment of day-to-day activities and making smart choices. All of us have &quot;got stuck&quot; in a crossroad or many roads. In such circumstances we usually try to follow the best road through mimicking other people's decision-making method or simply asking for their help. In addition we are always told: &#8220;before making a decision you&#8217;d better think twice and consider all the possible aspects and weigh the pros and cons&quot;. But such advises are vague and motherhood and apple pie words. Nevertheless, living with uncertainty and the great demand for creativity and innovation are the features of today world. Therefore, any method or tool that can help us extend our thought horizons to face such complex conditions would be of great value. By using these tools we can figure out which things are important for us and by focusing on these values make our decisions with comfort. One of good points of focusing on values and not get limited to available alternatives is that we get rid of wrong and reactive attitudes and instead hunt for decision opportunities so we can proactively enhance our quality of life day by day. I as a person who recently translated Value-Focused Thinking by Ralph Keeney into Farsi found my autographed copy of Smart Choices very much appealing. Dr. Keeney and his colleagues have produced an outstanding user-friendly guide to help people enhance their knowledge of decision-making. This book is a must for everyone who feels &#8220;have gotten stuck&#8221; in many crossroads and do not well know how to think twice and consider all the possible aspects and weigh the pros and cons."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"Making decisions is a fundamental life skill. Most of us dread making hard decisions. In real life tough choices almost always involve high stakes and serious consequences, they may involve numerous and multiple complex considerations, ..and they expose us to the judgment of others. The need to make a difficult decision put us at risk of anxiety, confusion, doubt, regret, embarrassment, loss, you name it.In this book the authors explain in a practical, and easy to follow language, decision-analysis techniques and stratagems for the benefit of the rest of us. They provide substantial, straightforward explanations of fundamental concepts (risk tolerance, sunk costs, desirability curves, etc.).In the step-by-step procedures they combine expertise, solid investigation, practical experience, and common sense, to help the reader understand what they want to accomplish, identify creative choices, evaluate risks, clarify any existing doubt, and establish reasonable transactions.

I think to buy this book was a good choice. It offers of course not the answers to all your questions in life but a good and systematical way to make decisions. There's a special approach in this book called &quot;PROACT&quot; and this means that you have to define your problem and objectives, look for alternatives, describe the consequences and deal with tradeoffs. All this is written in a clearly language and easy to read but with academic background.

Three renowned leaders in Decision Analysis have offered up decision-making that works everyday for everybody. Smart Choices is so much more than I expected because it is so much less. Not only have Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have removed the complex mathematics, but they have also excised the academic prose. Unfortunately, in the process they have removed most of the footnotes and references, and curiously have replaced the index with an outline called &quot;A Roadmap to Smart Choices&quot;. I'd like the index back, if you please. Nevertheless, this book is first-rate. The chapter entitled &quot;Tradeoffs&quot;, which appeared earlier in The Harvard Business Review, is destined to become a classic. Also, the chapter on risk tolerance is superb. Buy this book.

Although it took a lot of concentration and a few readings to truly grasp the system of decision making that the authors create, I can honestly say it is one of the most valuable methods of decision-making I have read. Other books make decision making simpler -- rely on intuition more say many; come up with a simple system say others. This one doesn't make the decision simple though it does make it more simple and it doesn't make it easy, though it does make a difficult decision a wee bit easier. What it does is make the decision smart, wise, reliable, clear, and as good as decision making can get. I have used it to make some of the most difficult decisions I could make for myself and I have used to help friends and others make difficult decisions for themselves. I have used it to write a complicated chapter in my own book on making a particular decision. So all in all, I highly recommend this book -- for use not just in business but for any complicated, serious or perplexing decision in life.

I definitely could have changed it all with the help of this book.This book has been written by top experts in this field. This book, at times, goes into too much complicated analysis of what has to be done for someone to make a smart decision. This is not necessarily bad since it tends to illustrate many points that the authors try to bring home. The authors do admit that for many life decisions, too much analysis is not often needed. If you follow some main steps that the authors advice you to take, you will be on your way to making smart decisions. I believe even if you use 50% of what this book tells you to do, you are more than likely to make a smart decision.Once again, I wish I had this book a decade ago. I would not have been broke, unhappy, lonely, unhealthy and with so much useless education right now. I already made a few decisions based on this book. I hope I will continue to make progress.

But of all those decisions, how many of them are actually 'good' decisions? This is a question that most of us hardly ever think about because we have been faced with many problems/situations and making decisions to most of them without much thought all of our lives. A lot of times we don't question our decisions unless the outcome is unfavorable, but even when it is favorable, it does not always mean the best decision was made. Unfortunately, this is exactly why most of our decisions are not really 'good' decisions. When an individual is in a situation where a decision must be made, how does that person go about deciding what their decision is going to be? Do they know what the real problem is? Have they determined the true objective of their decision problem? Are they aware of the consequences of each choice they have to decide from? These are only a handful of questions that need to be addressed when faced with a situation or predicament where a decision must be made. Some of them may be addressed during the decision making process, but for the most part, there are so many more that are not. Decision-making is a long detailed process that requires a lot of thought and analysis before a decision can be made. Fortunately to help us learn the art of making 'good' decisions, there have been an overwhelming amount of books, articles, and other reading material to help us refine and enhance our decision-making skills.One such book is Smart Choices, written by John S. Hammond, Ralph L. Keeney, and Howard Raiffa. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have brought together years of research and experience in decision-making into the aforementioned book to educate all of us on how to make 'good' decisions. They are not saying that their method will make all of our decisions easy, but that they will become easier. Smart Choices encompasses a lot of important concepts needed to fully understand the process of making 'good' decisions. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa provide us with a step by step process to making 'good' decisions that can be applied to many different aspects of our lives. Not only will we be able to apply these concepts professionally, but personally as well. The authors of Smart Choices believe that the foundation of 'good' decision-making consists of eight specific elements, which are Problem, Objectives, Alternatives, Consequences, Tradeoffs, Uncertainty, Risk Tolerance, and Linked Decisions. Of those eight elements, the first five are the keys to becoming an effective decision-maker and will be part of every decision problem. The remaining elements help to justify and clarify decisions and may not always be incorporated. Now they refer to the first five elements as PrOACT, which they feel will help us to remember that the best way to approach a decision situation is to be proactive and seek them out instead of waiting for them to come to us. They are trying to express to us that by being proactive and seeking them out, it enables us to avoid being in a position where a decision has to be made immediately and we are not prepared to really make the best decision. They feel that being proactive is invaluable in becoming the best possible decision-maker. I agree with them that being proactive is important, but I don't necessarily see how feasible it is during our everyday lives. I feel that most people are not going about their day trying to find decision situations because they already so much going on in their lives and in their minds. I know that I don't, and maybe that is why I have not always made 'good' decisions. I see why it is important to be proactive because it does enable us to give ourselves the proper time to think them through and make 'good' decisions.After reading through Smart Choices, I do understand the importance of finding them before they find me and have been trying to incorporate it in my everyday life. Problem is the first of eight elements that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa believe start the process of 'good' decision-making. Defining the problem is the basis for the entire process. It is extremely important that enough time is spent on making sure that the 'true' problem is determined. How we tackle a decision influences what we decide in the end. A lot of 'good' decisions can become bad decisions if the root problem is not correctly defined. In order to truly determine what the real decision problem is, Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa state that we must be creative and look at each situation in different ways other than the most obvious one. This way we can increase the potential of defining the true problem and giving us more and better options to decide from. This part of the decision process seems so logical, but I feel is something that a lot of us take for granted. Reading Smart Choices definitely helps to reiterate the little things that almost all of us know, just neglect or fail to implement. Another key to finding the right problem is going into your decision-problem with a positive attitude. How we feel about a situation has an overwhelming influence on our final decision. Being optimistic instead of pessimistic will help to make the decision process more enjoyable and beneficial because their will be a positive attitude. This is very true because I know that I have been faced with different decisions where I had positive and negative attitudes and it was definitely easier and more enjoyable when I had an optimistic view. It is a lot harder making decisions to situations where all we think about is the negative outcomes. The other keys to defining the problem are to be open to the impacts and effects of different decisions as well as open to seeking advice and insight from others.All of the previous concepts will help to define the root to any decision problem. Once its established, it is important to stay focused and be open to continuous review of the original problem because times are always changing, which means that a decision problem can as well. I really enjoyed reading this first part of Smart Choices because it puts 'good' decision making into perspective. So many times mistakes are made at the beginning leading to bad decisions, which also include good outcomes to incorrectly defined problems. The emphasis that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa place on spending enough time thinking through and formulating the right decision problem is vital to anyone becoming a decision-maker. The second element is Objectives. This element goes hand in hand with the previous one. A lot of times once the decision problem is identified, we tend to jump right into making the decision much sooner than we should and it turns out to be the wrong one or not the best one. Just like the first element, a lot of time and effort needs to be spent on determining the true objectives, which pertain to what we want to get out of our decision problem.Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have identified five steps to help us master the art of identifying our objects. They are 1) Write down all of the concerns you hope to address through your decision, 2) Convert your concerns into succinct objectives, 3) Separate ends from means to establish your fundamental objectives, 4) Clarify what you mean by each objective, and 5) Test your objectives to see if they capture your interests. By utilizing these five steps, we can come up with our true objectives that will lead to 'good' decisions. One thing that they feel is important has to do with asking a lot of 'why' questions. This helps to clarify things and ensure that nothing is being overlooked and our fundamental objectives have been determined, which are the key objectives that from our original list, are achieved. I think that their explanation of why it is important to determine the right objectives is valuable and extremely valid. I don't think that the majority of us really spend a lot of time making sure that we have our true objectives identified. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa do an excellent job of conveying the importance and relevance of there second element of the decision-making process. I definitely agree with them. In order for anyone to become an effective decision-maker, they must be willing to spend time developing the objectives that they want to achieve before rushing into making a decision. The next element of the decision-making process is Alternatives. The alternatives represent all of the different options available to choose from for pursuing the objectives. They are extremely important in the decision making process because they represent the choices we have to choose from and they have direct influence on the final outcome. Hammond, Keesey, and Raiffa express the importance of making sure that we keep two important points in mind when determining our alternatives. They are 1) You can never choose an alternative you haven't considered and 2) No matter how many alternatives you have; your chose alternative can be no better than the best of the lot. They are emphasizing the importance of developing good alternatives and making sure that all of our options have been determined and considered before deciding what to do.I agree with them emphasizing this because too many times people only give themselves a limited number of alternatives. They don't attempt to give themselves as many options as possible, which will help them to be aware of entire situation. I know that I don't do this enough when faced with a decision problem. The entire process of determining all of the alternatives is a long one. It is one that must be thought out and taken very seriously because it plays a big role in the final outcome of the decision. To help make things easier, Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have established several keys to generating more effective alternatives. They are 1) Use your objectives - ask 'How,' 2) Challenge constraints, 3) Set high expectations, 4) Do your own thinking, 5) Learn from experience, and 6) Ask others for suggestions. By using these keys, it will to generate as many quality alternatives as possible. I like the idea of establishing guidelines to help guide us into become better decision-makers. Another that they advise us to do is to always be open to more alternatives, but not to look forever for the perfect one because more than likely, there is never going to be a perfect alternative. Being open to new alternatives whenever they arise is important because things always change and you know when something an alternative that was missed or not a factor is recognized or becomes a factor. Now touching on the idea of not searching for the perfect alternative is a good one. Too many times people search and search and search for an alternative that does not exist because they do not want to accept any of the ones available.I totally agree with Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa that we must obtain as many alternatives as we can and at the same time we should not continuously search for the perfect one because it just doesn't exist. I think one of the most important part of their explanation on alternatives pertained to the types of alternatives that we can give ourselves to tailor to our decision problems. There were four different types to be exact. The first one is called a Process alternative. It deals with having a process make a decision for you. The example that they used was flipping a coin to make a decision. The flipping of a coin is a process. I think that this one will work when the decision is affecting other people or things. The example in Smart Choices dealt with flipping a coin to decide between two friends who was going to go to a skate show with the one that got the tickets. The reason why I say this is because I have flipped a coin to make a decision before and if it didn't land on the one I called, I automatically said, 'Best 3 out of 5.' I know that this is only one of many processes that can be used, but I just think that the other options available to help determine alternatives are better. A second type is the Win-Win alternative. This is one that I believe many people are aware of and probably use all of the time. This is when the decision that is made benefits two different parties. I like this one because it makes deciding a decision between several participants an amicable one. This way no one has to worry about the other one getting upset or disagreeing with the final decision and or outcome. I agree with them that this type of alternative is very common and efficient where both parties are satisfied. Information gathering is the third alternative. This deals with obtaining a lot of information of the situation or problem that will help to make a more educated decision. This helps to relieve any uncertainty that might be around about the possible decisions. I feel that this one is very important because in my own experiences, I have seen a lot of alternatives neglected because their real meaning was unknown and no one actually wanted to go find out the true meaning. By not knowing about them, it means that they are pretty much ruled out and really don't matter in the end. They are alternatives, but not alternatives. In other words, they are there for someone to choose, but the person choosing can't choose them.I think that it is very good that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have touched upon this style because I feel that too many times it is neglected by many people and that they just rule out alternatives that they no very little about. I like this type because it gives someone the opportunity to educate him or herself about a situation and then have them make a 'good' decision. The final alternative that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa give us is the time-buying alternative. This has to do with putting off a decision so you can think more about it and evaluate your options. I like this one a lot because I tend to put off difficult decisions as long as I can because I really don't want to be in the position of having to make the decision. A good point that they touch on is that during the waiting period, there is always the chance that things will change for the better as well as for the worse so it may or may not be a benefit to put things off.I think that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa do an excellent job at explaining the different types alternatives we have as well as their importance. The next element is Consequences. I think that this element is extremely important when determining which alternative is going to be chosen in attempt to reach the best decision for any decision problem. The main benefit that I found with this element was their use of a consequence table. A consequence table helps to give a projection of what the future holds for each different alternative, which will hopefully help to eliminate certain decisions and lead to the best one. They gave four steps to help us utilize a consequence table effectively, which are1) Mentally put yourself into the future,2) Create a free-form description of the consequences of each alternative,3) Eliminate any clearly inferior alternatives, and4) Organize descriptions of remaining alternatives into a consequences table. By using these steps to create a consequence table, it enables us to compare all of our alternatives against each other and decide which ones we know are unfavorable and which ones have potential to be the final choice. It also allows the objectives to be written down on the left-hand side of the paper with the consequences listed underneath the appropriate alternative. I think that this is a great tool because it helps us to really picture what our options as opposed to trying to remember everything. It helps to make things more black and white instead of gray because things are a lot easier to understand and contemplate when they are written down on paper instead of jumbled up in our minds with loads of other information. This section on consequences was very good. I like how they conveyed everything because everything was clear and to the point, which made it easier to comprehend.Knowing the consequences is extremely important because the severity of each one will have an influence on the one chosen and Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have given us a useful way of determining what the consequences are to our alternatives. The fifth element is Tradeoffs. The whole tradeoff process involves getting your number of alternatives down to a reasonable number to choose from. This is done by getting rid of the ones that are dominated by others, which basically means the ones that are not as beneficial are being tossed out of the pool of choices. Once this is done, there are only a handful of alternatives left to decide from. The true tradeoff process now begins because it involves each alternative and its respective consequences. The tradeoff process enables us to adjust our consequences of different alternatives to make them equal to other alternatives for a given objective. This type of method helps to make the last remaining possible alternatives equal so the final decision is easier to make. The method that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa touch on is the swap method, which means that when one alternative increases with regards to an objective while another alternative decreases with regards to an objective. I think that this element is important because whenever I am faced with a decision, I am always wondering what I am missing by making the decisions that I do.One thing that I think they should have done was incorporate the tradeoffs with the alternatives instead of by themselves after the consequences. It seems to me that it would make more sense if they went hand in hand with the alternatives and then lead into the consequences. However, I do think that they have done a good job of emphasizing the importance of having tradeoffs available to use when appropriate. I just think that they are making the process a little longer than it actually needs to be. I agree that formulating the tradeoffs is important, but there is no reason why it has to have its own section and instead be incorporated with the alternatives. The next element is Uncertainty. Uncertainty deals with being in the state of not really knowing if the decision you chose will actually be 'good' decision in the end. The decision that was made could be good and the outcome could be bad or vice versa. There is no way to know what is really going to happen. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have provided us with a risk profile that will help determine the way uncertainty affects an alternative. It basically lists out all of the possible outcomes to a decision and lets you list out the chances of it happening and what the consequences are of it does happen. I honestly feel that this element could be eliminated from the entire decision making scheme. Uncertainty is always going to be present no matter what the case, but I really don't think that it has a lot of influence on how the decision will be made pertaining to the alternatives. Even if it does have an impact on things, I don't think that it has to have a whole section of its own either because it could also be tied in with the discussion of alternatives or consequences. I also don't think that it should come after consequences. If there is going to be a discussion about it, I don't see the sense in having it come after the decision has already been made. If it is going to have an influence on the decision that is being made, I think that it should come before the discussion of the consequences. Now Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa also go into discussions about uncertainty's role in a decision tree, but I will discuss the decision tree in the next paragraph because I feel it has more of a role with the next element. The seventh element is Risk. Risk is a big factor in the decision making process. I think that this element has more influence on people than anything else because it basically will determine what type of outcome is desired or what someone is willing to give up for the chance of obtaining something else. Risk is going be viewed differently by every single person because not everyone will have the same amount of risk tolerance. This means that one person may or may not be more willing to lose more than another person in the hope of achieving something. Usually the more you are willing to lose, the more you will gain if you choose correctly.Now going back to why I felt that uncertainty could be eliminated is because I think that risk also encompasses the concept of uncertainty. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have established 3 steps to try and incorporate them, which are1) Think hard about the relative desirability of the consequences of the alternatives you're considering,2) Balance the desirability of the consequences with their chances of occurring, and3) choose the most attractive alternative. I think that the most important part to this element is its decision tree. The decision tree is a very useful table that I was completely unaware of until I read our textbook and Smart Choices. The decision tree pretty much lists out all of the objectives, alternatives, uncertainty, consequences, and some other things that are used to help people make 'good' decisions. The objective is located on the left-hand side with everything else feeding into it. I really like the decision tree because it has a very easy structure to comprehend and it will give you a layout of the different decisions and all of the different possible outcomes. You can also label the costs of each alternative pertaining to what the possible gains and losses are for choosing one decision over another.Now risk is something that everyone thinks about and should be something that everyone takes an interest in. You never know when anything is going to happen so we always need to be prepared to evaluate all of our choices no matter where we are during our decision-making process. I think that the emphasis that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa put on the use of a decision tree is excellent. After experimenting with it, I can honestly say that it helps to lay things out in black and white, which makes the decision making process easier for you to make. There is so much to say about risk and I feel that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have done an excellent job at conveying to us its importance and different options available. The trick is to make sure that everything is that can possibly be known is known because it will be much easier to make a decision with as little amount of uncertainty as possible. Without risk, life would be too easy. The last element that they discuss is linked decisions. Linked decisions are decisions that are made that have a direct effect on the future of other decisions. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa state that a decision tied to another decision can take one of two forms. The first one is information decisions and the second one is future decisions. Information decisions are sought out after before the basic decision is made because the information that has been obtained makes us better prepared to make the correct decision. The future decision has to do with making the decisions after the consequences of become known. Whatever the choice is now will dictate what the choices in the future will be. They also feel that the key to having good linked decisions is to get it under control and have them walk to their desks. They actually gives us 6 steps to master analyzed thinking among which are: Understand the basic decision problem, Identify ways to reduce critical under uncertainties, and Identify future decisions linked to the basic definition.I really feel that the best part of this section is the decision tree because on paper is looks amazingly useful. I think that linked decisions are very important to keep in mind because I honestly don't think that enough people think about what their decision today will do to a decision or situation 5 days from now. Hammond, Keeney, Raiffa do a great job of explaining what everything is and how important it is to start as soon as we can to become 'great' decision makers. Smart Choices was an excellent book to read. I can honestly say that it was a pleasure to read it everyday because there is so many positive things to day. They have given me a lot insight on what it takes to become a successful leader and the importance of being able to make 'good' decisions. Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have established the foundation that is necessary to learn how to make 'good' decisions as well as laid the groundwork for much more to come. Everything that they discussed is extremely important in the decision-making process. There are a few elements that could be left out or combined, but for the most part, all of us need to incorporate them into our everyday life in order to become the best decision-makers that we possibly can. There is so much going on everyday that most of us neither have the time or the energy to sit down and go through such a detailed decision-making process. I wish that I could because I definitely see the benefit of having such a process in place, but I just do not feel like I have a lot of time to spare for going through the entire aforementioned problem. The thing I liked the most, which was the decision tree, is probably something that I can't see myself actually sitting down and completing because it is definitely extremely time consuming.I feel that Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa have provided us with the necessary tools and procedures to become 'good' decision makers. Through practice and experience, I feel that anyone can achieve a good decision because of the foundation that they have given us: Smart Choices."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"I give this book to people who are just graduating from college.

My degree is in information systems management and, frankly, I took Managerial Decision Analysis only because I needed 3 elective credits to graduate. In retrospect, however, the course was among the most beneficial to me and Smart Choices was certainly the most relevant book I read in graduate school. I say it was the most relevant because it demonstrates how to define problems and make decisions not simply as a business leader, but as an individual. The PROACT approach is a valuable tool for making formal decisions like &quot;Which career path should I choose?&quot; or &quot;Which software package should I recommend to my client?&quot; But the mentality that the approach engenders is pervasive. You will find yourself unwittingly applying elements of it to questions like &quot;How should I spend time with my kids this weekend?&quot; or &quot;What is the best Valentine's Day gift for my wife?&quot; The greatest benefit to me has been the piece of mind that comes with knowing that I don't just make better decisions -- I am now a better decision maker."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"I have read many books on decision analysis - however, the 3 authors managed to condense the most relevant points in one book, without academic speak.

The title may make this appear to be one of the too-numerous mass-market books which claim to offer advice on business and personal decision-making but actually offer lots of specific admonitions which are based on values which the reader may not share (example: anything by Steven Covey). This book, however, doesn't try to sell you any of the the authors' values; instead it teaches you an effective process that you can use to analyze any decision-making situation and make the choices which are most effective for achieving your objectives, whatever they may be. The book treats the subject in the same systematic way that it might be treated in an academic decision theory text, only it is written in plain language which can be read quickly and easily comprehended by the general reader. It finishes with a summary outline (they call it a &quot;roadmap&quot;) which is a useful quick reference."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"I am a corporate strategy consultant and an author of business books and articles.

I was delighted to find that this book addresses these complex tools in their simplest possible form, and applies the lessons to everyday living (especially the most important decisions that most people have to make). I immediately bought copies for everyone in my family as a way to help coach them in how to have more effective lives. You should do the same. I also suggest that you use the book as a model the next time that an important decision comes up that your whole family should participate in. This will not only help you develop better choices, but it will greatly improve the communications in your family about the decision. I strongly hope that the authors will write a similarly simple version for business people.

Using the relevant decision research, the authors have successfully produced this accessible guide. The book is a practical introduction to decisions for anyone interested in approaching problems in business and life in a structured manner. While footnotes do not appear, related research confirms the validity of the authors' methods. For an introduction into the research, I recommend the Harvard Business Review on Decision Making from the HBS Press that includes a paper by the authors detailing the even swap method.My only criticism is the compressed feel of the text particularly in the \\"Uncertainty\\" and \\"Linked Decisions\\" chapters. For most of the book, the authors did an outstanding job of condensing a great deal of information into a flowing, informative book."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"The authors of the book \\"Smart Choices\\" (Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa) look at decision making as a disciplined informational affair. If you gather information according to their template you will make better decisions about some things. But they give only passing mention to the fact that decision-making is largely a psychological affair. Information handling (the topic of the decision) is opposed by psychological (emotional) determinants of decision-making. In the gap between these two factors, most people are driven more by emotions than by \\"rational factors\\" about information.The motivation in decision-making is about what people want. The choices made are the expressions of motives - and motives are, by definition, psychological machinery. Psychological machinery is emotional. Period. If you consider the logic of TV's CSI show or Lieutenant Columbo, for example, any behavior depends on three things: motive, means and opportunity. The authors of this book have concentrated on the means for making a good decision. Opportunity to make a decision is taken for granted. But they have deleted the systematic emotional bias that disables so many motives of so many people so much of the time.The downside of this excellent book is that the authors use the outline of their book in a way similar to the way pilots use a preflight checklist - to insure they will operate the machinery of their aircraft properly. Few human and interpersonal situations respond to \\"checklist logic\\". People are not normally as well organized as a well-maintained aircraft. People reach closure on decisions with emotional logic independent of the literal facts - in more cases than not. People have strong emotional habits and those emotions dictate the choices, not the information. That is, emotions frame the overall decision-making stage which relegate \\"rational\\" checklists to bit players in the story of the decision process. Relatively few individuals are able to shift the balance toward the rational end of the gap and away from emotional dominance. Emotional tune-ups, done by a trained professional, do more to improve decisions than any rational checklist possibly can."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"The first 75 pages or so of this book are pretty boring. As someone else noted, immediately after reading them you wonder what it was you just read, because the writing feels very meaningless. The one message I took away from it was, carefully think about how you phrase a problem. True enough, but that is also kind of obvious.One thing especially annoying about the book was that they role-played with a couple seeking to buy a new home because they were having a new baby. The problem as they describe is whether to renovate, buy a new home, if so which home, etc etc. The examples, although real in some aspects, do not go into enough depth. The case studies such as this one feel artificially canned to demonstrate a point. The case studies could have been a LOT better throughout the book, and would have made the book from an OK product to something really good.Methods in this book, although systematic and useful, don't directly map to real life. They do however point you in the direction you need to go, which is to start writing things down in a clear coherent fashion (in terms of stating problems), and creating tables to visually see solutions to these problems compared against each other.This book gets pretty good when it gets into the process of comparing alternatives. The ideas about putting solutions into tables, assigning numerical values to qualitative information, and then eliminating dominated alternatives is great. It clearly illustrates how to compare direct alternatives to each other, and there is very little room for screwing this up. Really good stuff, made the book worth reading.After that however, I don't really buy into their risk analysis section. The assumptions behind the risk forecasting aren't clearly articulated and I'm not so sure that the future can be forecasted with percentages at ALL (as in a 40% chance that I win a lawsuit). I have a very high degree of skepticism to any numerical forecasting done in this fashion.The linked decision section is not that great either.In the end what makes this book really good is demonstrating how to compare direct alternatives - i.e. if you have a choice between 4 houses, or 3 jobs, or 6 car mechanics - this book will show you how to narrow it down to 1 choice in an extremely well thought out and articulated manner. I guess it makes the book worth reading, although much of the rest of it is boring.My only criticism is that often times choices, (the choice of a job for example) will necessarily involve other decisions, such as what city to live in, what apartment or house to rent, that are tightly interwoven... Moving from top level decisions to bottom level decisions (like city first, then job, then apartment) is not always so clear cut. For example, the same decision tree could be (job first, city second, then apartment). Better case studies with a bit more complex problems would have helped a little bit in this regard."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"When I started reading this book, I was bored and disappointed with the examples. The process of decision making -- problem, objectives, alternatives, consequences, and tradeoffs -- seemed obvious. And the examples were silly: Should John and Jane Doe buy a house? I wasn't interested, but when I continued reading, some parts, such as the chapters about risk and uncertainty, grasped me. I also found that just enumerating the decision making process made it a lot easier. The PrOACT solution is very intelligent. Even if you've never heard of decision theory, you use the system. By quantifying it and understanding how you make decisions, you'll naturally become a better decision maker. You'll know that there are alternatives to eating the whole cheesecake, or what the real reason you're putting off that assignment is. I run a website, called the Wall Street Wizard, www.streetwhiz.com, and it's helped me craft a better, more perceptive site because of my decisions on a daily basis. And it can help you. One of the best decisions you'll make is to buy this book."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"There are a lot of books about decision making and problem solving, and the vast majority of them are mediocre. There are a number of decent, readable accounts that give some simple tips and teach you about psychological principles, but these typically have very little in the way of solid tools. We all know it gets boring when the math starts or when we have start doing drills to learn basic skills. And the more specific they get with their methods, the less useful it becomes for our own problems. Books that cater to our creative side can help us learn how to break out of ruts, but they are weaker on helping us make good decisions more consistently.Then there are systematic formal approaches by academics based on mathematical techniques, and these tend to be the equivalent of textbooks. Decision theory, mathematical modelling, strategy, optimization, probability, statistics, etc.. Great stuff. You can get a lot out of them if you put in the study, as far as useful tools and skills for hypothetical problems, but actually applying their lessons when you face a real problem is another matter. And as with most academic learning, practical transfer is left as an exercise for the reader. Also applying formal methods in situations where we already have good instincts, that often rubs us the wrong way. Using a spreadsheet to choose a mate? If you actually were to study systematic decision making and acquire the skills and habits for using those tools, you would surely make more decisions more consistently. But would you be wiser at knowing when to use these methods?Smart Choices is closer to the first type of book, a practical guide to principles, but it has the soul of a textbook. No footnotes, bibligraphy, or exercises. But it does treat the subject matter very seriously. Maybe that's also part of why many of the reviewers on Amazon found the book boring. The authors' discipline in focusing on what really works while building on solid theory is clear throughout the book. As a result of this unique approach, this book has two great strengths in my opinion.First, it is a surprisingly concise and admirably simple presentation of decision theory, with virtually no mathematics required. That's a signficant accomplishment in itself. The authors are deep experts in the technical aspects formal decision making, but have chosen a small set of simple tools to illustrate very general principles. When dealing with uncertainty, you create a risk profile for each alternative, listing the likelihood and consequences of each outcome for that alternative. Ok, not exactly rocket science, but who among us ever thinks of actually doing that to help them think through uncertainty? If you can't decide from the risk profile, you create a decision tree by identifying the things you can control and the things that remain uncertain, and their consequences. Very basic tools and advice and very powerful, with some practical advice for dealing with the messy details. It isn't so much the tools themselves that are the point here, it is the straightforward advice the authors offer on how and when to use them. There is a lot of experience condensed into a small book here.The second strength of this book is that the authors make an unusually successful effort to bridge the different kinds of decision making genres, offering not only the outline of a formal process to guide you and specific tools to use within the process, but very clear practical explanations of why the steps are done as they are. The book begins with the usual mantra of systematic decision methods: having a process is better than not having a process. Sort of like having a map is better than not having a map. Ok. But before they jump into the how-to part that makes this a small practical guide, they also make their process criteria explicit. The process must help you to:1. Focus on what's important2. be logical and consistent3. acknowledge objective and subjective factors, and blend analytical with intuitive thinking4. require only as much information and analysis as neccessary to resolve the dilemma5. encourage and guide the gathering of relevant information and informed opinion6. be straightforward, reliable, easy to use, and flexibleThis sounds great, but how can a formal decision process accomplish these things? And do the authors really provide one that manages this feat? It is their systematic and serious attempt to actually meet these 6 criteria, and their relative success at achieving it that makes for the greatest strength of this book.The way they attempt this is to define each of their process step in very flexible terms, focusing on the critical relationships between the factors. Some trigger leads you to a loose problem definition with its associated concerns. The problem definition helps you identify means objectives (how you intend to meet your concerns). Means objectives help you figure out your more fundamental objectives. The objectives help you generate alternatives that meet those objectives. Analyzing consequences in various ways helps you evaluate the alternatives and even go back to generate new ones. Alternatives often have consequences that meet different objectives in different ways, so we have ways of helping to make tradeoffs. There is a lot of theory and experience buried into these seemingly simple ideas, and it would be very easy to miss the value of this if the reader hasn't seen decision theory done less expertly in many other books. It is very easy to make the process too simple, too complicated, too rigid, or not provide enough guidance. I think the authors get it pretty much just right.The reason it works in this book, in my opinion, is that by explaining the process in clear terms and not just providing the tools, the flexibility of the process becomes much clearer. It becomes obvious from the examples why you want to keep looking for better alternatives even in the later stages of the process, even as you eliminate alternatives that just won't work or just aren't as good as others. It becomes clear where and how to consider uncertainty. It becomes more evident where various thinking traps make their way into the process by causing us to persevere at the wrong problem, by not considering important objectives, but not looking closely enough at the consequences of each alternative, by not considering tradeoffs, by missing relationships between decisions, or by failing to account for your own personal risk tolerance. The guidelines for the process help you avoid each of these problems by helping you focus on the right things at the right point in the process, but without making it so rigid that you fall into a completely different trap.There is no magic problem solving or decision making method that will solve your problems for you, but following the advice in this book will at the very least help you focus on the right things, ask the right questions at the right time during the process, and help explain your decisions better to others as well as to yourself. There are books that provide more details on specific tools, but this book stands out for its clear and practical presentation of the overall process of making decisions."},{"Title":"Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions","review":"As an executive I am faced with making key decisions almost every day. In many complex decisions there is almost always conflict between logical analysis vs. intuitive processing while there is a shortage of perfect information and time. Smart Decisions lays out a simple, clear and practical framework and process for decision making. Although many of the concepts are not novel, the power is that the book links various tools and technigues as discrete decision making steps. Each step builds on the next. They greatly enhance the concepts through many practical examples for making business and personal decisions. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Born to Skate: The Michelle Kwan Story","review":"If you've already read Michelle's autobiography this book is just a repeat. There was some info I didn't know about Michelle but very little. In my opinion, the book talked too much about other skaters. Some info in there was not necessary. Michelle Kwan fans out there, this book is better for people who want a mix of other famous athletes. I'm an MK fan and I was a little disappointed. If any of you haven't read Michelle's autobiography yet, you are better off getting it instead."},{"Title":"Born to Skate: The Michelle Kwan Story","review":"I'm a huge fan of figure skating in general and Michelle Kwan in particular, but this book sounded like it was written by an over-enthusiastic child. A lot of the quotes were taken directly from interviews that the skaters had done on TV, the writing and grammar were sloppy, and there were a lot of details that were just plain wrong. Tonya Harding did NOT come in third at the 93 nationals; that was Tonia Kwiatkowski (whose parents, by the way, are named Phil and Corinne, not Shirley and Leonard). Epstein waxes poetic about Michelle's brilliant artistry in 93 and 94, when she really didn't begin to shine until the 95-96 season. And any time Michelle didn't win first place, Epstein acts like she was robbed. These may seem like petty gripes, but with all the well-written literature available about Michelle, this book's numerous errors cause it to fall far short of what we've come to expect in skating coverage. Do yourself a favor and read Michelle's own autobiography or either of the two better-researched books by Christine Brennan."},{"Title":"Born to Skate: The Michelle Kwan Story","review":"This was written like a bad soap opera.

If you are a fan of Michelle Kwan read her autobiography, skip this book."},{"Title":"Born to Skate: The Michelle Kwan Story","review":"This book, besides giving tons of information on Michelle, had a great little directory in the back about all the jumps and spins.

A really good book on the sport and performer."},{"Title":"Born to Skate: The Michelle Kwan Story","review":"The book I read, &quot;Born To Skate,&quot; was the best bool on a bibliography that I have ever read. The book had a lot of excellent detailing, which made the book sound a lot better. Michelle Kwan's story about her was interesting and educating. It talked about her dreams when she was little and how she made her dreams come true.Her big dream was to go to the olympics, which she did and to become a world figure skater, which she also did. She always lived up to her expectations in life. She always kept a smile on her face even when she was down.This story about Michelle Kwan's life was so wonderful to read about, because everything was positive about her attitude. Born To Skate was a good story about people living up to their dreams and never letting go of them no matter what. In the story she said, &quot;Always live up to your dreams!&quot;"},{"Title":"Life in Ancient Greece Coloring Book","review":"I am using this resource with homeschool Pre to 2nd grade children. This coloring book helps Greece come to life with pictures of markets, shipping, a wedding, several different tradesmen at their trade, children playing, senate, theater, school, ect...One warning, four pages (out of roughly 45 pictures) have nudity: two of Olympic games and one gym (tastefully covering the front, but showing male backsides) and then one of a topless dancing/acrobatic girl at a party. I choose to scan them, in order to give them clothing.Other content: there are solider scenes with weapons bristling, but only two battle scenes (one on water and one on land). For battle scenes both are tasteful, even for younger dc. It also includes about four pages of religious ceremonies/scenes, including the oracle at Delphi.Overall an excellent resource; very well done!!"},{"Title":"Life in Ancient Greece Coloring Book","review":"I use the Dover coloring books often as I home school. The kids are busy, quiet AND they listen. It really helps to reinforce the lessons when they color the same things that they are learning about. There is a Dover book for most major subjects!"},{"Title":"Life in Ancient Greece Coloring Book","review":"I like this coloring book for children because it will help bring lessons on Ancient Greece to life and reinforce basic facts. It is organized primarily by chronology, has fairly complex drawings with enough detail and background for interest, and most significantly contains a brief historical note at the bottom of each picture. It includes highligts like Solon introducing reforms, Hipparchus being assasinated, Socrates being found guilty and condemned to death and Aristotle tutoring young Alexander. It also includes more general topics like weddings and funerals, the market, shipping and more. There is some male nudity (not frontal) like at the Gymnasium and Olympics. There is some incorporation of Greek mythology (like sculpting of a statue of Hermes, and consulting an oracle at Delphi.) Note, however, the art is not done in Ancient Greek style, but rather more realistic, scene by scene.This is good for any grade schooler or even a high schooler who still likes to color. The covers and inside covers have art which are the colored scenes of ones found in the book, so there is also some direction or incentive to make the art come to life.Useful alone or with a curriculum."},{"Title":"Life in Ancient Greece Coloring Book","review":"As coloring books go, this belongs in my most favored group. I like this particular series of coloring books as they are not only entertaining, but quite informative at the same time. There are over 40 full page drawings in this particular work, all are quite detailed and as far as I can tell, quite accurate.Each picture is accompanied by at least one rather lengthy paragraph explaining the picture and how it relates to life in ancient Greece.There are a couple of things to be noted about this, and indeed, other of the books in this series.First, I would strongly recommend the use of colored pencils rather than crayons. The pictures are just too detailed and parts of the pictures are simply too small to be used with crayons. A sharp colored pencil is needed to render the drawings completely effective.Secondly, the paragraphs of explanation accompanying each picture are done in a very small font and the information is quite detailed. The younger child most likely will not have the vocabulary nor reading skill to get much out of the information. An adult will be needed to read this information and possibly paraphrase.Third, there is some mild nudity found in this book. This nudity is not as blatant as that found inLife in Ancient Egypt Coloring Book (Dover History Coloring Book)as there is no frontal nudity and bare breasts, but nudity is never-the-less there. It is manifested in this work as the author shows nude wresting and other sporting events. There is no frontal nudity and the picture is quite historically accurate. These pictures are easy to alter after scanning them if the adult so wishes. I personally had no problems with it but can well see how some parents might and most certainly teachers dealing with a large class.Forth, this book is ideal for working with kids who have problems with fine motor skills. (That is what I use it for). Even though the kids I work with have little or no concept of this time era (They cannot read), they never the less enjoy it because they have seen such of T.V. and at the movies and can relate via those movies. I discuss each scene with them - some of the information sticks; other does not.Fifth, the pictures in this book may be reproduce for graphic and craft applications, free and without special permission, provided you include no more than four in the same publication or project. This works out quite fine in my case as I only work with one to three children at a time. This book would be ideal for home schooling. The pages are easy to reproduce and you can get a lot of mileage out of this book.Sixth, if you are a overgrown child like I am, then you, the adult, will find that coloring from this book is actually quite therapeutic.Highly recommend this particular work and the others in this series from Dover Press.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Life in Ancient Greece Coloring Book","review":"This coloring book is a great resource if your kids are studying ancient Greece.

Said this it is safe to say that this is not so much a book on Tibet. Rather on hotel stories. If you are interested in it, read it, if you want to read a book about Tibet, consider what the author says on the last page: \\" I have not set out to describe the political or religious scene during my time in Tibet. There are many people with greater knowledge of this and there are countless books on this subject. My aim has been to provide you with an insight into life at the unlikeliest Holiday Inn in the world\\". Who cares, I would have commented.But this is the proper drama, because whenever the author writes about \\"political\\" or \\"religious\\" scenes or folklore, he is really good in that. The same goes for his humour. It is a pity that in these 5 years he had not more to tell.He is a sound observer who has all his wits together. He is not another advertiser for \\"Free-Tibet-\\". He is able to keep to a critical objectiveness, for example when he writes, that the Chinese do not so much care about economics than politics. That is why boycotts of China do not work. They only hurt the people, having no effect on the Chinese government. And he also criticizes that \\"Westerners\\" do not understand it.He expresses his pensiveness also when he says that the \\"god old Tibet\\" searched by romantic Westerners was little different from medieval Europe, with absolute power in the hands of a few who were guided solely by their own personal interests. Government jobs were bought and sold, human rights were nonexistent and mass exploitations were the order of the day. Traditionalists will be pleased to know that some of these old habits like stabbing opponents or decapitate unwanted rivals are still existent in present day Tibet.The Chinese tried also to end these cultural old fashions. In these days when it is apparent that the Tibetans were not won by Communism, the Capitalism tries to do it better. And there are signs that they succeed. And the author has something important to say about this: \\"It is the Tibetans themselves who are making the change.\\"This is the course of life everywhere. Tourists who visit Tibet bring with them a contribution to destroy what they find there."},{"Title":"Running a Hotel on the Roof of the World (Isis Large Print Nonfiction)","review":"Loved the book Alec writes great; could not put the book down have red it two times in the last two years always I sell my books but I am not able to sale this one.Dear Alec when are you coming out with your next book?"},{"Title":"Running a Hotel on the Roof of the World (Isis Large Print Nonfiction)","review":"I was a bit apprehensive about buying this book, not thinking a book about a hotel in Lhasa really makes good reading. ...I have to say that this book is hilarious.

From the rains of dead flies at a banquet to the bizarre Miss Tibet contest in the hotel swimming pool, back to the dead guest who nobody seems to be able to get rid of, and encountering various smells, accidents and infestations on the way, Le Sueur emerges as a Basil Fawlty for the 1990's, tackling each catastrophe with crossed fingers and invention in equal measures. It's genuinely hilarious, and more so because it isn't the product of a comedy writer's brain, but an account of real, if at times surreal, events.Le Sueur is a very likeable protagonist who not only brings us the humour found in trying to run a top class hotel in a communist coutry cut off from the rest of the world, but also explores the effects of China's rule on Tibet and its people. What prevents the politics of the book becoming staid and stuffy is Le Sueur's naive angle - he sees the Tibetan situation in the same way that any other ordinary person might, with a mixture of fascination and outrage. It's clear he has a great deal of love and respect for Tibetans, and writes in a highly acerbic tone about their relationship with the Chinese. But at the same time, he is not afraid to show his downright frustration with both the Tibetan and Chinese staff in the hotel who it seems, will never understand the basic principles of customer service, or even hygiene.It's a nice balance, and the book works on both the levels Le Sueur is obviously trying to explore. The humour is so abundant it's ticklish, the anecdotes are so interesting, you won't want to put the book down; in short, &quot;Running A Hotel&quot; is a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Running a Hotel on the Roof of the World (Isis Large Print Nonfiction)","review":"I loved this book and have read it over and over.

Still, we learnt a lot about the country by reading between the lines. I have read countless of books about Tibet &amp; China &amp; most of them were about how the authors survived their ordeal. Cliche\`. Here, we also read about the author's ordeal but of a different kind. We were brought behind the scene of an international hotel &amp; I'm adamant that most hotel operators haven't removed 200+ dead rats from their hotels before, rode in their hotel vehicle which were devoid of suspensions &amp; driven in break neck speed by their driver who hardly spoke any English, etc. There's so much to be written but it's better to let the prospective readers discover for themselves what a wee gem this book is.

Readers will laugh out loud reading about the Miss Tibet competition sponsored by the hotel under the direction of its moody Italian General Manager, as well as the difficulties engendered by having a 'shadow' Chinese management team attempting to run things along with the team hired by Holiday Inn.

This book is sure delight those planning a trip to Lhasa or those who have already been."},{"Title":"Running a Hotel on the Roof of the World (Isis Large Print Nonfiction)","review":"In 1988, the twenty-five year-old Brit, Alec Le Sueur, arrived in Hong Kong determined to continue his career in high-end hotel management by securing a position in a poncy hotel in the Orient where, as popular legend had it at the time, the best establishments are located, e.g. the Hong Kong Peninsula Hotel. What he got - almost by accident - was a gig as manager of the Sales Department at the Holiday Inn in Lhasa, Tibet, a place in the middle of nowhere - unless you're Tibetan - otherwise known as The Roof of the World.Alec renewed his employment contract with Holiday Inn several times such that he spent five years in Lhasa. One must assume that, for at least part of that time, his work was uneventful. But you wouldn't know that from reading RUNNING A HOTEL ON THE ROOF OF THE WORLD, which is a litany of tales narrated in a manner that begs the rhetorical question: Jeez, can you believe this, or what? Since none of this is presumably made-up, the reader can be thankful that he's only on his way to, say, Cleveland - as I am as I peck this out - and not flying the Chinese state airline, CAAC, to the Roof of the World. (Well, perhaps CAAC's in-flight food service, however dodgy, is marginally better than what most U.S. carriers now offer; at least it's included with the price of the ticket.)All of Le Sueur's experiences are told against the background of the political relationship between China and Tibet, where the former is the Communist Big Brother lending their unfortunate Tibetan comrades a helping hand to achieve the nirvana of a socialist workers state whether the latter likes it or not. And the Tibetans appreciate it, I'm sure, though that doesn't prevent the locals from periodically torching the Lhasa police station.The internal operational structure of the Lhasa HI apparently reflects management at its most inefficient: each member of the expatriate executive team is paired with a Chinese Communist Party counterpart and all operational decisions must be approved during a joint meeting of both sides. This stricture, along with the vagaries of a long supply line and linguistic misunderstandings can lead, as Alec so succinctly describes, to absurd situations. Then, there are the live snakes in barrels delivered to fill a commissary's seafood order, the massive room over-bookings, the shut-off of the heating system in the middle of winter, the problem presented by the dead tourist, an infestation of rats, and the massive logistical barriers surrounding the printing of a simple promotional brochure. And who could forget the \\"Miss Tibet fiasco\\"? All of Le Sueur's recollections make the prospect of managing a HI establishment elsewhere seem idyllic. Even Cleveland, perhaps.The book includes that rarity among travel essays - a section of photographs, and in COLOR no less. However, the selection of images seems to have been haphazard as there's only one (exterior) shot of the hotel itself - odd in a volume focused on the running of the place. There are no snaps of any of the other managers who play prominent roles in Alec's dark comedy or of the love interest he met while in-country; perhaps he couldn't obtain signed releases.The author's narrative style is matter-of-fact, and there's not much of a hint that Alec took things lightly until it became a matter of retrospect. If Le Sueur has that famous dry British wit, it wasn't much in evidence. The humor in the piece is provided by the reader's mind's eye. This is good enough to earn four stars, however."},{"Title":"Running a Hotel on the Roof of the World (Isis Large Print Nonfiction)","review":"Although not a side-splitting, Fawlty Towers type of romp, \\"Running A Hotel . . .\\" is nonetheless a funny and yet informational book and I'm glad I finally had the chance to read it. M. LeSeuer deftly and often humorously exposes and enlightens the reader to some of the mystery that is Tibet. He also treats the political and cultural climates of that time very ably, with a keen awareness of the delicate balances needed to maintain the working and social environments harmonious during trying times. I learned a great deal about Tibet from this book and recommend it highly. Even though it was published about 10 years ago, the writing and the narrative detail remain fresh and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Complete Tales of Blackberry Farm","review":"We saw these stories (in small vintage books) at a friends house recently.

All the animals Ernest Owl, Joe Robin, Mr and Mrs Nibble and their young bunnies Rosey, Posey and Christopher, Walter Duck, Little Martha the lamb and more are so sweet.

The right of habeas corpus is Neely's main concern, but trials by military commissons and international law are covered among other topics.If you're not a Civil War buff, this book may seem pretty dry. For example, a lot of space is devoted to evaluating the various claims of how many military prisoners there were. While this is important historical data, it made my eyes glaze over and prompted me to skim several sections of the book.Given the post-9/11 discussions of military tribunals and other curtailments of the Bill of Rights, this book is more relevant than ever."},{"Title":"The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties","review":"This book gives an excellent look into the policies of the Lincoln administration and the effects of these policies on civil liberties in the United States. A common misconception regarding this subject is that the majority of those arrested as a result of the suspension of habeas corpus were political enemies of Lincoln. This book, however, demonstrates how many of the arrests were not based upon politics, but upon how the crimes committed affected the war effort. Most attention in the past has focused on a few famous cases such as Clement Vallandingham, but this book shows that this case was an exception to the rule.A must-read for anyone interested in the Civil War or Abraham Lincoln. Neely also writes in a clear prose that clearly explains his points and allows the reader to understand what he is talking about even without having an extensive knowledge of Lincoln or the Civil War."},{"Title":"The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties","review":"\\"The Fate of Liberty\\" involves an aspect of the Civil War rarely addressed, that of the state of civil liberties. The turmoil existing in Border and Northern states led President Lincoln and many military commanders to suspend normal legal procedures through the imposition of martial law and suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, the procedure under which prisoners have the right to compel their wardens to prove a legal basis for the incarceration. The unprecedented circumstances forced men to do what they would not otherwise do. Did it make sense to protect the right to free speech of the encouragers of draft resistance while the soldiers faced enemy shot? Must a saboteur roam free until he does his damage? Were mere political enemies locked up to stifle opposition? What was the status of slaves and who could decide their use and ownership and when? These are among the questions author Mark Neely raises and attempts to answer.This book is researched in great detail. Recitations of incidents and tabulations of numbers of arrests, convictions, and denials of rights are mindboggling. As much as the detail amazes the reader, it becomes a bit boring. A reader who is really interested in civil liberties under Union jurisdiction will find this book to be fascinating. For the traditional Civil War buff it is likely to be overly detailed."},{"Title":"The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties","review":"Mark E. Neely, Jr. is a historian who was director of The Lincoln Museum in Indiana for twenty years, and is currently Professor of Civil War History at Pennsylvania State University; this book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1992. He wrote in the Introduction to this 1991 book, \\"Rather than continue the fruitless debate over the constitutionality of Lincoln's acts, this book will examine instead the practical impact on civil liberties of the policies Lincoln developed to save the Union... Without ignoring what Lincoln and other major political protagonists of the day said, this book will focus on what they in fact did.\\"He argues that \\"Lincoln did not question (General) Fremont's imposition of martial law. He did not object in principle to the execution of civilian prisoners by the military in a loyal state; he insisted only on his prerogative to review the cases first.\\" (Pg. 34-35) He admits, \\"Missouri proved from start to finish to be a sorry blemish on the administration's record. It became a nightmare for American civil liberties. What a different story this book would tell if Missouri and its thousands of political prisoners could be left out.\\" (Pg. 52)He observes, \\"one can see the way conscription worked to make war harder on noncombatants. Many Americans would not have chosen any action, for or against the Union, had it not been for the threat of enrollment and eventual conscription.\\" (Pg. 170)He contends, \\"Lincoln was not searching so much for order and community as for usable arguments and instruments. That is not to say that his constitutional thinking was nakedly opportunistic or embarrassingly shallow, but only that he changed his mind from time to time and that he did not characteristically reach first for a copy of the U.S. Constitution when confronted with a political or social problem.\\" (Pg. 215)He says, \\"Lincoln did worry more about the consequences of emancipation than the consequences of suspending the writ of habeas corpus---and for good reason. Lincoln regarded the suspension of the writ as an exception for a temporary emergency, and he felt sure that the American people would never want to continue the condition when the emergency was over... About this, Lincoln proved essentiallly correct.\\" (Pg. 221)This book is a very provocative, and thought-provoking one, and will be of great interest to students of American history, Civil War history, Lincoln, of civil liberties."},{"Title":"The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties","review":"I gobbled up this book, but then, it falls right into my current research topic. Others who found it dull have a point if they are not into this era or the topic, but I loved reading it. I might have given it 4 1/2 stars because occasionally Neely's liberal side sneaks through, as when he deemed the military draft of 1862 an odious event. That's a personal value judgment, not a fact. That it was PERCEIVED by many Northerners as odious, is a fact. But that is a tiny, tiny flaw, and the book is definitely deserving of the Pulitzer it received. (And I suspect those occasional liberal slips were vital to winning the Pulitzer.) Neely's marvelous academic study contradicts with extensively researched facts (the man read 137 rolls of microfilm searching for arrest records) the rantings of the Lincoln-was-a-despot Libertarians such as Thomas DiLorenzo. Not light reading but highly recommended for scholars."},{"Title":"The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties","review":"It was a tough decision whether to give this book two stars or three stars (if I could do 2.5 I probably would). This book goes into great detail about exactly when and how Abraham Lincoln violated civil liberties (suspension of habeas corpus, arrests, suppression of speech, etc.). The facts themselves are interesting but it is a very dry read. The author basically seems to conclude that Lincoln only violated civil liberties when he had to and hey, there was a war going on so it was ok. In that regard, I couldn't disagree more. Unfortunately, I believe Lincoln set some bad precedents that are still reverberating today.If you are interested in the historical minutiae of this topic then this is a pretty good book.

One of these is Washington Irving's account of the fur trading enterprise tha t John Jacob Astor established at the mouth of the Columbia River which is now known as Astoria Oregon.I really expected this fairly long book to be a somewhat dry account of a frontier business enterprise, but it turned out to be anything but that!Even though Irving was not along on their encounters with foreign competitors and both hostile and friendly Indians, he really brought thestory to life. The adventures of these hardy souls have probably supplied Hollywood scriptwriters with thousands of ideas that made their way into the hundreds of Western and Frontier tales that have rolled out of tinseltown in the last 100 years. If you didn't know this was written in the mid 1800's you would think Irving had plagiarized more modern writers!Being familiar only with Washington Irving's iconic works of fiction I was skeptical that he could write in this format. He hits it out of the park.It's a fascinating read and I highly recommend it.

Frisch piles intimate, mundane details into a metaphor for the human condition and allows the reader to draw the larger inferences. An isolated alpine cottage becomes all the world we need. The need to understand our world is balanced by the depressing realization that we know less every day as we age. As Herr's options close in, we realize what Frisch has brought us to..Man in the Holocene. Fifteen years after reading this book, it is still the first I recommend to a new acquaintance. You'll think of it every time you mislay your car keys. Absolutely important and finely crafted. A must read."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"Max Frisch's simplistic and yet very intimate portrayal of an aged Swiss man, living alone, trying to occupy his thoughts, and facing the inevitable. The story is very psychological, reflecting the character Geiser's thoughts, which are sometimes strategic and at other times self-delusional. Frisch stands with Salinger, Garcia-Marquez, and Satre among this century's greatest writers."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"This novella is a neglected masterpiece of 20th century literature. As a study of modern anxiety & alienation, it belongs on a shelf with Sartre's \\"Nausea\\" and Camus' \\"The Stranger.\\" The form is completely original: the narrative of a 73 year-old man's mental and physical collapse is told in fragments of memory and thought, some only a few words long. Taken together, these fragments, completely controlled and deadpan, approach the beauty of prose poetry. One or two of the fragments have the harrowing power of Kafka's aphorisms--than which there is no higher praise. Shame on HBJ for letting this jewel of modern European literature go out of print. And kudos to Dalkey Archive Press for rescuing it."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"My experience is much like that of the other reviewers here.

Storytelling is rarely this detached and psychologically harrowing. The reader is stationed cleverly among the malaise and squarely in the sights of the dual reapers: misappropriation & death."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"Herr Geiser lives alone in a small mountain valley in Ticino, the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. A widower in his seventies, he has trouble with his memory, often forgetting why he chose to go to another room the moment he reaches it. But he is resourceful, unscrewing a banister rail, for example, to get a pole long enough to knock down cobwebs from the ceiling, and keeping a rucksack meticulously packed in case of emergencies. He clips articles from papers or writes little notes to himself and sticks them all over his walls to remember things: Bible verses, the history of Ticino, how to draw the golden section, weather statistics, drawings of dinosaur skeletons, the times of trains he may never take, and lists of geological eras from the Precambrian to the present, the Holocene.These scraps form a large part of Max Frisch's 1979 novella, which is entirely composed of short paragraphs and even shorter sentences. Geiser's mind travels widely but never stays on one subject for long. He describes the house and its surroundings with extraordinary accumulation of detail; he classifies sixteen different types of mountain thunder by their sounds; he thinks about his late wife; he tries to recall the names of his three daughters. The book opens in torrential rain; the valley is cut off by a landslide near the pass; Geiser is isolated in his house without electricity. But he manages. Much later, he decides to walk over into the next valley, taking precipitous paths in constant danger of being washed away. He almost makes it too, but halfway down the other side, he decides to turn back. This non-event, the only real-time happening of any magnitude in the entire book, is followed by the longest and most sustained memory, an account of a long-ago climb of the Matterhorn with his brother as a young man, bringing them both into extreme danger on the descent.I came upon this book following up a reference in Thomas Pletzinger's recentFUNERAL FOR A DOG, set in much the same region, which also uses fragments and the accumulation of objective detail to explore a subjective mind-state. An even closer comparison is to the German writer W. G. Sebald (e.g.VERTIGO), though Frisch mostly uses scraps of printed text in place of Sebald's pictures. While Frisch's Geiser describes the outside world with accuracy and is aware, for example, of the white trails of passenger planes lacing the sky above the valley on its rare cloudless days, he is not at all concerned with Sebald's larger themes of history and national identity. Geiser knows only two kinds of time: one in which it can take an apparent lifetime for the clock to advance two minutes, and another in which millennia follow millennia in the infolding of layers of rock. Geological time, with man a mere speck at the end of it. Yet a sentient speck, isolated but still master of his destiny. I am astounded that a book built with such objectivity (we never even hear Herr Geiser's first name) should end up so personal and sympathetic. It may be the most moving picture of old age that I know."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"I read this book first as a teen-ager when it appeared in The New Yorker. I kept intending to put it down, it was so strange (especially for a teen-ager), but it was so compelling that I read every word. It has stuck with me ever since -- not as a conscious memory but more as a spiritual one (ick -- sorry -- I usually hate stuff like that, but there it is). What I mean is that it changed my view of the world, making me realize the individual's small place in it, which can be a very comforting realization anytime things go all topsy turvy in your life. Now I am re-reading it at 46 and enjoying it even more; in fact, I am going to give it to my father who is terminally ill. Frisch's book Homo Faber is much different -- a tragic fable with lots or mythic references -- but also excellent. What a writer he was!"},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"I read Man in the Holocene as part of a university paper in European literature quite a few years ago and really enjoyed it. It didn't hurt that I had recently moved to Switzerland, where the book is based, and was able to picture the valley that the book describes.The novel follows the meandering thoughts of an older man who is losing his mind. As he describes the flood in the valley in which he lives and how he can't get out, he also sticks notes and newspaper clippings all over his walls.The book is paralleling the flood in the valley, his sticking memories on walls, with him losing his memory and going senile. The illustration of this is done quite well but may not be to everyone's tastes."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"This odd little book is essentially the interior monologue--though written in the third person--of an ailing old man in a rural Swiss village beset by dangerous storm. Man, as we're told somewhere along the way, appeared on Earth during the Holocene (present) era, quite late in the history of our tiny planet; the book is haunted with a sense of the infinite smallness and frality of the human race before the utterly impersonal will of nature. Personally, I could have done without all the scientific talk (much of the text is composed of geology articles that the narrator cuts out of various books), but it's still a fairly compelling read."},{"Title":"Man In The Holocene","review":"The book arrived when it was scheduled.

It was this key naval event that led to the eventual surrender of a major British Army under the command of Lord Cornwallis in Yorktown; the largest British military defeat in that war.I had the pleasure of being introduced to this gem of a history book, as it is the assigned text to the Yorktown elective at the Joint Forces Staff College, Naval Station Norfolk, VA., where Operational Art and Operational Design are heavily emphasized. An outstanding course!Decision at the Chesapeake correctly brings to light that it was the southern campaign, more so than the military events in New England, which finally produced enough setbacks for the British and led Lord Cornwallis to move his army to the Chesapeake region. This move, he anticipated, would posture him to reinforce General Clinton in New York, but in the end it led to his army's demise in the siege at Yorktown. One of the best books on the American Revolution by far! Eternally relevant!"},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Philosophy is important. &quot;What is our place in the universe?&quot; is not just a scientific question. What is the meaning of life, how can we be happy, do gods make a difference? All are good philosophical questions, not really to be left just to professional philosophers. It has taken centuries, but philosophers led us into the idea that humans have certain rights, something we take for granted now although we are not always good at ensuring every human gets the rights that are due. We can allow that human well-being is pretty much the gold standard in assessing values, and perhaps we take into account animal well-being, as well as the well-being of the Earth as a biological system. We think we can behave morally, but we have doubts that this can occur without gods of some sort. Gods or not, we sense that there is some larger meaning, and that selfishness just won't do, but selfishness seems to run a great deal of the world. It wouldn't be a bad thing if we could think about these ethical, philosophical issues with more clarity.And so professional philosopher Simon Blackburn has given us _Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics_ (Oxford University Press). He has distilled thousands of years of thinking on ethical issues by various philosophers into a slim book. It may not be a Guide for Living covering every situation, but it is an admirable introduction about how philosophers think about such matters, and where we ought to look for ethical answers. His book is witty and pithy, and demonstrates that thinking about big ideas can be fun. But we are largely on our own in this endeavor. Socrates, in Plato's _Euthyphro_, provided the classic challenge to the idea that ethics must have a religious foundation. Whatever gods there are that choose right and wrong for us cannot do so arbitrarily; they have to select such things correctly. Most gods have a system that demonstrates that we should act correctly because of fear of punishment if we don't, or desire for reward if we do. This distorts behavior into &quot;a religious cost-benefit analysis.&quot; Kant said true virtue was living up to a rule out of respect for that rule, not on post-mortem consequences. It is up to us to make judgements on what rules are worth living up to. Blackburn takes us through the pitfalls of relativism, that there is no one truth but only the different truths of different communities and times. He discusses our current obsession with rights, and even includes as an appendix the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human rights. Death, birth, desire, and pleasure all have chapters in his work, all fitting essays within the larger whole.Hume (whom Blackburn seems mostly to follow) said that rational, scientific proof of the virtue of an action is not possible. Blackburn does not despair over what others have seen as this unsafe or uncomforting doctrine. We share some values, and we can judge actions as reasonable or not by referring to those shared values. Blackburn (again with Hume) argues that the ultimate standard for judging an action is its capacity to promote happiness. He unites this with the modern philosophical ideas of contracts between humans and the state, both caring about such things as liberty and safety, in a dialogue to find common points of view. Blackburn's view is optimistic. We have made progress with sensitivity to the environment, to sexual differences, and to toleration of cultural differences. &quot;If we are careful, and mature, and imaginative, and fair, and nice, and lucky, the moral mirror in which we gaze at ourselves may not show us saints. But it need not show us monsters, either.&quot;"},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"\\"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics\\" is just that, a slim volume about the philosophy of ethics and how philosophers think about this subject. It is an introduction for people who are brave (or fooligh) enough to dare to ask \\"Why be good?\\". Far to few people it seems have bothered to ask this question or assumed there is a patent answer without ever taking that answer out into the daylight to examine it.Thinking ethically isn't done in a vacuum, it is of a process. When faced with an ethical problem, how do you seek a solution? Do you try to maximize the good for the most people? Do you try to identify universal laws and then try to follow them? Do you seek the advice of authority figures or authoritative books?The text is split into three distance parts, the first addresses what Mr. Blackburn refers to \\"threats to ethics.\\" These threats include relativism, skepticism, nihilism, challenges to free will, and altruism. Threats are largely those things which suggest that there is no real reason to be good at all; it's just something we as a people do. With each topic, he explains why they do not make ethics \\"impossible\\" after all. Mr. Blackburn explains how religion's declining influence does not harm ethical thinking, in fact he views this in a positive light in that without religion frees us to make independent choices, rather than to simply be automatons. Relativism is a more serious challenge, but when taken to its logical conclusion relativism refutes itself and removes the arguer from the conversation altogether.The second section discusses particular attitudes about ethical issues including birth, death, desire and the meaning of life, pleasure, the greatest happiness of the greatest number, freedom from the bad, freedom and paternalism, and rights and natural rights. This second section is the weakest and seems to be ill connected to the other two. This weakness is there despite the fact that the author is talking about such hot topics as abortion and euthanasia.The third section looks at the larger question of whether the idea of ethics rests on anything at all. This I believe is the topic that unsettles most people. The thinking goes that without a basis there is no reason for ethics. Mr. Blackburn shows this to not be the case. Mr. Blackburn believes people should actively engage in ethical dialogue in an effort to arrive at a common point of view for making ethical decisions. This of course means that there is no guarantee that such conversation will be successful, but at least there is a chance, and without such a dialogue, there is no chance at all.The book is demanding of its reader. It demands that one actually look at one's ethical system and see it for what it is."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Blackburn promises a short intro to ethics, and he delivers. This is perfect for someone who wants to get right to what different ethical concepts are without reading a book on each. Perfect for the person who wants to \\"see it all\\" in one slim book, then has the opportunity to investigate it more fully to his/her heart's content. Illustrations, particularly the one of the \\"Accidental Napalm Attack\\" in Vietnam, hit home with me, as I have small children."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"\\"Being Good\\" is a short, well-written overview of philosophical ethics. The author, Simon Blackburn, starts by defusing skeptical projects such as relativism and evolutionary determinism, whose truth would call into question the whole ethical enterprise. Having neutralized these threats, he proceeds to unpack some concrete issues such as birth, death and human rights. He ends by examining the \\"foundations\\" of ethics, asking where binding norms could come from and how they could impose obligations on us. Blackburn comes down (more or less) on the side of David Hume, who located our sense of right and wrong in sympathy for other people reinforced by our practical need to reason to a common point of view in order to achieve social cooperation.On the positive side, Blackburn's writing is never labored or academic, and he does a great job of linking philosophy to larger political and cultural concerns. However, his relatively informal and discursive approach makes \\"Being Good\\" a less-than-ideal textbook for beginning students. Readers looking for a primer should consult a book like James Rachels' \\"The Elements of Moral Philosophy.\\" However, \\"Being Good\\" would be a good warm up or companion for anyone tackling a classic text like Hume's \\"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.\\" (I know because I read the \\"Enquiry\\" at the same time I was reading \\"Being Good.\\")"},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Blackburn doesn't seem to make very many coherent sentences or chapters. I think that his thought process is very interesting, but the book is hard to read because of his poor writing skills, as I judge anyway.

It is for people looking for an introduction but do not want the typical fare that you find in a textbook. It is simple and to the point with just enough needed explanation.

I read it in about a week (mysteries or science fiction take two days; constitutional law books take forever), so it is not a long book, but a lot of easy to understand information is packed in it. To anyone who studies Ethics, it may be to simple, but to me, who has barely encountered the notion at all, the ease of understanding was important. There are parts that I read a couple three times to understand, and parts that just went over my head, but these parts are few and far between. For the most part, I could understand the ideas he wrote about. The sad thing was that I have come away with the idea that there is no Ethics but what we bring to it. But then, what good is a man's grasp if it cannot exceed his reach?

This is especially so when the author verges away from pure ethics and into political science, as he often does.Admittedly, the line between these fields is a bit fuzzy, particularly in the context of ultimate justifications (\\"foundations\\"). Blackburn crosses over a line that lots of very eminent thinkers have crossed before, including Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Rousseau, Mill, Nozick, and Rawls. Still, for a work of this brevity, I would have preferred a more focused account of the controversies and schools within the narrow field of ethics.I thought the section on challenges to ethics was the most interesting part of the book. There are many ways to dismiss, deride, and decompose ethics, and this is as good a short overview of these as I have seen -- with one exception. In my judgment, Nietzsche is not given his due in these pages.I recommend this to anyone who desires a brief and readable introduction to ethics, particularly to anyone who wants to segue to ethics from a political science background."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"I bought this book (along with others) to study for an upcoming DSST exam.

First of all I didn't like the fact that he is addressing the subject by starting with threats to ethics. I think including some more daily life examples would have made the book a lot more enjoyable. To hell with the theories of great philosophers of age old. I'd rather look at the problem without classifying it as falling into some particular school of thought. The peril of doing otherwise is that if your thinking on some subject, lets say 'a' [somehow] aligns with a particular school of thought then what about problem b,c and d? I'd rather have the author tell me what he thinks about it and leave it upto me to 'judge' for myself if I agree with it or not.Anyhow, the book is still readable if you are looking for a more traditional approach to the subject at hand.And the painting on the cover is refreshing.."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Not my favorite introduction to ethics; for that I'd start with Frankena's *Ethics*.

This review is based on the full reading of some chapters and skimming over the rest. Take it for what you will."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"No doubt Si Blackburn is a swell fellow to have a chat with at a Cambridge faculty tea -- if, that is, you hold all of the conventional, politically correct views expected of right-thinking university faculty. For example, early in \\"Being Good\\" (p.3), Blackburn declares that \\"Like America in the post-war McCarthy era, it [the Nazi regime] feared pollution from 'degenerates' outside or within.\\" One need not be an admirer of the late Senator from Wisconsin to recognize that comparing Nazism to McCarthyism betrays an unbelievable moral obtuseness: for all of his many faults, Senator McCarthy, after all, did not murder anyone. Furthermore, the opening of the Soviet archives and release of the U.S. \\"Venona\\" intercepts have proven conclusively that there really were a number of Soviet agents who had infiltrated the U.S. government (see, e.g., Weinstein's and Vassiliev's \\"Haunted Wood,\\" Klehr's and Haynes' \\"Venona,\\" and Romerstein's and Breindel's \\"The Venona Secrets,\\" all available on Amazon).Later in the book (p. 103), Si announces that \\"the law does not protect...speech inciting racial and other hatreds...\\" Maybe not in merrie olde England, Si, but over here in the former colonies we have a First Amendment which does indeed protect even the right, say, of crazy neo-Nazis to present their views. This remark immediately precedes an incredibly muddled discussion of \\"natural rights,\\" in which Blackburn admits (and demonstrates) a complete inability to make any coherent sense of the idea of natural rights at all. It isn't a difficult concept: you have a \\"natural right\\" to something if and only if you can naturally enjoy it absent involvement or interference from other human beings. Thus, you do not have a \\"natural right\\" to free medical care or food or housing, none of which you would possess naturally without the involvement of other human beings, but you do have a natural right not to be murdered, mugged, etc., since clearly you are free of such indignities absent involvement of other human beings. Whether \\"natural rights\\" are an adequate foundation for a political order is another question, but the concept itself is neither confusing nor difficult (for a modern exposition see Murray Rothbard's \\"The Ethics of Liberty\\").Elsewhere, Blackburn dogmatically declares, \\"'Slippery slope' reasoning needs to be resisted...everywhere.\\" \\"Slippery slope\\" reasoning is the sort of argument that claims that if we begin by depriving the Jews of basic civil rights and making them second-class citizens we risk sliding down a \\"slippery slope\\" to a point where we finally commit the atrocity of murdering millions of Jews: therefore, we must never start on the \\"slippery slope\\" in the first place. As this historical example indicates, contrary to Blackburn's blanket anathema, \\"slippery slope\\" arguments are sometimes very appropriate indeed.But does any of this matter? Isn't an ethical theorist entitled to a few silly remarks if his overarching grand theory provides a framework for the ethical life?The problem is that the central theme of Blackburn's book is that there is no such grand overarching framework. The best we can do, he argues, is muddle around, consider individual issues, and try to hammer out some sensible conclusion. This is what Si himself does in this book, and, as the previous examples demonstrate, he does it incredibly badly.Blackburn sums up his perspective in his concluding section, \\"...we need recognition in the eyes of others...From within our self-understanding, we can admit that these standards are ours--just ours.\\" In the end, ethics as Si presents it is just shoddy self-satisfaction and a sleazy bid for social recognition.The Western philosophical tradition, going back to Aristotle, took a less flippant view. It held that by acknowledging the basic biological and metaphysical fact of man's nature as a rational animal we can understand that certain moral rules, values, and virtues enable humans living in communities to exercise their rational nature in pursuit of survival and happiness.This was the starting point of ethics: what exactly are the appropriate rules, values, and virtues which show respect for rational beings? And, secondly, once we have discovered these rules, values, and virtues, what can and should induce people to adhere to these rules, pursue these values, and develop these virtues? Those questions posed the subject matter of ethics. Ethics was not a parlor game to enable over-paid, under-worked Cambridge dons to feel good about themselves; ethics was about the constraints imposed upon human life and human communities by the facts of human nature.To be sure, \\"Being Good\\" is at least readable if vapid; whereas, most twentieth-century academic philosophers were both inane and unreadable.But, in most respects, Blackburn's facile and silly little book is indeed representative of the disastrous industry of academic philosophical ethics which played its own small role in the tragedies of the twentieth century.Don't waste your time and money -- you can get equally good insights on ethics faster and cheaper from the average bartender. If you want to begin grappling with the real issues of ethics, try Alan Donagan's \\"The Theory of Morality,\\" Murray Rothbard's \\"The Ethics of Liberty,\\" John Mackie's \\"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong,\\" Ayn Rand's \\"The Virtue of Selfishness,\\" and Robert Wright's \\"The Moral Animal.\\" Those five authors differ on a host of issues, but at least they understand that ethics is not just a self-congratulatory game of feeling good about yourself and your fellow faculty members."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Blackburn blows it with this one.

Being Good did not do the job for me. I think the main problem is the writing style, which I found hard to follow. In many chapters the main point is not stated clearly clearly and concisely; there is lots of commentary which I suppose must be related to the main point, but unless you understand the main point it is hard follow and be interested in the commentary. I think another problem, for me, is that the writing style is more British than American; that's not a major problem, but with a confusing presentation to begin with it just makes it harder to understand and stay interested in the book.By the time I got to the middle of the book, I just could not tell where he was going, so I read the last chapter. The last chapter says, I think, that there is no single answer to the question of what's the right thing to do. Then I read the rest of the book with a better understanding of what the book was trying to say, and it seemed to me that it wasn't trying to say anything except commentary and critique. So in the end I did not come away with any useful conclusions for myself on being good or doing the right thing."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Interesting approach to ethics.

He shines a new light on every possibility."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Blackburn's \\"short introduction to ethics\\" is an easy-to-absorb read for the novice, allowing one to learn about the field without venturing into long, heavily-written academic treatises. However, its contents seem misguided: the three sections focus on \\"threats to ethics\\", ethical issues, and the basis of ethics, and while the second section is appealing, the first and third seem misplaced.Beginning an introduction to ethics by discussing its detractors, as Blackburn does in his opening \\"threats to ethics\\" section, seems out-of-order and defensive. Moreover, the subject matter exacerbates Blackburn's prose - wandering, disorganized, and vaguely preachy even when it lacks content.The book's second section focuses on the issues that laypeople might associate with ethics: birth, death, the idea of happiness and what it constitutes. However, Blackburn's discussions are dominated by definition and exposition(i.e. \\"why is death important to people? why are we afraid of it? what have greek/roman/medieval philosophers said about its importance?\\") and ignore the modern field of ethics entirely. There is a chapter devoted to the major schools of modern ethics, but it doesn't tie into the rest of the book (so we don't learn whether, for example, Kant thought killing another person could ever be permissible). This incompleteness leaves the reader with no idea of what modern ethicists might say about humanity's most important concerns.The book's third and final section discusses a number of attempts - both ancient and modern - to construct a universal, indisputable framework for ethics. This section is interesting but seems to miss the point: surely it would be more enjoyable and profitable to a reader who already know the basics of the field. Like the rest of \\"Being Good\\", it seems written not for the interested but uninformed audience it claims, but rather for the knowledgeable and skeptical reader who understands ethics and argues against its merit."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Speaking as someone who never formally studied ethics before reading this book (for a graduate-level course), I can say that the ideas and concepts that Blackburn present in this book are very interesting, and I learned quite a bit. It's a terrific mental exercise, and other reviews have adequately addressed the book's strengths.However, my main complaint - and it's a biggie - is that the writing style is not particularly accessible. He meanders, and at times his points venture off into disparate directions without a clear connection. Further, I don't believe the book is structured in a way that particularly facilitates the education of the \\"lay\\" reader. Ultimately, the rambling writing and counterintuitive structure lead to a presentation that really hampers Blackburn's apparent goals.When I think of a true introduction to an abstract field like ethics, I imagine a somewhat clear-cut piece of writing that takes the new reader down the ethical path starting from the ground up. This is not that. I'm no dummy, and I have a passing familiarity with Kant, Bentham, etc, and I didn't get as much out of it as I would have liked, despite my best efforts.So in sum, it's a book of some quality that nevertheless falls short as an introduction. Not the worst, but I certainly have to believe that there are better books out there for the first-time reader. Unless all ethicists write like this...?"},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of one of my professors, and this combined with a few introductory books on philosophy really helped me gain a full understanding of what ethics really is and how to gain a good grasp on it without using the classic fall back of religion."},{"Title":"Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics","review":"Had to buy this book for a class and it's complete and utter garbage.

His adeptness at investigative journalism is wonderful. Here, we see the sides of George Bush which weren't made public during the three months following the horrendous attack. Personally, I am pleased to see this side of the administration.The inside look at the meetings serves to enlighten the reader that such meetings are not taken lightly, nor is the information provided therein. Boring? To some perhaps. But the key objective is not to see what is said, but to &quot;feel&quot; it instead. As with all humans, more often than not, the most important words are the ones said not with the lips, but with the rest of the body. Bob Woodward takes the reader into these meetings and presents them in a way that doesn't necessarily allow you to feel you are there - that is for the fiction writer. Instead, he focuses on the events unfolding and how the decisions were made.All-in-all, I have to tip my hat once again at Mr. Woodward. His saavy for getting a story has not diminished, and his ability to translate the twisting jargon from inside the beltway and corridors of government into something that even laymen can understand, makes this a wonderful book which will allow the reader to really understand the decision-making process that goes on where the rest of the public never gets to see."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I am shocked by the hollowness of this effort. Here is a man who has been in the heart of the capital for eons, yet has observed nothing more than the expected comings and goings of the Washington elite? Woodward offers virtually no illuminated perspective on what is perhaps a seminal, pivotal shift in this nation's genetic destiny. We are at a crossroad. A potential soceital divide. Yet we're supposed to take away that \\"Bush is a pretty okay guy, who manages on the fly?\\" Please Mr. Woodward. People are dying in the first \\"unprovoked offensive war\\" in the history of this great country. \\"President\\" is not an \\"entry level\\" position, sir. And with all due respect to you being a responsible journalist and author - neither is yours."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Read this book with an open mind and you will discover that it offers a lot of insight into the workings of the White House after September 11th. I am no Bob Woodward fan, but he does a great job in this book of simply giving us a perspective (as opposed to his typical dirt-exposing) on the Bush presidency.Unfortunately, too many have apparently let their seething hatred for Bush to even pay attention to this book.It's a timely book to read, as well, because it directly contradicts the books of both Paul O'Neil and Richard Clarke. Bush truly was in charge and made decisions for himself, and truly was focused on Al Qaeda prior to 9/11."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This detailed account sometimes reads with the inside perspective of a Tom Clancy thriller. Famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward's \\"fly on the wall\\" story relies on detailed accounts from excellent sources who were in the room when key decisions were made. This exposition lives up to his reputation, and even promotes it to another level - if there is one. He takes us inside the White House bunker, Camp David and the halls of political power. Sometimes you'll think you're reading yesterday's headlines, but the story is more interesting when Woodward tells it. His narrative line is strong and you never feel that he is pandering to an action-film audience. This volume's most important contribution is its colorful portrayal of the key decision makers and its insight into how things really worked in Washington at the nation's most critical moment. We highly recommends this book to anyone yearning for a deeper insight about the World Trade Center attacks and their continuing aftermath."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War is an insightful overview of the Bush administration's initial prosecution of war against Afghanistan-based Islamic terrorists who attacked the United States on 9-11-2001. It focuses on how the most senior government officials (President, VP, Powell, Rumsfeld, Rice, Tenent, etc.) worked as a team during the last three months of 2001 to prioritize, formulate and conduct the successful military campaign to disrupt Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda stronghold. Controversial U.S. domestic responses (indefinite detention of suspects, the unsolved anthrax attacks, airline security efforts, etc.) are barely mentioned.Even though the events covered in Bush at War occurred barely one year ago, we lose track of perspective in our \\"news\\"-saturated culture. It's amazing to recall how much happened, and has already been mostly forgotten, in such a short time.The most informative part of the book is the process by which senior government officials cooperatively (more so the initial months than, according to media reports, subsequently) addressed an unanticipated event. The most surprising part is how truly unanticipated the attack was and how unprepared for response the U.S. military was. Former Clinton administration officials, from Clinton himself on down, assert they were actively engaged in pursuit of bin Laden/al Qaeda subsequent to the Nairobi and USS Cole attacks. Yet as of 9-11 the Central Command apparently had ABSOLUTELY NO contingency plans for attacking al Qaeda strongholds in Afghanistan other than more wimpy Clintonesque Tomahawk missile strikes on empty training camps (which President Bush wisely refused to do). Some American forces were ready to go against al Qaeda strongholds in just a few days but the vaunted defense planners had no contingency arrangements for temporary air bases in the region; this turned out to be the primary delay in mounting a military response. Also surprising, in light of more recent events, is the President's initial insistence, despite pressure from certain officials, on not getting sidetracked by Iraq (so much so that he cancelled a previously approved strike against Iraqi missile sites that had fired on U.S. aircraft in order to avoid the impression Iraq was being attacked in response to 9-11).Bush at War is based on extensive interviews with the principals and access to contemporaneous notes of then-secret meetings. Famed Washington Post investigative reporter Woodward is not known for being soft on government officials. Therefore, the highly positive picture of the President's and senior officials' performance in the initial weeks of the United States' escalated conflict with militant Islam is reassuring. Despite some media portrayals, President Bush comes across as a very competent leader.I recommend this book as a starting point for more detailed reading on what has, and has not, been accomplished in the non-Islamic world's response to the militant Islamic forces that seek to destroy or contain non-Islamic institutions through out the world."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward says he interviewed over 100 people for this book. But it reads as if the narrative is constructed solely from the minutes of various National Security Council meetings he obtained. That is no mean feat. But this book is not about &quot;Bush AT War&quot;: it is about George Bush getting READY for war -- in disjointed councils during which only Colin Powell, Condelezza Rice, and George Tenet ever offered the President any substantive advice. Moreover, Woodward barely mentions the feats of the Air Force Special Tactics men and teams from the 5th Special Forces Group which really liberated Afghanistan in only 90 days -- ten months before Woodward finished his book."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Because Woodward's book is based solely on what the President and his subordinates wanted him to know, it probably isn't a completely accurate description of the Afghanistan war. (PS The book primarily is about Afghanistan, NOT about Iraq).But at least it is a description of how the Administration insiders want us to perceive the Afghanistan war, and is slightly more candid than the information fed to the media in 2001. Because these insiders all worked for President Bush at the time the book was written (and thus had a strong incentive to praise Bush) Bush of course comes across very well.But even so, a few unpleasant truths come out: that before 9/11, terrorism was a low priority of both the Bush and Clinton Administrations, Paul Wolfowitz's obsession with making war in Iraq (which he proposed right after 9/11), Colin Powell's focus on gaining the support of allies rather than on the pros and cons of war itself.And this book reveals one other problem that is perhaps related to America's inability to capture or kill bin Laden: some parts of this book (though not others) suggest that the Administration may have been a bit wishy-washy about whether to mount a general attack on \\"terrorism\\" or to focus on the people who actually attacked the United States. For example, Rumsfeld is quoted as asserting: \\"We can't let Syria help us with al Qaida and then us feel constrained about pursuing them with respect to their support for other terrorists.\\" (p. 221). A more analytical book would have asked: what \\"other terrorists\\" was Rumsfeld referring to? Did the Administration's interest in \\"other terrorists\\" divert resources from bin Laden, or did the Administration quickly become more focused? Perhaps later books will answer these questions."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"A great book by Woodward on the in fighting that occurred within the white house as to how to respond to the 9/11 attack.Cheney and Wolfowitz wanted to attack Iraq.The rest wanted to go after bin laden, who all knew was responsible for the attack.CIA teams were inserted by Sept 26. Teams were already working in there with the Northern Alliance.SF teams could not be brought in until air bases were obtained in Uzebestan. The first Special Forces team did not arrive in country until Nov 6. In 53 days, the CIA, about 100 people, and Special Forces teams, about 316 people, eliminated the Taliban from Afghanistan. In spite of that, newspapers were calling the battle a quagmire.When shown the plan for use of CIA and Special Forces teams working together with Navy air and the Air Force, only Bush thought it would work. Facinating story."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The book by journalist Bob Woodward; who, along with Carl Bernstein, helped to cover the Watergate era, turns his attention to the current &quot;President&quot; and his motivations for war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The book does a fairly good job of describing the beginnings of the new administration, the reaction of key figures to 9-11, and the events that followed. It also gives a first look at the &quot;mind&quot; (collectively speaking) of the Administration, as what their response would be to Osama Bin Laden, the efforts to find him, the discussions, arguments and debates; within and among the different members, including Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Vice-President Cheney, and Secretary Rumsfeld. As Woodward points out, the latter two, along with Bush himself, were &quot;beyond 'hell-bent'&quot; to get Saddam Hussein out of power; even if it meant using 9-11; Afghanistan; Bin Laden, etc., as pretexts to invading Iraq (as I read it). It paints a more sympathetic image of Bush as a leader, following America's worst tragedy, that I didn't agree with (because of my political persuasion); which is not necessarily &quot;pro-Bush&quot;. That aside, the Epilogue and Afterword help to put the book in context with current events. Presumably, his new book will be a little more critical of the Administration; in particular, of Bush. We shall see. I look forward to reading/buying it, at some point. I'd also recommend readers getting their hands on the Gulf War and Iraqi War &quot;Readers&quot;; which I have (both), to get a further understanding of the reason why this nation (i.e., the United States) finds itself in the current situation. The questions posed by the book are more than the &quot;answers&quot; it gives. In a larger context, one might ask: &quot;Did Bush and company do the right thing-in Afghanistan, and ultimately, in Iraq? Time will tell and history will judge. Meanwhile, the book provides some insights into the &quot;thinking&quot; of the men, and woman (Rice) who are running our government and seeking to remain in office. God Bless America."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward offers up a few insights into the White House decision-making processes in the wake of September 11. He offers a surprisingly complimentary view of President Bush, sketching him as decisive, even if not always sure what he is being decisive about. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld is depicted as screechy and infantile -- territorial to a fault (once churlishly refusing to offer Air Force One a military escort until a few minutes before takeoff). NSA Condi Rice is conciliatory --personally the closest to Bush, but this book suggests that she probably deserves some of the criticisms she receives in the press for being unable to control a cabinet full of loose cannons and huge egos. Secretary of State Colin Powell takes his lumps from Bush and the rest of the cabinet. His moderation and diplomatic skills are viewed with suspicion by Bush as well as war-hawks Cheney and Rumsfeld, and they often drop leaks to the press and work behind his back to undermine and embarrass him.Woodward got good access to people and documents, and the fact that Bush gave him lengthy and private interviews probably accounts for the book's kid-glove treatment of the president. That was likely Bush's strategy in giving the interviews: co-opt Woodward into saying nice things. The book does provide some useful chronological accounting, from the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US to the December 7 final victory in Afghanistan. There are details of conversations and White House meetings among the administration principals as the anti-Taliban and Osama strategy took shape and played out. There is also some 'epilogue' material on the rush to war in Iraq that emphasizes the precarious position of Powell in the policy-making process. A good book, interesting without being groundbreaking."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Author Bob Woodward has succeeded in letting President George Bush and his cabinet tell their story of the 9-11 attacks on the United States and the decision to go to war in Afghanistan. I was surprised with the amount of information Bush and his cabinet willingly provided to Woodward, making this book stunning in its level of detail and insight on every aspect of the war.James Naughton, who reads the book, does great job and is at his best when reading the portions of the book attributed to Bush."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Maybe one of the other reviewers put it clearer in stating that the book felt incomplete. I was hoping for a more in depth type of investigation like his Watergate book. A lot of what he reported we already knew just from watching the news. We did get a look at how the key figures interacted with each other and their different personalities. If the people he interviewed were mainly those of the Bush 'Camp' then it's basically a one-sided viewpoint because they aren't going to give any incriminating or negative comments that would hurt their position. So what I'm saying, I guess, is that it would have been a better book if hadn't been quite as biased. It was an easily read book because he did a good job of writing so that the average person could understand it. I'd liked to have had more information on why they attacked, how come it was so easily accomplished, what had they done to prevent something like this from happening as there had already been an attempt previously, etc."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward uses his first rate access to poor effect. The book is disorganized, lacks perspective and is bereft of any level of analysis.Woodward's ability to get senior people to talk is unparalleled. It is a pity that he makes no effort to dig beyond what his contacts tell him. Worse, Woodward doesn't bother to add any historical or geopolitical context to the actions he describes. The author's tendency to describe the thoughts and feelings of the participants as though he was a mind reader is suspect at best - and should be left out of any serious work of non-fiction."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"In his latest book, BUSH AT WAR, Woodward displays his classic liberal bias towards Bush. Woodward casts him unfairly as a bit of a bumpkin. Also, there is his laughable characterization of Rumseld and Wolfowitz as reactionary and almost malevolent figures trying to influence Bush. Yet, somehow Woodward is able to treat superficially and without comment Clinton's contributions to the whole 9-11 mess and the aftermath. Finally, Woodward demonstrates remarkable ESP powers by describing what various people are actually thinking, even when their words suggest something different.I can't recommend this book as an objective or insightful anaysis of Bus at War."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I work for a book summary company. One of the books selected for summary is this book.When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high. But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident. By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved. We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions. We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban. Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it. A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post. In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth. This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"&quot;In 20 years, George W. Bush may be considered one of our greatest Presidents,&quot; author Bob Woodward told a book-signing audience in Thousand Oaks, California in May of 2004. The remarks were mentioned on several national talk shows. Woodward spells out in &quot;Bush at War&quot; why this is his opinion. Woodward is thought of as a liberal because of his Watergate background, but in reality he is a former Naval officer and Republican. For this reason, he is considered balanced and is respected. He had great access to Bush and like the embedded reporters who saw up close what great work the military actually did, Woodward reports that Bush was on top of his game. His remarks in Thousand Oaks reflect the view of many that, like Ronald Reagan's victory over Communism which was criticized at the time, Bush will achieve his lofty goals that take time to flower.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book shows that rather than being a weak leader, that he is made of the same stuff as were other great presidents such as Jonh F.

Here's the story of the century, a true-life Tom Clancy novel, but I'm left wishing that someone with more talent than Bob Woodward had been anointed to tell it. I agree with the readers who complain that he managed to make the story boring. The book lacks a clear dramatic structure and is riddled with grammatical errors. It comes across as a quick, opportunistic hack job. If Bob Woodward is a born storyteller, the Muse must have left him sometime after Watergate.But still, the book is worth a read, whatever your political persuasion. It certainly answers the major question I had. Is Bush really calling the shots? Apparently so, according to Woodward. But is he a wise and knowledgeable leader? This is a subject for debate, and the exercise is more interesting if we've read what Woodward has to say. Because Woodward was granted ninety minutes of interviews with Bush, which he wove into semi-fictionalized dialog, the book also provides a wealth of material for linguistic and psychological exegesis. The endless quotes that take the form of short, declarative sentences and assert things like \\"This is what a president does. He considers all the evidence.\\" are entirely believable; the ones containing the word \\"angst\\" are not.

No doubt the lines attributed by Mr Woodward to his principle characters bare some relation to a few tape recorded interviews with the Bush administration, infact some my be lifted in full. But to take this as a historical account would be ridiculous, it's a comic book account of events, and a pretty good comic it makes too.POW! THWACK! BANG! goes the war, no blood, no reflection, and no reality, it's Top Gun for kids. Rumsfeld providing light relief in the role of the grouchy but good grandad figure will have you laughing out loud as he huffs and puffs when pressed to let the French be involved in his saber rattling. And as for Bush himself, well you'll be falling over yourself when you hear his Buck Rogers style declarations, &quot;I'm not a textbook player, I'm a gut player&quot; he postulates, and indeed he his, and besides, those textbooks can take a frustratingly long time to read.Bush at war will appeal to anybody who likes there history, clean, fun, and bereft of content, or find victors history important to understand for it's own sake.To say it's unbiased is a bit like saying the New testament is a secular chronicle of events, the book reads like a State of the Union address.I await &quot;Bush at War 2&quot; in order to see how Woodwards vacuous prose will again attempt to put a shiny gloss on this administrations undiplomatic efforts to turn the world into America's surplus absorber."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I've read a few of Woodward's books and have enjoyed them very much (I've read his Hollywood book, WIRED, several times). His beat is mainly Washington and, given the politics of most of the Washington press, I was curious as to how he would treat George W. Bush.Up until Sept. 11th, the press was constantly painting Bush as a frat-boy dolt who rolled into the White House on money and his family name (it's starting to creep back into the coverage again--just tune into CNN or Donahue).But Woodward does an excellent job of examining the president's character and style. George W has become a leader and a president to be admired. He pushes for results, has a wide grasp of the bigger picture while focusing on the task at hand.How refreshing to see someone at the wheel who doesn't consult a poll every five mintues to see what he should do or believe.The candid, inside thoughts of all the principals make for interesting reading, especially since anyone can remember the public moments of the book.

What I hope to read in the remaining Chapters is information I and the public have not been commonly privy to.

I've read 104 pages of redundancy and am critically debating on suffering through another 300 pages. I must say though, the actual book itself, is aestheticly pleasing. I guess that is why they say not to judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose. I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, \\"Bush at War Part 2: Denial\\", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.Skip this one, it is no longer relevant. The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Pretty sure this was a 'Hey Bob, doesn't your contract say you owe us a book this month?' book. I'm going to put it down to contractual obligation because I'd hate to think someone with Woodward's reputation has started to grind out titles for checks.The Commanders was a better read, if you want to pick up a Woodward book worth reading. If you want to hear about Bush At War, turn on your TV..."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book gives you some iteresting insights into the administration's decisions, but the book starts getting very boring as you read through the first 100-150 pages. Some of the interesting information is new but most has been widely available in the media. Most of the book details NSC meetings, many of which were just plain boring.Jesus Arango"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I was very excited to start this book but I must say that after a while it got a bit boring. Another NSC meeting, another disagreement between the principals !I do hope &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; is better !"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"For those who say this is some sort of Bush administration propaganda: What book are you reading? There is a lot in here that the Bush administration, I would think, would not like you to know. In fact, Woodward points out that during the early weeks of the Afghan war the administration was very unsure of their strategy, which was going very badly at the time. It was only after the CIA insisted that the military switch from \\"pounding sand\\" to hitting front-line units did the U.S. begin to succeed.I cannot imagine that the Bush adminstration likes the idea that disagreements between the CIA and the military, Powell and Rumsfeld, etc., etc. are being aired publicly. The revelation that, even as the war was underway, the CIA and the military were claiming that the other department was \\"in-charge\\" of the operation is staggering in its implication.The only reason why this book comes across as positive for the President is because Bush showed amazing nerve and strength of character. Bush had patience and was not discouraged by temporary setbacks and negative press. He did not let CNN run the war."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward is lucky enough to have been allowed hundreds of interviews with White House insiders. He makes his usual great effort, nicely written, to help readers get their arms around Bush's thought processes. But, what's happening is not &quot;Bush at War&quot;. This is Americans at war. All of us. Let not yourself be deceived by some people who work at thought control in the media. This is not Bush's war. Listen, Mr. and Mrs. America, those who desire the fall of the American &quot;empire&quot; not only hate your government and your way of life, they actually hate YOU, personally, and want to see you and your children DEAD. Though I enjoyed Mr. Woodward's book, it is not going to help you to understand why Bush is doing what he is doing. If you want to understand Bush's thinking (and I hope you understand that you critically need to) I have no hesitation in recommending a book that was recommended to me that is excellent and an easy read for everyone by Norman Thomas Remick, &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson&quot; in which West Point is metaphor for America. Bob Woodward's book is an excellent piece of journalism. Be sure to read it. But also read the Remick book if you want to wrap your arms around our President's thought processes and philosophy."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is intelligent and informative. It is also interesting to note that almost every negative review on this book is full of spelling and/or grammatical errors. It is amazing how quickly some folks will criticize our President when they can't even form a simple sentence correctly. As for the negative reviews on this book, take it from where it comes."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I used to respect Bob Woodward, but this book is star-struck, celebrity-seeking drivel. I agree with others who feel the journalist did not dig deep enough. Further, it is abundantly clear from Bush's remarks post-September 11th (&quot;Why do they hate us?&quot;) to his actions in the region right now that he has no understanding of real foreign policy or the issues shaping the region."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"A chattering book: he/she told Bob Woodward that he/she/someone else told him/her/nobody at all at this/that meeting/not really but wanted to ... All in all it is just a collection of the public images people who are called major players want to give to a journalist who so addresses them.So if you want any insights into the US government's reactions after 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan this book is a waste of time. The only use for it I can foresee is as a source for silly quotes some future historians might use. Maybe."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is Woodward's tenth book (beginning with All the President's Men with Carl Bernstein), and it is one of his better books.Woodward, as an editor of the Washington Post, has the access to interview virtually anyone in Washington (although it is clear both Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld gave him little or no time, and his version is biased toward Secretary of State Powell, who clearly, with his assistant Rich Armitage, gave Woodward as much time as he wanted). Thus, while Woodward's books are in a gray zone between reporting and writing history, they are often worth reading.Bush at War is a useful book for any citizen who is interested in how President George W. Bush operates, the manner in which he leads a team of strong men and women, and the ways in which that team, coordinated by National Security Adviser Condi Rice, interacts to produce and implement public policy.Woodward's biggest weakness is the degree to which he interviews and writes as though a worldwide anti-terrorist campaign could be understood from a Washington-only perspective. General Tommy Franks and the Central Command in Tampa, Florida, played a much bigger role in liberating Afghanistan and helping create new alliances than is indicated in this book. General Franks' ability to lead 47 allies in Tampa (each with their own trailer and national flag in the largest coalition in history) is one of the marvels of the last year and gets virtually no Washington coverage.Woodward's other failure is the classic liberal bias that a profoundly conservative President willing to stand up for America's interests has to be \\"educated\\" into more \\"sophisticated\\" (meaning liberal) internationalist views.Nothing in the text of the book (which shows Bush as remarkably strong and clear and capable of managing a very strong team) would indicate that there is a struggle for the President's heart and mind with Powell representing the forces of light while Cheney and Rumsfeld somehow represent the forces of darkness. Yet that is the final editorial bias of the end of the book.Despite these caveats this is a good book worthy of every citizen reading it to get a better understanding of the war we are in."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"On the positive side, it is clear that Woodward has access to sources with considerable inside information. References are made to and observations are made by people that were at the meetings with the cabinet and the President. But,in a strange way, that seems to be Woodward's major point- that he has the access. I think that Woodward wrote his book too soon. He tries to write the story before there was a full story to tell.I found much of the book reinforcing things I had already read from other sources, though \\"Bush at War\\" could be a good primer for someone who is not a dedicated follower of the news.After Bush named his cabinet, he received criticism from some that his selection of Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Powell either demonstrated that Bush had no vision and selected his father's retreads, or that his selection of them was a tacit self admission of his own incompetance and need for older wiser heads. What is clear after reading this book, is that there can be no doubt as to who is in charge at this White House. With Bush, there will be no nightly insomnia fueled conversations with a political guru/swami about \\"triangulation\\" and the \\"third way\\". Like it or not, Bush is a Leader, totally comfortable making the big decision. Indeed, he is acutely aware of that as the essence of being President. He is also no prima donna surrounding himself with yes men. On the contrary, it is Bush who spends his time easing others doubts and urging them to buck up. It is Bush who tolerates, and even encourages a healthy tension between his crew, and who is completely comfortable and not at all threatened by strong personalities around him, male and female. Woodword's illustrations of Bush's leadership and management style are one of the most effective parts of the book.Perhaps the most revealing subplot is the role of Condi Rice. She emerges as Bush's go to guy. This also demonstrates how adept Bush's management style is in that he has exactly the right people in the right places. He has the foresight to place Rice, the person whose opinion he trusts most, in a position where she is cabinet level but not beholden to a large department with it's labor force or budget or congressmen holding the financial strings, so that she can offer unencumbered independent advice in his best interest.Woodward loses points by bringing the book to a climax by heavy handedly illustrating once again, for the umpteenth time, that in a business where access is currency, he remains the golden boy."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward needs no introduction. If you've read one of his books, then you know his style. He relies on inside access not available to most reporters and writes in a misleading way that is difficult for the reader to know who exactly is the source of the information. The latter characteristic makes Woodward an irresponsible journalist; the former trait makes him one you cannot ignore.&quot;Bush at War&quot; falls into this same pattern. It seduces the reader with descriptions of meetings and events one cannot read about anywhere else since no other reporter had the access to know about them; at the same time, the wary reader can't help but wonder whose agenda is being pushed. You either take Woodward at his word or you don't. (Bush and Powell come off well in the book; Rumsfeld less so -- is this because Rumsfeld was not a primary source for the book?)On balance, I found the book fascinating because the subject matter is so compelling: a nation goes to war. It's also revealing to see that so much of the initial policy-making in the White House after the 9-11 attack had a harum-scarum quality to it. In those first days, there was little quality information coming out of Afghanistan that Bush and others in the administration could rely on, so they had to feel their way to success. This is not a knock against Bush -- anyone else in his position would have been forced to do the same thing -- but it is informative to see the way leaders sometimes need to throw together a policy on the run and then respond to events as they happen."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The sad truth IMO is Bob Woodward did sell out. The valentine to George W. Bush, err.. book he wrote certainly doesn't qualify as journalism, but is more akin to Kitty Kelly's forays into Biography. It seems that having close unfettered access to decision makers of vast power and wealth compromised any sense of journalistic neutrality (perhaps on an unconscious level). As has been pointed out the book is nothing more than what his 'sources', senior players in the White House, themselves believe and what they want him to write. What's more there is no small amount of sympathy for his subjects.I'd like to think this compromise of a journalistic duty to inform was not merely for money from this and other books (he's writing one on Bush's second term too) that such high lvl access as personal interaction with Bush yields, nor the prestige. I wouldn't think it is out of feelings of gratitude arising from an internalized notion that he is the modern Herodotus chronicling a superpower after a horrible attack or even the empowering rush of being an insider on the world stage that led to this. I would like to think that the cause of the metamorphosis is of unknown origins even to Mr. Woodward himself, rather than a calculated exchange his of journalistic legitimacy for the hard coin of access. For the journalist who broke Watergate to have become such a softball artist is extremely troubling.It is much like the shocking sports radio talk show hosts whose vitriol filled rants end at the chance for any sort of access to the athletes that they secretly idolized. The dogged pursuit of truth became for Bob Woodward a grossly sycophantic linguistic exercise.Perhaps the more complete lesson of Bob Woodward is not merely his history making actions decades ago but also as a warning of what can happen when finally asked to join the stage with the powerful few if only as a bit player."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward's books have several predictable reactions:1) Many of the people involved or talked about in the book condemn it in generalities, but never in specifics.2) People see in the book their own prejudices. For example, Bush haters will either dislike or like the book depending on how much they perceive the book supporting or condemning Bush. Bush supporters exactly the opposite.3) Over time the book becomes a standard reference.4) As history unfolds, the observations and events described in the book might be refined but are rarely overturned in anything but details.5) Woodward comes out with a new book and the process repeats.This is a most interesting book. Bush comes across as more intelligent, involved, active, and passionate than his media persona is portrayed. This isn't to say he is without flaw, but I like Bush MORE after reading this book.Woodward also carefully details the rifts between the Cheney / Rumsfeld camp versus the Powell / Armitrage camp. This is fascinating stuff. It also gives details about Condi Rice's role in working with Bush as well as the CIA involvement in responding to 9/11. I believe that your judgment about this book should be independent of what you think of the administration's positions, policies, or the people involved. The real question to ask is, \\"Does this book provide us with valuable and reliable information?\\" I think a strong yes can be given.I think everyone interested in these issues, especially at this time of impending war, should read this book. It isn't very long, is clearly written for an easy read, and is fascinating enough to hold one's attention. Woodward works hard to remain unbiased, but few will be able to read him that way."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"\\"Bush at War\\" takes us inside the Bush Cabinet's decision making process after the 9/11 attacks. It's a fascinating look at how and why the Emperor and his paladins (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, et al)decided to do what they did...if this account is true. This book is not investigative journalism or a legitimate history. It makes no attempt to provide a broader picture of events or verify the assertions made by the subjects being interviewed. In a surprising and disappointing role for the man who brought down Nixon, Bob Woodward plays the part of obedient scribe, unquestioningly taking down the retrospective accounts of the Administration's VIPs. Basically, \\"Bush at War\\" is a book-length and better-written version of the New York Post.While I question the value of reading such a one-sided account, and the propriety of a journalist acting as stenographer for such one-sided accounts, I don't necessarily think the book is a complete snowjob. After all, it deals with relatively noncontroversial events that few would have much cause to lie about. After all, there was almost universal consent for the overthrow of the Taliban and the invasion of Afghanistan. So, if you enjoy reading about high level meetings, the technical details of how the Administration supported the Northern Alliance or decided on its war strategy, then I think you can put a lot of credence in this book, even if its uncritical report forces you to take it with a grain of salt. One aspect that piqued my personal skepticism though is the disconnect between the bumbling frat boy Bush we see on the news every night, who has incompetently mismanaged our government for 7 years and who has not yet mastered the English language, and this book's portrayal of a President who was humble and mindful of the limitations of his foreign policy and military experience, whose understanding of problems was subtle and keen, and who chaired these war meetings with authority and intelligence. Decide for yourself whether to believe this book or your own eyes and 7 years of the public record. In any case, the book doesn't deal with the important issues that are at the heart of widespread accusations of incompetence and malfeasance against this Administration: namely the failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks, despite myriad warnings and indications, and the neoconservative manipulation and invention of intelligence to justify the war against Iraq.To be sure, Woodward tells us that people like Wolfowitz and Cheney were pushing to attack Iraq along with Afghanistan in the days after 9/11, but that's hardly a revelation. It was well known that the neoconservative cult was publicly calling for war on Iraq throughout the 1990s. What was even more interesting was Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's assertion, in his own book, that Bush was planning for war with Iraq from the first days of his_administration_. In any case, \\"Bush at War\\" tells us that the President overruled his neocons and put Iraq on the back burner_for the moment_. What was surprising, and disgusting, was that even people like Powell, who were opposed to any attack on Iraq, merely tabled the Iraq War for tactical reasons (e.g. it would hurt the Coalition, let's deal with one enemy at a time, etc.) rather than openly opposed it because of its inherent insanity and injustice. That kind of pusillanimous dissent perfectly captures the character of the good soldier Powell and other Bush loyalists, who preferred to serve their President rather than their nation.My opinion of the value of this book is on the low side of the scale, but if you must read it, supplement it with books that will give you a larger picture of the America that Bush created."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"A very favorable, indeed almost fawning, portrait of Bush and his war cabinet. Bush comes across as strong post 9/11 leader with the right instincts and a good crises management style. This despite the fact, as Woodward's final chapters, if read carefully make clear, that the ultimate success of the Afghanistan war at the end of 2001 was a complete and unexpected, although welcome, surprise to the Administration rather than the natural result of a well thought out and well executed strategy. This does raise a number of concerns about whether Bush will be as lucky in Iraq. Still, even with the recognition that Woodward's portrayal reflects the Bush Administration's spin rather than an objective appraisal, the book is well worth reading especially by those who still consider Bush an illegitimate president"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The main body of this book covers the period from 9-11 to the fall of Kabul in December 2001. However, the best part is the forty-page Epilogue, which covers Powell's being forced to make an ill-advised trip to mediate the Palestinian crisis, as well as the internal dynamics of the administration's decision to invade Iraq.In this book, Woodward gives the reader a thorough grasp of the interpersonal relations at the top rung of the Bush administration. Much of the book focuses on the \\"Principals' Committee,\\" consisting of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, and others. Cheney and Rumsfeld are loosely allied with each other. Powell is out of synch with the others' hawkish orientation and is increasing isolated - in his case, being Secretary of State doesn't count for much. I had always thought highly of Condoleeza Rice, but in this book she comes across as smarmy and sycophantic. In one situation, Bush asks her for her opinion, but she told Woodward she didn't know how to respond because she didn't already know Bush's preference.Bush comes across as a hands-on policy wonk, the complete opposite of the \\"doofus-cowboy\\" persona often attributed to him. If this book had been written by anyone else, it would be seen as a whitewash, but let's not forget that this author is the Bob Woodward, well known for his liberal politics, who brought down the Nixon administration.Be forewarned that Woodward's writing style is not for everyone. Some reviewers were unhappy about the lack of analysis, but in most of his books, Woodward's style is to report who said what, and leave the analysis to each reader. Woodward never uses direct quotes unless he's absolutely sure of the exact wording, and instead relies on paraphrases. The end result can be a bit bland and yes, even boring at times - look elsewhere for snappy dialogue. But after finishing the book, I felt I had been in the room when the key decisions were made."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War had been intended as a book simply about the first one hundred days of the presidency of George W. Bush. It, as Woodward says in the end, was changed when foreign terrorists hijacked those planes and plunged into the World Trade Center towers.I posted my first review while reading the book, and now that I've finally finished reading, I thought I'd share further/final thoughts on the book.It's fascinating to learn all about the events that went on behind the scenes of our nation's leaders on that day that many of us remember all too well. Woodward interviewed many of the high-level, high-profile leaders, including Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and even President Bush. Thus, this is probably the most accurate and detailed description available to the public today about the events of September 11th, and the following events.On the other hand, you'd think that reading about those events would be exciting. I'm sure the events that took place weren't exactly that electrifying, but the way it's put down on paper makes it seem quite dull and dry. And once the war in Afghanistan begins, it's a jumble of names and places within the Afghan region that is just too hard to keep up with, at least for the readers who aren't knowledgeable about the region.Still, it's a great refresher for what the chain of events were following that terrible day in September. For certain it's a great book to keep on the shelf and take down when you get old, and your grandkids ask you to tell them about what it was like to live through 9/11 and the war that followed.As I warned, however, in my previous review, this book does contain profanity, used by the higher-ups in stressful situations, including the term FUBAR. I read in another book that this term meant Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition, but . . . well, let's just say there was a less wholesome word in the F position.A few last notes. While the book was supposed to be about Bush, it did wind up being about how our nation as a WHOLE handled the war, as another reviewer pointed out. Second, this book is NOT about politics. It was about what happened after 9/11 in our nation's inner circle of commanders."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Just halfway through...Woodward had unbelievable access, I doubt there could possibly be a better account of the days just after September 11th and the buildup to the war in Afghanistan. Great so far, just hesitated on the fifth star because I'm not done yet."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Finally, a book that shows the ignorant left is starting to come around. Hopefully, we'll soon be rid of the sterile nonsense that has plagued American thought for over 40 years.&quot;To hell with naivete, and its most endearing progeny: the liberal fool!&quot;"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward gives us portraits of many people in this book, and most of them are good people: hard working, intelligent, and emotional. But, the book's title says it all: BUSH at war. President Bush is the hero of this story, whether Woodward intended for him to be the hero or not. Bush is also intelligent, hard working and emotional. However, he had the worst job of anyone involved in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on America. He showed more than intelligence. He showed intellectual courage. He made decisions and stuck to them, even when his advisors were trying to move in different directions. He cut through the confusion and anger and fear and made hard choices. He showed the entire world what America's leadership was made of: Determination and guts.Woodward's writing is splendid. It speeds you along through the days after the attack. The words and actions of Bush and his deputies are heartening and, sometimes, inspiring.The close-up of Bush's spontaneous response to the rescue worker at the World Trade Center is almost worth the price of this book by itself. You want to know what George Bush did and said in private and compare that to what he did in public? You want to decide if the man we just barely elected president deserves the job? Read this book. It's a great place to start your research."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This Bob Woodward's account of behind-the-scene policy making process is nothing less than a vivid portrait of Bush administration's power constellation. As is always described in media circuit, Cheney is the mastermind of American bullish undertaking while Powel tries to maintain the US policy in the context of international system. It shows Bush is a leader with a heart of tolerance to open discussion but not to foot-dragging. He puts utmost importance in quick action rather than mulling over potential setbacks.Woodward tries to keep this book a narrative of events in the circle of the Whitehouse decision making rather than adding his own perspective. Readers can easily figure out each player's role in the process. This book's bottom line: Bush in charge, Rice at the top of coordination, Cheney as a hardliner unilateralist, Powell as an internationalist-minded pure diplomat, Rumsfeld as a stubborn but determined leader of his Department. The reality certainly has many more layers of input attempting to divergent directions of American foreign policy. This setting may not be the perfect, but certainly has a necessary decisiveness. It is readers who draw what is the Woodward's message."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"As everyone says right off -- I am not a big fan of Bush. However, I finished this book have a much stronger feeling about him. Bob Woodward not only reveals the basis behind each step taken in the war in Afghanistan, he also shows us how involved our president was and is. I expected this book to give the reader proof on how uninvolved and un-skilled &quot;W&quot; really is (or how some on the left think he is). But Woodward sheds light on the knowledge of our president through the questions Bush asked in national se-curity meetings, the leadership he showed on Sept. 11, and the ability for Bush to defer to his staff.My only problem with this book (and with other Woodward books) is that he does not provide background or basis for his findings. It would be much better if he cited at least a few conversations or articles. I know that after Water-gate we are not to challenge the great Bob Woodward, but it would be nice if he would provide some basis for some of his blanket statements.On the whole, however, this is one of the best behind the scenes political books available. It really places you in the meetings that we would all like to be a fly on the wall at."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Presumably, Bob Woodward has no particular leanings toward a Republican president, even though Richard Nixon propelled his career. I find this rendering to be conclusive evidence of President Bush's absolute dedication to his oath of office to protect this country and it's people. Woodward puts into context the concerns of the President , in the days following 9-11, that his cabinet not jump to conclusions but had to act.If you pay attention to the course of the dialogue you come away with the conclusion that the President was very wary of making Iraq's connection to the terrorist attack without exploring every source of information. While the war with Iraq is not the subject, this book should put to rest the idea that 9-11 gave a vengeful presidential family the perfect opportunity to finish what they had started a decade earlier!"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is a book that all Americans should read if only to see how the Presidential decision making works. It has some good insights into the personalities of Bush and all of his cabinet. Sometimes President Bush seems heavy handed but again we may have had a lot too much diplomacy in the last years. This was an answer to an out and out act of war by terrorists and Bush's answer to it was quite a bit less violent than the answer to the last such act against the U.S.A. (Pearl Harbor) which had fewer casualties than the 9/11 tragedy.This is an in depth look at the meetings of the major decision makers other than Congress. It contains many quotes of how the cabinet and the president spoke of happenings and planning concerning the war against terrorism. It also shows how the media can affect public opinion in that people were becoming impatient to see some results because of the media agitation. Some were shouting that it was another quagmire like Viet Nam although it had only been a few weeks since the tragedy. The war in Afghanistan came together all at once and finished in a hurry afterward.The book was written before the second Iraq war and only contains a comparative few references to the problems with Iraq, although it is constantly on the minds of the principal people in the book.The author made a highly readable book with direct language and mostly fast moving narrative."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"As I read this book, I felt as though I had an inside seat at the table of the NSC, CIA, and Bush's inner circle of advisors.What struck me most was how much of the message we heard immediately post 911 was crafted by Bush himself (and while I'm not a Bush fan, I was favorably impressed). The process by which this group went through to make their critical decisions was fascinating to follow--the book provides a critical insight to how government works at the highest levels, and how dependent we are on the judgement of the people who sit around the table.Rice looks like the heroine/dutiful servant; Powell comes off looking challenged by internal politics (but he perseveres) ; Rumsfeld looks weaker than I would have expected--much less creative that I would have thought. There's not all that much about Cheney since he has been sequestered in an undisclosed location (at his own suggestion!), but he made critical contributions. I personally wish Powell had a stronger voice to counter the Cheney/Rumsfield chants. The book will give you some flavor for the internal politics on the team, and how they play out.Watching our current state of affairs (buildup to war with Iraq), I wish I still had a listening post about the decisions being made...and hope Woodward will return with another sequel soon."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward has put together another outstanding \\"insiders\\" view of the war on terror, and all of its problems. He details the political and military problems in responding to the September 11th attacks and also how President Bush and his team fought through setbacks in order to hammer out a strategy to begin the war on terror. What is especially interesting is President Bush's seeming outstanding control of the situation from the first days, he does not come out of this book as weak or indecisive at all but as a very strong leader who knew what had to be done. The most interesting point in this book however are the internal discussions about extending the war on terror and how Iraq was on the table and pushed by Vice President Chaney almost from the beginning. This book is necessary for anyone wishing to gain insight on what the discussions inside the Bush administration on the decision to go to war against Iraq now must be like.My only small gripe as a historian are the complete lack of footnotes and citations by Woodward. This book would be much more useful to future historians and readers if Woodward would cite the sources for his information."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward has betrayed his jounalistic duty----so frequent these days among his colleagues. This would be ordinary and not worth the comment if not for his status as one of the most respected and influential investigative reporters in America. Woodward is an icon. He is admired across the political spectrum for his tenacity and stubborn adherence to getting at the truth no matter the risk. Once a valuable investigator anduseful muckraker---Woodward exposed the intrigue in the Nixon administration---he has gradually turned from hardhitting exposure to gossip and narative. Bob Woodward seemsto have turned novelist.To quote Frank Rich of the New York Times, who listed a number of Woodward's omissions in a recent column: \\"The truly sensitive issues for the Bush administration are those that are given short shrift in the book or left out entirely. We hear no inside accounts of its failure to track down the anthrax terrorists.\\" Even the fact that after instant blame was thrust toward certain of the Middle East, \\"John Ashcroft was not able to show proof of guilt or to arrest a single terrorist during his post-911 mass roundups goes unnoticed.\\" Nothing of the many serious unanswered questions regarding 9/11 and the strange and possibly incriminating events associated with the White House are explored.Rather, Woodward is curiously flattering instead of hardhitting, and does nothing to inform serious readers of material they should be being provided from real investigativereporting."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Well, we can be sure of one thing. Bob Woodward won't be bringing down anymore governments. He has completely bought into the back-scratching revolving-door Washington set that doesn't want to offend anyone, lest you be taken off the good party list for the next year. He manages to write this without making anyone look even a little bad. His images of Bush are like the old Saturday Night Live skit, where Reagan ushers out the little girl scout from the photo op and starts talking in Russian to Gorbachev. Bush even interviewed with Woodward, and his self-serving accounts go unchallenged by Woodward. This book is an embarrassment, and Woodward should be ashamed. I am a former fan who will not be purchasing anymore of these boilerplates."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Couldn't finish it.

Woodward, himself, has stated publically that he cannot believe how open and accessible President Bush was for his interviews. Bush is no lite-weight. Bush allowed one to one discussions with a critical observer and writer. No reservations, no 'gimmes'. Doubt Gore or Clinton would be so bold and open.We elected a 'team' in 2000, and boy, has that paid off.

Woodward manages to describe one of the most emotional times in our history with no emotion whatsoever.In fact, the only emotion in the book comes from Bush himself, who was interviewed by Woodward.

Aside from his inability to read or articulate proper English, the president's reading to the second graders was a mere political propaganda.2) George Tenet, the fat sick CIA director was having leisurely breakfast, not at his office or home, but at a hotel few blocks from the White House. The CIA director knew about Zacarias Moussaoui and Bin Laden long before 9/11. He knew and will prove that every warlord in Afghanistan could be bought by money. He also knew for sure that Bin Laden has bought the Taliban for far less than half a billion dollars. He also knew that learning how to fly an airplane is a highly regulated profession and that it was possible to find all background information on all pilots and their intention to deploy their acquired flying skill. At only $70 millions, Tenets was able to buy the North Alliance and the Pashtuns to fight the Taliban and Al-Qaeda but only after 9/11. Had the CIA director competed with Bin Laden in buying the warlords, the war in Afghanistan would have been avoided. Only the price of the 66 cruise missiles that were used to hit the empty camps of Bin Laden in 1998 would have bought enough warlords that perform a better job than the mighty army of the super power. Instead, George Tenet asked the president to show his appreciation to the hardworking people of the CIA after the 9/11. It would take two more years before Tenet is fired in July 2004 after making the \`slam-dunk&quot; promise on the WMD in Iraq that started a losing war.3) Having pardoned him self for being detached from the real concerns of the nation and pardoning his CIA director for his 6 years on the job with evident failure, pathological lies and deception, the president will unleash unilateral wars for the sake of wars only to gain political grounds. The &quot;yes-sir&quot; cabinet will execute the president's orders of waging the war on the fourth world country of Afghanistan, not to destroy the Al-Qaeda or to capture Bin Laden or to build the nation but to capture cities and to replace warlords with other warlords. At a cost of $1 billion a month, more chaos was brought to Afghanistan and more opportunities for the drug dealers and weapon smugglers to trade and spread more terror.4) The president then plays another political game with the Middle East conflict not to help solve the peace puzzle but to aid Tony Blair in overcoming his internal struggle for supporting the unilateral America. Realizing his unpopularity in the Arab world, Bush sends Powel to the Middle East not to help with the peace process but to embarrass him and set him to fail. He calls Arafat &quot;evil&quot; and supports &quot;Sharon&quot;, while Arafat is defending his own country and imprisoned by the racist and fanatic Israeli occupation, Bush wants Arafat destroyed and eliminated. That American pro-Israeli bias will come to haunt the American occupation of Iraq, big time a year later.5) The president contradicts himself by announcing &quot;no nation building in Afghanistan&quot; then promises the Iraqis with building a great-westernized nation. The president claims to promote international peace, condemning North Korea for human right violation while letting the Israelis massacre the Palestinians and rape their land by American weapons, money and support. The president claims to promote international democracy while sleeping in Bed with the Saudi, Egyptian, and Jordanian dictators.6) The concept of unilateralism by a great superpower would have advanced the international peace, pluralism, democracy, and global economy had the president and the nation have unconflicting principles and nonpolitical short-term ambition."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This was a brilliant idea For a book, the writing was candid and humorous. The section on George W. 's 'guardduty&quot; wink, wink, had me rolling. I was thoughly enthralled during the &quot;pretzel story&quot; . This book could keep me entertained for years."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward - Bush At WarOf all of America's flies on the wall, Bob Woodward may be our most prolific. The dust jacket of my copy of \\"Bush At War\\" informs me that Woodward has authored or co-authored no less than nine nationally best selling books, all offering an inside look at some aspect of America. The dust jacket also tells me that Woodward has picked up steam of late, writing the majority of his books in the last 10 years. In \\"Bush At War,\\" the strain from this increase in pace is showing.The most important part of any of Woodward's books is the access engendered by his \\"uber-insider\\" status. Whenever you choose to read Woodward you can be sure the inner workings behind the headlines will be made completely clear to you. It is precisely this fact that makes \\"Bush At War\\" a worthwhile read, as we all know what happened on September 11, 2001, but few of us know what occurred behind the scenes in the months that followed.The facts are thus: on 9/11 2001 terrorist attacks perpetrated against the United States by elements of the al Queda terrorist network sparked a war in Afghanistan that eventually toppled the Taliban regime and scattered al Queda's troops and operations. Surprisingly, most Americans know little else about these events. How did the United States mobilize for war against Afghanistan (and so quickly)? What steps were necessary to thoroughly infiltrate a country that had withstood powerful invaders in the past? How did the U.S. quickly accumulate allies in a hostile region of the world? How did the Bush administration create its national message for the new War on Terrorism? Was the war in Afghanistan really as quick and easy as it seemed? Of course, at 352 pages \\"Bush At War\\" is far too short of a book to answer all of these questions conclusively, but Woodward does an excellent job of posing answers to these questions and fills a large gap in the historical record post 9/11.It is clear in \\"Bush At War\\" that Woodward is more of a reporter than an author; the book's main liability is Woodward's storytelling. The only character that is even partially developed is that of George W. Bush (as one would hope he would be in a book bearing his name in its title). Woodward depicts Bush as a man who understands quite well that he is in command, and as a straight shooter who trusts his gut feeling, makes snap decisions, and is determined that, after the debate has ended, his staff support the decision with unanimity. We also see Bush as a person clearly enraged after the terrorist attacks, as someone who was moved to tears by grieving New Yorkers, and as someone who takes the new war very personally (so much that he keeps his own private scorecard of deceased terrorists).The other primaries, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and Condoleezza Rice, are given, at most, a page or two of exposition which they are then defined by for the rest of the book. This lack of characterization does not make the book very interesting on a humanistic basis, but it is sufficient from a reporter's point of view; i.e. we see that Powell and Rice eventually came to temper Rumsfeld and Cheney's war-mongering, and it was clear where each comes down in the numerous meetings and debates detailed in \\"Bush At War.\\"And that is a good thing because \\"Bush At War\\" is not so much a narrative as a seemingly endless string of meetings. At first these meetings are interesting and enlightening, but soon the positions of each of the players and the main points of discussion are established and then the action moves slowly. For each plot point that is painstakingly uncovered we must read through pages and pages of \\"we need to get basing rights from the Pakistanis,\\" \\"so what are our options,\\" \\"we need boots on the ground,\\" \\"we flew 90 sorties today,\\" \\"we need humanitarian drops,\\" and \\"he's talking with the Northern Alliance.\\" Yes, these details are important and should be included, but there is no reason to reiterate them time and time again. The insider's look at what really went on behind closed doors is certainly interesting and, I believe, important, but only perhaps the first five times we hear it. In writing \\"Bush At War\\" Woodward should have used far more discretion, substituting narration for pages and pages of unnecessary meetings (they are all there in the public archives for anyone to see). The book continually bogs down and it is only with extreme lethargy that we wade through each event in the war. As it is the book is more a mass of quotations than a coherent narrative.The other problem I have with this book is the ending. Without giving too much away I can say that the book ends abruptly, and at a point which, far from being a natural endpoint, abounds with. questions and a need for resolution. It seems unnecessarily arbitrary that Woodward chose to end the book at this point. There is an epilogue which, though it does not fit on too well, reads better than most of the rest of the book and makes me wonder why Woodward didn't write all of \\"Bust At War\\" with such skill.As it is, \\"Bush At War\\" is a book that anyone interested in politics (especially that of the current administration) will devour. Unfortunately the storytelling abilities of its author do not live up to the great potential of telling the story of the Bush administration at war post 9/11. Still, I recommend it as a unique, and important, look at Bush at war."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Terrific writing, as has always been the case with Bob Woodward. Fascinating inside account of the mental struggles taking place in the executive branch of our government over terrorism after 911. Great effort by Woodward at getting inside information. (How did he do that?) The mental struggles inside the \\"war room\\" inevitably boil down to a practical application of our founding fathers' (especially Thomas Jefferson's) and now, America's, basic philosophy of \\"who we are and how we got here\\". Woodward leaves the subtle message that, whatever they do on terrorism, all members of the war room recognise that they must be on firm moral grounds, philosophically. ..."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"To my surprise Bob Woodward has brought a fresh angle to perhaps the most reported event of our times. The angle is the variety of viewpoints, personalities and management styles among the President's senior advisory group. If you think Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney were calling the shots on US retaliatory policy, I suspect Woodward's work will change your mind. CIA chief George Tennent brought Bush what he wanted--a plan that could be implemented quickly and forcefully. Rumsfeld and the DOD were talking in terms of months while Bush was thinking in terms of days. Condoleeza Rice's role (and influence with the boss) was greater than I had thought. Bob Woodward seems to have sources that no one else has, plus an ability to intersperse historical perspective on the players in question. The George Bush in \\"Bush At War\\" bears no resemblence to the GWB of Saturday Night Live. The real Bush took charge, knew what he wanted to do and did it. Somewhat to my surprise I might add. This book is not a rehash; it provides a view into the White House inner circle that you won't get on the evening news or CNN."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is the first of Bob Woodward's Bush war books and it is simply title 'Bush at War.' I know that Woodward has been bashed by the right as someone out to get George Bush. I really think that the people that make that accusation have not read these books. It seemed to be rather fair to Bush and his staff, overall. It comes off as, in a way, a documentary on what led the US to go after Afghanistan, the Taliban and Al Qaeda. It goes into the high level meetings...Woodward spent hours interviewing Pres. Bush himself, as well as with Rumsfeld, Powell, Cheney, etc.There were a couple of things that surprised me and didn't surprise me. First, Bush comes off much sharper than he is actually given credit for. Though I don't always agree with his reasoning, he had a strong voice within his administration and he used it. He would tell them what he wanted and his staff (Rummy, etc.) would get it done.Second, it was interesting to see how dire it appeared with Afghanistan. The administration was frustrated, little was being accomplished and winter was about to set in...and then all of a sudden, one of the air raids along with the troops (northern alliance, CIA) moving forward, the Taliban went on the run. It seemed to surprise the administration how quickly it changed.Third, the administration knew what it wanted to do...but you can see that there was little big picture planning going on. Woodward had a great line when he said \\"The president, untested and untrained in national security, was about to start on the complicated and prolonged road to war without much of a map.\\" As we have seen, this has dogged Bush for years...we come out with guns blaring and not quite sure where to go when we have done something.Fourth, you can see how alienated Powell was for almost the entire presidency. Neither Rumsfeld nor Cheney seemed to want his input much and the President appeared to be more than ready to listen to those two with Powell often being the scapegoat or the one out on his own little island (even though Rice often tried to bring him back in).It was a good read. Worth the time and a nice look into an administration."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The book mainly focuses on the drama of 9/11 to the current war in Iraq. The start of the book describes the shocking 9/11 in depth, the way in which Woodward lays it out is very easy to read and is not a cluttered mess of information, but a very precise, interesting and emotional account on what happened.Then the book takes us into the White House, the discussions and important meetings that were held. The biggest thing that struck me was the portrayal of Donald Rumsfeld, who according to 'Bush At War' pushed war on Iraq further than Bush had originally intended. Although it is never made clear whether or not Bush wanted a war against Iraq that badly, or if he just wanted to show US prescence in Iraq and Afghanistan by spreading the US military in an attempt to intimidate terrorists against America. Woodward clearly shows Bush as a good decision making President, and shows Bush's aims now that he is the President.Woodward also tells us that after 9/11, war on Iraq was not a question, the focus was on Afghanistan and the Al-Quada, one interesting fact was that the Taliban were offered to turn over Osama Bin Laden's position and prevent any war.The information on preparing for war is possibly the most intriguing part of the book, Woodward's revision is at full flight in this section as he describes the complex decision making involved in waging a war in the far East.The book contains a lot of facts and nearly no opinions, it is easy to read in some places but has the tendency to over do facts and sources. All in all a very interesting book, shows another side to Bush many people don't see and deep information on the situation with the Al-Quada and Taliban."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward has done it again. His Watergate-era journalistic investigative style has given us another fly-on-the-wall look at contemporary American politics. Bush At War takes you on a 3 month trip through the Bush Whitehouse (focusing on the Principals--Bush, Chaney, Rice, Powell, Tenet, and Rumsfield), and allows the reader intellectual access to the thoughts and minds of those that orchistrated the post-9/11 response and Afghanistan Conflict. The book is EXTREMELY well researched (he had access to all of the major players and the transcripts of meetings at which he was not present), and EXTREMELY well written. It's one big class act.For those that are wondering, this is not a tell-all of what went wrong on 9/11; no are figers pointed here. There is no blame game to be played in Bush At War. Instead, the reader learns about the people involved and the discussions that transpired--good for those interested in political science, boring for those looking for juicy tidbits of what went wrong and when.Why not five stars then? It's hard to say exactly, suffice it to say that it's a four star book only for two reasons:1) The Detail gets to you after a while. It's line by line coverage for 300 pages. It's fascinating, but it can be slightly oppressive.2) If this is possible, the book doesn't have enough of an agenda. There is a somewhat subtle agenda towards the end, but there lacks an answer of so what. Why 3 months? What, besides for an understanding of what happened, am I supposed to take away? What general overarching conclusions should I draw? There are extremely interesting conclusions about President Bush in the Epilogue, and perhaps those embody Woodward's point, but I guess that I'm not sure enough about the answer to these questions to give it a 5 Star rating."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"There's no Deep Throat in &quot;Bush at War&quot;. Bob Woodward no longer has to plug after back-channel sources in order to write his fly-on-the-wall exposes. Now all he has to do is visit George W. Bush in the Crawford, Texas ranch, and take a romantic walk with the President, at the end of which, both men throw pebbles at an ornate limestone formation thousands of years old.&quot;Bush at War&quot; is indispensable reading, as it takes you right inside the White House for the planning of every jot and tittle of the late 2001 combat in Afghanistan. From weekends at Camp David, to heated National Security Council debates, to the CIA's point man inside the Northern Alliance, to an evening with Derek Jeter at Yankee Stadium, this book probably uncovers conversations, the existence of which most other books could only guess at.However, gauge for yourself just how much of the &quot;real&quot; story you're getting. Yes, the transcripts are probably authentic. However, in spite of the promises of &quot;deep background&quot;, the book is still told primarily from the point of Bush's war cabinet. Apart from a few snide digs from one principal to another, there's not much here to satisfy the most brazen conspiracy theorists about Bush in Iraq, or Cheney and the oil junta.Another point is that the Afghan story is basically without controversy, a war scorned by only the hardest of the hard-core left-wingers and an Islamic regime or two. The conflict in Iraq has taken over the controversy in terms of international consideration, and &quot;Bush at War&quot; by fault of publication date can only take you through the early Iraq planning stages, and only in broad strokes at that. Perhaps another Woodward volume will be in the offing once the dust settles over Mosul and Tikrit.Bush comes off as a decent President in &quot;Bush at War&quot;. Based solely on the information given, the most obvious flaw is that he's a President without vision. Or rather, his sole vision is that he wants to have a big vision. He speaks in broad terms about &quot;redefining the office&quot; and &quot;creating world peace&quot;, but never really seems to know how to accomplish that. Even the narrative on the war in Afghanistan is structured so that the U.S.'s ultimate victory comes as a surprise twist.30 years ago, maybe Bob Woodward could have told us the things we *didn't* know about Stage One of the war on terrorism, but this book remains an absorbing official look at the hidden story."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War offers an often fascinating glimpse into what was happening in the White House ahead of the war in Afghanistan that followed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. But it necessarily suffers from the problems that any writer addressing current events and people still in power suffers from: the knowledge that what is written will have an impact on the way the writer is treated and the access he is given in the future.That is especially true of Bob Woodward. Dating back nearly 30 years to when he and partner Carl Bernstein famously made names for themselves by uncovering much of the Watergate scandal, Mr. Woodward's strength has always been his ability to track down information rather than a talent for putting events into perspective. With Bush at War, I could almost feel certain editorial decisions being made to protect that access to information above all else.In fact, some of that access seems to have been limited despite the care he took. In painting a picture of the president's decision-making, the book is notably light on first-hand information from Vice President Dick Cheney or Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, for example, and much heavier on the views of Secretary of State Colin Powell.That imbalance is not ideal, but it does present one of its unlikely strong points: while the views of the hawkish Cheney/Rumsfeld faction of the White House's advisory team are well known (because they were turned into action on the battlefield and on the diplomatic front) Mr. Woodward's efforts here give us an interesting perspective on what might have been had the more multilateralist and tactful Secretary Powell had his way."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"An excellent day to day reporting post 9-11. Bob Woodward shows how the planning as well as the unexpected took place as America prepared and executed its war against Al Queda and Taliban in Afghanistan. The author draws from personal conversations he has had with the President and his war cabinet. However he doesnot dwell on any of Foreign Policy implications of the different decisions or the lapses of intelligence that led to 9-11.The author clearly brings out the different opinions of the different personalities involved mainly between the Sec of Defense Don Rumsfeld and Sec of State Colin Powell with Condi Rice being a moderating influence and reality check.Overall a good book which I would recommend to understand how the US military and intelligence agency plans and executes one of the strangest and unorthodox wars that US has ever fought."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I didn't vote for this administration, and I'm not sure I'd vote for them if there is a next chance, but this account of how the Bush team handled the first 100 days after the 9/11 attacks is fascinating. Whether one agrees with the way the war in Afghanistan was handled or not, this explanation for what happened is essential to understanding why the Iraq war has happened and what might come next. Woodward reports, but does not opine, and that is the right tone to take. As for this moderate Democrat, the book does support my own gut feeling that the Administration members are neither dumb nor reckless and are not operating out of impulse or base motives. They faced a grim task in figuring out how best to prevent another 9/11 disaster. The jury is still out on whether their solutions will do the trick or not. I'm glad I read it, and I did develop increased respect for this group. Even if Al Gore had won, the U.S. mighthave had to handle the terrorism/Iraq problems in pretty much the same way.I think every adult citizen ought to read this before either condemning the Administration or blindly supporting every proposal that comes from it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward was allowed extensive access inside the Bush administration to obtain the material he discussed in this book. As usual, the book is well written. To understand why this appeared to many to be Bush's war, you have to read his provocative book. I feel, however, this is no longer Bush at war. This is now America at war. After reading &quot;Bush at War&quot;, I strongly recommend you also read Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point: Character Leadership...Thomas Jefferson&quot;, a book that brings into clear focus who we are and where we come from as Americans in a way that helps you understand why the war on terrorism (homeland, Afganistan, Iraq, and what the future holds) has now become America --- all of us --- at war. Anyone who wants to know the practicals and philosophicals of why we fight should read both books."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward gives an excellent inside look into how the Bush Doctrine was formed as well as the numerous other reforms that occurred days after September 11. Some of the most facinating insights were the operations and reforms that the CIA went under. For instance, how many American citizens knew that we've been tracking Usama bin Laden by paying three Afghan sources?This book also touches on the subjects of forming a coalition for the War on Terrorism and the White House debate for a military action against Iraq.This book is a definate read for anyone interested in gaining knowledge in the War on Terrorism and how the Bush Doctrine is paving the way for this long campaign."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War is not what you're looking for. If you want to know about how much Bush claims to bench-press, or, you're interested in Bush eating a hamburger, then read this book. Ifyou're interested in 9-11, avoid it.Using only White House sources, Bob Woodward depends on \`deep' access to government officials, and as a result, cannot either fact-check, or scrutinize the story told to him - something all journalists must do.Woodward's reporting, when not uselessly asinine, fails to scratch the surface of 9-11. He makes sure to note that George Tenent and Richard Armitage met head Pakistani intelligence officials before and after 9-11, but does not note that the same official, Gen. Ahmad, who was visiting the White House from Sept 4th to 13th , sent Mohammed Atta ..... - a story reported in The Times of India, Oct.11, 2001, and confirmed by the FBI. The same guy who paid for 9-11, through his Inter Service Intelligence, is being supported by the White House ( The US government has always supported the ISI, and by extension, the Taliban, during the Soviet/Afghani war of the 80s; and a Los Angeles Times article from May 22, 2001, titled: \\"Bush's Faustian Deal With the Taliban\\", has Colin Powell sending the Taliban $43million.) Woodward doesn't think that's interesting enough to note in his book.Bob notes that Donald Rumsfeld debated about sending fighter-jets to escort Air Force One on Sept 13th; but does not mention that on 9-11, violating standard operating procedure, fighter-jets from Andrews Air Force Base (the home of Air Force One, and ten miles from the Pentagon) were not scrambled (sent to assess the hijacked plane) for over 30 minutes! Fighter-jets are scambled routinely, and have been since 1976, every time a plane deviates 15degrees from flight path, loses transponder contact, or loses radio contact, according to FAA manuals. On 9-11, a pizza delivery driver is faster than combat-ready fighter-jets, and Woodward doesn't even mention it?Bob claims that the US Military was unprepared to attack Afghanistan, but does not note that operations \\"Bright Star\\" and \\"Swift Sword\\" had placed troops in the area, and had beenplanned 4 years prior -- many of those details were printed in the UK paper, the Guardian, but I'm running out of room, so just check out the last paragraph for more info.Bob missed all over those facts, in the FIRST FOUR CHAPTERS. The rest doesn't get any better.This book is garbage. Bob Woodward should be ashamed. If you're seriously interested pursuing this topic, start by viewing \\"Aftermath: Unanswered Questions From 9-11\\", 3/5 of which can be viewed online. Type the title of the film into Google.com. After viewing the film, either pick up a copy of the DVD (featuring 90minutes of extras), or/and research the peoplefeatured in the documentary."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is a very good book now, but will become \\"great\\" as time passes. The only thing holding it back for today's reader is that we know the majority of the plot. Woodward's book is therefore not intended to primarily provide new information, but rather to record history and will be appreciated more by future generations than by us.Woodward's book is important to the Bush legacy. He paints a picture of a man far different than the widely held idea that Bush lacks leadership skills and is only a puppet for the powerful men around him. He also appears to be a clear thinker and lacks no certainty in his decisions.I respect Bob Woodward tremendously. We all know his political views are more liberal than conservative. He had to know he was writing a book that could convince many hedgers that George W. Bush is a solid president. When personal ideology collides with journalistic integrity, Woodward maintains his honor and principles."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward' account of the post 9/11 crisis, the road to war with Afghanistan and an eventual commentary on an impending Iraq conflict is fluid and informative. For those skeptical of GW Bush, his executive ablities and whether he is &quot;up to the task&quot; this book provides an unbias documentary of the inner functions of the president and his war cabinet. It covers in depth daily NSC meetings, previous undisclosed information, political personalities, relationships, and the overall tone and focus of the White House on its cautious road to war. What I found most surprising was Bush's careful expression and delegation of proper and effective authority; probably his most valuable trait. And secondly the non-dominance of &quot;Hawks&quot; Rumsfeld and Cheney, and the complete absence of Karl Rove from any War Council proceedings. While not a riveting page turner, the book is a must for political junkees, for anyone interested in the active function of the executive branch in time of crisis, and for anyone with previous doubts on Bush' ability to lead effectively."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is a behind the seens picture of how the Bush Administration reacted to the events of 9/11/01. Bush did not initially want to do nation building but in the wake of 9/11/01, they were forced to do so by the conflict in Afghanistan with the Taliban and al Queda. Woodward gives us a picture of an administration that didn't want to analyze things too closely and chose instead to take drastic action and overthrow the Taliban regime. At the end, they consider Iraq as also an ally of the terrorists and start planning for the Iraq War of 2003. This book gives the reader an inside view of the major players in the Bush Administration.This is a very readable book about the conflict in Afghanistan.

A juicy example - Deputy Secretary of State conveying to Colin Powell, \\"They're eating cheese on you\\"(military for you're getting used) when Rumsfeld and Cheney contradict Powell's earlier statements necessitating the U.N. Inspectors in Iraq.Having read Fighting Back by Bill Sammon and enjoying it thoroughly, I likewise found Bush at War to be compelling, albeit with more focus on CIA and its chief George Tenet. At times, I thought I was reading a Tom Clancy novel when the CIA paramilitary operatives Hank and Gary(1st names only for obvious reasons) undertake their clandestine operations with suitcases full of $3M to buy off the suspect Northern Alliance and Taliban commanders. I found it chock-full of interesting, and sometimes shocking insider info from the NSC meetings that made it completely worthwhile and quite a veritable page turner. As Woodward said on Larry King, thank goodness for the 1st Amendment or this stuff would not be available to the American public. Although the administration is most likely not overly pleased with the release of much of this previously classified information, we as the American public are priveleged to have Woodward so expertly pen this telling epic in American history.Woodward has made a concerted effort to mainain a mostly objective and unbiased account of our prodigiously talented Commander in Chief, George W. Bush. That being said, this book does skew towards the Left moreso than I would prefer. All in all, worth a read for all who desire to delve deeper into the innerworkings of the White House."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"There is an Alice in Wonderland quality to this book--or more properly stated, to the conversations that are quoted among the principals. Their wandering short-hand conversations, the degree to which the President is mis-led about our capabilities, the inability of the Secretary of Defense to answer a direct question, always having to go back to his office for an answer--the entire book is, as one reviewer suggests, practically a recount of a handful of recollections about scattered conversations, as if the center of the world were one room in the White House, and nothing outside those walls really mattered. It is also somewhat revisionist--as I recall from published news at the time, all of the principals wanted to delay the taking of Kabul until the spring, and it was President Putin of Russia, speaking directly to President Bush, who made the case, based on his superior intelligence sources on the ground, for how quickly Kabul would fall, leading to the US acceptance of rapid advances by the Afghan warlords. The absence of this essential and openly known fact casts doubt on the entire process of writing the book, and how information was researched and selected for inclusion.There are, however, some major gems that make a careful reading of this book very worthwhile and I list them for consideration by other readers:1) The Directorate of Intelligence does not appear as a listed player--CIA special operations rather than CIA analysis appears to have been the DCI's best card to play;2) The clandestine service, as Dewey Claridge notes in concluding his \\"Spy for All Seasons,\\" died in the 1990's, with only 12 case officers in one year's class--the book misrepresents the increase from 12 to 120 as stellar--it was actually a return to the norm before a series of mediocre leaders destroyed the Directorate of Operations;3) The CIA had been \\"after\\" bin Laden for five years prior to 9-11, the DCI even \\"declaring war\\" on him, to zero effect. Worse, post 9-11 investigations determined that bin Laden had been planning the 9-11 attack for two years without any substantive hint being collected by U.S. intelligence--and at the end of the book, Rumsfeld reflects on how the three major surprises against the U.S. prior to 9-11 not only happened without U.S. intelligence detecting them, but we did not learn of them for five to thirteen years *after the fact* (page 320);4) Presidential-level communications stink--the Secretary of State could not talk to the President when flying back for seven hours from Latin America, and the National Security Advisor could not get a reliable secure connection to the President from her car right in Washington, D.C.5) The Secret Service idea of security for Presidential relatives in a time of crisis is to take them to the nearest Federal Center--the kind that got blown up in Oklahoma.6) Throughout the discussions, it was clear to the principals that the U.S. military is designed to find and destroy fixed physical targets with obvious signatures; it cannot do--it is incompetent at--finding mobile targets, whether vehicles or individuals (cf. page 174)...and of course as General Clark documented in his book, and David Halberstam repeats in his most recent tome, and as the principals learned again vis a vis Afghanistan, the U.S. Army does not do mountains.There are three remarkable aspects of this story, only one even remotely hinted at in the book: we failed to get bin Laden. The CIA went to Afghanistan with the right orders: \\"bin Laden dead or alive.\\" They promptly forgot their orders and settled for spending $70M to play soldier. The two stories that are not told in this book, but are clearly apparent: 1) Russia saved the day, both for the CIA and for the Department of Defense; and 2) Saudi Arabia never came up as a serious problem that needed to be dealt with sooner than later.Finally, and this only became clear to me after the early months of 2003 when the obsession of a few people in the Administration brought the world to a crisis over Iraq, the book provides really excellent documentation of how a tiny minority, led by Paul Wolfowitz, basically pushed the President to treat Iraq as an alternative to substantive action on global terrorists networks, and the book documents how the uniformed leadership of the Pentagon clearly opposed this line of thinking that is unsupported by intelligence, either on Iraq, or on the relative threat of Iraq (not imminent) in relation to many other threats that are both more imminent and more costly if not addressed now.This is a useful book, worthy of reading, but the real story with all the details will not be known for some time."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush At War depicts the inside view of the Bush Administration after 9/11, Operation Enduring Freedom, and the beginning of the plans of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This novel is outright good, it brings the pure emotion of President Bush, Dick Cheny, Secretary Of State Colin Powell, Natonal Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice, SecofDef Donald Rumsfield, and DCI (director of Intelliegence) George Tenet.It kind of starts out slow, but if you read some Tom Clancy novels like Executive Orders, then everything you read in this novel, then everything you read in his novels are true, even to the Navy cooks.This novel is interesting, and if you are looking into the deep inside of the people in the news. Rather interesting."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"By way of disclaimer, I must say that I am an ardent supporter of President Bush, his administration, and most (though, not all) of his policies.With that said, this book provides a clear glimpse of the intricate political decissions President Bush had to make in response to the September 11 terrorists attacks. It showcases some off-the-cuff comments by the commander and chief, Rumsfield, and Powell. The typical view that Rumsfield and Cheney are &quot;hawks&quot; while Powell is the &quot;moderate&quot; prevails in the book. Ms. Rice, the president's National Security Advisor, is brought up in many instances of the book, but rarely does one get any information on what she thinks about the issues at hand. I did not get a chance to understand how Ms. Rice felt under the difficult time of responsing to our nation's highest challenges.Another problem with the book is that, while it does provide a great deal of information on what was done, and how information was coordinated, it rarely said anything relating to why administration officials felt the way they did. That is, there was not much discussion on the origins of their political philosophies, which guided their actions and policies. It would be wise to learn more about what books, magazines, think tanks, and other intellectual might helped bring this talented group of people into making concrete, and difficult, decisions.But, then again, the format of this book was the same as you would find in your national newspaper. And so with it came the limitations...Michael"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"In _Bush at War,_ Bob Woodward has assembled an impressive account of the Bush Administration's reactions to the September 11th attacks. Based on a series of interviews with the principles, including the President, the book provides a number of fascinating details about how the administration chose to deal with the crisis. Internal politics, arguments, and the unexpected problems of the war all are brought to light.What Woodward fails to acknowledge, however, is that these accounts are all based on interviews, not from his actually being there. Even if human nature were not part of the equation, it's unlikely such recollections could be 100% accurate. When the fact that all of the people interviewed are members of a political administration that will be seeking reelection in a year, it's hard to believe they were fully candid with Woodward. What areas might have been over- or underemphasized cannot be known with any certainty, but it's probably safe to assume any major problems that would reflect poorly on the administration were not discussed as candidly as issues where the administration did well. Therefore, this work can hardly be considered the definitive work on the post-9/11 reactions of the Bush administration.That having been said, it is a fine read. Woodward's prose is clear and the work moves along rapidly from event to event. Descriptions are vivid, providing the illusion of the reader actually being present for the events being discussed. And while the reader is almost certainly not getting the whole story, the story provided includes enough details to cast a new light on the actions of the administration leading up to the Iraq War. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"A difficult book to stay with. Political issues and personal preferences aside, investigative reporting requires intimate knowledge and follow through interviews of &quot;leaks&quot; and obscure sources.Deep Throat led to the demise of the Nixon white house and the complicated relationship between Woodward and Bernstein. This book made me wonder who was the real investigator.Web news is more up to date and interesting.In my opinion."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Thank goodness for this book, as it eloquently corroborates Richard Clarke's assertions that prior to 9/11, al-qaeda was not on Bush's radar, let alone his priority list. Despite fervent daily briefings from CIA director Tenet, and a strong warning from the outgoing Clinton administration, Bush himself admits in this book that he ignored the danger signs. Woodward must be a far-sighted genius, cleverly lulling an unsuspecting Bush into admitting it.Okay, actually neither Woodward or Bush had any idea at the time the quotes in this book would come back to haunt the administration, but there you have it. I understand that future printings of this book will have a title modification: &quot;Bush (was a failure) At War.&quot; Proof that even puff-pieces like this have their purpose to history."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War is poorly written; however, it is very informative and gives great insights into the Bush administration's decision making.

Anyone who knows anything about Woodward understands that he is anything but a kiss-up. Those of you looking for cheap shots should steer clear of \\"Bush at War\\" and read an Al Franken book.

Woodward never questions any of the war staff's actions or verbage. What happened to Woodward the investigative reporter? His work in BUSH AT WAR is like a cheerleader for the Bush administration."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward has written the ultimate work on the various events that transpired within the Bush Administration at the beginning and opening months of the continuing war on terrorism. Beginning with September 11, and continuing through the first campaign against terrorism in Afghanistan, Woodward presents a look at just how the early stages of the war developed, from the points of view of many of the major participants in the White House. What is so excellent about this book is that you get a clear picture of just how intelligent and put together the Bush team is, and how each member brings their own expertise to the war's management. President Bush is also shown to not be the bumbling figure head he is portrayed as on Saturday Night Live. Instead, he is shown to be the true leader of the situation who often asks questions and comes up with ideas that no one had even thought of before. In fact, the CIA had to get used to well thought out questions from the President when presenting their daily intelligence briefings to the President. Bush's committment to the war is also shown, and the precursors to the later campaign in Iraq are clearly shown as part of the Bush White House's strategy to not only go after terrorist groups, but also states that support and sponsor terrorism. The humanitarian campaign in Afghanistan was also Bush's brain child, as he was the first to bring it up as a major issue at the various war cabinet meetings. &quot;Bush at War&quot; is a must read for all Americans, because it is a necessity to understanding the beginnings of the continuing war on terrorism."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Just finished Bob Woodward's great book BUSH AT WAR. Woodward, a WASHINGTON POST reporter and no great admirer of things Republican, was given unprecedented access to the White House and the inner workings of our government at the highest levels during the days following Setember 11. This is the story of that period with major emphasis on Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld, Tenant and Rice, their roles, thoughts and comments as they struggled through the situation. The whole time I was reading it, the thought kept circling in the back of my mind &quot;thank God the previous residents weren't still at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.&quot; It was also amazing to learn the political types at the White House, i.e. Rove, Hughes, etc. were kept out of the process. More importantly, there wasn't one mention in the remarks attributed to any of the principals about polls or focus groups."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"It's hard to believe that the American people are getting duped into looking at Bush as a &quot;leader&quot; in times of war. How can anyone, in their right mind, call the travesty in Iraq a war? It was simply a &quot;we're gonna mow you down 'cause we're bigger than you&quot; type of scenario. How can there be a war with a one-sided attack? This book proves to me that Bush is, indeed, manipulated and handled by the likes of Carl Rove (read Bush's Brain) and others who played a major role in putting him as the Resident of the White House. I voted for the father because of his long and distinguished career serving our country. The son doesn't even come close. I think that Woodward did an excellent job in bringing out, ever so subtly, that it's a Hollywood portrayal, folks - one that can be performed much better by &quot;President Bartlett!&quot;Read between the lines - Bob Woodward did an excellent research job and an equally excellent writing job...so don't miss the obvious points."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Larry King was saying how this book is the best selling book of Woodword ever, that I just had to read it.even though I'm not a fan of Bush or his team (except maybe Colin Powell).I'm grateful to Woodword, that I now understand The administration roles (more or less, with the exception of the Vice President). but when it came to the President, it was too much to see him saying how a president should not do this, and the president's job is not to do that.. when he defined what he 'should' do. it wasn't very compatable with what he really did.I also find the President, and his Defence Secretary's relationship with the media, rather unprofessional. i thought the media seeks people, not the other way around.one more eye-opener, the people with less ranks seemed to make those historic decisions.the book is an easy to read, very beautifully written, and I think I tolerated Bob Woodword's bias to the Administration."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book was very disapppointing, especially from Woodward who has electrified us before. We are supposed to get an inside view of the President and his actions and reactions to the world stage. Instead we get a lot of discussion on the methods for obtaining journalistic information along with snippets of information that show clearly a president who is not in control, but rather surrounded by aides each running their own show. One thing it does illustrate is that Mr. Bush is determined to set a course for war regardless of what goes on around him, confirming news from the popular press. Woodward gives us very little that we have not heard before through other journalistic sources. As a previous reviewer said, maybe this will be better in the future as we look back on this presidency.

A right wing view of Bush's war efforts with blinders added. Woodward's aim at terrorism is as bad as Bush's. Bush does not deserve to be on any pedestal."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is a P. R. job in behalf of the President that I would not have expected from the revered journalist Bob Woodward. Bush, he of the steely look and the thin lips, is the supreme leader. After all, he himself keeps mentioning that he is the Commander in Chief and the President; therefore he can say anything he wants to and does not have to explain anything. The bad guys in this piece are Rumsfeld and Cheney, who follow their own agenda ignoring Powell and Rice. Tenet is another bad boy.After September 11, it was agreed that something drastic and highly visible had to be done immediately. \\"I want bin Laden, dead or alive\\", said the President. But how do you bomb the dickens out of a single person? A larger target was needed. How about the al Qaeda? Still not large and compact enough for a bombing campaign. OK - so let's go after the Taliban. They could not prove any connection to 9/11, but they presented a chance to mess up a whole country. Besides, they were those uncouth people who would not let their women lacquer their fingernails (Laura Bush).It took a whole month to get even the semblance of anything going in Afghanistan. Even before 9/11, the CIA was given up to $200 million to pay off the Alliance. But now the real moneys hit the ground in stacks of $100 bills. Tenet put the cost at $ 1 billion. \\"Whatever it takes\\", said the President. At the same time Ashcroft declared that terror suspects would be dealt with, if necessary without a trial. Cofer Black from the CIA pointed out that people were going to die, some of them Americans. \\"That's war\\", Bush said. Powell saw that Bush was getting tired of talking; he wanted to kill someone. \\"I am a loving guy\\", he said. He opened every cabinet meeting with a prayer.Tenet now asked that the CIA be given special power to use all instruments ever thought of, including deadly force. He wanted to start liaison with questionable intelligence services, including rogue states such as Libya and Syria. There would be ruthless torture and worse. Bush said he understood.Bush did not care for allies. He said \\"We may be the only ones left. That's OK with me. We are America\\". Ashcroft requested, in behalf of the FBI, special authority to wiretap. A Special Operations officer submitted a memo on the poisoning of food supplies in Afghanistan. They also started to build a case to show that al Qaeda was behind the 9/11 attacks. Ashcroft wanted a national neighborhood watch system.Bush to New York business leaders: \\"I truly believe that out of this will come order in the world - real progressw to peace in the Middle East, stability with oil-producing regions.\\"We need a victory\\", said Bush.\\"I am not a textbook player. I am a gut player.\\"So assets were inserted and they tried to get boots on the ground. Collateral damage is accepted. They started to incentivize and Americanize the war effort. A year later, the Taliban are regrouping. General Franks thinks that is good: \\"I have more targets to hit\\".Most of all, it is amazing to see how Bush completely lost control over his cabinet members. Rumsfeld does whatever he feels like doing, including setting up his own intelligence force. Meanwhile, Tenet builds up his own army- called paramilitary - and illegally assassinates people in Yemen with armed Predator drones. Ashcroft locks up hundreds of Muslims throughout the US without charge, lawyers or habeas corpus. Wolfowitz locks up hundreds of Afghans in Cuba under inhuman conditions.What is our fearless leader up to? At the first sign of trouble and playing it no doubt from the gut, he hops on his plane and disappears into Nebraska. And Cheney? He disappears into bunkers of undisclosed locations, where he cannot be exfiltrated. On his first visit to New York, Bush had a motorcade of 55 cars. During the Genoa summit he stayed away from the world's leaders on a ship. An during the Prague summit, large parts of the city and the access roads were closed, while F-115 and F-116 circled overhead.A President and Commander-in-Chief who is afraid of his own people and is willing to abrogate their constitutional rights. Whos purpose in life is the waging of war, no matter where or how."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The very title of this book is a joke on the American people. Woodward had nothing better to write about than this penny-loafered fratboy who could only play at war in his wildest imaginations? What happened on 9/11 is not war and what George Bush is doing is not waging war. He doesn't have a clue what war is. Bush has absolutely no understanding of history, or the realities of world politics, and 9/11 has taught him nothing other than how to grimace better, and walk more like a determined ape. If the American people eat everything fed to them by this imposter of a President along with his puppeteers, and so-called journalists like Woodward, we deserve everything coming to us. The Right is merely solidifying its hold on this country and Woodward stupidly serves their interests by making a hero of this dim bulb we call President. I would prefer a poodle as President (and that's an insult to poodles). If Orwell were alive, he would tell us unequivocably that 1984 is ensconced and well in America.

The greatest proof of his journalistic objectivity is the fact that it provides evidence both for and against the Administration and its policies.On the credit side, even those who disagree with the President must, if they are fair minded, agree that, on the evidence here, he is an intelligent man who was deeply and sincerely moved by the experience of 11 September. Many who style themselves \\"intellectuals\\" in western Europe have a cartoon image of President Bush as some sort of simple-minded Texan cowboy - thus indicating that they are not as intellectual as they think for he is clearly nothing of the sort. He is also very much the leader within his own administration. Of his lieutenants, General Powell, unsurprisingly, comes out best, as the sort of chap you want at your side in a crisis, but, more surprisingly, Vice President Cheney puts his hawkish instincts second to loyalty, and also seems the man most likely to raise an important and common sense point everyone else has overlooked in a meeting. DCI Tenet desrves credit for covering up the CIA's intelligence failure with an aggressive covert action campaign. The real star, however, is Condi Rice. If the Vice President, who has heart problems, decides to retire at the next election, she seems the obvious candidate to replace him. I am beginning to think I might see a woman President in my lifetime - and a black Republican woman President at that.On the debit side, it is frightening that the biggest and most sophisticated government in the world comes down to decisions made on the hoof by a handful of people under intense pressure at the very top: the description of how the \\"Bush Doctrine\\" was born is both instructive and terrifying. That the most powerful military machine the world has ever seen is controlled by a Pentagon bureaucracy that seemed paralysed at first, like a mighty dinosaur waiting for signals to travel to and from its brain, is also cause for concern. Above all, we should all pray for the health of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, if only because the thought of his Deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, getting his hands on a position of greater responsibility, even for a few minutes, is truly horrifying. Doctor Strangelove lives.The book itself is compulsive reading - strangely similar in style and content to a Tom Clancy novel, with Rice as Jack Ryan. The fictional Ryan was, of course, National Security Adviser before becoming Vice President - and then getting the big job."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward's account of the Bush administration's Afghanistan policy provides detailed information on all the major players and their contributions to formulating an approach to the issue. It is interesting to see the contributions of and conflicts between Powell, Rumsfeld, and Rice. However, one crucial person is left out of the book: Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy to Afghanistan and Presidential advisor for the region is not mentioned at any point by Woodward. This is bizarre since Khalilzad, himself of Afghan origin, is believed by most to have been the instrumental actor in the Afghan campaign, which is why he was subsequently appointed U.S. envoy. In fact, many argue that there was a complete lack of expertise on the subject other than that of Zalmay Khalilzad.Khalilzad's absense suggests either a research flaw by Woodward and his team or a conscious effort to downplay Khalilzad's role in order to exaggerate the knowledge that Rice, Rumsfeld, Tenet, Powell, and others mentioned in the book had of Afghan issues."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I don't know why I keep subjecting myself to books by journalists. Newspaper style is just fine when digesting the morning news, but four hundred pages of it? On this score, I must say that Woodward's multipart series for The Post back in January 2002, &quot;Ten Days in September,&quot; is a much more enjoyable and worthwhile read; it does in a few pages what this book takes hundreds to do--not to mention the fact that, written just after 9-11, it has a greater sense of immediacy. The book doesn't have the emotion, the urgency, the poignancy of that series; all that was lost in the passage of months or spread thinly throughout this book. I should not, probably, be too harsh on journalists as book writers, despite my unfavorable impressions of Woodward's book and Frank Bruni's. After all, David Maraniss wrote a superb and highly readable biography of Vince Lombardi. But back to Bush at War...What comes through here is the same old story we heard for months: Rumsfeld is the hawk, Powell is the dove with claws (to use Johnny Cash's Vietnam-era phrase), Rice brokers between the two, and Bush makes the final decisions. Woodward's account is one-sided. Evidently and not too surprisingly, Powell was more open about granting interviews (perhaps it was one of his tactics in the power game), and Rumsfeld was not. This is a glaring flaw throughout the entire book, especially when Woodward starts paraphrasing what Rumsfeld might have said or is reported to have said (signalled by abandoning the quotation marks). For whatever it's worth, given these imbalance, Powell comes across as the hero, the torn moderate who eventually prevails in the end (that is, in getting Bush to give the UN a chance in fall 2002). Rumsfeld is painted variously as demanding boss, evil taskmaster, and uncooperative interviewer, despite Woodward's concluding efforts to give some credit to the Defense Secretary.Some reviewers have written that this book is evidence of Bush's inability to be self-critical or to think for himself. Quite the opposite seems to be true, if this book is any guide. That Bush surrounds himself with talented people and lets them debate the tough questions is not a sign of weakness. Constantly, Bush asks the difficult questions, sets the deadlines, demands results. Yes, he sits back sometimes and allows his principals to wade through thorny issues, but the final decision is his--firmly. And he does have a vision, one that Woodward had difficulty seeing until the end. At the root of that vision, informed by Bush's faith, is to advance the cause of human rights and freedom, to eliminate, so far as possible, needless human suffering. With Bush still in office, the final verdict on his leadership is some years away. But I could not help thinking that he would make for interesting study in Eliot Cohen's Supreme Command framework. Time will tell.If you read Woodward's 2002 Post series, or even if you just watch TV or read the morning news, this book will probably offer nothing new. Perspectives on the several issues above could easily be obtained from other sources over the past two years. Like most other journalists, Woodward's writing does not easily translate into book-length studies. This is not to deprecate him; it's simply to acknowledge the fact that he's a journalist (a highly respected and talented one at that). Perhaps in ten years, when more documents are available, someone will write the history of 9-11 and the war on terror in the way it deserves to be written and analyzed. I wait for that day."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is not a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; sort of report. It is a reconstruction of meetings, conversations and thoughts focused on President Bush as he orchestrated the military response to 9/11. Bob Woodward, the celebrated Washington Post journalist who with Carl Bernstein wrote All the President's Men about the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration, demonstrates here that he has entree (and will keep it) at the highest levels of the Bush administration including lengthy interviews with the president himself. Much of the material in the book comes from these interviews, where the participants recall their thoughts, motivations, and reconstruct their words. Woodward weaves into his text both direct quotes and reconstructed quotes, the former with quotation marks, the latter without.The story itself is rather bland and unrevealing. Most of the action is clearly off camera, the deviling details left to those lower on the change of command. The various secretaries report to the president and get his views and his orders and then they meet again. Some of the progress in the war is reported on. Spin is discussed. Bush prepares for and gives speeches. Scenarios and long-term consequences of various actions are bandied about. The high level players posture and engage in dialogue. We do feel some of the tension between Rumsfeld and Powell and there is an occasional bit of peek and undertone displayed but overall the language is what one would expect to find in official documents.Nonetheless Bush-watchers will find this book very interesting in that a clear picture of George W.'s leadership style and substance emerges. I think that was Woodward's goal, and I think he did a good job of achieving it. Here are two quick examples of Bush revealing himself:Taking a kind of Harry Trumanesque &quot;the buck stops here&quot; stance, Bush says, &quot;...I don't need to explain...why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being president...I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation.&quot; (p.146)Or, when advised by Rumsfeld that the bombers leaving Missouri for the 15-hour flight to Afghanistan might tip off &quot;the start of operations,&quot; Bush responded, &quot;Let them go. Try some disinformation.&quot; (p. 204)Clearly, President Bush's presidency is a practical presidency. We see this today with the emphasis on &quot;nation building&quot; in Iraq, a 180-degree turn from his stance both during the 2000 election campaign and during the bombing of Afghanistan when he reiterated again and again that he did not believe in using the US military for nation building. (See especially page 192.)But more than anything we see Bush and Company preoccupied with visualizing how their actions will appear to the public via the media. This is nothing new. John F. Kennedy worked tirelessly to manage the press, with varying degrees of success, as has every president since. We have to go back to JFK's immediate predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower to find a president that felt comfortable putting substance before spin. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Ike was the last president to be elected before the majority of American homes had television.Revealing how commonplace spin has become, Woodward writes, &quot;The president, focused as always on the public relations component, asked Defense to work with Hughes [White House counselor Karen Hughes] on the themes that were going to be used in the announcement of military action.&quot; (p. 189) Notice the &quot;as always&quot; and the use of the word &quot;themes.&quot; The postmodern president has no choice but to be a master of spin since in today's world perception of what has happened and why is often at least as important as what really happened.Rumsfeld's style on public relations is contrasted somewhat in that he comes across as believing that the best way to handle the media is to give them no more information than is absolutely necessary. For example, he is quoted on page 176 as saying, &quot;I think the precedent is bad of having to go out and make your case publically...because we may not have enough information to make our case next time...&quot;The role that National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice plays in the Bush administration was what most surprised me about the information I got from this book. She is not just a token black woman in the White House. It is clear that Bush relies on her to both coordinate the input of the other participants at the highest level and to advise and guide the president himself. Rice comes across as someone who thinks clearly, rises above petty squabbles, works hard, and has the ear of the president.Powell's famous patience and level-headedness and cautious style also come through vividly. Rumsfeld's preoccupation with guarding his rear and protecting his turf and its prerogative powers is also well-illustrated.Bottom line: this is the sort of book that serious politicos must read, but will probably speed-read."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward forever stands where the big stories are developing. Who could forget his tip-toe excursion into former CIA director William Casey's hospital room as he stood at death's door, seeking confirmation of his knowledge of the Iran-Contra initiative.Woodward spirited to fame and millionaire status along with fellow Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein with \\"All the President's Men,\\" the inside story on the Watergate burglary and what transpired in its wake, a brilliant expose of the Nixon White House which resulted in Pulitzer Prizes for both journalists. They returned to the same Nixon White House scene to pen \\"The Final Days\\", detailing how the sad saga of the Nixon Administration Watergate finally played out.Woodward's current effort takes up in many ways where \\"The Commanders\\" left off, the story of the Gulf War and the strategy of the White House of George H.W. Bush. Some of the most fascinating passages related to the conflict between General Norman Schwarzkopf and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Colin Powell on whether or not the U.S. should send troops into Iraq to destroy the regime of Saddam Hussein. Powell held the line for Bush in explaining that the UN mandate for action did not encompass such an initiative.Now we are back in the same area as Bush's son seeks to undermine Saddam Hussein through threatening U.S. military action unless weapons of destruction which Bush asserts he possesses are ultimately destroyed. Powell, now in the position of Secretary of State, has been urging an international approach through the United Nations Security Council. Woodward points out that Powell was ultimately joined in that regard by National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, who also stressed the international approach.Woodward writes much about the Afghanistan campaign and how the U.S. supplied $70 million in cash on the barrelhead to seek assistance within that nation to repel terrorism. He frankly concludes that the answer is far from known and that one needs to stay tuned for evolving developments."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward could have just as easily ghost-written President Bush's memoirs of the 100 days post-Sept. 11.There are almost no critical questions asked in this book, no opposing viewpoints presented and very little context provided. These aren't bad qualities in somebody's memoirs--afterall, you want their perspective--but its a dangerous quality in something that purports to be a history of a key moment in the Bush Administration.At a few particularly disturbing points, Woodward verges on patriotic machismo: \\"There was a television antenna on top of a small hill in Kabul that had been a favorite target of the Soviets though they had never succeeded in hitting it. The Northern Alliance had also tried and failed. An American jet streaked in and, with one bomb, the antenna was gone. Word spread through the capital: The Americans are going to win, this is over.\\" (p. 312). Wait a minute, am I reading Tom Clancy or an investigative reporter?Interesting book, but read between the lines & be sure to check out some of Noam Chomsky's or RAWA's writings on Sept. 11th, Afghanistan and the Northern Alliance for a point of view that actually questions the motives and actions of the United States."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War is actually the first book written by Bob Woodward that deals with the GWB administration, but the second one I have read (I previously read Plan of Attack). BAW covers the time from September 11, 2001 until early 2002, when the Bush team was celebrating victory in Afghanistan and looking ahead to Iraq. The book follows (obviously) Bush and his inner circle, George Tenet and others in the CIA, and a paramilitary team covertly inserted into Afghanistan soon after 9/11 with the codename \\"Jawbreaker.\\" Since Plan of Attack is probably one of my all-time favorite books, I had high expectations for BAW. However, these expectations were not met.Overall, Woodward does a good job of giving a \\"fly on the wall\\" inside look at the workings of the administration. It's obvious that he had a high level of access to documents and several of the main characters. As a purely informative book, BAW is a five star slam dunk. But we are not looking for simple facts, that's what newspapers and encyclopedias are for.My disappointment with BAW stems from Woodward's writing style. Often, I felt like he simply cut-and-pasted elements of meeting reports, etc. into the book and inserted paragraphs to break things up. Some chapters are simply \\"Bush said this...\\", \\"Rumsfeld expressed concern that...\\", \\"Franks explained that...\\" and so on. Sure the content is compelling, but I think that Woodward could use his good judgement and excise some of the more repetitive parts, especially for a book that is 350 pages long. The worst part of it all is that the last 50 pages are an epilogue dealing with Iraq, which seems to last forever. Woodward should have just saved this stuff for Plan of Attack.If you're looking for a quick, informative read, by all means, buy this book. But if you're expecting compelling drama or a real page-turner, look elsewhere. Buy Plan of Attack instead."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"As a person who scarcely gets much national news, I was able during the aftermath of 9/11 to hear the national news reports on our response to that tragedy. Woodward, who has access to the most private conversations in Washington and even to the principals themselves, might have given us a book more revealing than this. From cover to cover it is little more than a compilation of tidbits reported in the media. Except for a few names, nicknames and details labels for things, and a few details of what so-and-so thought of so-and-so's inputs at meetings, the entire panorama is fairly well-known even to me, who as I said does not get enough national news. The style lacks pith and punch, whichs makes for quick, almost mindless reading."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I was surprised when a friend of mine suggested this book to me, because he is very conservative and my impression was that this book was just another anti-bush rant. I was clearly wrong. I thought that this book was an insightful look into the President's War Cabinet. I did feel that Woodward was partial towards Powell over Rumsfeld. Overall, however, I thought that this book was excellently written and I would suggest this book to anyone wishing to learn more about the way that the Bush administration operates."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush At War is respectful yet unbiased. Hard core Republicans may be annoyed by some divisions exposed in the Bush White House, but liberals will be more frustrated to learn that Bush is much smarter and wiser than his critics like to pretend. If you want to believe that those in charge really don't know what they are doing, read Bill Mahr's book instead. But if you can accept the idea that Bush is a bright guy, this may be the book for you."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The events of September 11 changed the mindset of many people in this country, me included. By way of full disclosure, I admit that I voted for Al Gore mainly because I thought that George W. Bush was a lightweight who would wilt in a crisis situation. Events have proven me wrong. In his latest book, veteran journalist Bob Woodward goes behind the scenes to see how the terrorist attacks changed President Bush and his cabinet and how this effected development of the subsequent &#65533;war on terror&#65533;. It is not a history of the events in question. How could it be given that the events are still going on? Moreover, Woodward is no historian. Rather it is an attempt, by a consummate insider, to give a near contemporaneous behind the scenes look at Bush and his principal advisers in the aftermath of the attacks. In this he largely succeeds.Woodward was given a good deal of access to the principals involved. The book reveals a lot about the private personas of Bush, Vice-President Dick Chenney, Sec. of State Colin Powell, Defense Sec. Donald Rumsfeld, National Security Adviser Condaleeza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet. These people comprised Bush&#65533;s inner circle in his initial efforts to formulate an appropriate response both at home and abroad. The book does not cover, except in passing, such important figures from the period as FBI Director Robert Mueller, Transportation Director Norman Mineta, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge or Attorney General John Ashcroft. Rather, Woodward sought to focus on those persons with close access to Bush. This is because the real point of the book is to present a portrait of Bush as a leader at war. The book covers in some detail the early meetings of the &#65533;war cabinet&#65533; and shows Bush&#65533;s evolving thought and how his advisers effected that thought. Powell is presented as the consummate diplomat, a &#65533;dove&#65533; who saw his role as countering the hawkish advice of Cheney and Rumsfeld. Rice is revealed as a bit mercurial, her views constantly changing and evolving. Bush himself is revealed to be thoroughly in control from the first moment, running the meetings with skill and demanding options and answers from his subordinates.The events of 2001/2002 with which we are all familiar are presented from the back stage and we see how the administration actually reacted to accomplishments and set backs in Afghanistan as well as how much they feared a further attack. Contrary to liberal opinion, Bush is not a puppet controlled by anyone, not Carl Rove, not Cheney and not the &#65533;neo-conservatives.&#65533; Indeed Rove is scarcely mentioned. There is not one indication that Bush&#65533;s actions were based on personal political considerations or screened through his political advisers. This is a welcome contrast with the previous Clinton administration. Instead, all policy is shown to be a product of Bush&#65533;s mindset that, in his own words, he should &#65533;seize the opportunity to achieve big goals.&#65533; All Americans who are concerned for their futures should take some comfort to know that the President, rightly or wrongly, is sincerely determined to take the necessary action to preempt these grave dangers. Democrats who are convinced that Bush is a puppet of his right wing advisers or who ridicule him as an empty suit controlled by others should take heed or they will be sorry. It is just not so.Woodward has received a good deal of criticism because the book is not a &#65533;hatchet job.&#65533; Because it does not expose wrongdoing or chicanery, some feel he has not done his job. Many have argued that Woodward&#65533;s &#65533;insider status&#65533; has made it impossible for him to objectively analyze his subjects for fear of losing that access. I find this to be quite unfair and a slander on this Pulitzer prize winning writer. Woodward&#65533;s purpose is to reveal to the public, Bush the war leader. He clearly has no ax to grind with either side. Because of this the book is slightly bland but I believe it presents a true portrait of Bush for better or for worse. Mostly for better. As a Gore voter, I have never been so glad my candidate lost."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"It was just after noon on September 13, 2002, when Bob Woodward leaned into a conference table at the Washington Post, grimacing at the cassette tape recorder I placed in front of him. Sitting around me were fellow print journalism graduate students from the University of Maryland. \\"So we're taped here? Is this like the Nixon system?\\" Woodward said. We laughed.Woodward went on. \\"Looking at this god-awful tape recorder, and thinking about Nixon that if you go back to Nixon or Ford, who was there briefly, or Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton and now another Bush and look at all the presidents one of the things that has churned in my mind for a long time is what's the definition of the president's job?\\"\\"I want to hear your answer and then I'll give my prepared answer,\\" Woodward said.\\"He's a representative of our country,\\" one student said.\\"Politically speaking, he's a fundraiser,\\" another said. Woodward chuckled.Woodward scanned the room, taking in the various ideas.Then Woodward gave his definition.\\"I would say the president's job is to define the next stage of good for a majority of people in the country. And by the next stage of good it can mean winning a war, fixing the economy, saving or helping the environment and that it has to be the next stage of good for a real majority. Not one political party. Not one special interest group. But a real majority, and if a president can define the next stage of good and get it out there it's more than setting the agenda, it's setting a direction and a definition of who we are.\\" George W. Bush's next stage of good is clear, Woodward said. \\"It is get rid of the evil ones, stomp out terrorism, eliminate it.\\"When Woodward made these comments he was in the process of finishing up his book \\"Bush at War,\\" a book about George W. Bush's war on terrorism. On August 20, Woodward interviewed Bush for over two hours at Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch.In what Woodward described to Larry King on CNN as a \\"miracle,\\" Simon and Schuster was able to publish \\"Bush at War\\" with incredible haste. The book was released to the public on November 18.I bought \\"Bush at War\\" the day it was released. Even though I bought it in a bookstore, I noted that it reached #1 in sales on Amazon.com that day. I marveled at Woodward's success in compiling a book filled with investigative reporting and producing it for the public in record time. It was the first time I witnessed a book being consumed by the public as breaking news.I was curious to see how Woodward's vision of the president manifested itself in Woodward's reporting? Another question I was curious about: how far can journalists go in defining the president and the president's job?In the dedication of \\"Bush at War,\\" Woodward makes a reference to a favorite saying of Katherine Graham: \\"hands off, mind on.\\" This is the technique that Woodward follows in \\"Bush at War.\\" He never spells out his vision of Bush's job. In his reporting, he never says that it's clear Bush stands for stomping out the evil ones. He doesn't put his hands on the story. But he puts his mind to getting the story, understanding it, showing the story to the reader though factual reporting, and letting the reader decide how to define the president and his job.The result: fantastic reporting and a blueprint to the Bush Administration. A+"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book makes clear that Bob Woodward has become the Barbara Walters of political journalism. Facile and lightweight. Frustrating lack of critical analysis. Devoid of penetrating questions. Puff piece for the administration."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. Bob Woodward provides excellent insight into the workings of the President and his cabinet level advisors. President Bush displays steadfast resolve in leading our nation's political and military leaders through what must have been some very difficult decisions. I have always supported President Bush and this book makes me thank god he is our political leader during these difficult times."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward had access to all the important actors-George W Bush, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Candoleezza Rice, Don Rumsfeld, George Tenet and many others. Hence, Woodward gives the reader a real feel for the inner workings of the national security team. He covers in detail the period from 11 September 2001 to the end of the year and then the period from early August, 2002 until early October, 2002. Who comes out best? In order, President Bush, George Tenet, Colin Powell and Candi Rice. Woodward, who seems to have mellowed a bit in recent years, seems very impressed by the leadership abilities of George Bush. If Woodward misses something about Bush it is that Bush is very much a fighter pilot. Fast acting, decisive and self-confident. A few small errors detract only slightly from the book--Algeria is not the largest country in Africa. I called Woodward to point out a few errors--he called me back and seemed interested in my inputs. Finally, I would give it 5 stars except for the minor errors, my inability, at times, to figure out who was being quoted, the lack of a strategic context and the dearth of analysis."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward writes in a way that is instantly enjoyable. Doesn't get bogged down with dullness and adds a certain flair to his writings and the occasional piece of humour.Very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush at War was the first book that I have read by Bob Woodward. Of course, I am somewhat familiar with Woodward's work and his reputation as one of the greatest living journalists. But, \\"current events\\" is not a subject that I normally look for when choosing literature. The idea behind Bush at War intrigued me though. Here we have a presidential administration obviously very fond of secrecy, but they are also willing to grant extensive interviews to Woodward -- one of the reporters that exposed the covert goings-on of another secretive White House. My curiosity was peaked.The book documents the behind-the-scenes discussions among the members of Bush's war cabinet in the months following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. It tells the almost day-to-day who, what, where, when and why of the immediate aftermath, planning and strategy for war in Afghanistan, and the political wrangling necessary to make it all work. It is also clear from the beginning that Iraq kept coming back to the table even before there were \\"boots on the ground\\" in Afghanistan.I learned a lot of new information from Bush at War, and it all reinforced what I had already hypothesized about the Bush Administration. Cheney (Vice President) and Rumsfeld (Secretary of Defense) are hawks -- almost to the point of being vultures, and Powell (ex Secretary of State) is a man of the world and a statesman. The three of them brought balance to Bush's war cabinet, but the fact that Powell didn't actively seek \\"face time\\" with the President (until it was too late) muffled his message under the others' sword rattling.The author's presentation of Bush at War is a fair and balanced telling. Most of the events are described in the words of the participants, and Woodward lets them all have their own voice. That is presumably why Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Rice, Tenet, etc. agreed to talk to this particular reporter about it.The paperback edition has a bit of an Afterward about the Iraq war. The whole book is well indexed."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I took two things away from this book that can by summed up in two words: policy and personality. Bob Woodward used his amazing knack for access to secure interviews and transcripts of meetings---from the first 100 days after 9/11---which deliver a fly on the wall perspective to Bush policy and the personalities that drive that policy. \\"Fly on the wall\\" unfortunately also means that there's not much of a middleman between what's presented and the reader. By way of providing analysis and context, Woodward intentionally shies away from these authorly duties for the sake of impartiality.Although Bush at War doesn't have much of an author's voice, the principle's words speak louder, and inform deeper, than any author could. The personalities are what will stay with the reader, not so much the intricacies of the Campaign in Afghanistan. The basic dynamic of Bush's inner circle seems to be the unilaterally aggressive, military-minded elements including Cheney and Rumsfeld knocking heads with the more finessed, worldview sensibilities of Powell and Rice, with the President being in the middle but leaning toward the Cheney/Rumsfeld doctrine. One way to characterize this friction is as one of dominance vs. diplomacy.One of the more revealing quotes in the book is from President Bush. He surmised that in the course of the war on Terror our tactics would alienate us from the world community, but for him \\"that's alright. . .after all, we're America.\\" If anyone harbors doubt that this administration has unilateral tendencies, this and other quotes dispel that doubt.Tempering this attitude in the administration, Powell and Rice believe that it is in the country's interest to bring the rest of the world along with our policies. They bristle at the dismissiveness of some and believe that hubris only weakens this country in the long term. While they see diplomacy as having preponderance over power politics, they do not see the latter as obsolete. Rather, it has a limited use in today's world order but is rarely the only option left us. A quote I like from Powell alludes to this perspective: \\"sometimes tough talk is necessary, but behind the scenes, it should not be substituted for policy.\\"While Powell/Rice may be a counter weight to unilateral militarism, Rumsfeld/Cheney are two of its sources. Bush at War clearly shows their ideas manifested in this administration. The most revealing insight of this book shows just how, and more important, when the Iraq policy materialized. In fact, with transcripts of meetings and interviews with Rumsfeld himself, we see that on Sept 12---reflexively and without any evidence---Rumsfled urged the President to invade Iraq.This revelation could lead some to conclude that the desire to overthrow Saddam's regime in Iraq existed long before 9/11. And in fact, that conclusion is quite accurate, but you wouldn't know that for sure from this book since, as I said above, Woodward does not expound much of what is said in his book.Overall, an interested reader will find some nuggets of revelation in this book, but only after slogging through some dry text."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The book generally provides a good summary of White House meetings and actions following 9/11/2001. It focuses on the events leading up to the Afghanistan War and the events ending in its successful conclusion. I did learn a little more about the thinking of the principals involved, especially Secretaries Powell and Rumsfield. That said, there is nothing especially surprising in the information, especially for individuals who follow the news. It is worth reading, but not worth keeping. I passed it on to my Dad."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The problem I find with any book that I am really excited to read is that they always seems to let me down a bit. This was the case with this book. Woodward covers the first section of the war on terror after 9-11 up to the end of the year. You get all the standard Woodward stuff, great quotes, good set up and overall solid reporting. I am always surprised that he can get such access, but I guess he is going to write the book regardless so if you want your story in the book you need to participate. The problem I had with the book is that when covering such important, once in lifetime events it is difficult to capture the same level of intensity and drama in a book that covers the political and governmental action.What interested me the most or concerned me the most is that Woodward reports that a number of people within the inter Bush group were looking for ways to go after Iraq, even on 9-12. This looked to me to be one of the most reveling things about the book. As a Monday morning quarterback maybe the action in Afghanistan could have been handled a little better i.e. get Osama, if so many people in the inter circle were not trying to figure out how to go after Iraq. The details of the CIA action were very interesting and I wish he had focused more on that part of the story. I was also let with wanting to know more on the activity in Afghanistan, but I guess I will have to wait for other books on the topic. Overall I found the book interesting and enjoyable, it just seemed to lack some of the pop or zing that I was looking for, maybe Woodward rushed it out the door."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"A new Bob Woodward book is something I look forward to but I hesitated in buying this book (as it turns out I received it as a Christmas present). The hype surrounding it, from reviews I read and Woodward's appearances on Larry King, made it seem as though it would serve purely as propaganda for George Bush II.After all, Woodward uses a long interview with the President and transcripts from National Security Council meetings to construct the book, supplemented by his usual interviews. While the book does help the Bush image quite a bit (I'm not a fan but it gave me new respect for him) it's the background that really makes the book live.The jousting between Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld probably is the most surprising revelation. Powell is a top military man, yet comes across as the ideal diplomat. Rumsfeld (who has become a darling among some media and others for a reason I cannot fathom) is much more hawkish than Powell, certainly understandable in a Pentagon chief. The two go at it in many meetings although the disagreements are portrayed as being respectful. Powell is not a hawk on Iraq in the book either which makes today's statements on the subject questionable.Of all the book's \\"characters\\" Rice comes out the best. She appears to be a diplomat who can strategize with the best of them. Chaney does not appear as forceful as he seems in public and is much more in the background than he appears as portrayed in the media. Is this an effort on the part of the Bush White House to end the widely held contention that Chaney is not pulling the President's strings?The President's words, thoughts, ideas and character read much better than his public personna. The book Bush is mostly an intelligent, thoughtful individual who holds the reins of government firmly in hands. His public personna (on TV, for example) is much weaker and vague.The book is absorbing, especially for a reader who enjoys behind the scenes political policy making. Still, it's not the best Woodward book. How much of it is pure investigative reporting and how much carefully filtered propaganda? Woodward's independence and judgment can usually be trusted but the book comes out at a time when a reader may wonder if it's being used to support someone's agenda.With events about to unfold in Iraq, the real story of Bush at war may yet to be told."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"In Woodward's attempt to credit the players with exactly which comments, statements, and thoughts, should be attributed to each, he sometimes swings the reader around. Nevertheless, he does achieve his goal of giving the reader a view of each player's role in the process. I believe he over-victimizes Colin Powell. Though I am huge fan of Mr. Powell and respect him greatly, I believe even he may feel that Woodward overcharacterizes Powell's feelings that Rummy and Chaney are the bully power players. Powell is a soldier and a military great. Having been educated at the war college, he is likely the best at balancing military strategies and diplomacy. Diplomacy is not the department for Rummy or Cheney. They are the fire power, along with Bush. All of these angles seem contradictory and Woodward goes out of his way to emphasize that. In reality, they are a vital part of the balance necessary for strategic thinking and considering consequences. Bush practices Texas diplomacy which, as a native Texan, I realize may not work in all corners of the world. It has worked wonders with Putin, Musharraf, and Blair, but will not work with the UN. For this, he needs Rice and Powell. Additionally, he needs Rice as his calmer subconscious. Without Rove, Rice, and Hughes, Bush would be flitty and unstable. He counts on them for sound advice and they deliver. His \\"quick to action\\" temperament is complemented by their well-thought-out advice which makes for marvelous success. Bush knows the value of his advisers and that the diversity and differences of the team are what make it successful. He is a decisionmaker which differentiates him from his father and Bill Clinton. Woodward frequently refers to Bush's \\"unilateralism.\\" But not for his willingness to step forward when everyone else is standing still, we would, I believe, have experienced more terrorist attacks following 9/11. Dems who read this book will likely focus on the disagreements and, sometimes, downright hostility between the players rather than recognizing the value of their differences. Though he makes an attempt to stay on middle ground, Woodward fails to recognize this value and, himself, focuses on the disagreements and powerplaying in the administration. He also includes a comment that Rummy clearly indicated would be off the record which is, I think, going across the line. It adds nothing to the story and simply shows the levels to which he will stoop to get a morsel for print.In all, it is a great book and gives a good look into the administration of one of the most popular presidents of all time."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is a wonderfully written book. It gives you a front row seat in the White House."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is a great read for an inside look at how the leadership or our country discussed, debated, and responded to 9/11. It is also a great backdrop for understanding how the presidential team is thinking about our escalation to war with Iraq."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"If you are (like myself) an individual who has a somewhat limited knowledge of Bush's closest staff and advisors, Bob Woodward's occasionally compelling biography about the first 100 days following September 11th will provide you a better understanding of the main characters and players running the show in Washington and how they interact with one another.The majority of the source material for the book appears to be taken primarily from many of the National Security Council meetings following 9/11 (in addition to over 100 interviews according to Woodward) which is in some ways a blessing and a curse. While it is interesting to be an insider to the discussions about launching a war on terrorism, \\"Bush At War\\" does get a little bogged down about three quarters of the way through as Woodward presents each and every possible scenario to launching \\"Enduring Freedom\\" in Afghanistan and the resulting consequences as discussed by the players in these NSC meetings (i.e. what do we do if Tajikistan doesn't give the U.S. permission to use their air strips?...etc.) Since all of us now know the outcome of the war, some of these discussions just seemed to slow down the flow of the story. The book redeems itself somewhat in the rather lengthy but faster-paced epilogue which focuses on the reasons for the mission's sudden success after a three-week period of \\"perceived\\" sluggish progress and occasional uncertainty. Finally, it concludes with a good Bush interview at his Crawford, Texas ranch.After seeing Woodward interviewed upon the release of this book and hearing how there was a bit of controversy about some of the details which made it to his final draft, I was expecting perhaps a story with a few more behind-the-scenes surprises or with a couple of \\"classified\\" leaks. This book though is fairly straightforward although obviously carefully researched by a master craftsman. It does in the end make a good document for the post-9/11 era."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Focusing on the three months between the attack on the World Trade Center and the end of the Afghanistan war, Woodward presents a day-by-day account of what went on in the Bush White House, as related to him by the principals involved--primary sources appear to be Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Tenet, maybe Rice, and various assistants to this group.Not surprisingly given the sources, on the surface the Administration comes accross as decisive, well meaning, and even heroic. This is not a &quot;leak&quot; book, as you might bet from Seymour Hirsch; this is a book which presaents the Administration as it would want to present itself to the world.That said, the picture painted by the Administration--as reported (and presumably filtered) by Woodward, is profoundly disturbing. The U.S. has, after all, the most powerful military in the world. We can, more or less single handedly, defeat any realistic combination of other countries in the world. To control such a powerful military force, the Constitution establishes a series of checks and balances; including most importantly rigid control of the uniformed armed services by civilians--and penultimately by the President and the Secretary of Defense.Woodward's most important contribution is to demonstrate how these constraints were simply ignored, circumvented, and outright undermined during the lead up to Afghanistan. Rumsfield had no control over the uniformed forces. Either he had no idea what the real capabilities were, he was lied to, he lied to the President, or--worst of all--his orders (and those of the President) were simply ignored by the military.There is no decision making process in the White House. The &quot;principals&quot;--Cheney, Rumsfeld, Tenat, Powell, and Rice--regularly met to &quot;script&quot; discussions which would be held later in teh President's presence. President Bush simply did not like disagreements to be aired in front of him!The incredibly powerful military machine thus either (1) ran on its own, or (2) was controlled by someone other than Bush. As the old rule of politics goes, power does not lie with those that make the decision; it lies with those who define the choices.Anyone who believes in democracy should be appalled after reading Woodward's book. Many suggest that Woodward has lost his Watergate edge. But I beg to differ. By using the principals as his source, he lets the world see just how dangerous the anti-democratic tendency is in government. If this isn't the leason of Watergate, then we have learned nothing."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I expected this to be just another biased book written by a kiss up reporter. But as I read this book I was reminded that Bob Woodward has never been a &quot;kiss up&quot; reporter. In fact, Bob Woodward is in a class by himself when it comes to gaining access to the inside scoop on Washington. And this book is no different. And Bush doesn't pull any punches either. He shoots straight from the hip with what he believes and what his intentions and motives are in regards to terrorism and Tyrants. Great Book. Another book I would like to recommend that attacks Terrorism and doesn't pull any punches is &quot;I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You&quot;. Except, that is not from a political point of view. It is instead from a spiritual perspective. Interesting read."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward's book is a fascinating blow by blow look into Oval Office in the wake of September 11.The personalities are vividly portrayed. My perception of George W. Bush has been altered. In this portrayal, he appears to be an interested, conscientious participant and certainly not like he is being chaperoned by Dick Cheney. Bush Jr. is calling the shots. He is portrayed leading the cabinet taking in all information like a sponge.Woodward, however, posses only limited information. Frequently his narrative seems choppy and incomplete, leaving interested readers wanting more. One great example is his dealing with the Northern Alliance. Readers are left wondering quite a bit about the U.S. relationship with the alliance and the role the group may have taken in any planning.For me, the most informative insight of the book centers on the concept of power. The President of the United States is to powerful for his own good. Every cabinet member serves at his will. Their power and prestige are derived from his. In order to stay in power they give the president self serving advice designed to defend themselves or advance their agency's interests and interestingly this advice is always in agreement with the Chief. To disagree is to risk alienation and lose access to power.Armed with all the intelligence and in the wake of the worst attack on America, Woodward masterfully portrays how different key players came to deal with the idea of preserving government continuity and living and working in a giant target, uncertain of the future.Overall, this is a fascinating book that will be of interest to anyone who wishes they could be a fly on the wall in the cabinet in those terrible times."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The most unsettling aspect of this book is that, even though it is not 'anti' (or even really 'pro') Bush, reading it certainly lowered my estimation of him. He leads the country like he is reading from a John Wayne script, and refuses to let things like reason or facts or analysis get in the way. His decisions are based on strong principles. Operating this way is good only when it is after a lot of analysis. George Bush simply does not put in the thought necessary for his office. He is an ideologue."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"In his latest book, BUSH AT WAR, Woodward displays his classic liberal bias towards Bush. Woodward casts him unfairly as a bit of a bumpkin. Also, there is his laughable characterization of Rumseld and Wolfowitz as reactionary and almost malevolent figures trying to influence Bush. Yet, somehow Woodward is able to treat superficially and without comment Clinton's contributions to the whole 9-11 mess and the aftermath. Finally, Woodward demonstrates remarkable ESP powers by describing what various people are actually thinking, even when their words suggest something different.I can't recommend this book as an objective or insightful anaysis of Bush at War."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is a good book by Bob Woodward that gives you excellentinsight into planning for the war in Afghanistan after theterrorist attacks on September 11th.You are shown the roles ofthe individuals who were involved in the decision making of thewar in Afghanistan.President Bush,Vice-President Cheney,Secretary of State Colin Powell,Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield,CIA Director George Tenet,National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice and General Tommy Franks, and their roles in the Afganistan war are shown in this book. This book gives wide and good coverage to the war effort. You are also given some insight into the Iraq situation and the Bush administration. This is an excellent book on the Afghanistan war.Read it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward presents the facts with a minimum of editorial comment and value judgements. This is good journalism, and perhaps it is also the price he must pay for exceptional access to the main players in the Bush government. What an extraordinary story he is able to tell! Woodward transmits a compelling portrait of a leader unprepared to deal with America's great challenges, but wishing to be as strong and as decisive as the great Teddy Roosevelt he admires so much. In the end, George W. Bush comes across as an insecure boss, driven by a risky combination of under-informed intuition and fierce determination. Reading this very interesting book about the internal workings of US policy and decision-makers in a time of crisis has reinforced my impression that this president very unfortunately is not in the same category as TR, who was not just a firm promoter of America's defense and power but also an experienced, independent statesman of brilliant intellect, integrity, phenomenal energy and courage and superlative powers of communication."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is not a first draft of history. I doubt future historians will find anything of interest in it. It reads like a novel with stereotypical characters.Woodward brags about all the access he got from top goverment officials and he paints heroic portraits of people who gave him access, including Bush. But it doesn't look like he asked any meaningful questions to people who gave him access. Why war with Iraq? Why now? Woodward doesn't say. It looks like there was an understanding. Woodward would get access and in exchange for access he wouldn't ask any inconvenient questions.Bob Woodward the journalist has been utterly corrupted by power. He is now just another Washington insider."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"What to believe; who to trust? Those were two questions that kept recurring as I read Bush at War by Bob Woodward. Simply put, something doesn't jibe here. Why would the super-secretive, hyper-political, control-freak Bush White House grant this kind of access to Bob Woodward of all people? It doesn't make much sense. Or does it? Well, maybe it does if we think for a minute about who stood to gain and who stood to lose by having such a book published.For starters, how about George W. Bush, shown here to be (pick several or all of the following): firm, resolute, tough, courageous, compassionate, concerned (with humanitarian issues in Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iraq, for instance), engaged, secure enough to surround himself with strong people, and even possessing that elusive trait in the Bush family -- the \\"vision thing,\\" as his father called it. Wow, this guy could be the next Abraham Lincoln if he's even half this good!But don't reserve the space on Mount Rushmore quite yet. How do we know any, or even most, of this book is true? Well, we don't. In fact, all we've really got is our trust -- or lack thereof -- in Bob Woodward. We certainly don't have any footnotes, critical voices, or even any analysis to speak of. And that's where things start falling apart. In a book like this, at least for those of us not favorably inclined towards George W. Bush, we need more than blind faith in a reporter. All that does is raise our suspicions even further. And Bob Woodward just doesn't give us what we need.Speaking of the author, why did the White House choose Bob Woodward, of all people, to produce this \\"Profiles in Courage\\" piece? Why not just get some Republican hack from Fox News -- Roger Ailes would have been glad to supply one (along with his own confidential advice on how to run the war, etc.) -- to do the job? Was Woodward chosen because he has enough credibility built up over the years so that the story might actually be semi-believable? Woodward's not telling.Anyway, having chosen Bob Woodward, for whatever reason, to tell the story of Bush at War\\" (also known as \\"how George W. Bush saved freedom, truth, and the American way\\"), we really have no idea whether or not the Chosen One (Woodward) was: 1) independent and objective in his reporting here; 2) manipulated by Ari Fleischer and friends; 3) simply a conduit for the story the Bush White House wanted him (and the public) to hear; or 4) some combination of \\"all of the above?\\" Almost certainly #4 is the correct and final answer, but who knows for sure?Another major problem with Bush at War is that \\"you don't know what you don't know,\\" and all we've got to go on here is what the White House -- via its messenger-boy Bob Woodward -- provides us. And sorry Bob, but that's just not sufficient. I mean, seriously, why should we believe anything coming out of this White House: the same hyper-political, control-freak, super-secretive bunch that won't release records of who the Cheney energy task force met with, that has set up a secret group in the Pentagon (headed by convicted felon John Poindexter, no less) to spy on us, that has launched a frontal assault on the Freedom of Information Act, and that has locked up thousands of people without trial or due process? And now we are supposed to trust the Bush White House, to believe, for example, that slimy, smarmy Karl Rove (who comments admiringly at one point how an enthusiastic Yankees stadium reception for Bush was just like \\"being at a Nazi rally\\"), really had absolutely nothing to do with the Bush administration's decisions after 9/11? Does anyone out over the age of 10 there really buy this? Well, Bob Woodward -- the experienced, cynical, hardened, veteran Washington reporter -- apparently does. Again, what's going on here?Maybe the most interesting thing here is that, in spite of all its propaganda efforts with Bob Woodward, the Bush Administration \\"A Team\\" (Powell, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Rice, etc.) really doesn't end up looking that great in \\"Bush at War.\\" Don Rumsfeld in particular comes off as aloof, obsessive, irritable, and a weird control freak. Dick Cheney comes off somewhat better, although inscrutable, but still bearing a creepy resemblance to Dr. Strangelove. Colin Powell is depicted as on the margins, constantly doubting whether things will work, but basically always holding to his role as the loyal soldier. As a whole, the \\"A Team\\" -- at least as depicted here -- actually is not the smooth-functioning, well-oiled machine that Rove et al. would like us to believe it is. In fact, for most of the book these wise men and women seem to be almost completely \\"making it up as they went\\" along, hoping for a lucky break.You've got to hand it to George W. Bush. He may not be very smart. He may not be very compassionate. He may not have \\"the vision thing.\\" But he's certainly very lucky. And whether we like it or not, we could be stuck with Mr. Lucky for another four years."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is 4 star writting by the great Woodward. But I think it was so important, as I read this book, not to forget that his conclusions were drawn from impressions he got from the principles; Mr. Woodward wasn't there. He told their story which I found interesting and an effective balance to those of Clark and Dean. All three should be read."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Other than giving you some insider information about the White House this book does not have anything interesting to say.Woodward tries to make the President look smart.I do not recommend this book because it does not have anything to say and seems like he tries to make the President look more knowledgeable that he really is!"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"When I heard Woodward speak on several TV shows about his new book and learned that he had a personal audience with George Bush, I thought that this book would seem as nothing more than propaganda for Bush. However, using the insights he learned there and through National Security briefings/meetings, Woodward constructs a fairly good book on the inner workings of the Bush White House.This is not Woodward at his best although it's not bad either. This book along with his last, Maestro, leave something to be desired, especially after Veil, The Brethern, The Agenda, and, of course, the Watergate books. He has a rich written history but his style is getting a bit worn out. And his subject isn't necessarily that interesting in this case. The real story on Bush at War has yet to be written (although we can hope that it won't have to be written at all).There are some interesting items - the conflict between Powell and Rumsfield, Powell's surprising dove-ish attitudes, the disapperance of Chaney (he seems almost invisible here), the behind the scenes work of Rice. But the book as whole doesn't seem powerful enough. The book does allow more respect for Bush because he is seen here as more than just a puppet of the much more knowlegable Dick Cheney.How about a Woodward book on the Enron scandal and the White House Role - a really good investigative report? What about the impact of big oil on the Bush White House? How about the Bush - Gore election?Woodward's style is familiar - very little quoting. He uses his usual \\"he said/she said\\" style of reporting on and summarizing meetings without directly attibuting specific words to an individual in the book. That style is getting a bit tiresome especially with only a fair theme.The issue of \\"Bush propaganda\\" still hangs over this as well. It appears as though Woodward remained independent in researching and writing this. What bothers me is that he seems to have much more official access here than he did in some of his other books.That along with much more substantive issues to be dealt with, the kinds of things Woodward usually does well. How about it Bob?"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I have never read a Bob Woodward book before. I'm going to start reading more of his work.

Perhaps they would see the error of their ways, and this could be resolved peacefully.Recommended: \\"West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson\\" by Norman Thomas Remick, a book that enlightens the reader on what America is really all about."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"After September 11, 2001 the nation as a whole put aside their political differences for a while, and emotionally rallied around a President who had had a tremendous crisis thrust upon him. Criticisms were put on hold as America geared itself for the coming war: that was not the time for divisions, it was a time to pride ourselves in everything American and to give support to the most powerful American in a time of crisis. George Bush was the president, and Americans wanted to hear nothing that would affect the perception that we were safe, that those in charge would respond swiftly, effectively, and with great and just violence.This book captures that sprit excellently. The President is shown to be a decisive leader, original in thought, a man very much on top of the situation. It reports what happened in various meetings, the thought processes that went into decisions, and some Clancy-esque insights into the ground level operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Woodward had interviewed Bush for this book, and was also given access to many classified documents, and he puts them to good use in constructing a timeline of events and decisions.He shows that many members of the administration (especially Paul Wolfowitz) were pushing for an attack on Iraq shortly after 9/11, but such plans were put on hold until Afghanistan was taken care of. There were many internecine battles, not surpringly primarily between State and Defense.Unfortunatly this book has not survived well into the current time. It is uncritical of the administration in a way that doesn't suit an author who once took down a president. Woodward seems to have agreed to go easy on the president, in exchange for access to a wealth of information that would guarantee him success. No administration is without fault, but if you go by Woodward's work then this one certainly is.Because of this it is finally difficult to trust the accuracy of this book, despite its detail. You come away with the feeling that it has left significant information out."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Slipping inside the mind of the main man...hmmm!

I still think there's a chance he and Bernstein just made him up to make their careers. But maybe I'll be proven wrong someday. This book shows the genuine side of W. and I strongly recommend it, whether you're liberal or conservative. I'm not really into War Stories or War Movies but this book really pulled me inside and wouldn't let me out until I was finished.

Bob Woodward's book reads like a novel. He has constructed a narrative with various characters cast in stereotypical roles. This book could have been written by Karl Rove. You are not going to learn anything about Bush or his regime reading this book. You will learn a great deal about Woodward and how he operates as a \\"journalist\\". He brags about all the access and documents he received from various goverment agencies. He brags about the interviews he got with everybody including Bush. You can't help but wonder why he never asked any meaningful questions. After awhile though you get it. What Woodward is giving us is Access Journalism. In exchange for access to high level officials and all the meaningless trivia they gave him Woodward shamelessly carries water for his sources.

Clinton was far worse but Bush needs to protect the borders and stop illegal aliens."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward has betrayed his jounalistic duty----so frequent these days among his colleagues. This would be ordinary and not worth the comment if not for his status as one of the most respected and infuential investigative reporters in America. Woodward is an icon. He is admired across the political spectrum for his tenacity and stubborn adherence to getting at the truth no matter the risk. Once a valuable investigator anduseful muckraker---Woodward exposed the intrigue in the Nixon administration---he has gradually turned from hardhitting exposure to gossip and narative. Bob Woodward seemsto have turned novelist.To quote Frank Rich of the New York Times, who listed a number of Woodward's omissions in a recent column: \\"The truly sensitive issues for the Bush administration are those that are given short shrift in the book or left out entirely. We hear no inside accounts of its failure to track down the anthrax terrorists.\\" Even the fact that after instant blame was thrust toward certain of the Middle East, \\"John Ashcroft was not able to show proof of guilt or to arrest a single terrorist during his post-911 mass roundups goes unnoticed.\\" Nothing of the many serious unanswered questions regarding 9/11 and the strange and possibly incriminating events associated with the White House are explored.Rather, Woodward is curiously flattering instead of hardhitting, and does nothing to inform serious readers of material they should be being provided from real investigativereporting."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward's book is a lively and entertaining read. The picture of President Bush that emerges from all accounts is that of a decisive, intelligent, strong willed leader intent on WINNING the war on terrorism. The President's cabinet comes across generally well, although with a fondess for office politics.Some of the CIA stories in Afghanistan are eye popping. For example, a CIA operative offered an Afghan warlord fifty thousand in hundred dollar bills to back the Northern Alliance .... the warlord asked for 24 hours to consider ..... the CIA operative arranged for a B52 to drop a 500lb bomb right next to the warlord's headquarters as a 21st century version of a horse head in your bed.... the next day the CIA operative visits the warlord and offered him FORTY thousand in hundred dollars bills ..... and the warlord signed on the dotted line no questions asked. God it's good to know that our intelligence agencies still know how to play hardball with these fanatics despite having been hamstrung and persecuted by Clinton and other bleeding hearts in Congress.Considering Woodward's ever present liberal bias, this book paints an incredibly favorable portrait of our President. Thank God Almighty for giving us President Bush and not President Gore in this time of national peril!"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward has made a career out of access to those in powerful places. He is not a historian, per se, but a mouthpiece, really. This is not a criticism - those who confide in him occupy the highest positions of authority in this world of ours. That having been said, Woodward is at his best, as is often the case in this book, when he is revealing what went on behind closed doors, and at his worst, as this book also illustrates, in providing perspective. Perhaps this is why his greatest source, the slippery Deep Throat, helped him so much in launching his career - he provided perspective more than details, sort of a ying to Woodward's yang.Bush at War should perhaps be titled Powell at War (with Rumsfield). It is clear that Colin Powell was his primary source, the provider of the notes (well, I would guess also Rice, to some extent) of the National Security Council meetings that provide the backbone of this chronicle. While it is clear that Woodward was given some access to all the primary participants (Tenet also appears to have been a primary source), the hawk wing of Rumsfield, Wolfowitz, Perle, et al, is given short shrift. Obviously, they chose not to participate as fully. Why?The answer would appear to be that Powell and the diplomats at State lost this battle, and felt the need to get out their side of the story. To the victors go the spoils, and the spoils here are the end of the Taliban and the Hussein regime in Iraq, less than two years after the epochal 9-11. That Powell felt the need to make his case in this fashion speaks volumes about his relative isolation in the Bush White House. It also is a bit of a sad commentary on the cautiousness of Powell, a fine man by all accounts. Woodward and Powell did not have access to a crystal ball at the time of this book's publication, but the doomsday scenarios painted by the State Department for the most part have proven to be unfounded.Bush at War provides insider information at a seldom seen level, and is a fascinating read, but, in the end, an incomplete look at one of the most pivotal moments in our nation's history."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book was very disapppointing, especially from Woodward who has electrified us before. We are supposed to get an inside view of the President and his actions and reactions to the world stage. Instead we get a lot of discussion on the methods for obtaining journalistic information along with snippets of information that show clearly a president who is not in control, but rather surrounded by aides each running their own show. One thing it does illustrate is that Mr. Bush is determined to set a course for war regardless of what goes on around him, confirming news from the popular press. Woodward gives us very little that we have not heard before through other journalistic sources. As a previous reviewer said, maybe this will be better in the future as we look back on this presidency. But for now, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I was disappointed. I had hoped for an unbiased look at the workings of the Administration. What I got was an obvious, agenda driven, manipulated story, driven by the Author's own view of the world. I was hoping for much more. I was very saddened by the Epilog. The Author used this section to \\"prove\\" everything he had put forth in his story. To bad he wrote both.The Author's view of the world is so skewed that at every instant when something profound took place, where something really affected the fabric of national life, the Author not only brushed it aside as strictly happenstance, he turned it into something ugly."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward, despite the great feats he achieved of the past, is nothing now but your typical Washington insider, someone who will write an uncritical piece about someone in order to gain their confidence, and the hopes that this person will help him out in the future (i.e. more interviews). The problem with Woodward is that he panders to the Bush administration too much in this book.While an overall account of the 100 days following the September 11 attacks, Woodward ultimately just does that, writes an account. Many times throughout the book he speaks of his resolve to be completely objective, a statement that becomes oppressive. While as a journalist he is held to the standard of an unbiased report (which he departs from many times), Woodward glosses over too many sections of the story to make this book worthwhile.In helping Woodward write the book, the White House provided him with nearly fifty sets of notes from National Security Council meetings. You could say that is a good thing, but when you take into account that this is the same White House that has used \\"executive privelege\\" to hide the members of Mr. Cheney's CEO-rich Energy Board from CONGRESS. Think about it...Woodward (a reporter), recieves reports that were denied to Congress.The book falls short also because it focuses on the first 100 days after the attacks, before the \\"War on Terrorism\\" stalled and Iraq took center stage.However, the worst part about the book is that it does not cover many things that would be seen as being sensitive to the White House. Nothing of anthrax is mentioned (the fact that no one was ever arrested, and that the main suspect, Steven Hatfill, was not investigated until many months after the spores started showing up). Equally absent are John Ashcroft's mass round ups of any Arab that looked suspicious (the fact that not one terrorist was found is equally absent). The vastly important battle at Tora Bora recieves less than a page, although this is the battle where over 1000 al Qaeda (and many suspect bin Laden) escaped to Packistan. This major setback recieves very minor attention. Usually, the only setbacks shown are where they are overcome.Mostly, the book only focuses on what went right, something that the Bush administration is all to happy to encourage. Woodward tries to portray that he is the same Watergate guy of the 1970s, but success had taken its tool. He is now just an ordinary reporter (although a famous one), who writes what the interviewer wants him to write, and then veil it as being an investigate account."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"An avowed Bush Basher, I gained a new perspective on this President. He was the right man for the job in this phase of the war on terror. Must read!!!"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward is a very thorough investigative reporter with a unique style. I really felt, after reading this book, that I had a true insider's insight into the Bush Administration after 9-11 and during the Afghanistan campaign. I liked the \\"flies on the eyes\\" part, the \\"we'll put their heads on sticks\\" part, and the part about the CIA guy who ordered a box and dry ice, just in case he needed to present bin Laden's head to the Bush. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This invaluable and non-tendentious portrait of Bush and his key advisers' strategizing following 9/11 and the run-up to initiating war in Afghanistan is even more fascinating against the backdrop of the current war in Iraq, the launching of which postdated this book. I was amazed and heartened to read of the facility with which the president and his team were able to recover from the stunning blow of 9/11 and pull off the extraordinary logistical feat of mobilizing against an almost invisible enemy hiding half a world away -- in weeks (contrasted with the first raids on Tokyo fully 4 months after Pearl Harbor). I was brought up short by the backdrop of constant threats of more 9/11's against which Bush and his advisors anxiously operated in those first weeks. Bush comes off as an extraordinary leader -- probing and provoking his advisors to get all the proper planning done before going to war, but insistant on fast and sweeping actions to fashion a new world order in which terrorists are themselves terrorized by the US's relentless pursuit of them. Great to have here in the record, too, are the pathetic whinings of the press, led by a New York Times piece --a bare 3 weeks into the Afghanistan campaign -- ghoulishly asking &quot;Could Afghanistan become another Vietnam?&quot; Reading this book should have Americans feeling much more sanguine that our present leadership is brilliant and thorough in its approach to dealing with the terrorists who menace our country."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I eagerly awaited Bob Woodward's \\"Bush at War\\" because I hoped to get a factual account of what really happened in Afghanistan. I had been disappointed by the news coverage. The coverage was, I thought, unnecessarily critical, hostile sometimes, almost as though certain members of the media hoped our people would fail. Perhaps that's the way the news media is: search for controversy, play it up to make it more appealing and then slant their coverage so that their opinions outweigh the facts. They also play up conflict between persons, inflating the conflict almost like professional gossips, until we get an image of our leaders seemingly at each others throats.I had hoped Woodward's book would be different. However, I was disappointed to see, mixed in with the facts, the same sort of snide remarks and gossip that I had seen on the networks. For example, on page 24, Woodward states that Mr. Cambonn \\"was the means by which, at least initially, Rumsfeld had extended his grasp around the throats of the military brass.\\" Was it necessary to state an opinion that way? I presume that the basic fact is that Cambonn helped Rumsfeld consolidate his legitimate authority. On page 23, Woodward quotes someone as saying that Rumsfeld \\"is an egomaniac cleverly disguised.\\" This is a petty gripe to put into a book that will be read by millions. There is no need to make snide remarks like this. Woodward, on page 21, referring to Bush's father wrote: \\"It was inconceivable, at the time, that the head of spying and dirty tricks abroad could ever become president.\\" What deep message is embedded in this statement?On page 29, Woodward refers to the CIA \\". . . as the most secretive, subterranean lattice work of undercover case workers, paid agents, and secret stealers in the world.\\" I think there is a better way to characterize these men who have dedicated their lives to help defend our country. Stealing secrets is a petty way of putting it. Al Qaeda's attack on the twin towers was a secret before it was carried out. Did this secret belong only to al Qaeda? Have we no justification trying to \\"steal\\" it? The news media has never stopped criticizing Bush and his administrating for not \\"stealing\\" this secret before the towers were destroyed. Why describe the CIA's work in such a biased way? No nation would be secure if it did not try to discover beforehand the intentions of potentially hostile nations. That's the way the world is. All nations spy to protect themselves.On page 58, Woodward writes \\"Bush was tired of rhetoric. The president wanted to kill somebody.\\" On page 277, when describing the Yankee fans cheering as Bush throws the opening pitch, Woodward quotes someone's comment: \\"It's like being at a Nazi rally.\\" When I read these two statements, I wondered what is Woodward's underlying point?When someone in congress leaked sensitive military plans, Bush decided to allow only the Big Eight in congress have access to sensitive information, Woodward seemed critical of Bush. The paper Woodward helps to manage, \\"The Washington Post,\\" printed a front page article featuring the leaked information the day after it was revealed. Is this \\"news\\" to publish classified information so that even our enemies can read it? It might seem news to some, but it's my neck at stake when classified information is made public. I don't fault Bush at all in trying to limit access to classified information. I think it's shameful that members of congress would deliberately leak it.Woodward plays up conflict between Powell and Rumsfeld. I'm sure it was difficult to reach an agreement encompassing different points of view, but I think it is a disservice to both men to play up their different views when, in fact, both men worked together to accomplish an amazing feat of adroit statesmanship and stunning military success. Just think of it! These men helped to achieve our country's goals denying al Qaeda a safe haven in just ten weeks.\\"Bush at War\\" could have been a great book if Woodward had focused more on the patriotic sense of duty these men have and less on gossip trying to emphasize rivalry between them. We owe them and President Bush a vote of thanks, not only Americans but people of other nations as well. The world is significantly safer now because of what these men did. Had Woodward realized this and made it the overall theme of his book, \\"Bush at War\\" could have been a great book of lasting interest."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The same Bush administration which Woodward sizes up favorably is now stumbling, bumbling and looking pretty silly on the world stage. That's the problem with the kind of \\"instant history\\" Woodward attempts here -- it rarely has legs. Given more time to fully play out, Bush's cowboy-style rush to make crucial decisions half-cocked now means there is no meaningful allied front to take on Iraq -- if, indeed, taking on Iraq is even the right thing to do. Bush, Powell, Rice, Rumsfeld -- they've all failed miserably to make the case or put together a winning strategy. Osama is still at large, the economy is in the pits and George is locked in battle with the U.N. Woodward should be embarrassed by BUSH AT WAR and you should not waste your money on it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"The release of two new books that reveal the accounts of people who were actually there on and immediately after 9/11, Paul O'Neill and Richard Clarke, expose this book for what it is -- a deceitful propaganda tool. The game that Woodward seems to play is a trading of favors with administration officials. These officials give Woodward \\"unprecedented access\\" and tell him the tales that they want told and Woodward, in return features them prominently to sell a lot of books. It really is a good read, in a Tom Clancy kind of way. The only problem is that it appears that the real events didn't actually occur in the way that Woodward describes them. Instead, Woodward facilitates a rewrite of history by principals who wish to tell their story as they would like it to be remembered rather than how it actually occurred.For example, Woodward says that Bush didn't focus on Iraq after 9/11, but the people who were there, Clarke and O'Neill say that he began on that horrible day to plan an attack on Iraq in spite of no evidence of any connection between Iraq and 9/11. I believe the guys who were there.My prediction is that when you read the report of the 9/11 commission it will expose this book for what it is -- a propaganda tool that gets many of the major facts and conclusion wrong."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Mr. Woodward should be commended for writting and interesting book about an administration that will go down in history as the dumbest, most narrow-minded, self-serving for the rich, in American history. Fabricating an ill advised massacre against the Iraq citizens in the name of oil and the rich contractors. Woodward portrayed W. Bush, the born-again Christian, cocaine using (1972), convicted drunk driver, warmonger as sometype of \\"war leader\\". Surrounded by \\"chicken hawks\\" that have never served their country in a military capacity. Fooling many Americans in believing in him and his croonies as they lead us to war against the wrong enemy. History will not be kind to this foul group of \\"Losers\\" we have running our government. Woodward had to be holding his nose as he interviewed Rumsfeld, Cheney, Pearle, Rice, and the other chicken hawks left over from little Bush's fathers administration. Mr. Powell is the shinning star in this dirty group. Hopefully he will continue to talk some common sense in Bush and his entourage of ..."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is a detailed account of what was said by Bush and his inner circle. There is no real attempt to form an opinion or show happenings in any light other than that of Mr. Bush and his group. I'd give it a 4 or 5 for accuracy, but due to the lack of insight into what Mr. Bush's course of action would cause long-term, this has to go down. I wouldn't advise this book to anyone who actually wants to _understand_ the events of 9/11, Afghanistan, or now Iraq. To Bob: 4 for being a faithful tape recorder and zero for analysis. You get a 2, and I'm going to offload the book on the used market."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"For all the conservatives who give this book one star because it's \\"filled with lies,\\" I feel compelled to point out that I am a moderate liberal who enjoys reading these Woodward books because they help me empathize with the Bush administration more, not because I want to demonize them or make fun of them.This book, like his most recent one, is one that will have you forgetting your other responsibilities. As busy as I am, I found myself finishing this near-400-page book at just under five days. It's just really interesting, really good reading; and it covers material that, like I said about the other book, every American really should know about."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward is a great reporter. Though he may not be the world's biggest Bush fan, this book gives you the feeling that you are a fly on the wall in TOP SECRET government meetings. Some of the things reportedly said by Bush sound chilling. It is an interesting read and a must have for anybody interested in the inner workings of politics and the White House!"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodword gives a nearly day-by-day account of the three months following the terrorist attacks of September 11th. This format allows the reader to gain insight into the decision-making process regarding the war in Afghanistan (you must read Woodword's new book, Plan of Attack, to learn about the war in Iraq). Woodword had unprecedented access to President Bush as well as senior cabinet members, giving him a clear advantage over others in ability to objectively confer the events that led to the war in Afghanistan. Woodword allows the reader to draw their own conclusions about the President and his administration, rather than filling the pages with his own opinions and analysis of the proceedings depicted. No matter your party affiliation, everyone would do right to read this book in order to have an informed opinion about the President, his administration, and the war in Afghanistan. No other work covers the events with as much detail and objectivity as Woodword does here."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Ostensibly, this documentary chronicles the days and weeks after September 11th, with the beginning of plans for Afghanistan, internal security, and an international war on terror. What really makes this book so notable and useful is not the events it describes, but the power struggles and interesting dynamics in our current White House. It sounds like a soap opera, but Woodward has a wiretap in the White House and highlights large ideological and petty differences between Rumsfeld and other hawkish conservatives, versus military doves in the camp of Powell.Contrary to the opinions of some other reviewers, I thought these insights into the White House situation room were quite scary. Conversation is completely off topic and nobody can continue a train of thought for more than a few minutes. Bush approaches foreign policy like someone who hasn't graduated from high school, with grossly inaccurate judgements and generalizations. He makes constant analogies to sports when deciding how to move forward (e.g. \\"I'm a gut player.\\") It seems the only person with their head on straight is Condoleeza Rice, and she is only a voice whispering in the president's ear, and not a huge player in public. At least according to Woodward's representation, the Bush White House could haphazardly fly towards Armaggedon on any given day. The reader will learn things that the public surely didn't know about even a few months ago, including that Bush was seriously considering sending over 50,000 U.S. ground troops to Afghanistan. The documentary also is more telling about how the administration feels about the \\"axis of evil\\" and other nations, as well as showing how Bush's PR staff was able to convince Americans that Iraq was a terrorist state (indeed one of the greatest PR magic tricks of all time considering the dearth of any evidence.)Although the detailing of military operations in Afghanistan isn't all that interesting, Bush at War is valuable as an insight into high-level politics that seem to be taking place at a rather basic level."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I always thought Woodward was a liberal, but not after reading this book. I really enjoyed it. It begins with the events of 911 and carries the reader through the war on terror in Afghanistan. Very interesting and readable. I blew threw it in a couple of days and wished there were much more. This book will give you confidence in the President whether you're a fan or not. One of Woodward's best works. I would have rated this a 5, but it left me wanting more. I really want part 2."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I enjoyed the Woodward account of how Bush developed his war on terrorism with his closest advisors. One shortcomming of the book which appeared, but I don't understand, was Woodward's background pro-Bush development. While I don't believe Woodward, a great investigative reporter and the one responsible for bringing out the Watergate scandle, sought to promote Bush in any way, the work seems to convey this.Beyond this, the Woodward account of the war is really a transcript of the war planning. Woodward shows the dynamic between the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense on the one side and Secretary of State on the other with the National Security Advisor as the real sounding board and most influential in the President's war cabinet. According to Woodward, Condi Rice, next to Karen Huges (who has left), appears to be the arbitrator between the factions within the Bush administration's war cabinet.I wouldn't rate this as a great work of art, but a good transcript of how the current White House administration has handled probably one of the most difficult times since Pearl Harbor. The book provides a view of President Bush in action which the news media generally has not portrayed. Woodward, to produce this book, had significant access which confuses me on the unnecessary pro-Bush bent. Even if Woodward presented the information, I think the reader could walk away saying Bush is a leader.Bush, according to Woodward, breaks things down to simple parts to make a decision always keeping in mind he works for the people. Bush, as presented by Woodward, kind-of stikes me as a cross between Truman and Teddy Roosevelt. It is a book worth reading, but don't expect some great wisdom here."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Enthralling portrait of the weeks following September 11 when the world watched and worried how President Bush would react to the most devastating terrorist attack in history. Based on scores of interviews, Bob Woodward manages to convey the drama and concern of further attacks which permeated the American administration."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward does an excellent job describing the events and activities of all the major White House players as events unfold after the attack on September 11. He gives true insight into how the players interact and their thought processes as the US response to terrorism unfolds.This is not a book just for conservatives or supporters of our President. Woodward writes in a clearly unbiased manner exposing both the strengths and weaknesses of Bush and his advisors.Educational and an eye opener, the book is very topical as it ends with the heat being ramped up on the Iraqi situation."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I should begin my comments saying that i am a third world citizen and that i have read an spanish translation of this book, which it is sold like hot bread in supermarkets in Lima.This book shows how the most powerful government of the earth knows so few about other cultures and other ways of responding to threats. I can't imagine the american foreign policy without their CIA experts and spies. The story everyone has read in newspapers shows a government what can't respond inmediately - because it doesn't have enough information and because it needs to persuade governments around Afghanistan to get bases and logistic facilities and because the Pentagon never imagined a war like this - and that gets in just 10 days the falling down of Afghanistan after the fall of Mazar-i-Shariff with absolute surprise. And what we should recognize is the ability of Bush's staff members to create solutions from nothing, and try, and learn, and finally, doing so again and again, under public pressure, get success. It was a great essay for what is coming: the hunt on Saddam Hussein.I think that european goverments have political elites more sensible to other cultures and more able to persuade and negotiate. The american giant needs a very expensive inteligence agency and subtle military and financial threats to get the almost the same outcomes.But let's give a prize to the intuition and courage to make choices and take risks, of the President Bush."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I thought Woodward was quite objective. He pointed out the difficulties involved with the war &amp; inside the war cabinet. The book also gives an incredible exclusive as to what Bush is all about &amp; peels away this painting that the media has painted of him as a dumb cowboy from Texas, but quite the contrary. The fact of the matter is that Bush accepted the challenge of the war on terrorism &amp; truly cares about the American people &amp; our nation. He was the glue that held Powell, Cheney, Rumsfeld &amp; Rice together being the driving force behind them in getting results in a time of crisis."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I suppose you can draw whatever conclusions you want from Mr. Woodward's \\"Bush At War\\" depending on your political slant. For those considering the book, I ask you to look at it impartially - it is a fascinating study into presidential decision making, and can be considered a primary source for research purposes. The decision making portrayed here are those of President Bush, and despite attacks from either end of the spectrum directed at Mr. Woodward, he has, as always, turned a reporter's eye to the sequence of events that led to the decision to go to war in Afghanistan.I read this book twice - once when I first bought it when it was published, and recently. The hindsight history provides us made it read like two different books. What we see is a president not at all aloof, detached, or non-informed about the affaris of his government, but a resolute wartime leader setting the course for the future of the war on terror. From there you can draw your own conclusions - we have the \\"with us or against us\\" policy in the days after 9/11, which at the time seemed an approporiate, passionate, and emotional response to the tragedy. That policy in microcosm was exactly the correct policy as it pertianed to Pakistan in the days after 9/11, for example, but its broad application to other world events (Iraq, as we were soon to find out) was to prove much more difficult. We also see the inner workings of Bush's inner circle, the War Cabinet.Mr. Woodward's book does not read like a novel - sometimes you feel that he is reprinting a transcript of the meetings right after they happened. This, while at times difficult to maintian attention to, is exactly the service he has provided - a first-hand account of events and decisions as they were made, without filter. The conclusions he reaches are based on those accounts, and are not partisan. He calls it like he sees it. His thorough research and interviews, many with the president himself, have to be seen as more authoritative than the views of any pundit.I'm looking forward to Mr. Woodward's other books in the \\"Bush At War\\" series. My challenge to myself and to the rest of you is to stop seeing this topic through partisan lenses and begin to take Mr. Woodward's contributions here as the narrative of history as it was made. We will all be more informed and better citizens as a result."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is not an opinion piece--it's nearly a minute-by-minute matter-of-fact transcript of what transpired in the Bush administration in the first 100 days after 9/11, up to the capture of Kabul.There are no sweeping judgments here, just the facts, in an accessible and readable style. If you're after a wholesale condemnation of the Bush administration, this book won't satisfy you. But if you want a kind of step-by-step chronology of what happened and when, with explanations along the way, I don't know of a better source."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"First of all I found this historical account of the daily response, thinking, and activities of the Bush cabinet from the morning of 9/11 to the height of the Afganistan campaign, an exciting and excellent account of this historical period. I later read Pat Buchanan's \\"Where the Right Went Wrong\\" and found this book corraberated many of his assertions. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This was a decent book that I've enjoyed reading; it purpotes to give the inside story behind the White House's response on 9/11. And I'm for the most part reasonably sure that it roughly corresponds to what happened inside the white house. However, there is sort of unreal aspect that one senses when reading it; for it starts to almost read like a Tom Clancy novel, or any other spy novel.Its also important to take this work for what it is; its the \\"inside\\" story of a war that is still underway. Some might jump up and immediatly scream \\"Propaganda! You are being brainwashed and you should be reading Chomsky instead!\\" after reading a few pages of this, but in my opinion that is not a fair assessment. I could easily see a hypothetical book about World War II published in 1944, or a another hypothetical book about the Cuban Missile Crisis published in 1963 be written in the same style. It is unrealistic to expect anything different.So my advise would be, to read this book, take it for face value and enjoy it for what is, and go from there."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"If you are looking for what really happened in the conflict with Afghanistan, then you must read Bush at War. It shows what went on and how it all fell into place. Bob Woodward did a phenominal job of giving me the chance at what it feels like to be in the Oval Office for those 100 days after September 11. I felt like i was a part of the NSC and got a say. The book is a guide to what really went on behind closed doors and how what was done inside that room was followed out by those doing the fighting. A must read for the person who is an avid history follower or the person who just wants to know what is going on in our government today."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book, as its title suggests, is a collection of various events and decisions involving Bush and his cohorts, which lends a framework for the retaliatory strike on UBL and the Taliban.There is an apparent disconnect when the War on Iraq is being discussed. The subject is introduced abruplty, and the flow of the book is totally disrupted. This prompts the reader to question the motives behind the War on Iraq.The author does a good job on revealing Bush's emotions."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I felt the book was informative, and captured many angles. It gave the reader an inside account of Bush's inner circle. On the other hand, it seemed disorganized, which may more be a function of what was really happening, rather than Woodward's style of writing. Overall, there is probably a New Yorker or New York Times article that captures the essence of the book but does not leave the reader wondering why they purchased it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I was unsure about purchasing this book because of the many negative reviews but, luckily, I did anyway. If you'd like a fairly nonpartisan but well-informed account of the days following 9/11 then please give this a shot. It's a fascinating read and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"It had to be galling to Bob Woodward to write a fairly flattering book about a President he undoubtedly would have never dreamed of voting for a couple of years ago (and maybe not even now). While the book does little to dispell Bush's reputation for lacking eloquence or reflection, it does reveal his strengths as a leader who knows how to get action out of his staff. Two key passages in the book, just prior to the bombing in Afghanistan and just prior to the collapse of the Taliban, show a remarkable ability of #41 to reassure weary, wavering cabinet members just as they are beginning to lack confidence in themselves.The big question of nearly every Woodward book is how much he was able to extract from credible sources and how much he pulled out of thin air (he was, after all, the last man to talk to CIA director Casey AFTER he died). How much you think he fabricated for this book will probably depend on how much you like or hate George W. As usual, Woodward's writing style is highly readable, a good second draft of history."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward's intent was to provide a snapshot of the post-9/11 year of the Bush administration by talking to as many insiders as he could and recording their on-the-spot actions and observations. This &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; approach has its merits and drawbacks, especially as practiced in this book. On the plus side, he seems to have had quite extensive access to the major players, although apparently much of the verbatim quotes from high level meetings must have been reconstructed afterward by the parties. He does provide some sense of the personalities of these figures, and how they interact with each other. I had hoped the book might provide some clue as to the rationale behind the policy, and while there is some analysis, it is mainly &quot;personality-based.&quot;The limitations of this approach are readily evident: Woodward is careful not to step on anyone's toes, and one cannot help but wonder whther this is because everyone was acting as competently as he portrays them, or whether his reporting is designed to facilitate future access to this administration, widely viewed by the press as paranoid about negative images. If journalism is the first draft of history, then I suspect this book will not be deemed very useful a few years out. There is no analysis or critique of the administration, and everything they tell Woodward is taken at face value. Minute and unimportant troop deployments are covered in as much detail as much larger issues. The book seems like an effort to picture Bush as &quot;in charge&quot; and acting competently, without any reflection on the wisdom of the direction they are taking the country. As the book ends in late summer 1992, there is virtually nothing on how Iraq became Enemy No. 1, or the policy reasons behind that switch. And Woodward has an annoying fondness for the one-sentence paragraph.All in all, of the eight or nine books I have read touching on 9/11 issues, this was the least satisfying, but it was certainly not totally devoid of value. As a useful counterpart on how a seemingly competent, in-charge administration, fueled on hubris and a willingness to assert American power, can get us into a load of trouble, Halberstram's &quot;The Best and the Brightest&quot; is worth a read. The trouble now is that this crew is neither the best nor the brightest."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward's intent was to provide a snapshot of the post-9/11 year of the Bush administration by talking to as many insiders as he could and recording their on-the-spot actions and observations.

A wonderful read that proves--much to the dismay of his detractors--that President Bush is indeed a very smart man. He has proven that he's smart enough to surround himself with brilliant people, listen to their wise counsel, and then act with force and foresight. Additionally, Woodward performs a useful public service as he sheds light on the President's human side. The decision as to how to respond to attacks such as the ones we suffered on 9/11 (which by the way followed dozens of other such attacks over the past few decades) is vexing, but Mr. Bush has shown himself to be up to the task. Hats off to Mr. Woodward for this important record."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"It pains me to see this book billed at the \\"inside truth\\" written be an \\"outsider/liberal.\\"Over the years since his Watergate score, Woodward has morphed from investigative journalist to consumate insider. His access here was vetted by Karl Rove, Andrew Card, Ken Mehlman -- the henchmen inner circle. These people work in secret, allow no real press access (just ask the reporters), and politicize every act and statement that comes out of the White House, i.e. everything is a calculation to make Bush look good and to stay in power.So here comes Woodward, with his rep and Washington Post connection, the perfect guy to give Bush statue with doubter and critics from the center/left. The whole thing is a \\"set up\\" calculated to sell Bush, and at the same time give Woodward a a big book, bucks, and a new basis for getting his face on TV.Is it the truth? Woodward wouldn't get within shouting distance of Bush or any other \\"insider\\" interviewed if he was a free thinker and truthteller. No, he gets in becausehe's \\"reliable\\", \\"they\\" can depend on him. Is Woodward a liberal? Hell no. He's pure establishment and self-serving to boot.Sure, some of the stuff is interesting. And the book is a decent read. But in the end, it's just a piece of establishment propaganda. Woodward is just another of the \\"insiders\\" who take good care of each other and pipe out the \\"newspeak\\" calculated to keep us feeling alright.

Woodward offers NO real investigation, NO real depth, and NO real insight into an administration that has so diligently shrouded itself in secrecy (while so effectively engaging in new heights of deception).It doesn't surprise me in the least that Woodward was given full access to the Whitehouse, since this book offers little beyond the unsubstantive \\"rah-rah\\" pro-Bush cheerleading that the mainstream media has been engaging in since Bush took office (Ari Fleisher and his minions in the Whitehouse Press office could have written this book themselves!). Although Woodward is certainly a talented writer, this book is little more than pro-Bush P.R. and spin. Uncritical fans of George W.

I come away with a slightly better view of Condi Rice."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bush At War by Bob Woodward (2002) presents a detailed record of President George W. Bush. The book catalogs the events of the first one hundred days following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Woodward does not present an outward thesis and also does not pass any ascertainable judgment or analysis on the events or decisions made by Bush or the National Security Council (NSC). The book serves primarily as a documentary which was written promptly following the terrorists attack and therefore at the time of publication had very little historical context.Woodward writes from an insider's perspective but freely admits in his \\"Note to Readers\\" how he obtained his information, thoughts, conclusions and actions by the primary actors in the text. The interview methodology was problematic due to the time span between actions, decisions and interviews. In this context (many officials were still serving the President) the interviewee is apt to relay information, thoughts and actions favorable to him or herself ignoring poor decisions or contrary opinions or others.Woodward does an acceptable job with his presentation of issues and narrates in a manner consistent with fact based presentation. The author evenly establishes the tenor and tone of the NSC and Principal's meetings portraying areas of agreement and disagreement within the Bush Administration. The narrative highlights many questions posed by Principals, of which there were no substantive answers at the time. The internal disagreements surfaced in debate both in front and external of the President. The subtle debate alludes to friction within the NSC where individuals are advancing their individual views, ideology and agendas.Students interested in foreign policy and the application of military force in support of national interests should read this book for several reasons. First, the author allows the reader examine how foreign policy is formed and how it can be changed based on sudden and direct threats to national interests. The book includes highlights of the President of the United States as a central actor in the NSC but also demonstrate other actors having significant influences on the scope and direction of a particular policy. The main influences of focus by the author are public sentiment, legal Presidential authority, international perception and diplomacy. All of these key influences serve to focus what ends are achievable and therefore shape the resultant policy. The process and the speed in which the administration had to make key decisions on policy with long term impact demonstrates despite study, formulas and theory, the process at which policy is arrived at is much more fluid.Secondly, ten years after publication, the book can now be viewed in some historical context and provides the reader information to measure and judge the decisions during those one-hundred days after September 2001. Examination of the results of the policies and decisions made at the time illustrate how the Bush Doctrine worked and how the doctrine caused problems for long term U.S interests."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is such a great book to read and remember 9/11 and the aftermath with.

Now as for his administration, I can't say the same. Wolfowitz should receive a-hole of the century award. Rumseld that of the millenium. and Cheney, of all time. Either way this book does a great job of illustrating the facts with minimal (minimal, not zero, especially towards the end) bias. The great thing about this is that it's an easy read, I zipped through it sometimes getting through 100 pages in just a couple of hours. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Whether you are Republican or Democrat, a fan of GW or not, Woodward's account is the way to go if you are seeking to understand the steps that led to the conflict in Afghanistan. Woodward, as always, presents a clear, comprehensive \\"backstage pass\\" into the discussions that led to the decision to invade Afghanistan in the wake of September 11 as well as President Bush's initial reaction to the terrorist attack. This book, it could be argued, depicts the Bush Administration at its finest point, yet, as with all of Woodward's book, presents the various strengths and weaknesses of the President and his advisors through rigorous interviews with the VIPs themselves.Key Ideas from Bush at War:-Bush is very hands-on in meetings of the principals, being very decisive, which can be viewed as both a positive (rendering decision) and negative (constraining debate and free expression)-The key principals involved in the Afghanistan decision were Rumsfeld and Cheney, with Tenet playing a roll in initial facilitation of the conflict.-Colin Powell was largely ostracized from a great deal of decisions (this would later be compounded in the Iraq war debate).-Connections to Iraq were not found by the principals; President Bush initially called upon the principals to disregard Iraq for the time being.-The Vice-Presidency of Dick Cheney was at its peak, taking into mind collective information about the office.-President Bush refused to commit to any plan not on the scope of a \\"global war on terror.\\"On the whole, this is another masterpiece of Woodward's, portraying President Bush as a strong decisive leader in a critical time of our nation's history. While it is clear debate was constrained and Bush largely had a set path to follow, reviews of Bush's leadership are largely positive in this decision alone. Woodward again extends beyond partisanship, however, in allowing the reader to analyze all the facts in order to arrive at his or her own decision as to Bush's leadership capabilities at this point in time."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is an exceedingly good book,at least in the original form.(I have the hardback; haven't read the \\"additional chapter\\" in the paperback.)

Good quotes from key players that will live on, too.Well-written, insightful, objective, revealing.5 stars."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Whether you fan or detractor of President Bush, this book arguably provides the most balanced perspective on the inner-workings of the Bush Whitehouse after 9/11. It is a compelling read by a well respected author."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I was listening to the morning meetings on the war the day after I purchased this book. A senator was addressing the panel which included the head of the CIA, FBI, General Franks and others. The senator said he had just read the book and stated that the reading briefed him better than any other meeting in the White House ever had on a situation of importance. He posed the question, When are we going to stop the publishing of such important inside information on the operations of government that can be read by anyone. Bob Woodward only sites from original documents, and first hand accounts and interviews. It is a must read if you want to have an opinion that is well educated. Unfortunately this is not an education you can receive by listening to the news."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"One can say that the difference between a newspaper and a history book is that a newspaper is useless the next day, but a history book stays relevant for years afterwards. Following this logic, I would classify Woodward's \\"Bush at War\\" as closer to a newspaper than a history book. Reading it in 2009, the contents of this book are essentially old hat; no great insight, no stunning revelations that has not already been expounded upon in other books or in other news media. Even the context of the book; a recount of the first 100 days after the 9/11 attacks, lacks depth and critical analysis. There is no mention of the \\"Project for the New American Century\\" and how many of the decisions within the first 100 days stem from this critical document. There is also little mention of what goes on between Congress and the Bush White House. The passage of the Patriot Act gets minimal coverage; even though it was probably the biggest piece of legislation passed in that first 100 days. So too are the details of the anthrax attacks; a reporter of Woodward's salt should have suspected something when the the two key roadblocks of the Patriot Act in the US Senate, Daschle and Leahy, were the only government recipients of the anthrax letters. So overall, an OK book. I expected better from such a respected author."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I picked up Bob Woodward's \\"Bush at War\\" when I was looking for an objective telling of how Bush got into and approached the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are too many partisan accounts that say Bush is all right or all wrong and I was looking for less politics and more information. This book provides that in great and sometimes tedious detail.This book is focused on the period from just before 9-11-01 to prior to the Bush administration's going to war in Iraq, but after the Congress gave the Bush administration the authority to unilaterally do what it felt was required there. The book ends with Bush awaiting UN enforcement of the many Iraq-related resolutions. This is 90% focused on Afghanistan, NOT IRAQ.Richard Clarke's highly critical book on Bush and his alleged lack of attention to terrorism prior to 9/11 came out while I was reading this book Surprisingly enough, Clarke is not mentioned at all in the Bush at War book in spite of his being the head of the Counter-Terrorism office in the White House.The first quarter of \\"Bush at War\\" did a nice job of taking me back to the emotional shock of the Trade Tower attacks and the virtually universal feeling in America of patriotism and joining together. The remainder of the story describes in repetitive detail the frequent meetings among the White House principals, (with and without Bush) regarding what kind of response was appropriate, what was achievable and when could it be done. Logistically they found it difficult to reopen old intelligence contacts in Afghanistan and get men and material over there. I was surprised out how difficult the logistics are in fighting a war all the way around the world. Woodward does not clear up the question of whether Bush was on point regarding terrorism prior to 9/11 but makes it clear that it was taken very seriously after, to the point where the subject honed Bush's vision of what he wants to accomplish with his Presidency.Some key points from the book.*Iraq is discussed in the White House early on after 9/11 but is not the main topic, Al-Quada is and the Taliban's support of them. The Taliban is not even the prime initial target for retaliation; in fact they are offered an out by turning over Bin Laden and the rest of the leadership.*This book does not make it clear that an Iraq invasion was on the Bush agenda upon inauguration. However, Rumsfeld suggests possibly attacking Iraq or somewhere in the Far East to demonstrate the far reach of the US military and to scare the terrorists, especially when it becomes clear that the military had no initial plan or assets to exploit in Afghanistan. No one else went for that idea.*Bush comes off as decisive, inclusive and even open-minded during the discussion phases. He is heavily involved in the \\"you are for us, or you are against us\\" position on terrorism that came out early after 9/11. He is involved in tactical discussions and keeps the team focused and confident.*Cheney and Rumsfeld are the uber-hawks, pushing the ultimately prevailing position that the possibility of a devastating second terrorist attack against the US, either domestically or internationally, required the adoption of the declared preemption policy. They are the prime proponents behind the decision to eventually invade Iraq.* Powell was not as much a part of the real inner circle as Cheney and Rumsfeld were (and are still). Powell is more independent and less trusted.This is more similar to an in-depth newspaper piece than a novel in terms of readability. Woodward could have described the discussions leading to policy formulation and then used hindsight to report where they were right or wrong. I would have liked more conclusions rather than just fact reporting. Another difficulty was keeping track of the passage of time. A timeline running along the top of the pages would have been helpful in this type of account. As it was I frequently had to flip around to reconfirm where I was in the calendar of events.Bottom line, \\"Bush at War\\" is a well researched book with good sources clearly evident, that is not pushing a political agenda. He needs to do another one focused on Bush in Iraq."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward, who was a major player in breaking the Nixon Watergate scandal and also wrote the book-made-into-movie, \\"All the Presidents Men,\\" writes his account of President George W. Bush's presidency during the first 100 days after the attacks on the two World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001. Conscientiously fair, Woodward has put together a quite comprehensive behind-the-scenes documentary-style book that reveals a full-disclosure look at the Bush war cabinet, their meetings and interactions with one another, interviews with the President and much more.Of interest to those who seek authenticity, this book will make you feel like a fly on the wall. According to Woodward, Bush at War includes: \\"contemporaneous notes taken during more than 50 National Security Council and other meeting where the most important decisions were discussed and made.\\" Additionally, Woodward states that he \\"interviewed more than 100 people involved in the decision making and execution of the war [in Afghanistan], including President Bush\\" (4 hours of interviews), \\"key war cabinet members, the White House staff, and officials serving at various levels of the Defense and State Departments and the CIA.\\" Needless to say, a great deal of investigative effort was put into this book, which can be said of all Mr. Woodward's books.I read Bush at War about a year-and-a-half ago, and after much time and reflection, I am amazed at the amount of access to the Administration that Woodward was given. I found this to be rather astonishing, as it was almost certainly an unprecedented move by a world leader in terms of permitting the scope and freedom that Woodward enjoyed. At the time this book was originally published, Bush at War contained a good deal of secret information from the war effort in Afghanistan. No doubt the reason for such trust in Woodward comes from his reputation for fair and impartial reporting, his unmatched investigative skills, and his astute journalistic credentials.But enough about Woodward.From the beginning, we are familiarized with the key players involved in post-9/11 war planning subsequent to the terrorist attacks. Woodward begins the story of that sunny Tuesday on 9/11 by going through the events of that morning through then CIA director George Tenet's perspective, leading to the urgently ominous, \\"Mr. Director, there's a serious problem.\\" From there, the previously untold story of how Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rice, Rumsfeld, and Tenet dealt with the worst attack on America unfolds before your very eyes.As I've alluded in my opening statements, this book reads like a documentary to me. I can visualize much of the book as if I were reading a transcript from a hypothetical movie that could've been named \\"100 Days After.\\" But one of the most interesting and even intriguing things about this book is not just the details of the book itself, but the perspective with which people have read it and reviewed it. There is such a contrast in what people have gotten from it, and the opinions that have been formed after reading it. It is a perfect example for me that the term \\"what you find depends mostly on what you look for\\" has a resounding ring of truth; especially when the subject matter involves political figures. But it's really a testament to Bob Woodward in this instance, because it shows to me just how impartial the book really is. Most, if not all the information that those who've read the book were looking for is provided; and most importantly, we are judiciously left to make our own informed decisions and judgments on how we feel about what took place in the Bush White House subsequent to the 9/11 attacks.For instance, there are conversations about Iraq that provide some insight into the President's feelings on the subject. These quotes are surprisingly candid and really provide more answers on his reasoning for deciding to liberate (or \\"liberate\\" for those who prefer the insinuation) Iraq. You will read just what Bush's vision for the world is, in his own words. What's priceless about it is that they're direct quotes that haven't been filtered by spinsters or the PC police. It's raw George W. Bush like you've never witnessed before; and that means that you will love him or hate him even more than you already do. For those that hate him, you will find more reasons to hate him. For those that love him, you will find more reasons to love him. It has plenty of \\"red meat\\" for everybody, regardless of political persuasion; and that's a good thing in my view. There's nothing worse than reporting that biased and intended to shape your opinions to the political right or left; because that's not really reporting, that's called propaganda. Bush at War is the real deal, un-salted and raw. It's up to you to spice it, cook it, chew it, digest it, and decide if it sits well with you or not.For added entertainment, here are just a few notable quotes that stood out for me:Bush on Iraq:\\"Action was not for strategic purposes or defensive purposes, [Bush] said. \` You see...Condi didn't want me to talk about it (Iraq). We'll see whether this bears out, [but] clearly there will be a strategic implication to a regime change in Iraq, if we go forward. But there's something beneath that, as far as I'm concerned, and that is, there is immense suffering.' \\"\\"As we think through Iraq, we may or may not attack. I have no idea yet. But it will be for the objective of making the world more peaceful.\\"Bush on North Korea's leader:\\"...\`I loathe Kim Jong Il!' Bush shouted, waving his finger in the air. \`I've got a visceral reaction to this guy, because he is starving his people...' \\"Bush on unilateralism: \\"I mean, you know, if you want to hear resentment, just listen to the word unilateralism. I mean, that's resentment. If somebody wants to try and to say something ugly about us, \`Bush is a unilateralist, America is unilateral.' You know, which I find amusing. But I'm also-I've been to meetings where there a kind of \`we must not act until we're all in agreement.' \\" He continues, \\"...well, we're never going to get people all in agreement about force and the use of force. But action--confident action that will yield positive results provides kind of a slipstream into which reluctant nations and leaders can get behind...\\"Woodward on Cheney and Powell:\\"Cheney and Powell went at each other in a blistering argument. It was Powell's internationalism versus Cheney's unilateralism.\\"Condi on Nukes:\\"I've been in this business for a long time and people always underestimate the time, they rarely overestimate the time [it will take a country to become capable of building nuclear weapons]. If we're wrong and we had four or five or six years before he posed a nuclear threat, then we just went in early. If anyone willing to wait is wrong, then we wake up in two or three years, and Saddam has a nuclear weapon and is brandishing it in the most volatile region in the world. So which of these chances do you want to take? The lesson of September 11: Take care of threats early.\\"Bush on his role:\\"I'm the commander--see, I don't need to explain--I do not need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being the president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation.\\""},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Who can chronicle a major event in world history better than Bob Woodward? Once again, Woodward is at the center of the storm, sharing minute details of the early stages of President Bush's War on Terror.I was very pleased with Woodward's objective approach. He didn't take a knee-jerk liberal or conservative bent--he just told the story. Obviously, his view of Rumsfeld may be a bit skewed because of limited access and yet pays him the respect he is due.I particularly enjoy Woodward's deep bios of the main characters. I learned information about each member of the cabinet and I feel better informed for having read the book.The biggest surprise of this book: the role of Condi Rice. Bob made it obviously clear how large a role she plays in this administration. I left feeling that she could one day run the country and had a keen sense of responsibility, leadership, and faith.The only flaw is the subtle insistence that Bush is in over his heels. I think every writer is tempted to buy into the conservatives-must-be-dumb theory. For the most part, he gives Bush enormous credit and lets the American people understand that he is a man on a mission.This is an extremely enlightning book and gives a real insider's account. Buy it and put it on your nightstand."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Love him, hate him, voted for him, voted for Gore, didn't vote in 2000, none of that matters one spec. The fact of the matter is, this candid look at our President shows that he might have acted with more bravado and character than most of us-not all of us, but certainly most of us. I suggest reading this one. It's a good and honest perspective-from a liberal-that's semi-flattering to the compassionate conservative."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This is a facinating look at how the President, his staff, and the CIA handled the response to the 9/11 tragedy. Hopefully, people will not politicize this, and will read the book and judge the current administration's response in an fair and unbiased way.Personally, it gives me a great deal more confidence in the president; particularly in the way he handled the different opinions among his staff. He did not go off half-cocked in any direction, and he used his people to the utmost benefit to the country. At the same time, he was decisive and action orientedin getting the job done quickly and right. Our enemies were made to pay for what they did. He did not \\"pound sand\\", as he puts it, by fruitlessly wasting our resources on meaningless use of war resources.The cost of the war in Afganistan was amazingly small for everyone except the Taliban and al Qaida. All Americans should sleep a little better after reading this."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"A detailed account of the decision making process that went into the preparation and ultimate victory of the war in Afghanistan. The book's primary focus revolves around the war planning and execution meetings for the invasion and overthrow of the Taliban.Woodward provides a thorough, reputable, account that which largely focuses on Rumsfeld, Powell, Tenet (CIA), Cheney, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.I don't recommend that political ideologues (right-wing conservatives or left-wing liberals) read this as it is too objective and does not pander to either ideology. Woodward has no axe to grind. As a political moderate, I felt the book revealed that Bush was more in tune to the decision making process than most press accounts give him credit for. It also shows a President who operates an efficient, executive style White House.However, it also discloses his vulnerabilities. Most significant is his lack of ability to second guess himself-what he calls making all his decisions \\"without regrets\\" and based on his \\"gut\\". His lack of deep reflection, simplistic world view, and bouts of unsubstantiated confidence will trouble many.The clandestine detail Woodward provides is impressive and the most revealed thus far. He details CIA involvement with the Northern Alliance and the \\"boots on the ground\\" efforts to wage a propaganda war using secret ops, food, and suitcases of money.Woodward appears to have had much more traditional access to the Bush White House and as a result it hasn't rattled White House insiders like many of his other books (The Choice, The Agenda, All the President's Men).While more extensive accounts will be written as history shakes out, this is a great initial work into the decision making process. It gives the reader insight into the personalities and styles of Bush and his \\"principals\\". I came away enlightened by the knowledge Woodward provided on the inner workings of the Bush White House."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Woodward is an international media legend. The cause of his world renown was, of course, unearthing the Watergate scandal, leading to the eventual resignation of a president. Because of his long tenure at the Washington Post and reputation as a \`pure' reporter, we expect great things from this man; at least reporting the facts in a bipartisan fashion. In Bush at War, he focuses on the Bush administrations response to 9/11 in the form of the invasion of Afghanistan, as many have deemed the \\"forgotten war\\". Woodward reveals an administration, at times, hysterically grasping at a way to attain some kind of retribution for 9/11. A war cabinet at odds with each other, all seeming to have their own agendas, and in the end, after Afghanistan was supposedly won; only a few al Qaeda terrorists were captured, (16 of the top 22 leaders were still at large, and the arch enemy, bin Laden, well hidden and laughing at us from his secret hideaway) though the oppressive Taliban was disbanded, ironically and sadly, Afghanistan still remains a potential haven for al Qaeda terrorists.One should not include this text as just another \`Bush bashing' exercise, because the president is depicted as a passionate and determined leader, albeit inexperienced, hell-bent on bringing those responsible for 9'11 to justice. Woodward skilfully puts the reader in the shoes of the president, and we feel his anger, frustration and one-eyed goal for retribution. The president's cabinet, however, are depicted as mostly floundering during the crises, fighting with one another, vying for power, in the pursuit of their own particular goals. The vice president is a crafty fellow, a smiling political assassin, so to speak, while Rumsfield is depicted as your basic playground bully. There is a scene in the book where Rumsfield pokes his finger with force into Woodward's chest during an interview, pushing the reporter off balance - this action speaks worlds. As an administrator, Rumsfield is meticulous, arrogant and definitely not a team player, (my way or no way) and, to my mind, holds the majority of responsibility for the current mess in Afghanistan and the present \\"quagmire\\" situation we now have in Iraq. Technically, the buck stops with the president, though Rumsfield has a lot to answer for...Although not emphatically stated, Bush at War begs the question: did Afghanistan accomplish anything in terms of combating terrorism? Is the world a safer place as a result of many lives lost and literarily millions of dollars spent on bribing the Afghani Northern Alliance? Well, the answer is in the results - and they speak for themselves.Woodward's book is by no means a revelation about this administration. One has only to look out the window, turn on the television or open a newspaper, to see where this administration is leading us. However I recommend this text as a close as possible \`true' historical record of the Afghanistan \`incursion', and how the military machine operates in war conditions."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Love him or hate him, George Bush is running a unique White House. His team stays unnervingly tightly on message, fights their battles mostly in private (one gets the sneaking suspicion that public Powell- Rumsfeld disagreements are really Bush trial balloons), is far less susceptible to leaks, and effectively changes decision in the face of adversity.If you don't like Bush, this book will appear to be glossing over his lack of intellectual curiosity, the macho bravado of his decision-making process, and the extent to which he is a creature of the political interests that backed him in his run for office. I short, if you're a liberal and not of the \\"inside baseball\\" political junkie type, your money is best spent elsewhere as this book will just disgust you.If you do like Bush, you will see here our \\"Top Gun\\" president (though I thought the aircraft carrier photo op was more of a \\"Luke Skywalker at the end of the first Star Wars\\" production) making decisive decisions, backing his people fully, and creating day-by-day the conditions necessary for victory.If you're a political professional, student of politics, or lover of a good group dynamics exegesis, you will greatly enjoy this work for its exploration of all the inside dirt, machinations, and organizational behavior quirks of the world's most powerful office politics.Obviously there are limits to what even the most diligent of journalists can re-create. And this particular perception of events is surely wrong in its particulars in many places. But as a whole, it hangs together very well, and it seems to comport with the dozens of other stories about the functionings, foibles, and folks at the White House.There is not much in this book for the anti-Bush crowd to like. Woodward, who can hardly be called a Republican stooge, does not portray a goose-stepping Bush taking orders from a shadowy secret cabal of oil industry plutocrats while blowing his nose alternately into the Bill of Rights, the French flag, and the UN Charter.Woodward gets inside and gets the story. He shows Condoleeza Rice again and again playing intramural referee. He not only gets the basic Rumsfeld - Powell tensions, but also shows how each man, by virtue of his background, predilections, and character, *must* be who they are.No, this is not grand biography on the sacle of a Chernow or a Caro, and the writing is easy, brisk, and clear. Given the subject matter, time to produce, salience, and access, though, Woodward has scored a real hit.Woodward quite reasonably focuses on six principals: Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Tenet & Rice. This is a simplification and we are certainly missing the slightly broader backstory in which the two dozen closest aides to those six jockey, wiggle, horsetrade and backstab as they provide, deny and spin information to their superiors. But it is a necessary and reasonable simplification that shows us the broader truths. And Woodward provides enough glimpses of these backstage battles to feel real.Other excellently handled vignettes include the lonely CIA operative in Afghanistan and the essential diplomacy pursued with Pakistan in the weeks after 9/11.Again, this book is for the political junkie or the partisan Republican only, our friends on the other side of the aisle would be best off saving their money for something less vexing.Anybody who has experience with small group dynamics will be fascinated by this account at that level alone. I'm certain that Woodward's skill could make a Nebraska state party convention seem just as riveting. The stakes involved amplify the importance, interest and our enjoyment, of the story."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Once again Bob Woodward has written an unbiased book which tells you what really happened. And you learn some fascinating details such as \\"The realities at the beginning of the 21st century were two: the possibility of another massive, surprise terrorist attack similar to September 11, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - biological, chemical or nuclear. Should the two converge in the hands of terrorists or a rogue state, the United States could be attacked and tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. In addition, the president and his team had found that protecting and sealing the U.S. homeland was basically impossible. Even with heightened security and the national terrorist alerts, the country was only marginally safer.\\"This one quote explains why we went to war with Afghanistan, Iraq, and soon other countries as well.

Bush\\" by David Frum which is an obviously pro-Bush book."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Edit of 22 Dec 07 to add links. We now know that Dick Cheney has hijacked the Presidency and subverted Article 1 of the Constitution for eight years and all the way back to the Ford Administration. The question begs to be asked: why on earth are the Democratic contenders ignoring the need for both Electoral Reform, and impeachment of Dick Cheney?-----As America confronts the very real probability that the Administration manipulated and distorted and fabricated intelligence in order to go to war against Iraq, and as calls rise for the impeachment of the President and the Vice President (the one naive, the other conniving), this book takes on added value--Bob Woodward has done a superb job of documenting both the \\"keystone cops\\" nature of the Administration's \\"strategic deliberations\\", and the very specific manner in which Paul Wolfowitz (too controversial to be Secretary of Defense but a power in his own right) guided the Bush team toward a war on Iraq as a \\"solution\\" to problems they could not deal with directly, to wit, the war on terrorism.There is an Alice in Wonderland quality to this book--or more properly stated, to the conversations that are quoted among the principals. Their wandering short-hand conversations, the degree to which the President is mis-led about our capabilities, the inability of the Secretary of Defense to answer a direct question, always having to go back to his office for an answer--the entire book is, as one reviewer suggests, practically a recount of a handful of recollections about scattered conversations, as if the center of the world were one room in the White House, and nothing outside those walls really mattered. It is also somewhat revisionist--as I recall from published news at the time, all of the principals wanted to delay the taking of Kabul until the spring, and it was President Putin of Russia, speaking directly to President Bush, who made the case, based on his superior intelligence sources on the ground, for how quickly Kabul would fall, leading to the US acceptance of rapid advances by the Afghan warlords. The absence of this essential and openly known fact casts doubt on the entire process of writing the book, and how information was researched and selected for inclusion.There are, however, some major gems that make a careful reading of this book very worthwhile and I list them for consideration by other readers:1) The Directorate of Intelligence does not appear as a listed player--CIA special operations rather than CIA analysis appears to have been the DCI's best card to play;2) The clandestine service, as Dewey Claridge notes in concluding his \\"Spy for All Seasons,\\" died in the 1990's, with only 12 case officers in one year's class--the book misrepresents the increase from 12 to 120 as stellar--it was actually a return to the norm before a series of mediocre leaders destroyed the Directorate of Operations;3) The CIA had been \\"after\\" bin Laden for five years prior to 9-11, the DCI even \\"declaring war\\" on him, to zero effect. Worse, post 9-11 investigations determined that bin Laden had been planning the 9-11 attack for two years without any substantive hint being collected by U.S. intelligence--and at the end of the book, Rumsfeld reflects on how the three major surprises against the U.S. prior to 9-11 not only happened without U.S. intelligence detecting them, but we did not learn of them for five to thirteen years *after the fact* (page 320);4) Presidential-level communications stink--the Secretary of State could not talk to the President when flying back for seven hours from Latin America, and the National Security Advisor could not get a reliable secure connection to the President from her car right in Washington, D.C.5) The Secret Service idea of security for Presidential relatives in a time of crisis is to take them to the nearest Federal Center--the kind that got blown up in Oklahoma.6) Throughout the discussions, it was clear to the principals that the U.S. military is designed to find and destroy fixed physical targets with obvious signatures; it cannot do--it is incompetent at--finding mobile targets, whether vehicles or individuals (cf. page 174)...and of course as General Clark documented in his book, and David Halberstam repeats in his most recent tome, and as the principals learned again vis a vis Afghanistan, the U.S. Army does not do mountains.There are three remarkable aspects of this story, only one even remotely hinted at in the book: we failed to get bin Laden. The CIA went to Afghanistan with the right orders: \\"bin Laden dead or alive.\\" They promptly forgot their orders and settled for spending $70M to play soldier. The two stories that are not told in this book, but are clearly apparent: 1) Russia saved the day, both for the CIA and for the Department of Defense; and 2) Saudi Arabia never came up as a serious problem that needed to be dealt with sooner than later.Finally, and this only became clear to me after the early months of 2003 when the obsession of a few people in the Administration brought the world to a crisis over Iraq, the book provides really excellent documentation of how a tiny minority, led by Paul Wolfowitz, basically pushed the President to treat Iraq as an alternative to substantive action on global terrorists networks, and the book documents how the uniformed leadership of the Pentagon clearly opposed this line of thinking that is unsupported by intelligence, either on Iraq, or on the relative threat of Iraq (not imminent) in relation to many other threats that are both more imminent and more costly if not addressed now.This is a useful book, worthy of reading, but the real story with all the details will not be known for some time. However, in the aftermath of the failed effort in Iraq, and the clear and compelling evidence that the American people and Congress were deceived about the Iraq threat, this book has an added luster, an added value, and become a \\"must read.\\"Other books (see also my lists, one on Evaluating Dick Cheney, the other on The Case for Impeachment).Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American PresidencyRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About ItBreach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into InsidersThe Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)Independents Day: Awakening the American SpiritDay of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America ApartThe Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for AllA Power Governments Cannot SuppressDemocracy's Edge: Choosing to Save Our Country by Bringing Democracy to LifeSociety's Breakthrough!: Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People"},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Many of the reviews posted here say more about the reviewer's politics than they do about the book. Ignore them. What makes this work so compelling is that it provides genuine insight into the workings of our government. Rarely is such access available while an administration is still in power, and the war itself still unfolding.Some reviewers have criticized the book for the level of detail it provides in, for example, covering what was actually said in NSC meetings. But I think that's essential. We all know the outcome; the interesting bit is learning how and why the administration made the decisions it did. Too often history is presented as a neat little story with a bow on top. Here we see history as it is actually made: with incomplete information, conflicting views, unprepared agencies, foreign nations both helping and seeking advantage, and all the other messy details of the real world. Woodward makes all this tension and uncertainty come alive.I do have one complaint, though. The people who gave Woodward interviews (Bush, Powell, Rice, Tenet) consistently fared better than those who did not (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz). To some extent that's inevitable -- if you won't tell your own story, someone else will tell it for you, and less charitably. But one gets the impression that Woodward has it in for Rumsfeld. The book portrays him as consistently unprepared and uninformed, in contravention to everything else I've read about him. One wonders: has Woodward exposed Rumsfeld as a Wizard of Oz, or is he just nursing some personal grudge? It's hard to tell.The surprise winner in this tale is CIA Director George Tenet, who seems always to have ideas, information, and options at the ready. This is in sharp contrast to the Pentagon, which was alarmingly unprepared for action.Overall, the book is an incredibly gripping, engaging story of what actually happened in the immediate aftermath of 9/11."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"I must admit my reading of Bob Woodward's Bush at War leaves me troubled.At a time when we are being asked to place our children in harm's way, in a part of the world that few of us have even visited, serious policy questions come to mind; questions that Bob Woodward could have appropriately addressed in a book of this nature. Rather, we are given a blow-by-blow account of the stage entrances and exits of key Washington players reconstructed from interviews and notes of the players.Instead of a thoughtful review of the questions raised, we are treated to theater-like criticism of the players. Instead of finishing the book with conclusions like \\"this is, or is not, the proper foreign policy for the world's only super power,\\" we are left with conclusions like \\"Bush is focused,\\" \\"Bush is in charge,\\" \\"Condoleezza Rice plays an important role on the team,\\" \\"Dick Cheney, a hardliner, did not appear to cooperate with the reporter\\" and \\"Donald Rumsfeld is a crafty agitator.\\"These are conclusions I can draw from reading my daily newspaper. I recognize that television's pervasive influence has forced other media outlets to adapt a tabloid view of the world in order to compete for eyeballs. The type of book I want to read takes longer to prepare, if it is going to be done well. Clearly Bob Woodward and his publisher did not have that luxury. The market was hot; the holiday book selling season was upon us. Clearly a newspaper, like the Washington Post where the author serves as Assistant Managing Editor, provides the best medium to distribute this type of detailed reporting, but then again, that would cut out the book publisher.It is at times like this when I recognize how old fashioned I have become. Quality reporting belongs in the pages of a quality daily newspaper where it can be published in a timely fashion; books should be reserved for the policy questions raised by that reporting.Please excuse me while I hone the tip of my quill pen."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Bob Woodward released \\"Bush at War\\" in 2002 before much of the long term results/failures of the \\"global war on terrorism\\" had been determined. What is presented is a detailed review of the Bush Administrations development of a vision and strategy to combat a situation the United States was woefully unprepared to fight.Bob Woodward presents the administration as focused immediately after the 9/11 attacks, striving to balance a strategically sound response and develop a long term strategy against the enemy. The government was mobilized and the world was willing to help. Although Bush's intentions were good, and his plan noble, \\"Bush at War\\" presents an administration better suited at raising questions about broad stroke issues, rather than a defined strategy with clear goals.Tenet and Powell seemed to offer the best advice early on in the development of our response (in my view), but Bush seemed to try to incorporate ideas from everybody in his cabinet which resulted in a disorganized action plan. Bush's impatience with an answer to the attacks sent our country down a path in Afghanistan that relied on luck and \\"by the seat of our pants\\" action. Thankfully the first half of the goal was achieved.I was left feeling better about the Presidents vision after reading this book, but very concerned about the lack of effective strategic leadership in the cabinet. Rumsfeld comes off as a dictator and lunatic. Cheney is hardly mentioned until the end when the Iraq issue begins to gain prominence. Powell was very much on the outside of the inner circle with Rice as the referee. There is not much hope that there was one unified agenda, although the President did his best to try and make the right decisions.The information is good and fair, but the reading is very dry with too much \\"..then they did this...\\" and \\"...then he said this...\\". An important book and I look forward to reading part 2 \\"Plan of Attack\\""},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Be prepared for an indepth look inside the National Security Council meetings and an unbiased perspective of how the major players in the Bush administration directed the attack of the Taliban and terrorist infastructure in Afghanistan. Also be prepared to be frustrated. While there is abundant information and quotes, it will fly at you fast and Woodward does not summarize or give his analysis (mostly because he wants to leave no footprint on the story only facts)."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"This book is about the beginning of the counterattack against terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks of 9-11. Therefore, the primary coverage is of the war in Afghanistan and it describes only the initial, internal discussions of the war with Iraq. As usual, Woodward demonstrates his ability to access authoritative sources within the U. S. government, so we learn much about the deliberations concerning how to respond. He also writes well, the prose is easy to follow and extremely informative.The principles of Bush's war cabinet fall within the expected camps, Colin Powell as Secretary of State is wary of extending the war too far, leading to unintended and possibly dangerous consequences. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney are hawks, pushing for the war to be extended beyond Afghanistan and ultimately to Iraq. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice is often also a hawk, but at times leans more towards the Powell position. As is always the case in Washington, there are shifting positions, as people consider their careers, their position in history, how they appear to the public and what is in the best interests of the country.Without question, this book could be only the first volume in what should be a two-volume work. Victory in Afghanistan was easy, but the country still remains ungovernable. Iraq was invaded and the regime of Saddam Hussein easily overthrown. However, at the time this review was written, U. S. troops were still being killed in Iraq and there was no viable exit strategy in sight. Therefore, this book tells a tale of success, but it is only a preliminary one. The final chapters are yet to be written and most likely will not tell as happy a tale. I hope that Woodward also writes that book and I eagerly await the opportunity to read it."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Where are they heading for? What's their goal? If you are looking for a textbook that tells you the decision-making system in the Bush Administration, you should read 'Bush at War.'Written by Bob Woodward, a well-known journalist and also the writer of 'the Commanders,'etc., it clearly describes how foreign policy was made in the White House after the 9/11th attacks, citing, for example,struggles between Donald Rumsfeld and other hawkish guys and dovish Powell over foeign policy and war plans. It's as if he had eavesdropped on the White House. After reading this, you might be able to predict where the Administration will move ahead and what ramifications they will bring about for your own country and also for the world in the future."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"On page 242, Bob Woodward writes \\"[Deputy national security advisor Steve] Hadley, taking notes in a steno pad, was thinking that they were having too many meetings that week. Fatigue was starting to show.\\" I found this book somewhat fatiguing too, and for much the same reason.There's no question that Bob Woodward is a Very Important Journalist who writes Very Important Books that Everyone Reads. But that doesn't guarantee an exciting read, and this one took some effort to slog through. Though the first section, chronicling the President and his staff's immediate reactions to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, have a certain excitement and immediacy (I read the first 70 pages in one sitting), that pace is not sustained as Woodward takes us to meeting after meeting after meeting. Indeed, \\"met\\" -- as in, \\"attended a meeting\\" -- is probably the most frequently used word in this book, with \\"said\\" a close second. While important things are happening in the wide world, this book seems trapped, most of the time, in the White House situation room, and therefore feels rather claustrophobic.Another difficulty with this book is the very fact that it was written by a Very Important Journalist who writes Very Important Books that Everyone Reads. In speaking with, and recalling their motivations and reactions to important events, the officials under Woodward's microscope know they're dealing with perhaps America's most prominent journalist and power groupie. Even when politics is (said to be) not a concern -- with the exclusion of Karl Rove from key strategy meetings (p. 205) -- folks in Washington understand, as Jurek Martin pointed out in the Financial Times recently, that a key to success in D.C. is to play along with Bob Woodward. Those who do, like President Bush, get painted in heroic colors. Those who are less willing to indulge him, reportedly including Don Rumsfeld, go down in Very Important Books in a much less flattering light. In \\"Bush at War,\\" the author is very much part of the story, even though he generally keeps himself behind the curtain.Finally, the time frame of this book seems somewhat random. The main narrative ends before there's any sort of resolution in Afghanistan. It just stops. Much of the rest of the story is told in an Epilogue that was, in many ways, more interesting than the rest of the book, in that it blends action and words instead of being primarily a transcription of meetings. In this section, the most compelling character was Secretary of State Colin Powell, apparently fighting a one-man battle against the \\"unilateralists\\" (today's term of opprobrium) in the rest of the Administration.On the whole, this is a moderately interesting look at how important decisions are made by senior White House officials in times of crisis -- or at least THIS White House in THIS time of crisis. If reading about the meetings gets dull and repetitive at times, at least we can say that the people in those meetings apparently often viewed them precisely the same way."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Seasoning disguises the true state of the sometimes rotten ingredients. Well worth reading BUT keep in mind that with this highly secretive administration Woodward has made a smooth transition from 'investigative journalist' of Nixon to &quot;Court historian&quot; for Bush. Courts tend to surround themselves only with those who generally agree and to permit only chroniclers who do so as well. Sadly, it may have been necessary to get even this version of the story."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"&quot;Bush at War&quot; invites comparison with &quot;Against All Enemies&quot;. These books could not lead the reader into more starkly contrasting conclusions about the capacity of the current administration.Naturally, some people will explain the contrast in terms of motivation. Some people will dismiss Clarke's book as the venal revenge of a disappointed civil servant. To others, Woodward has portrayed his subjects sympathetically to ensure access for future books.I don't think either book requires an ad homonym explanation. The difference is really very simple. Clarke's book is the result of somebody living the day-to-day activity of the White House and reporting what he has seen first-hand. It is like a candid photograph. In contrast, Woodward's book is like a posed family portrait. Administration officials recounted their version of what happened, deeply conscious that what they said would end up in print. To expand on the family portrait simile, &quot;Bush at War&quot; is like a portrait posed not by the photographer, but by the subjects, some of whom undoubtedly scrunch down a bit to make the Big Guy look bigger.Still, once you get past the fact that the sources for &quot;Bush at War&quot; are self-conscious and self-serving, the book is eminently fascinating. Bush comes across as supremely decisive. Once he has chosen a course of action, he does not revisit his decision. That is good or bad, depending upon the rightness of the original decision. It is a quality that wins him popular admiration and support. It is a quality that members of his administration act in consciousness of. In one episode, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice approached Bush with some misgivings about the direction of the war in Afghanistan. The book protrays her as unwilling to broach her misgivings, except in the most indirect way, and, indeed, the meeting resulted in the President's decision to stay the course, reflecing a signature quality of the President.&quot;Bush at War&quot; provides insider details. For example, the President dispatched Colin Powell to the Middle East for a hopeless mission to pour oil on particularly troubled waters between Israel and the Palestinians. While he was out on that precarious limb, high unnamed administration rival were more than happy to saw it behind him. Powell comes across as most under-appreciated.Another example is a conference between chief of staff Andrew Card and the President. Card was concerned that Bush was immersing himself too much in the details of the Afghanistan war. He felt that Bush needed to be President, and he needed to let the generals be the generals. Card invoked the specter of Lyndon Johnson, who famously micro-managed the Vietnam war, to warn Bush off over-involvement in military decision-making. Bush reportedly took the advice to heart.All in all, this is a valuable book, and when the reader is alert to its limitation, it gives valuable insights into the inside workings of the Bush White House."},{"Title":"Bush At War","review":"Yet another \\"inside the Beltway\\" confessional starring the DC powers and powers that wannabe. In here they go about their appointed or elected tasks all the while spilling their guts to Woodward. History will judge George Bush on one thing: His decision to involve the U.S in an ongoing world-wide war against not only terrorists but terrorist states supporting them either directly or indirectly. This idea seemingly pops into view in the midst of the chaos surrounding 911 and it sets the stage for world events for the next decade.Frankly, I prefer Bush's managerial style over the incoherent, jumbled style of his predecesor that has been described in detail by former administration insiders. The managerial style is particularly effective in crisis mode which, after reading the book, it seems Washington is in 24/7. Depending on your point of view, it is either an affirmation or confirmation of previously-held personal opinions.Bush is seen as resolute, steady, able but not brilliant, open to suggestions. He can also be seen as unbending, relying too much on deputies and merely selecting from an array of options. Others appear as expected. Cheney, unconcerned with celebrity, always looking for lurking dangers. Rice, the Great Compromiser, perhaps the only one who knows the \\"real\\" George Bush. Tenet is the administrator, a voice crying in the wildernerness. Rumsfeld and Powell duke it out again and again, both behind the scenes and in public. Yet when push came to shove on Iraq, Powell jumped on board, thoroughy disgusted with the broken French promises as Bash or Cheney.The trouble I had with the book was its tone as a documentary rather than a story. We read about events, facts, alleged conversations, overheard telephone calls, political mutterings but see little analysis or conclusions. One gets the idea that Powell is the hidden Savior of the administration and indeed, his stature and prominence seem to grow as one progresses into the story. Still, one must give kudos to the author for getting the story."},{"Title":"20 Warning Signs of Down Low Brothers","review":"The ONLY thing which books like this one accomplish is make those Black and Latino women that are already paranoid even more so--not only does it NOT shed any new light on this whole DL phenomenon but it does nothing to help.

The book includes 10 recipes for flavored oils, and 5 for flavored vinegars. Other than an exhortation to 'user your imagination', there are no general formulas for flavoring either medium. A recipe for 'truffle oil' calls for 3 black truffles. The reader isn't cautioned that this will cost about $270 and will produce 2 cups of this flavored oil.The balance of the book is color photographs, recipes, and meandering discussions of the history and use of oils and vinegars. The recipes are perfunctory -- apparently the author assumes his audience are skilled cooks. The West Coast cous cous recipe, to accompany chicken breasts, has no instructions for preparation. The Risotto recipe calls for 'browning then sweating onions and garlic'. Sweating and browning are opposed techniques. Elsewhere, the author calls for candied mangoes, grapes, and other fruits, but neither suggests where to get them nor how to prepare them. Jim Tarantino's book 'Marinades' and Irma Rombauer's 'Joy of Cooking' both contain more succinct, helpful information on flavoring oils and vinegars, with less verbal 'fluff'.About 1/2 the book is devoted to color pictures. Although attractive, only 1/3 of these deal with presentation and a number of these are duplicates.

Lord Peter Wimsey surely deserves to be counted as one of fiction's greatest detectives, along with Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Jane Marple and Inspector Maigret. This mystery showcases Lord Peter at his finest, along with the usual cast of Bunter, Parker and Mr. Murbles (with the lamentable exception of Miss Climpson!). Lord Peter has to untangle an unusually knotty mystery where a half-million pound inheritance hangs upon an uncertain time of death. His own feelings in the case are at issue since he has been friends with the brothers who stand to gain. I also liked the deveopment of Ann Dorland's character and the very real sympathy and desire to help that Lord Peter comes to feel for her is echoed in the reader's mind. The mystery itself is intricately plotted and as usual, Ms Sayers does a fine job of pulling together all the threads for the reader. A most satisfying and absorbing read!"},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"When Lord Peter Wimsey comes down to the Bellona club to dine with an old friend he little expected to find the 90 year old General Fentiman sitting quietly by the fire in full rigor mortis. Nor, did he expect to be confronted with a case about which one of the General or his sister, Lady Dormer, predeceased the other. But, seeing that it was a matter of some half million pounds he was delighted to oblige old Mr. Murbles, the family solicitor.It turns out that establishing Fentiman's time of death is going to be a major feat. No one, including his heirs, the staff of the Bellona Club and most of London seems to recall what the General was doing that morning, or when he showed up, opened his newspaper and promptly expired. Worse, what few facts that Wimsey can put together convince him that something was very, very wrong with Fentiman's timely ticking off. Suddenly this is no longer a case of friendly detection but a serious investigation into a murder.'The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club' was one of Dorothy Sayers' early smash hits. It shows off Wimsey's charming urbanity against the gemlike setting of his friends and cohorts, only striking serious chords when grim necessity rears its monocled head. Wimsey doesn't act quite as foolish as he was prone to in past novels, which makes him likeable as well as witty. The other regular characters have also acquired some extra depth that makes everyone a bit more believable. Everyone but the bit players, of course. Each of those is, as usual, a quick, delightful pastiche, one of Sayers greatest talents.This is one of Sayers' most memorable books, and, despite a plot that is a little too transparent, is one of her most re-readable. The odd thing about a Sayers mystery story is how unimportant it is whether you know or can guess the murderer. 'Who' is less important than 'how' in these tales, and neither is as important as the balletic interaction of the players, most of whom you would like to find in your sitting room - it you had a sitting room large enough, that is.This is also the first book that displays Wimsey's softer nature with the ladies. While Marjorie Phelps is not destined to become Lord Peter's great love, we see glints of the Peter to come. He shows a fair and attentive style without a hint of macho that will serve him well in his trials to come. I am tempted to say that, if you don't enjoy this book, there is no hope for you as a Sayers fan. That's not completely true, but ' The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club' is a completely representative Sayers effort and one of my perennial favorites."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Lord Peter is at his best in this mystery novel which gives us 21st century dwellers a view of English post WWI culture, specifically the Men's club. In the process of untangling this convoluted mystery, Lord Peter touches on some of his own issues regarding his military service and some resulting psychological scars.Despite all this, Lord Peter chases the criminal with class, wit and ridiculous humor. He never takes himself too seriously, and is always charming--even when the stessed out subjects of investigation lash out at him.Lord Peter has two perennial sidekicks--Bunter, his perfect butler, and Parker, the police detective. Both of these men are excellent at their trade and balance Peter's ridiculously good humor with sedate and serious good sense. Peter is a brilliant intuitive which contrasts with his piercing deductive mind. Bunter has good insight into human character and Parker has dogged determination and the abilty to integrate diverse evidence.Despite the sometimes dated language, Sayers has the knack of writing an engaging and suspenseful mystery as well as taking us back in time to simpler more gracious times."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Among the more successful mysteries is Dorothy Sayers' &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.&quot; A very wealthy woman dies, leaving a fortune to her brother if he is still alive, otherwise to a young female companion. When the brother is found dead in his chair at the Club, the novel becomes, not a whodunit, but a &quot;whenwasitdun,&quot; a question much on the mind of not only the heirs of the two deceased persons but of Lord Peter Wimsey, who is asked by the brother's lawyer to help establish the time of the brother's death (that of the sister being certain).The question of When is answered halfway through the novel. But even before that, the other questions of how he died and by whose hand become paramount; and Wimsey winds up offending almost everybody concerned in his inexorable quest for the solution. There is a certain tongue-in-cheek element in Sayers' writing that calls out for a good reading--and that is exactly what we get in the Audio Partner's set of 6 audio cassettes with none other than Lord Peter himself, which is to say Ian Carmichael, doing the honors.Having read the book twice in the past and watched the Acorn Media video release many times, I enjoyed listening to this tape even more, picturing in my mind the scenes from the television version, which seems to be remarkably faithful to the novel. This set is highly recommended for those who love a good mystery, well-told and (here) well read."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB wasn't the best mystery novel that I've ever read, but it was certainly enjoyable enough that I didn't feel I was wasting my energy. The characters are, at times, clich&eacute;d, but I was entertained by all of them enough not to be too bothered by any lack of real substance. It's a tale of murder, deceit and money, but is told with enough whimsy to make it fully enjoyable.Despite some initial false assumptions on my part, the plot managed to keep me mostly surprised much of the time. At first glance, I thought that I was in for a fairly tedious journey, as I wasn't very far into the book when I suddenly figured out what I assumed was a large part of the mystery. Faced with the prospect of having to read through the entire rest of the story pretending not to know how the murderer had gotten away with it, I began to wonder if perhaps the remainder wouldn't be worth reading. To my great surprise, while the portion of the mystery that I figured out was fairly well signposted, it didn't turn out to be as important as I had anticipated, and I was greatly pleased that Lord Peter figured out the puzzle not long after I did. This allowed the story to turn into directions that I hadn't anticipated, and brought me back into the narrative. There are several clever little moments of storytelling that successfully managed to keep my on my toes, which is an ideal situation for any detective story.This was the first Dorothy Sayers book that I've read, and I was surprised at how much of the story was conveyed purely through the dialog. There is almost no description at all and there were times where it seemed as though I was reading a television or a film script. (Incidentally, this is probably why the series translates so well to visual mediums.) This did contribute to a feeling of triviality, but it did make the book pass by much more quickly. This is not a book to be slowly picked apart, but rather one to be enjoyed quickly, in large gulps. The fast-pace adds to the fanciful flavor and allows the story to rapidly wash over the reader.I found THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BELLONA CLUB to be a fun and enjoyable, if light, detective adventure. It's a great little piece of fiction to read on a lazy afternoon, and it should be recommended to any fan of mystery novels. A short, and fairly unambitious novel, but definitely quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This book shows the charming and dry British humor. The setting: an old austere British club in 1928. On Remembrance Day, three men are sitting down to lunch. One notices an old soldier sitting not far away. He has a newpaper in front of him and a drink to his side. He is quite dead, and so the Unpleasantness begins. Wonderful"},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey has planned on spending a quiet Armistice Day, just stop by the Bellona Club, reminisce with some old friends and then a quiet memorial dinner. But since this is Lord Peter Wimsey, the aristoctratic amateur sleuth, (and this is a mystery novel) a death soon occurs. The deceased is old General Fentiman and since he is ninety his passing is rather sad but not surprising. Not at all the sort of thing to arouse Lord Peter's notice until the exact time of the old General's death becomes a matter of vital importance to his heirs, one of whom is a friend of Lord Peter.As Wimsey looks deeper into the matter he becomes involved in the art world, a jilted lover, domestic tension and even receives a proposal. Of course he unravels the mysteries in the end, bringing the guilty to justice and protecting the innocent.As always with this series the glimpses into Lord Peter's world are as entertaining as the mystery itself. We are treated to visits with Inspector Parker, Bunter, and Marjorie Phelps and if those names mean nothing to you, you would probably do better to start this series with one of the earlier books. For fans of the series this is a definite must read."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is one of my three favorite novels in the Lord Peter Wimsey series (the other two are Clouds of Witness and Murder Must Advertise), and it's the best solid mystery in the series. By this point, Sayers was concocting more complicated plots involving trickier clues, issues of timing, and calculated motivations. In this book, old General Fentiman dies at a gentleman's club, but it turns out that the exact time of his death relative to the death of the wealthy Lady Dormer he'd once known, as if she died first, then he (and hence his heirs) inherit the bulk of her wealth, whereas if he died first then Ann Dorland, who's lived with Lady Dormer for several years, inherits most of the money.Wimsey, a member of the club, is asked to discreetly investigate, a situation complicated by the fact that he's friends with both of General Fentiman's heirs, and that Ann Dorland - not unexpectedly - is reluctant to contribute anything which might result in someone else receiving the money. So Wimsey is left to discover when the General died, whether anyone tried to hide this information, and who stands to gain from it. Sayers mixes in plenty of atmosphere of 1920s English civility (with a brief aside to the art culture of the time), and paints a variety of interesting and sympathetic characters. The end result is an entirely satisfying mystery."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is the first Dorothy L. Sayers book that I have read, and I can guarantee that it won't be the last. If you're looking for a nice, Golden Age mystery book of quick length, crisp pacing, interesting plot, and colorful characterization, then look no further. The mystery unravels quite rapidly from the start as Lord Peter Wimsey (the foppish and wickedly intelligent protagonist) is taking-in the evening at the private Bellona Club, and a body soon turns up. The club itself is host to many characters, some suspicious, some amusing. Outside the four walls of the Bellona also exist many plots and characters that are fun to meet and get to know. Whether it was murder or natural causes is part of the mystery. And then midway through the book another mystery springs up which takes things in a somewhat different direction. Never boring for a second, this was one of those books that was hard to put down. The atmosphere is good and appropriate throughout, especially a creepy scene in a graveyard. My only qualm is with a portion of the ending, which is a little to civilized for its own good. But that's small in comparison with the rest of this enjoyable Golden Age mystery. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"For those who have heard of but never read Dorothy L. Sayers, this book would be a good start. The novel offers a glimpse of the English upper class between the World Wars. Sayers is skilled at strewing red herrings and making the reader suspect various characters. Enjoy the class consciousness and snobbishness as well as the unraveling of the mystery. Realize, also, how much more extensive vocabularies seemed to have been in the first half of the twentieth century than now, based on the author's use of language."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This Dorothy L Sayers book is beautifully crafted with droll humor, excellent language, believable characterizations and atmospheric descriptions.

The man died sometime after 10am, but the exact time of death is a mystery. It becomes a pressing mystery when it becomes clear that the time of death determines who will inherit a large fortune. The convoluted family argument and complex relationships make Wimsey's efforts more difficult. Halfway through the book the culprit seems to be apprehended, but Wimsey isn't so sure. I liked the model of a solution partway through the book that had to be unraveled.This book had little engagement with Wimsey's life outside of the mystery. It is a book dependent upon Wimsey entering an existing situation. The details are numerous, and we get an interesting look at a London gentlemen's club in the 1920s. Overall, an entertaining classic mystery."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"i finished The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club today. Wimsey is brought in on a completely unsuspicious death to determine the exact time of death. If the old General died before his equally old sister, the money goes to the sister's companion, if after, to the General's two sons. Of course, events get curious and Wimsey has to use a good bit of his cleverness to figure it all out. I certainly didn't guess who the killer was.I guess I like Wimsey because he's all competence and properness covered by quips and a bit of playing the buffoon. He's clever and but haunted. The setting is just so British it's a bit weird; it is like a fantasy novel as it is just so different from what life is today. Quite well written."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"How could anyone resist reading a mystery with a title so very British as this one? I love the word \\"Unpleasantness\\" in the title, and I thoroughly enjoyed this, the fourth of Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey novels. I think this particular mystery was more solvable by the average reader than many of her stories, but that didn't make the book any less enjoyable to me.The story is set at the Bellona Club, where a 90-year-old member is found dead. The time of his death will determine who inherits a large fortune. And, just as in the previous Wimsey novel, \\"Unnatural Death,\\" the detective must determine whether this death was natural or whether it was murder. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This captures class and English crime fiction about as well as anything ever published.

Lord Peter is astounded that such as unseemly event could occur in the unlikely location.This Lord Peter story ranks as one of the best produced by Mrs. Sayers and is often included in lists of one of the best detective stories written during the 20th century.A must read for anyone who loves a good puzzle.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"I'm really into audiobook (and book) mysteries -- I've heard/read hundreds.

I cannot say enough good about it."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy this segment of the Lord Peter series. I do think the other reviewers are correct in their assessment of the literary virtues of this work and of the author. My problem is with the idioms of the era. I found myself wishing I had a &quot;Lord Peter to English&quot; Dictionary! Please don't misunderstand me - I like this series and I have a growing respect for Dorothy Sayers' work. I simply found myself wondering what on earth these people (the characters in the novel) were talking about. But I bet my grandmother, a contemporary of Lord Peter, would have known...I am reading Sayers' works in order of publication, and so far Clouds of Witness is my favorite."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"Gentlemen's clubs are a peculiar facet of British upper-class life, serving as a place of retreat from family, from the hoi-polloi, and from all women. Most of London's clubs are rather different places now, but in the 1920s they still were going strong. On the morning of Armistice day, November 11, the many veterans of the Great War who are members of the Bellona Club put poppies in their buttonholes and go outside to observe the moment of silence in remembrance of their mates who didn't come home from France. And when they return to the warmth of the clubroom -- Lord Peter Wimsey among them -- they discover the body of the very elderly General Fentimen in his armchair by the fireside. Well, he was into his nineties; one can't be too surprised, right? Only, when one of the other members goes to call the home of the general's estranged sister to alert her to her brother's death, they find that the old lady has just died, too. A macabre coincidence, right? But then the terms of the two siblings' wills become known. The wealthy sister had left everything to her brother, but if he predeceased her, then it all goes to her young female companion. And the general left all his much smaller estate to his two grandsons. Obviously, if the sister died first, the general became (for a few hours) very wealthy indeed, and the grandsons inherit it all -- but if the general died first, the grandsons get only a few thousand pounds and the companion will be set for life. It's a complicated set-up, but a fascinating one. The lawyers ask Wimsey to look into the times of death of both parties, which are proving very difficult to pin down, and he begins to suspect the general's body was tempered with. The grandsons -- one an active-duty army officer, the other a victim of post-traumatic stress (\\"shell-shock\\" in those days) who had to resign his commission and who now cannot hold a job -- obviously would benefit from delaying the general's death, and that's where the first part of the story focuses -- but, as always in a Sayers novel, there's considerably more to it than that, and Lord Peter's investigations go far afield. While the plot will definitely keep your mind engaged and the dialogue is as snappy as usual (especially Wimsey's quotation-laden conversation), the author's characterizations are somewhat more melodramatic than usual. Though I'm rather partial to Murbles the solicitor. Still, it's a good novel. And Sayers makes the most of the opportunity to get in a few jabs at gentlemen's clubs!"},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is one of the early Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries by Dorothy L. Sayers from the \\"golden age\\" of detective fiction. The copyright is 1928, and the story is roughly contemporary. You've got a corpse, difficulty over time of death and an inheritance, all in a \\"fair play\\"--all evidence laid before the reader--mystery. Go for it!For fans of the series, don't look for Harriet Vane in this one. It's Wimsey, Parker and Bunter all the way.For those looking for \\"deeper\\" meaning, the background here is WWI veterans, often disabled, trying to adapt to the peacetime world. Escapism just isn't what it used to be."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"I've been meaning to read more Dorothy Sayers for a while; but when Susan hill mentioned it in Howards End is on the Landing, I knew that this had to be the next to read.In the years just after WWI, an old military man (a veteran of the Crimea) dies in his club. Although it would seem that he died of natural causes, Lord Peter Wimsey determines that he was murdered; and he sets out to prove not only the time of death but the manner in which the General died. At stake is money, and who will inherit it.Of her early Lord Peter mysteries, this one is undoubtedly Sayers's best. She seems to have gotten better and better with each book she wrote, and she really perfected her art with this book. She deals with not only the petty stuff, but the larger things that were going on in he world at the time; in this novel, although WWI is ten years past, it's still very much on people's minds. George and Robert Fentiman, grandsons of the General, are perfect examples of this; George has been extremely affected by experiences in the trenches, while Robert escaped untouched.Dorothy Sayers has a very subtle sense of wit; what I love about Lord Peter is his dryness. You almost have to be looking in order to find the humor in this book, but it's well-worth it when you do. We learn more about Lord Peter's experience during WWI and his relationship with Bunter, too--surely one of the most patient butlers in fiction."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"\\"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club\\" is a reminder of just how good Dorothy L. Sayers was at her very best. The mystery is well-constructed, Lord Peter is as sympathetically sharp as he ever was, and the secondary characters are well-rounded and realistic.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"This is the mystery of the death of old General Fentiman at the Bellona Club. Did he die before or after his sister? Her will either leaves the grandsons fabulously wealthy or leaves most of the money to a young female relation, depending on when he died. Peter is asked to try to determine the death time, although everybody deplores how \\"unpleasant\\" the whole thing is - the death itself at the club, the prying into the General's business, the need for Peter to even ask members of the club questions.It's beautifully written, clever, and has a depth of characterization of even the most minor characters that makes you feel you know them. The mystery and its resolution are satisfying. Sayers never skimped on writing with a great level of detail but I've never been bored by digressions and peripheral plot lines. Peter's time spent with Marjorie Phelps is an example. Her taking him to a party does forward the plot, but by their few conversations and the meals they have together we realize the Marjorie loves Peter, he doesn't love her, yet wants to be friends. A very nice little subplot.One thing I've always liked about this book, having read it perhaps half a dozen times, is how it describes men who've been through The Great War. What they came home to, how they were expected to hide their problems, how they were so fragile after such horrific events, especially if they were at all sensitive or badly wounded. George Fentiman, grandson of the old General, is a case in point, while his brother, Robert, took pot shots at rats in the trenches, laughing all the time.Peter's own trauma from the Great War is alluded to but not gone into detail, but serious Sayers fans know that he was almost buried alive and through most of his life suffered from his nerves.All in all a very beautifully written novel. One of my favorite Peter Wimseys.I had a bit of a problem with Ian Carmichael's reading of this book. I had a hard time differentiating the characters, and only because I've read it so often was I able to figure out who was saying what among the upper-class accents."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"When an elderly gentleman, ensconced in a winged back leather chair close up to the fire and apparently reading the \\"Times\\", is found to be dead the word for this event, occurring as it does in a respectable London club in the 1920s, is \\"unpleasantness\\". When Lord Peter Wimsey investigates further and discovers that the death is actually murder, it is still not proper, in the Bellona Club, to abandon the euphemism \\"unpleasantness\\". Thus is established the tone and the subject of Dorothy L Sayers' fifth work of detective fiction, written in 1928.Readers of \\"Golden Age\\" detective fiction will find the usual wit and polish in the writing and a central idea for a crime that derives from nice points of logic and a specialized knowledge of anatomy and medicine. Somehow these strengths, together with a preponderance of dialogue, also account for the book's weakness. It lacks atmosphere. After describing the opening scene in the Bellona Club with great care and effect, Miss Sayers rarely thereafter gives a thought to sketching in details of time, place, action or surroundings.So this is one of Dorothy L Sayers' books that will always provide me with entertainment and rich enjoyment, while making me aware that it does not quite provide everything I ask of great detective fiction."},{"Title":"The unpleasantness at the Bellona Club","review":"A well written mystery.

Not only has the text aged well, the narrator reads it well. Durant waxes a trifle poetical at times, but he delivers the goods.The book works chronologically through the history of philosophy, summarizing much, but stopping to give the biographies (and synopses of the thought) of all whom Durant considers major philosophers. Along the way the auditor learns some interesting tidbits: E.g. Darwin wasn't the first to conceive of evolution by natural selection. That honor belongs to the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Empedocles.The philosophers whom Durant profiles are a who's who in the pantheon of thinkers:Chapter I: PlatoChapter II: AristotleChapter III: BaconChapter IV: SpinozaChapter V: VoltaireChapters VI-X are set forth in Volume II of this audiobook, \\"The Story of Philosophy: From Kant to William James and the American Pragmatists.\\" If you have a CD with MP3 capacity, you might rather buy the entire book in that format.Durant later, in \\"The Lessons of History,\\" lamented the fact that he overlooked the scholastics, and his omission of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas constitutes the greatest weakness of the work. Durant atoned for slighting Aquinas in \\"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time\\" by ranking him as one of history's 10 most influential thinkers."},{"Title":"The Story Of Philosophy From Plato To Voltaire And The French Enlightenment (volume1)","review":"Durant has a gift for explaining complex philosophical ideas simply and for writing in an entertaining fashion. He also has an intriguing approach to the field. Instead of writing encyclopedically, he picks a half dozen philosophers as representative of 2000 years of philosophy.The jump from Plato and Aristotle to Francis Bacon, however, hardly does justice to the philosophical life of man during the 1000 years of the \\"Dark Ages.\\" Durant too easily falls into the conceit of writing off the Middle Ages as a time of barbarism and backwardness. I'm more inclined to write off Rome as barbaric and to view the rise of a Christian Europe as having a far more salutary and civilizing effect on man. How is it possible to write the story of Western philosophy without acknowledging the indispensable role of Christ and the scholastics?Durant should have jumped from Aristotle to Christ and then to Aquinas and Ockham.Durant does spend a few passages on the Middle Ages, characterizing the theocracy of the day as a realization of the philosopher kings of Plato's republic. It's a striking thesis, though it reveals what is perhaps the ulimate fallacy of Durant's approach -- that ideas determine social structure as opposed to the other way around. The faith-based intelligentsia of the Middles Ages was particularly well suited to the secular hierarchies and power structures of the day.I was skeptical of Durant's choice of Spinoza as such a pivotal philosopher, but Durant's argument is ultimately persuasive. Spinoza does square the circle of religion and science by reconciling the two and Durant is probably right to conclude that Spinoza defined modern thinking on this issue. Equating God with nature and with Newton's laws is a thoroughly modern approach, as is the tendency toward determinism and a healthy skepticism for organized religion.I'm not convinced by the primacy he gives Bacon. Although not strictly a philosopher, Isaac Newton was the great mind of his day and had more influence on shaping modern notions of science than did Bacon. Also, Durant's decision to write off the British empiricists and the study of epistemology as not being \\"real\\" philosophy is hard to justify.His choice of Voltaire as the embodiment of the Enlightenment and the shift to modern thinking about religion and society, and his contrasting of Voltaire with Rousseau, is excellent.This is a worthwhile and interesting book."},{"Title":"Hidden (Young Trib Force: Kids Left Behind, 3 / Left Behind: The Kids, Books 9-12)","review":"Great research was done on this series!

The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens. I enjoy them and I am an adult."},{"Title":"Hidden (Young Trib Force: Kids Left Behind, 3 / Left Behind: The Kids, Books 9-12)","review":"Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy \\"experts\\" or \\"scholars\\" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, \\"The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea,\\" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: \\"The REAL Rapture\\". If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's \\"The REAL Rapture\\" (based on a volume in his forthcoming \\"Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period\\" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon)."},{"Title":"Wi-Fi Toys 15 Cool Wireless Projects for Home, Office, and Entertainment","review":"I was hoping that this book would help me boost my Wi-Fi signal around the house, since the reception downstairs is a little weak. Well, it did show me how to boost my signal - for up to 20 miles!

The hardest part of it was setting up the Linux system (Linux is free!!) but after following the instructions and purchasing a few inexpensive parts on Ebay i had a hotspot running for all my neighbours.The antenna pages are superb and make it easy to follow and build out of next to nothing. Range extension, Selfpowered repeaters (yes you heard that right).I even loved the final chapter 15 - Making a wireless Digital picture frame (Woww - cheap and easy).overall this is a fantastic book with tons of insight into the mysterious and invisible world that surrounds us every day.

That is the question Julie Kenner asks and answers in Harlequin Temptation #969. It's a very sweet, engaging read. Too quick as most Temptations are, so character development just does not have the chance to really flesh out the characters and true conflict.In a long length, it could have really been a powerful book. But that is Temptations. Quickie reads. I can read them in an hour, so no matter how good they are, I feel like I have \\"eaten Chinese\\"; they are satisfying, but leave you hungry for more. Kenner makes the best of the format with engaging characters.Melissa Tanner was raised by her grandfather. The elder Tanner is a dashing may even in his twilight years. Once a bit-actor in many Hollywood films, he was in love with the starlet from the period, Emily Radley. However, the studio pressured Emily not to drag her career down by marrying him. Both married, both are now widowed, both have grandchildren they want to see settled. So Emily plots a meeting between her grandson, Kyle and Gregory's granddaughter, Melissa. During his younger years, Gregory was a small time cat burglar, and he passed onhis skill to Melissa. However, she has turned over a new leaf, wanting to go straight. She is stuck finding a job, it's her birthday and life is looking rather bleak with the tax man practically knocking on the door.Kyle has retired 10 years ago, and now runs a high tech security agency, which is under siege. Getting involved with any woman is not high on his list of priorities, and when that woman is a thief it's double double toil and trouble. Only, this thief was putting something BACK! Sparks fly and they are soon following the route character by them.The characters are charming, so are Gregory and Emily. The plot is developed as well as the very limited length permits, but it causes the secondary plot of the mystery to see so obvious that is undermines this. Still, Kenner's writing is sharp, she has good control of her \\"voice\\", just wish Harlequin would give their writers about 25 more pages. I think both writers and readers would appreciate a strong foundation to this line. (Writer get 5 stars, Harlequins forced format gets 4)"},{"Title":"Giving God Your All: Women of Faith Study Guide Series","review":"we have a group of ladies stuying the women of faith books .this are hard times i love my book it came on time for my group and I save a lot!! what a blessing!!!"},{"Title":"Arrive at Easterwine","review":"This is one of Lafferty's lesser-known book-length novels, and unlike Past Master, Fourth Mansions and a few others, has not been recently reprinted in a new edition. Some readers probably wouldn't give it five stars; I do so in relation to Lafferty's other output, which is so voluminous that I recently read an article about him in which I didn't recognize any of the books the author mentioned.Lafferty is best known for short stories that appeared in various sci-fi mags, including Orbit, and in a number of paperback collections (and some in hardback book club editions) such as Ringing Changes, Nine Hundred Grandmothers and Does Anyone Else Have Something Further to Add? I first discovered him after reading a review that made his books sound so oddly intriguing that I had to have a go at them, and initially read numerous short stories and novellas.However, I much prefer his longer novels, or rather some of them. Lafferty is an odd duck--read: original writer and unique visionary, but even within his own canon his books vary widely, arguably not in quality but in style (while remaining unmistakeably Laffertarian). At least as few are classics, but they are often the least available (and least read). My list of greats would include: Fourth Mansions, Past Master, Not to Mention Camels, Annals of Klepsis, and Arrive at Easterwine. Books I can't get into or through (although they may be favorites of other readers) include The Devil is Dead and Apocalypses. Somewhere in the middle I would place Space Chantey and The Thirteenth Voyage of Sinbad, but I have not begun to exhaust his catalog.This book is told in the first person, and as with Asimov's I Robot (recently recast as an excellent film) and Kate Wilhelm's The Killer Thing, that first person is a machine. Not as light as Lafferty's Reefs of Earth but not as heavy as some of the above novels, it remains a flight of fancy where all deals are off and reality (whatever that is) is turned on its head in a typically? Laffertarian fashion that readers who've caught the Lafferty bug (and are therefore doomed to endlessly seek out and devour more R.A.L.) may enjoy."},{"Title":"Sesame ST Dictionary","review":"This has got to be the greatest toy since Legos.

HOWEVER--I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THIS BOOK had I known a few of the word entries listed. We haven't read the entire book cover to cover, but here are the disturbing listings I've found thus far, that I wanted to put out there for others thinking of buying.Each word entry has a brief explanation and a picture to further express the definition. Under \\"join: when you join things, you put them together,\\" it shows a picture of three witches dancing around a fire \\"holding\\" hands. I find this in bad taste--of all the cartoons that could have been drawn here to illustrate \\"join,\\" Sesame Street shows witches?This book is not a complete dictionary of course, claiming to list about 1300 words. This is fine, except I am a bit baffled at how the word \\"kill\\" made it in while other common words of a more kid-friendly nature are excluded. The definition for kill is listed as: \\"when you kill something, you make it die.\\" I'm not saying we need to shelter our children from all negative words, but does this entry really have to be in the dictionary when words such as \\"blanket\\" did not make the cut?One last complaint: the grammar is not always delivered well. For example, under \\"good\\" the definition is listed as: \\"when you are happy or healthy, you feel good.\\" First of all, it's a poor explanation of the word. Second, literature professors always taught me that the correct version of this sentence is: \\"when you are happy or healthy, you feel WELL.\\"I felt compelled to be a choosy mom and list the rating at a 3. Honestly, I would have rated it worse if it weren't for the fact that my son began crying hysterically today when I put him down for his nap and tried to sneak the dictionary out of his room under my arm. There were real tears there as he cried for me to put it back! This book is a favorite at our house, and my son is excited about looking up and learning new words, so I've resigned myself to editing and skipping the entries that I disagree with. I must admit, I'm not sure there is an equivalent dictionary alternative out there.

Elmo is her favorite. She calls this her \\"Elmo Book.\\" I assumed that since Elmo is ON THE COVER, he would be in it, but my assumption was wrong! Upon closer inspection, I realized that even though I thought I was purchasing a 2004 book, it originally came out in 1980 (pre-Elmo), and apparently, they just slapped a new cover on it with Elmo and Zoe (who do not appear anywhere in the book!) I was going to return it since I was disappointed with it, but my daughter still likes to look at all of the pictures and all of the other Sesame Street characters (from when I was growing up). I felt bad because the first night I showed it to her, and she saw the cover and screamed, \\"ELMO!\\" Then I sat down with her and said, \\"Where's Elmo?\\" and we flipped through the whole book to realize her \\"Elmo Book\\" doesn't contain Elmo!

My 3 year old will actually 'read' it to his sister while I am doing other things.

She was the first woman to get federal matching funds to run for president, but she had little or no support from the national media. Beginning in 1977 she campaigned indefatigably for the Equal Rights Amendment, denouncing her church's (Mormon) opposition to the amendment. This resulted in her excommunication from the church.Soon after she parted ways with the church, her husband divorced her, the mother of four. Eventually, she began a relationship with a woman. The Ship book is the story of how she found that even relationships between female couples are \\"slave ships\\" (hence the title).To read Sonia Johnson, I suggest you just loosen up, go for the ride as she does, and see where it takes you. Even if you don't come to her conclusions, I feel confident that you will not see things quite the same, and you'll be more awake and aware of your most basic acts.She discusses how taking care of others is a form of control. For example, \\"my\\" children must be all right in order for me to be all right. I strongly identify with her when she notes that the rescuer/victim pattern was the most difficult to break. She says that a certain kind of distance is essential to intimacy, that we need to regard our intimates as capable of handling their own affairs.Johnson echoes other feminists in saying that women are taught to be \\"a good woman\\" who doesn't ask herself what she wants and even loses touch with what she wants. Women also learn that it is noble to suffer. She reminds us that we can be empathetic when others suffer - our children, for instance - without waiting to be happy only when they are happy.I appreciate her suggestions about sex and they ring true with me. She sees women's natural approach to sex as arousal (connected to power), not excitation (connected to control). She suggests that you touch your lover for the joy that touch gives you at that moment without trying to stimulate or control the other. That kind of touch connects your heart with your lover. No response is required. She claims that this same style works for women in acting in the world - the power of actions that arise organically."},{"Title":"The ship that sailed into the living room: Sex and intimacy reconsidered","review":"Never received.

It truly is the most comprehensive, interesting, and honest history of clinical psychology available today.Among the best features of the book is its honest and inspiring look at the multiple perspectives which abound in today's psychology and how they can be traced to ancient times. The ancient/sacred, neuroscience, psychoanalytic, cognitive, behavioral, gestalt, humanistic and socio-cultural perspectives are all traced and detailed. Millon avoids disparaging each perspective. Instead, he shares the strengths and weaknesses in the words and actions of the scientists and philosophers whose works represent the critical thoughts in each area.While it is difficult to read more than one chapter at a time (it is that comprehensive and detailed), a chapter a day will certainly make for an excellent review of psychology for a good two weeks. In fact, the last two weeks have been remarkably educational. (I decided to read this book during a two week break from graduate classes).For each perspective, Millon follows a three stage process of detailing its hisory. First, he offers a summary and review of the major historical movements within the perspective. Then, a detailed history (person by person, country by country) is proffered. Finally, Millon offers his own unique and insightful commentary. Millon and his daughter's own artwork (portraits of key scientists and philosophers) provide helpful context. In addition, each scientist's contributions are shared in concert with a brief biography. Finally, in those cases where Millon actually met or worked with one of the psychologists, he shares his own observations. For example, Beck truly does appear to be a nice guy, while Ellis appears truly narcissistic and arrogant.I'll admit that the average reader may find Millon's style, at times, difficult. He loves to use big words and assumes some level of prior understanding of psychological constructs. However, as a psychology instructor and student, I found his book enlightening, interesting, at times funny, and many times educational. The book offered incredible food for my college lectures and inspired me to continue to hold on to a multi-perspective, eclectic view of the cause of mental illness. It truly appears likely from history that a multi-perspective view is most consistent with a view of humans as complex with behaviors that could result from the interaction of numerous causes.That's just my opinion..."},{"Title":"Masters of the Mind: Exploring the Story of Mental Illness from Ancient Times to the New Millennium","review":"It is a great book to follow the time line of thoughts about Mental Illness.

This marks a return to the contemporary perception of the war, where the whole conflict was observed, rather than the subsequent concentration on the heroism, incompetence and recovery on the few square miles of the Crimean Uplands that have come to dominate the modern image of the war. 103 b&amp;w illustrations"},{"Title":"A Terrorist or Patriot","review":"I believe this story happened and I believe the writer has been in some sort of intelligence service.

It was an interesting look at one man's fight against a corrupt system which is something all too common these days of shadow governments here in the United States.Roberts did a more than decent job of weaving the plot so that the reader is kept guessing but doesn't feel like an idiot at the end of the book. The characters are identifiable and draw the reader into their struggles.I finished the book the day I began it. Once I had started it, I just had to finish it that same day.Also, I looked at the guy's Web site. His picture looks like Leon Redbone. I don't know whether he can sing or not but he writes entertaining fiction. My only gripe is that I wished it would have contained more history about Argentina but that's a minor point and really doesn't detract from the book's purpose.In summary, a quick read, a fun read and at times a compelling read. The book is entertaining and that's what fiction is for so I give it 5 stars.

Unfortunately, the author makes the opposite assumptions. So he casually mentions that you should have IIS running, but includes a whole chapter on C# constructs (just in case I didn't know what a &quot;while&quot; statement is). The same pattern is followed throughout the book: loads of trivial junk that I needed to slog through, because they conceal some crucial information. It took me 15 minutes just to put a label on a web form when it was in FlowLayout. The author did explain that you need to DOUBLE click to accomplish this, but the information was buried under a discussion of how to use the VS IDE (including what a Save icon looks like!) - something I've been doing for years.Perhaps if you know all about ASP and know nothing about C#, then this is the book for you.

This time, two of Jephtha Kent's sons take the spotlight -- eldest Gideon and youngest Jeremiah -- as they illustrate two different vantage points of the young Confederate soldier. Jeremiah is on a long, miserable errand for his commanding officer, now dead: He must desert the ranks and track across the Georgia countryside to the man's estate to deliver a letter to his wife and look after her and his daughter in these brutal times. Jeremiah completes the fool's errand and is forever scarred by it. Things get very ugly at the plantation, causing this young Kent to take a different view of his fellow man. It was good to see Jakes veer off formula with the character of the daughter, Serena. I thought I could see exactly where this sad tale was heading, but I was wrong.Gideon, meanwhile, encounters his own suffering (because this series IS all about suffering!). He gets imprisoned at Fort Delaware. All in all, he fares better than his little bro, proving to be one of the level heads in this book.Michael Boyle, Amanda Kent's onetime young Irish assistant, is another level head here. He enlists and becomes a soldier, himself, now in his 30s, then postwar takes a part in the burgeoning railroad's big cut across the West.Amanda's son Louis is largely on the sidelines. And Michael's illicit encounter with Louis' wife Julia is heavily referenced but seems to remain unfinished business.Jakes stays piercing and vivid in this sixth book, and so wonderfully easy to read.

I practically fell in love with Clementine's guy and this made me love the book even more.

Clementine will do anything not to upset the balance of nature, God, or even the shopkeepers because she simply worries about and for them.In Aldingham, Clementine, accompanied by her sister, finds their aunt's unfinished fairy tale collection. Clementine begins to work on completing the project. However, even as she falls in love (and worries about her future relationship), Clementine concludes that a new resident is the person responsible for a rash of robberies afflciting the town.

Her latest book mixes a well written fairy tale with some acute carnal humor. The characters are fun to read about, especially Clementine who sees the world as if Murphy was an optimist (think Mel Brooks in HIGH ANXIETY but enormously worse). The so-called hero is capricious in love and just not there to save his beloved. In fact, Clementine needs to be there for him.

It includes everyday life under the German terror. Special emphasis is placed on the development and protection of clandestine radio transmitters. Interestingly, a simple rope-signaling system finally overcame high-tech German surveillance systems (p. 334). Good detail is provided about the murders of Poles at Palmiry, the Katyn Massacre, the role of freed British POW John Ward during the betrayed and foredoomed Warsaw Uprising, and the subsequent systematic destruction of Warsaw by the vindictive Germans.The recent widely-acclaimed publication of FEAR, by Jan Thomas Gross, has accompanied accusations, by Gross and his fans, of Poles being too proud to admit negative aspects of their history, specifically acts of Polish collaboration being ignored because they do not fit the ruling paradigm of Polish resistance. The utter nonsense of such charges is readily evident in Korbonski's book. He devotes considerable detail to Polish consorting with and collaboration with the Germans (e. g., pp. 256-257).Of course, the line between accommodation and collaboration was not always clear-cut. Korbonski clarifies the Volksdeutsche. While most of them were Polish-speaking Germans, some were ethnic Poles, of which only a small fraction should accurately be reckoned collaborators: \\"No sentence of death was ever passed on a Pole for having registered as a \`Volksdeutsche'. The reason for this leniency was that the problem was more complicated than it appeared on the surface. Roughly speaking, the problem bore different aspects in the various aspects in the various provinces of Poland. The Silesians, for example, at the very beginning of the German occupation and in sheer self-defense, decided to register as Volksdeutsche, which in my opinion did not affect their patriotism and devotion to Poland. In Pomerania, from which district large numbers were deported to the General Government, the remainder of the population was compulsorily registered as German, and all men of military age were conscripted into the German Army. The same occurred in Posnania. These soldiers by compulsion eventually deserted from the German army and jointed the ranks of the Second Polish Corps in Italy. It was only in the General Government that the Poles were not compelled to register as Germans and cases of defection were extremely rare.\\"(p. 135).Another borderline case of accommodation and collaboration is exemplified by the Polish Blue Police (the Policja Granatowa). Wrongly equated with the Jew-killing Ukrainian and Baltic collaborationist units (the infamous Hilfspolizei, or Hiwis), the Blue Police was, in actuality, an anti-criminal force: \\"The Blue Police consisted of the pre-war Polish Police force; the Germans made them co-operate for the maintenance of public order.\\"(p. 93). Of course, individual Blue Policemen did become open collaborators, and some of these were killed by the underground for helping the Germans kill Poles (p. 130, 134) and Jews (p. 206). Otherwise, some units of the Polish Blue Police were used by the Germans, with or without their consent, for anti-Polish and anti-Jewish actions. For example, the Blue Police was warned by the underground not to take part in the roundups of Poles for forced labor in Germany (pp. 118-119, 224). All in all, the actions of the Blue Police defied simplistic classification: \\"The attitude of the underground authorities towards the Blue Police was hostile, because as a body it had become a tool in the hands of the German police; but a number of policemen, such as the above-mentioned Inspector, were members of the underground, and frequently carried out most dangerous instructions. The Blue Police were aware that the underground authorities had ordered the suppression of banditry, so they were always glad to take a hand against them.\\"(p. 242).There are common mischaracterizations of Poles being indifferent too, or even secretly approving of, the Germans' extermination of the Jews. The truth is otherwise. Korbonski recounts the fact that underground Polish reports of Jews being sent to death camps were disbelieved by the British (pp, 252-253). Neither were the events of the Warsaw Ghetto (p. 359) accepted. (The advantage of John Ward reporting on the Germans' use of Polish civilian shields around their tanks during the Warsaw Uprising was the fact that he, an Englishman, was believed: p. 359).In a cruel irony to the malicious charges (e. g., Schindler's List) of Poles cheering as Jews were being railroaded to death camps, the laughter was actually on the other side: \\"However, when the trains from the various countries continued to arrive, and when here and there Polish railwaymen were able to whisper a warning to the unfortunate Jews, they were not believed and were laughed at, especially by those Jews who traveled in passenger trains with their luggage and bedding; who were convinced that they were being transported to some labour camp, and that they would be able to survive the war by working hard.\\"(p. 254).On the basis of the fact that the Kresy (eastern borderlands) had only an ethnically Polish minority (albeit a large one), the British supported Soviet claims to Poland's eastern half. However, most of the non-Poles on these territories were not pro-Soviet, and some were pro-Polish. Consider the following entreaty: \\"I am a man from Minsk. Now that the Minsk province is under German occupation we can get in touch with people in the motherland. I have come to Warsaw as a representative of the ancient province of Minsk to ask the Polish Government not to forget our country, so that after the war the Minsk territory may be reunited with the motherland. It has been a Polish land for centuries, and wherever you go you'll find evidence of it. There are Poles still living there, and they are dreaming of a reunion. And the White-Ruthenians, too, dream of Poland as their deliverer from the Soviet hell.\\"(p. 314).

I'm a Polish immigrant and have as much vested in promoting the neglected valor of Poles as anyone, as well as correcting the distorted \\"history\\" of Pole hating polemicists such as Jan Gross. But a review should impart to potential readers what is and what is not positive about a book, and occasionally I find this lacking in reviews of works such as this. It may be that they are often read and then \\"reviewed\\" by those with an ax to grind and given 5 stars.This is not a 5 star book. This is a very important book but it could be a more transformative one if it was better written and better translated. The Polish Underground State is a subject that truly deserves to be told, as it was the most magnificent achievement of resistance during WW II - perhaps of any war. That the Poles ran an entire state (justice system, schools, military, etc.) under the noses of the Gestapo is nothing short of remarkable. And Stefan Korbonski, as the incredibly courageous chief of the Polish underground state is certainly one to tell it.The problem with this book lies with the fact that it is so crammed full of minute detail that it makes for difficult and laborious reading. I suspect that this meticulous attention to detail is a result of the author being a lawyer and his desire to preserve as much of what he remembered as possible. Unfortunately, that detail may be of historical importance to a historian, but not to a general reader. There is much important data here, and much important information, but one gets bogged down in the dry details of something that undoubtedly was very important.Also, as I read (and I had to limit myself to a snore inducing 10 pages a day) I got the idea that Korbonski was editing the story to tell us of the exploits of his particular clique -- not of the collective efforts of many, many people. Being somewhat familiar with the underground state and the AK and the stories of those who were there, I thought that there was much missing on the one hand, and too much minutiae on the other. It was a very strange read.Moreover, the translator, albeit true to the original Polish, did not help matters. I found the translation to be dry and concrete. As far as I am concerned, I do not mind a translator putting a minor interpretation on a narrative if it livens that narration up and does not change the intent. Polish cannot be translated literally, just as English cannot. The skill of a good translator is in his/her ability to impart the spirit of the narrative, not just the words.The translation of the Milennium trilogy comes to mind.I will keep looking for a more compelling telling (pardon the alliteration) of the Polish Underground State.

His ability to create vivid mental images, even in the Irish naive mind, is unprecedented."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"Because he was famous as a participant in the Irish Civil War (in 1922, he raised a red flag over the Dublin Rotunda) and because his best-known book is \\"The Informer,\\" Liam O'Flaherty is regarded primarily as a novelist of the Irish rebellion. In a letter to the Irish Statesman, he celebrated \\"the wild tumult of the untamed storm, the tumuilt of the army on the march, clashing its cymbals, rioting with excess of energy.\\" Like our own Theodore Dreiser, he was capable of being crude, grandiose and melodramatic, and he was often swamped by his own rhetoric. But he was also capable, far more than Dreiser, alas, of reaching and expressing astonishingly delicate perceptions of the human soul.At his best, O'Flaherty was one of the great natural forces of 20th Century literature. Like Jean Giono or Knut Hamsun, when writing about the land, the sea and the simpler creatures, including here peasants and seamen, his writing takes on the elemental forcefulness of classic folk tales. \\"Famine,\\" his greatest work in this mode, is matched only in his best short stories. It reads as freshly today as it did when it was first published 45 years ago.In 1845, the population of Ireland was estimated at 8.5 million. By 1851, it had been reduced by two million, half of whom had died and half of whom had fled, mostly to the U.S. and other former British colonies. The raw numbers do not do justice to the magnitude of the catastrophe that had befallen Ireland. In large parts of the south and west, traditional culture had been uprooted and destroyed.Focusing on a family of County Galway tenant farmers, the Kilmartins, \\"Famine\\" inserts us into the horror of the \\"great hunger.\\" A study of the uses of power -- by the old English ascendancy, by the rising middle class of usurious merchants, by the embattled (and mostly defeated peasants), it records the final days of an ancient, ritualistic society, unhinged by the destruction of the customs and traditions that had given shape and meaning to life. It is also about survival, especially that of Mary Gleeson Kilmartin, who fights for her family with fierce determination.[\\"Famine\\" was first published in 1937 but was never available in soft cover until a handsome edition was offered by David R. Godine's line of quality paperbacks, Nopareil, which also published works by Benedetto Croce, Edmund Wilson, Paula Fox, William Gass and Stanley Elkin. It was thought at the time that the publisher might be moved to reprint O'Flaherty's excellent short story collections, \\"Spring Sowing\\" and \\"The Tent.\\" If you can find the Nonpareil edition, buy it; it is avaialble now in a version from Interlink.]"},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I first read Famine while in secondary school in Drogheda Co. Louth in 1985. Sadly I didn't have the willpower to finish the book and appreciate its brilliance. Twenty years later, I found the book and finally read it through. It truly is a masterful work. Deep behind the story lies a web of emotion that is sure to bring a tear to your eye as you watch the characters fight against hunger and the enthrenched establishment. There is a sense of forboding and pity for what we know awaits the simple people portrayed in the book, yet they are also complex in their outlook on life and their belief in the Almighty. The book will not give you an historical account of what happened during the mid 1800s but it will give you an appreciation for its impact on the people and their way of life. The book is a classic in every sense of the word. It is unfortunately little known outside Ireland but if you can get your hands on a copy, I encourage you to give it the time and effort that it deserves."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I loved this book and read it twice. It is at once sweeping and intimate. Without sounding trite it reminded me of Gone With the Wind, and one day I'm sure someone will make a movie of it, especially since Ireland has become popular in the media again. Based on the truth, a classic."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I purchased this book in Cork Ireland on recommendation from my wonderful well read husband. I was not prepared for the emotions I experienced during my reading of this great story. For many years I have tried to have this book brought in but with no luck. Now I am able to share it with my book club and many others. Although I am not aware of the status this book was given at any one time it is a novel that should be considered a classic. I am dismayed at the number of books that reach this level or stay on the best seller list for months. At a time when I believe we are living in a dark age and there is far to much psycho bable and self help selfishness I am hopeful that we will eventually recognize this kind of talent and embrace it."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"For someone like myself, who actually lost family members as a result of the \\"Great Famine,\\" I was awe-struck by how the author so dramatically portrays the insensitivity and cruelty exhibited by the English during Ireland's greatest moment of need."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I read this book 15 years ago or so, captivated by the story and its telling. When I set it down, a thought just popped up: now I know why I am here. \\"Here\\" is Washington, DC, USA. My great grandfather arrived here as a boy from Kerry in 1848, and we still don't know with whom he might have come. We know he had a much younger brother who stayed in Ireland, probably with parents (if they were still alive; it was easy to wonder after reading O'Flaherty's tale). I turned the book over to my then-13 year old daughter; an untimely fatherly recommendation if there ever was one. I did not know then that O'Flaherty was a rebel. I recall only thinking that the writer was a great storyteller. You could almost taste the putrid and blackened potatoes as they fell apart in the characters' hands. A powerful story of roots, intimately felt by at least one family."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I read the book because one of my great-great-grandfathers immigrated to the USA about the time of the famine, and I wanted to learn more about his life in Ireland. This book delivered. From the first page to the last, the author describes everything interestingly and in detail. I don't have any way of knowing how accurate the details are, and I'd like to know the author's source for them, but they all ring true to me. I find it interesting that many of the characters' expressions are what I've heard in my own family! I don't doubt some of them were passed down through the generations.The other thing I appreciated was the author's commentary on the conflict between working people and the elite. It made me see similarities between the present and the Irish famine of the 1840s."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I was interested in reading more about Ireland's plight after reading Angela's Ashes. This book tried to cover a monumental event through the vantage point of a family in rural poverty stricken Ireland. The characters seemed flat at first but eventually came to life. The story was very somber and hopeless. The political configuration at the time was helpful in understanding the long standing differences between Ireland and England."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"This book is absolutely extraordinary. I'm quite familiar with the history of the Great Hunger, but to learn about it through the eyes of fictionalized Irish people was a humbling experience. Facts and figures can't even approach the life that people lived ... or died from. Taking one place and one family with their neighbors, O'Flaherty makes the failure of the potato crops palpable. O'Flaherty adds to his novel historical background information to put the story in context. This doesn't detract from the story at all, but is welcome. Irish history is complex.Man's inhumanity to man is painted in stark colors by O'Flaherty. I finished my reading heartbroken and tearful at the utter, needless cruelty that were inflicted on the Irish people by the British during the Great Hunger.O'Flaherty's writing is often choppy, and his dialogue can be hard to follow. Stick with it. You'll soon grow accustomed to his style and will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Famine: A Novel (A Nonpareil book)","review":"I could not find this book last year as it was out of print. I read it first from the one copy at my public library.... The famine came alive to me and the great suffering and humiliation people went through. I was surprised I had not heard of this book sooner. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"When this game came out, White Wolf's forums were...less than thrilled about this game. It's a shame that people judge this book before they read it, because it has amazing depth and humanity to it.You are the Imbued, regular blue- and white-collar citizens who one day get a big cosmic message from enigmatic beings (called the Heralds) waking you up to the fact that monsters not only exist in your world, but they have been there for a while and they've inserted themselves very neatly into law enforcement, politics, media, etc. Armed with &quot;second sight&quot; (the ability to spot these monsters out of a crowd) and &quot;edges&quot; (powers given to you by the Heralds to help you out in the hunt), Hunters can either strike at the darkness, search for redemption inside monsters, or merely try to learn more about them and figure out what went wrong. But as you begin to fight the good fight, you realize that you're outnumbered, outmanned, and underpowered. To top it all off, leading the crusade against darkness ultimately alienates you from your friends, family, and society. It's gritty, tragic, but ultimately hopeful. Despite it's bad rap as a twink game, Hunters are actually fragile, panicky creatures who bleed easy and go down fast. It's a welcome change from the usual White Wolf fare (if you haven't picked up a White Wolf game yet, I recommend this first before purchasing others...knowledge about the other games ruin the mystery of the monsters somewhat)"},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Hunter is one of the most compelling games White Wolf has ever made. Unlike the other games, your character is \\"merely\\" an average human, given the ability to see and react to the supernatural around him by the mysterious \\"Messengers\\". Each hunter is given a different view of how to answer the supernatural based on their own reactions, some seeing it as a last ditch war against the darkness while other instead approach it with innocent curiosity and optimism. While there is a sort of general \\"framework\\" to the game plot so it can fit into the overreaching world of darkness metagame, the writers do an admirable job of providing enough supplements and help for players so that in no way will your chronicle be limited by having to fit in with the other games. The hunter's powers are the best of any game I've seen, tailored to be cinematic effects than a cheesy \\"+12 spell of death\\". They suit their name of \\"edges\\", giving the players just enough power (and really cool chances for dramatic effect). The \\"everyman\\" feel of the game only adds to the suspense. The main weakness of the game is that to really enjoy it on more than a \\"its clobberin time\\" sort of level you have to buy multiple supplements, especially if you're going to get a deeper understanding of the different creeds. Spectacular game, but you really need the patience and the supplements to truly enjoy it."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"I've played Werewolf. Hell, I've dabbled in Vampire. Both are really great games if you want to play as something that's rediculously powerful and only have a real challenge if you're fighting an older Vampire or Werewolf (in either game). Hunter is different: instead of being this ungodly-powerful monster, you're this regular Joe with a neat trick, trying to fight the aforementioned monsters.It sounds unfair, I know, but that's what makes this game beautiful. You have extraordinary powers, but they're hardly enough to stop a charging Get of Fenris or Bruja in its tracks. You're alone, and if you don't find help, either you'll die, or you'll be driven insane. That, my friend, is true fear.Yes, the story aspect is my favorite part of this game, but let's discuss the gameplay. As in most White Wolf games, the gameplay takes a backseat for story, but there's a perfectly working game here, too. Each player creates a Hunter (someone trying to fight monsters that only they can see) and assigns him/her powers."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Hunter: the Reckoning is another RPG that looks good in theory and concept, but the actual execution is flawed. Personally, I had been griping for some time that humans (read: people who don't have a WoD book named after them) are basically cannon fodder and statistics to harvest for personal gain. When I heard that an official Hunter book was going to be released (despite the botched publicity stunt at WhiteWolf's website), I thought I could finally implement something to restore some play balance and fear to the other supernaturals (who were becoming more stereotypically arrogant every time they played).What I instead found was something that might be more suited as an independant game, much like how Aberrant could not fit in a typical World of Darkness setting. The Hunters gain their abilities through a weird twist of fate in which the powers manifest. Such powers are based on a series is mindsets (martyr, avenger, etc). It presented a hunter less like the classic Von Helsing, and more like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The &quot;monsters&quot; have less personality and tend to fall under the typical fodder of tv and movies. During a sample session where Hunters were introduced, the intricate plot got pushed aside for guns blazing and much skull-crunching. Definitely a departure from the plot development that I found in the other books.In summary: Don't view it as another World of Darkness book. See it more as a different gaming environment using the same mechanics. Thus, individual opinions will vary."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Finally! I play and storytell White Wolf games for almost 5 years now and although I like Werewolf and Mage, and revised Vampire, I felt there was something missing, the very something that almost dripped from the old 2nd Edition V:tM. Gehenna, Apocalypse and Armageddon are neat. But the World of Darkness should be about rather more subtle horrors, and more internal conflicts. Therefore, I was very glad when I bought Hunter and found out that it's almost as good as the old 2nd Edition Vampire. Its atmosphere, all encompassing paranoia and isolation are perfect in their ability to gnaw at you. Excellent. Even for my players, who are Vampire vets and at least competent Mages or Garou, this is something completely different. For all those, who play for atmosphere and emotional strength of the story, this book is a must. ...Well, two objections (minor, but still here): 1) The art on the Creed Names is HORRIBLE. Shoot the responsibles, please.(The one responsible for Martyr should be burned alive, instead) 2) &quot;Monsters&quot; could be described a bit better. This makes us Kindred all look like impotent morons. Nonetheless, this is one of the best things from White Wolf. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"I always enjoyed a good Hunter game because players are in control of supernaturally imbued characters who are entirely clueless to the World of Darkness. Thankfully with the well written, and familiar, rules, you have the opportunity to fight back against the creatures who prey on humanity. This is not an investigate and run away game like Call of Cthulhu.With that said, a good game requires that the cluelessness is maintained to keep the level of excitement up. You can have players who know about the World of Darkness, but that information should not influencing their character's in-game decisions. A Hunter is not going to know a Brujah from a Gangrel or that a large man in a business suit is a Glasswalker.Overall, Hunter was my favorite of the \\"old-school\\" White Wolf/World of Darkness games/settings. The basic rules are consistent with the other titles in the line, with only a few variations. This made it easy to pick up and start playing on our first night with the rule book."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"If you're interested in playing a vampire hunter, or werewolf hunter... this is a great game to do it based on a storytelling aspect rather than dice rolls.Also, it's set up to play as a kind of survival-horror game better than anything else; it doesn't have the dice rolling of the old Dark Conspiracy game, but you can definitely do the story well with the character outlines provided.The book is well layed out and easy (and fun) to read, with more than a few inspiring sections for a beginning gamemaster. I do recommend picking up the player's guide with it, though, especially if your players are veterans of other RPG's."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Hunter is my favorite RPG in the World of Darknes series. In this game, you do not play an all-powerful vampire, mage, or werewolf... but instead a vulnerable human with a few paltry powers (mostly revolving around detection and identification of the paranormals). I highly recommend the Hunter: the Reckoning for the following reasons: * The StortyTelling system from White Wolf has an excellent resolution engine for tasks and combat. * I enjoy the story line -- playing a vulnerable human hunting very powerful paranormals... trying to understand them, sometimes destroying the evil ones, sometimes befriending the good ones. All of these things combine to make this one of my favorite games to play... and I've been role-playing since the Summer of 1980. If you buy it, I'm sure that you'll enjoy it. There is a decent-sized community of online gamers that play Hunter via &quot;WebRPG Online&quot;. Buy the game and join us. Have a great day!"},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Pardon the title, but really- a fantastic game.I own all of the major (o)WoD titles and have played and/or run them all. I really loved the games, the system, and despite the difficult times I had in trying to run massive cross over games I did what I could.To be honest, I still prefer Vampire the Masquerade, but Hunter is a really close second.The book is worth the purchase for the Flaws section alone. Giving a character a large alimony or a terminal illness helps to keep the characters set in a realistic setting that's hard to get out of other WoD games. The arguement that the characters are too weak to really 'hunt' the other various denizens of the World of Darkness is rather accurate. A man is generally too weak to stand toe to toe with lions and tigers and bears, yet they too are hunted and slain. The complaint that the game is nothing but weak combat and no story is awful. When I was the storyteller we spent about a third or fourth of the night discussing the day to day lives of the hunters- there 9-5 lives. The characters would then band together- guided by a mysterious force- to hunt. I didn't hand the characters rocket launchers and C-4. None of them were kung-fu masters or rogue CIA assassins. A professor, car dealer, truck driver, and - okay I admit- mad scientist type guy. They had very limited combat resources so instead of just off and 'blowing away' vampires and werewolves they had to really be clever, setting traps, researching patterns and habits, and generally trying like hell not to get killed. I have been enjoying the New World of Darkness and PRAY that the new Hunter does a halfway decent job to catch the feel of the old. If not, I'm sure I'll make adjustments as necessary."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"This is a hard game for a true gamer! sadly, the low level of power of the characters of this game can deceive other players of powergaming series like vampire and werewolf. This game is about terror and madness, not to make the world a couple of slaves and show the most powers of strange forces. Through the scenario of the Time of Judgement, this game shows exactly the situation of the humans and the apocalyptic situation of the end of the WoD. Only for experts, not for Powerseekers."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"I've played a bunch of different RPG's, but I have to say that Hunter is deffinately my favorite. I really like it because it's a more realistic setting with more room for character development than, say, D&amp;D. I really like the White Wolf system of dividing a certain number of points between attributes instead of just using dice rolls and getting stuck with the attributes you're given. I felt that this game was very easy to incorperate with other White Wolf games or change around. It gives a very basic set of rules for a character that are very easy to be changed or elaborated on. It gave the versatility to move our characters back in time several centuries and still work. All in all, I just think that Hunter is the perfect base book, if you've got a creative storyteller."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Fans of the previous WhiteWolf rulebooks (Mage, Vampire, Wraith, Changeling, Werewolf) will most likely be disappointed by this fairly new release.I personally reserved a copy of Hunter:The Reckoning about 4 months before it hit the shelves and was saddened when I first read through it. The storyline for even the existence of Hunters is weak, the skills are mediocre at best when compared to the other systems and even the artwork was rather depressing.I leave my rating up at 3 stars only because it is at least new and tries to incorporate several of the other systems which often have little or no ties to each other despite failed attempts at 'crossover' books. I would recommend this book only to hardcore fans of Whitewolf who wish to own all of the rulebooks for their collection. It makes me sad that Wraith was phased out to make room for this monstrosity of a rule set.-Zilean"},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"I've been an avid gamer/roleplayer for over five years, being especially familiar with White Wolf and TSR productions. This is an excellent product for the WoD line, having more game balance than most the rest. The storyline's great, and the idea assortment for character's is strong. All in all a very well done WOD product.In Hunter: The Reckoning the player takes on the role of an &quot;imbued&quot; human - one who can see the creatures of the night who have been stalking and killing us for millenia. &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; is the popular theme of this Roleplaying Game, where the characters will have to decide how exactly they will cope with the sudden changes in their lives."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Disappointing... If your not planning on running a mortals campaign, don't bother with this book. If you are, then use this book alone. It will be very difficult to integrate into the other WOD books.

That's the only interesting thing I thought about this book."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"For many years White Wolf , has allowed us to play all type of creatures that have hunted our nightmares for years , now it is time to fight back!In hunter you play the role of a normal person &quot;gifted&quot; with the power to stop the demons that plauge mankind.It is not an easy task, and many will perish , but in the end it is the right thing to do."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Ewwww... I can't believe I am saying this there is now a WOD game that is worse than Werewolf. Hunter just screams bring in the Combat Drones..... (At least Werewolf had the saving grace of having an interesting backstory.)What in the heck was White Wolf thinking? The whole book is practically begging for some fundamentalist group to tear into it and start screaming about the evils of roleplaying.... White Wolf really crossed the lines of bad taste with this one...."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"You don't need this book at all. If you want to run a Hunter chronicle buy the Vampire or Werewolf or whatever WOD rulebook. The rules are the same and to play a mortal human isn't that different from what a player should already know.Analogue to tribes or clans hunters are distinguished in this book by their reason to hunt and their ways to do it. This is boring!On the other hand, Hunter: The Reckoning innovates the imbued, a term for special super-human abilities. Forget these rules, make up your own. It will be much more intriguing. And most of all I guess in the real world only one in a thousand humans have supernatural abilities. The book implies, that almost every hunter is imbued. That kills the spirit of the World of Darkness. Humans are by definition mortals. They are not that strong, not that fast and not that powerful. They are human. Play it like that."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"The latest in the WoD line, Hunter the Reckoning leaves a little to be desired. If you take out the the &quot;Flavor text&quot; you could trim the book's length by half or more. In and of itself Hunter IS a good game. As part of the WoD however, it's a bit awkward. Once you get past the fact that it reads like a hand book for the Society of Leopold, there is a good concept there. PC's can die rather quickly. Sure you can make every mortal in a mile see the Supernatural for what it really is, but how does that help out againt the BSD that's jumping down your throat? Handy hint, before you run this, read the last part of &quot;Time of Thin Blood&quot;. It's a natural lead off point to introduce Hunter charactors."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"This book is great. If you're a storyteller and you are sick of you players power gaming, here's a little something to make them whimper in fear.

Tempo de espera: 1 ms e 10 dias para entrega em So Paulo."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"It's quite a necessity for making Hunter characters since I'm sure Vampires and other supernaturals run afoul of them from time to time. If you like playing on the Hunter's side then this book is vital. I consider it a staple to the Old World Of Darkness collection, but others may disagree."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Though suffering from a bit of the verbosity that seems to plague White Wolf publications (the supplements in particular; you could halve their lengths if you just made sure each point was made only once), Hunter: The Reckoning is, despite the judgements flung towards it, actually one of the most down-to-earth, difficult, and tactically challenging games White Wolf has released. Though many might instantaneously assume that it is meant to be an Army of Darkness style shoot-'em-up (like the namesake video games based on Hunter), the inclusion of firearms is primarily just a natural human response to grab SOMETHING they can fight back with. Honestly, against blood-drinking walking corpses, semi-spirit werewolves, immaterial ghosts, and horrors far worse, you'll need brains to survive. Unless your storyteller is heavy on action and firepower, trying to play this game in the twinky stereotype it's often given will get you killed, fast. In fact, not all the Creeds (philosphical archetypes of Hunter, which determine their powers) are even geared toward fighting at all. Some try to rehabilitate or cure monsters, while others don't even go that far, simply seeking to understand them, let them know they are not begrudged for it, and leave the doors of forgiveness open. Trying to talk an angry vampire out of killing a roomful of mortals can take on challenges all its own.An issue of confusion seems to be those who mix up the Hunters (capital H; note the full, proper title being the &quot;Imbued Hunters&quot;) with unrelated groups. Though some number of them may have joined groups like the Society of Leopold, Hunters are imbued with their powers when confronted with the supernatural. They share no unified system, no overarching organization or membership cards. Though they can meet with others of their kind, their disorganized nature and supernatural powers set them apart from conventional mortal hunters, be they alone or in groups. The issue of incompatibility seems to be largely unfounded. Imbued Hunters are explained in several White Wolf core rulebooks, and creatures from several of these books are even summed up in Hunter. The relatively minimal mention of them does make sense. Ultimately, the Hunters, as they are, are not a powerful force. All together, their powers and armaments mean relatively little. Only with time, careful planning, and survival could they ever hope to take back the night. It is this ultimate weakness which is their primary dilemma. Still ultimately mortals with a few helpful cantrips and tricks to give them a better chance, most are left with the disappointment of only being able to do what few things they can.Whether you want to play a boomstick-toting zombie blaster, a skittish parapsychologist trying to get a peek into a dark and hidden world, a wandering redeemer seeking to save the inhuman souls of the damned, a stake-toting Van Helsing, or a stiff-collared exorcist attempting to dispel hellish influence from the world, there's a niche in Hunter for you. Just don't pack any guns you can't drop in a hurry. You'll need to shed as much weight as possible when it's time to start running."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"Well, I met only disappointment in my purchase of this book, despite high expectations. I have come to expect only the best from White Wolf, and this product is definietly below par for them. It seems almost that they lost their touch on this one. It lacks the edge of previous releases such as Vampire and Werewolf. However, the best products to compare it too would be the other individual Hunter titles like The Inquisition, Project Twilight, etc. Granted, they set out to have a common man Hunter title, but it comes off contrived and weak in comparison to the aforementioned titles.I would refer the discerning gamer to the other Hunter titles for a good game of hunting down the monsters of the WoD, and to pass on this one."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"I love the World of Darkness and am an avid player of these White Wolf games. I love the idea for Hunter. Here, normal people are awaken to the reality that supernatural beasties are everywhere. However, what has disappointed me about it is how confusing the system become to understand. If you can grasp it, more power to you. This is an excellent source for how Humanity is fighting back.Oh, and for you people how are saying that these humans aren't 'human' anymore bacause of their special abilities - consider this, if they didn't have any powers to fight back with, White Wolf would have entitled this work &quot;Human: The Horrible Death&quot;. Still, you don't want a character without the paranormal 'Egdes', I'd suggest taking a peek at the &quot;Sorcerer&quot; book."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"While White-Wolf did basicly recycle their old games' systems into Hunter, the story is a new one. For years, White-Wolf's World of Darkness has been ruled by the creatures of the night: Reality shatters at a Mage's whim; Ghosts terrorize the living; Vampires see humanity as a group of cattle; Rampaging Werewolves can tear a human apart without a second thought... and not even our dreams are safe from the Changelings. In response to this, reality seems to have begun to randomly choose champions to fight back. The Imbued, also known as hunters, are taking the war back to the doorsteps of the supernatural. As opposed to other WW games, the Hunters are ordinary people with some extraordinary abilities. This is the emphasis of the game. They are students, mothers, doctors, DJs, whatever. But they aren't all fantasticly rich super-strong martial arts instructors. This is a game about finding hope through one's actions, and giving the innocent an easier sleep at night. Also, the writing in the book is well done, and the powers and abilities are fresh as well. Where Aeon floundered, Hunter will stand firm."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"What I expected when I bought this book was an interesting addition to the End Times arc, perhaps clarifying and expanding on the events contained in both Rage Across the Heavens and Time of Thin blood. What I seem to have gotten, at least in my own eyes, is somewhat different.To give credit where credit is due, the game holds up under scrutiny and it is interesting to read through. I'm sure many a novice WoD player will find this game an easier path into the angsty world of darkness, and this is good. The only problem seems to be that... well... this isn't exactly the world of darkness! Let me explain, lest someone go crazy and cancel thier order...This is an official addition to the WoD, but as the previous reviewer stated, it is better suited as a standalone game, and not as a game in the venerated series. The complex, three dimensional villains we are used to are replaced with cardboard seeming targets, lableled simply 'monsters' and fleshed out poorly. Sure, a veteran player of White Wolf games will most certainly use his own sourcebooks for guidance, but the novice is stuck with the vision of B movie grotesques. It also lacks the storyline progression we have become used to. There's nary a mention of our favorite baddies (like Pentex, one of my favorites), lack of the famous (and infamous) characters we've become used to, and overall, a lack of -involvement- in the big picture.The largest flaw is this, however: the whole purpose of playing a human, of creating a frail, relatively helpless mortal is to... well, play a frail, relatively helpless mortal. Giving them powers beyond that makes them superhuman as well, and diminishes the crucial human element.I've had many nonpositive things to say... so let me close with this: The game is not a bad game, it is just better played as standalone."},{"Title":"Hunter: The Reckoning","review":"This book is great.

I love her strong women characters and I love a good mystery as well. In this particular book the main character is divorced by her artist husband at the beginning and she hits on a sure-fire way to avoid him and her immediate social circle by suggesting to her company that they pay her a stipend to travel Europe doing research while the gossip dies down. She ends up staying at the Villa Miranda and who shows up but her ex-husband (the artist) who is painting the wife of one of the owners. A wonderful who-dunnit involving smuggling and murder with another one of Ms. Lee's strong women protagonists."},{"Title":"The Spy At the Villa Miranda","review":"From the back cover: Looking for a way to forget the trauma of her recent divorce, Siri Quain accepted a job as a traveling companion to a sophisticated older woman. The thought of losing herself in the beautiful sun-drenched ruins of ancient Greece seemed to be the perfect cure for the horrible memories of her shattered marriage. . . But then an act of violence fell across Siri's path, and her carefree vacation turned into a fearful nightmare. And to add to the terror there seemed to be no one who she could trust -- no one except her ex-husband!"},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"This is just an index of patterns with references. To be of any use, it should be a computer program/database instead of a book. It is like using a printed table instead of a calculator to solve the formula. I cannot think of a target reader population for this book. I guess it is for people that know every pattern already, but they've forgotten where have they read about them, so this serves as an idex. A waste of money."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"A poorly written and poorly designed catalog of patterns. Hard to read, with a bibliograph/index that takes up approx 1/3 of the book.

It is just what I have been looking for.This book can be read from cover to cover to get an overview of patterns, as well as be used as a reference (which seems to be what the authors intended).All in all, a very useful book for someone who is using or wants to start using design patterns."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"When this book is described as a listing of 700+ patterns, think literally. No UML, no suggested implementation, no rationale, no CRC - just a brief description of the pattern. And I do mean brief; the GoF's Mediator is reduced to six or seven lines. If you're looking for a good book on patterns, go elsewhere. If you're looking for a good index to pattern material you may already have (JOOP, GoF, Smalltalk Patterns, PLoP books, PLoP conferences, and others) this may be a worthwhile investment as the book includes excellent citation sections."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"This is the book that the pattern community has been waiting for! The one source of pointers and intents for all the patterns that have been published about software and selected other topics. In order to locate a pattern, or even know it existed before this book you would have had to have studied all the various pattern books and websites, ranging from the Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson &amp; Vlissides) to the latest PLoP proceedings. This book makes it possible to identify a problem that you have (such as dealing with queues), turn to the index to look up that topic (12 different patterns related to queues are indexed, as well as citations of several collections of patterns), and then turn to the cited pages to determine if the patterns might be useful to you in solving your current problem.The value of this book is not that it restates all the patterns, it is in its ability to index the patterns so that they can be found. I think it does an admirable job of this. To achieve this Linda Rising has tackled the monumental job of documenting the intents of all these patterns. For those patterns that I'm familiar with she's done a great job capturing the intent.This book won't make the reader an expert on the use of any pattern, but will contribute to their ability to create better software."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"Considering that one of the hard parts of applying patterns is finding initially the right one for the problem at hand, this is an excellent catalog to support one in this task. Certainly, it's not a book to start learning about patterns. But after one has done the required homework (reading the GoF and POSA book) it's an excellent place to start hunting for additional patterns. I especially love the multiple indices.I missed two things. I would have liked to see a better context desciption for each pattern and I missed a few patterns that I consider useful. Among those are the recently published &quot;SanFrancisco Design Patterns&quot;, although Pattern purists may possibly argue whether the latter already qualify as patterns by the &quot;rule of three&quot;.In any case, a very good (4 1/2 stars) addition to ones desktop!"},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"Somewhere along the line, AWL decided to release the GOF book as a CD, entitled &quot;Design Patterns CD&quot;. I personally found the cross-linking of patterns via hypertext to be extremely valuable, and &quot;The Pattern Almanac 2000&quot; cries out for the same treatment. Frequently while reading/scanning this text I found myself wishing that each pattern was linked to its on-line source (where available), or that I could connect to related patterns or documents regarding experience with their use.This book is, as others have pointed out, an index. Having this in softcopy would provide another dimension of use that would markedly increase its value."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"Patterns. The current vocabulary of the high end designers and software architects. There are very few universities offering the M.S. courses on this subject; the future language of the software industry. Eric Gamma et al. started this revolution in 1995. It seems that there is no end to it.The author herself has significant experience in the area of Patterns. The book, as its name suggests, is indeed a very good almanac of patterns.The author has taken truly a lot of pains to collect patterns from varous industries &amp; put them in book form. Many of the patterns I have not heard of. That is one of the greatest strengths of the book; it gives you a bird's eye view of all the patterns used in various industries.Another thing I liked about the book, the author mentions relationships with other patterns, though not with details.The layout of the book was not as appealing &amp; the index takes many pages. The patterns should have been accompained by urls. Some url's are given. But, not all. But the effort is really herculean &amp; the author has done a great job to put it in book form.Please note that the book is not for beginners. It is for users who know &amp; use patterns &amp; want to know more about other patterns. I hope the author will come up with more patterns in the near future."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"As a body of literature expands, it reaches the point where collections of detailed explanations become too large and unwieldy to be examined efficiently. When this occurs, it is very helpful for people to collect and organize the descriptions of the features, so that practitioners can quickly look up the general descriptions. That is what Linda Rising has done with software patterns.Each pattern entry in the almanac has the basic information:* Pattern name* Category list of where it is used* Source citation* URL if applicable* What it is designed to do* Related patterns* An experience report citation if applicableMost of the descriptions take up less than a third of a page, so the author has erred on the side of brevity. This was the proper approach, as this is a reference book of brief explanations designed to serve as a primer and a collection of pointers to more detailed information.The good, brief descriptions aside, the real quality of books of this type is measured by the ease of discovery when you conduct a search. The different levels of indexing and the ease with which you can understand them is where one book rises above another. The opening list organizes the patterns alphabetically according to category, the index at the end is approximately one-third of the book and nineteen pages of bibliography are included in the middle. That makes it easy to find a pattern, whether you know it by name or by usage.This is a reference book that you will make use of if you are serious about applying the advantages that software patterns can provide. Neat and well organized, you should be able to find any of the patterns in a matter of seconds, even with minimum knowledge."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"The Almanac is an indispensable tool for the pattern professional. I use it daily in my capacity as a consultant. It's great when I can remember the existence of a pattern, but not quite the name.

The only place I can find \\"all the patterns\\" in one place."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"Having worked my way through a good proportion of the famous 'Design Patterns' book I'm always on the lookout for a simpler introductory book that I can recommend to people new to the subject. In many ways this book fulfills that rle.It is a comprehensive catalogue of pretty much every important pattern published. It includes lots of reference material and a wealth of information on where to find more information. Its weakness is that it includes so many patterns. There is quite a lot of duplication (or, alternatively, variations on a theme) and the quest to include everything means that there is only a limited amount of information about any particular pattern. Additionally, there seems to be little discrimination between what I would describe as 'important patterns' (such as Factories or Composites) and trivial ones (such as the oft quoted 'George Washington is dead').Patterns were first developed by people working in the language smalltalk. They have since outgrown their origins but seem reluctant to let go. As a result you'll find a disproportionate number of examples worked out in that language. Although not insurmountable, it is still a barrier that will hinder the majority of programmers. Fewer examples are also worked out in other, more common, languages such as Java and C++. Since no single language is right for all programmers, I'd have liked to have seen more emphasis on the UML diagrams.Overall, this is a useful reference work to have available in the office though not an essential one for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Pattern Almanac 2000","review":"This is nothing more than a shopping list of patterns.

If you have a wealth of patterns-related material, it may probably be a good addition, providing an extensive index (or more precisely multiple cross-indexes) to patterns and patterns-related publications and resources.

He also presumes that his reader knows even less than he does. The \\"AI\\" he proposes is nothing more than a basic for(;;) loop.

He is aware of some of the limititations of his design but is unaware of their obvious (to any intermediate-level programmer) work-arounds. Secondly, while he is happy to put lavish names, such as \\"Sensorium\\", on empty or nearly empty functions, he seems to be completely oblivious to the real issues a succesful AI mind must address.He throws about refferances to concepts in the AI and futurist community such as the technological singularity but fails to demonstrate any understanding of what they mean. He claims that his design solves the AI problem when, infact, it hardly does anything at all.He claims that his system is suitable for use in robotics, yet he has done no orrigional experamentation.He continues to troll the usenet (sending between 5-7 messages to every AI and transhumanism related newsgroup per month) pushing his book and his lame ideas..

First, the authors seem to have a preference for non-pedestrian-friendly, car-oriented suburban sprawl. Second, I don't know where they got their info. We went so far as to move to one of the communities listed in the book, and after we got there we found out that the &quot;excellent public schools&quot; cited by these authors were ranked 48th in the country, and that there was very little for children to do. Health care was rated 47th in the country and was subpar, expensive and difficult to obtain. Not only that, the community was not friendly or welcoming to outsiders, and it was a most decidedly un-family-oriented environment. We stayed a year and left this town. We had not gone only on the basis of this book's recommendation, of course, but we had taken it into consideration as part of the total picture and it turned out to be extremely misleading.Use with caution.

Each city review had a nice &quot;contact&quot; list at the end, but one major thing missing were website addresses (which would've helped locate more recent data).

Some of it is very quantitative and objective but a good deal of it is personal opinion. The opinions are what allow the book to offer far more depth than the Places Rated Almanac but they also make for a somewhat unreliable set of &quot;facts.&quot; What I like best about the book is that it touches on almost every aspect of living in each of the cities profiled. Medical care, the job market, recreational opportunities, and much more are explored.Because a lot of the information is anecdotal in nature, however, your mileage could vary considerably from the people they spoke to. I have visited multiple cities they list in the book and found that beauty was very much in the eye of the beholder. This book is a worthwhile resource but don't just jump in and assume that their recommendation will mean you would enjoy living there.If you are considering moving, I would suggest purchasing both this book and the Places Rated Almanac to draw up a short list of candidates. Then go there and do as many things as possible that you would if you lived in that city. Go to a movie, check out the local mall, look at a few houses, etc. Get an idea of what it's like to be there on a daily basis.

As a valuable companion to Places Rated Almanac, it presents a good picture of some of the best places to live in the United States. Use this book to help find a good place for your family to live.The harsh comments from the reader in Minneapolis need to be taken in perspective. That reader said that some of the numerical data are incorrectly listed. But all books heavy in numerical data have those PRINTING errors. I can't tell you how many college texts I've seen with numerical printing errors. But just because a math problem number in a math book is printed wrong, it doesn't mean that the mathematical truths are no longer true. Condemning information that is obviously excellent due to printing errors is unfair. The information in this book is valuable.For example, my wife and I spent two years deciding on which community in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, area to live in. We studied school districts, recreation, crime, and many intangibles. Living in Minnesota made it possible to learn first-hand - much more than the general statistical summaries listed in a publication like Places Rates Almanac.We decided on Eden Prairie. The schools have won numerous awards and have among the top-5 test scores in the state. The city was carefully planned to integrate recreation, nature, and family living. Our home is walking distance of two supurb parks, near a regional bike trail, within a short bike ride of a great recreational lake, and a longer bike ride from half-a-dozen other excellent parks and lakes, including a regional preserve. (There are miles of paved trails to bike, walk, jog, or roller-blade.) There is more to offer, too.To our surprise, we later discovered that Eden Prairie is one of the 50 Fabulous Places to Raise Your Family. The book got it right. We were very impressed that the book listed the things that took us months to research.50 Fabulous Places to Raise Your Family details many important facts that you cannot find in most other publications.And by the way, the Minneapolis school district has the second-lowest test scores and the worst crime rate in the state. Minneapolis still ranks among the best in the U.S. when compared to other large U.S. cities, but nowhere near the best Minnesota suburban schools districts: Eden Prairie, Plymouth, Wayzata, West Bloomington, Apple Valley, Minnetonka, Hopkins, Edina, etc.Reading a general publication, such as Places Rated Almanac, groups the whole Twin Cities area together. 50 Fabulous Places to Raise Your Family reaches deeper into specific suburbs around the country.I have only one complaint about this book.

I recommend this book to anyone, old or young. It is a higher step book but still a great one that hooks you onto it. I recommend this book to anyone because it is sharing an experience one girl had with a shark while waiting out in the water.

It is an easy read and good for kids 7 and older. My reasoning on that is that some kids might get scared about the fact that a girl gets her arm bit off by a shark.

I would recommend this book to many people who need a bit of inspiration, and that is what this book was to me. This book was very inspiring, it talked about how she lost atone of blood and how it is miracle that she is alive. Also about how she never gave up on surfing and just kept on trying.

Knowing that a four-teen year old girl, became: a role model, a super star, and a hero to thousands. Don't get me wrong at times it would get a little slow but I was very impressed to know that a young girl like Bethany could write a whole book. What I really thought was cool and unique about the book was that she would be willing to be so kind to show actual pictures of her-self, her family, and her friends. I know I probably should have read the book first but I think the movie was amazing too, not that the book was bad because I liked them both. The book was very different then most books I've read before because most don't go off into something else in the middle of a scene.Within the first third of the book, it already got into the shark attack and I thought it would be boring the rest of the book but then it goes into the past and her memory. When it got towards the end it really moved me to put it all together how Bethany had gone through so much in so little time at a very young age. It was one morning in October in 2003 on the islands of Hawaii, Bethany and Alana were just laying in the water on there boards, when a pool of blood yet Bethany stayed calm and paddled back to shore with her right arm because she had noticed that the shark had taken some of her \\"rip-curl board\\" and her whole left arm up to the bone. when she got to shore Alana's(Bethany's best friend)dad rushed Bethany to the hospital where they broke the news to Bethany's family. she went on a huge adventure from there and became a hero by getting back on the board and became an amazing surfer.

I'd say the grade level to read this book would be 5th or 6th grade and up. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy read, that is both interesting and very inspiring. However, be aware that the events that happened in the movie Soul Surfer, really happened a lot differently than in real life.

Most people would have given up surfing at this point because having only one arm to paddle with is a major disadvantage in competition. But with a supportive family, community, and even world and her strong faith, she came back strong and is now a top ranking pro-surfer. Since the movie, the book has been updated to include her time on the movie set which is a fun addition if you watched the movie.The book was written when she was only fourteen, a year after the attack. Her youth shows as the book does not really go in depth into the emotions and struggles she experienced. Much of the hard stuff--like how she adjusted to things like preparing food with one hand and competing with one arm--was glossed over. (The movie shows this poignantly.) Despite this obvious lack, the story is still inspirational. Her strength and resiliency (whether you care about faith and religion or not) is impressive and you cannot help but be touched by her story.One thing I was slightly disappointed to note was that the cover (a shot taken from the movie) does not show her surfing with one arm. I am not surprised with this decision, but at the same time, it is as though they feel the need to hide it for fear that showing someone with only one arm will scare off consumers. What makes Bethany inspirational is that she doesn't hide her injury (she doesn't wear a prosthetic and she has never let one arm hold her back) and it seems like the publishers should have highlighted rather than hidden this on the cover."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"My 10 year old loved this book...and I make her read the book before she can watch the movie. It's a great story of a girl with tremendous courage!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I get blue once in a while and resort to reading books like this to snap me out of it. I guessed this would be inspirational and sure enough there is a lot of positive energy here. Bethany Hamilton is an amazing woman with a lot of wisdom to share. The book is a quick read (210 short pages) and I read it in one sitting. The story centers on a shark attack while surfing but the details are not too grim for young readers. I give high marks to the author for telling a compelling story suitable for young and old readers of all faiths.So did the book help me get over my blues? Yes, it did and gave me lots to think about. Thank you Bethany!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Great, easy-to-read book that is about an amazing real-life story. My daughter used it as the basis for a project where she has to be that person and tell her story to the rest of her 6th grade class. She is not a \\"book worm\\" but she couldn't put the book down. Highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This is a fantastic book for teens. I brought it to school and it is a hit. They all have heard about Bethany and want to learn more about her. Great inspirational story."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Soul Surfer is an amazing story. Bethany Hamilton loves to surf; it has been her hobby since she was six. It is amazing how she has faced the challenges as a 13-year-old. Bethany was surfing on Halloween when she felt a little tug on her arm ... She paddled to shore... You'll have read this book to find out what happened. Bethany is a courageous person!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Title:Soul SurferAuthor:Bethany HamiltonMain Character:The main character in this book is Bethany Hamilton.She is thirteen years old.She lives to surf.Plot:The plot in this story is that Bethany one Halloween morning she and her friend were just laying on their surfer boards in the water.Then allofasudden she feels a tug.Then she looks down and she sees a pool of blood.

I came across this book at a garage sale and thought I would invest my time and glad I did. I read it in one sitting. Bethany went through a horrendous experience of loosing her arm from a shark attack and then became famous overnight. That is quite alot for a 13 year old girl to endure, to digest and remain stable. Her wonderfully supportive parents, brothers, friends, and church were by her side the entire time protecting her and yet encouraging her to follow what she felt was best for each situation she came upon. I also was really impressed by her tight loyal relationship with her best friend from toddler years. There is so much \\"girl drama\\" these days and girls don't seem to realize how important being a good friend is. She really stays focused on her Christian principals and doesn't waiver like so many young celebrities that have been given such a gift of talent and then thrown it all away. Bethany remains humble through it all and just wants to remain a normal kid, stay close to her family and do what she loves most - surf. I am anxious to read her book \\"Follow Your Dreams\\" to see how she uses the loss of her arm to help others who have as well or have endured something similar. I pray Bethany stays grounded and continues to allow the Lord to order her steps. A most impressive young woman. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"~~*SOUL SURFER*~~\\"It came literally out of the blue. I had no warning at all; not even the slightest hint of danger\\". Out of all the times Bethany has went surfing this one particular time she got bit by a shark on halloween morning. Bethany is a nice girl, with awesome friends and she is 14 years old. Bethany struggles with surfing, writing and other activities. Bethany exercises to get back into shape. \\"A true story of Faith, Fighting, and getting back on board\\". Did you ever think you would get your arm bit off this one particular time?? Bethany has nice brothers and very caring parents. I think Bethany should write another book.By: K. Cannon"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Have you ever gone through an experience when you got your arm bitten off by a shark? Doubt it. Well in the book Soul Surfer By: Bethany Hamilton, she got her arm bitten off by a shark when she was surfing. She kept her faith in God and still followed her surfing dream with one arm only. This is a Non Fiction book so it is a true story.Bethany Hamilton has not written any other books but the one that she wrote is an awesome book. The setting is in Hawaii and the main characters are Bethany and her family. The book does have some weak points, all the surfing information and stuff like that because it gets boring after awhile. The book Soul Surfer is a very suspenseful book once you get to the attack you can't put it down.When you're reading Soul Surfer it will teach you to never give up on your dreams and ALWAYS have faith in god. Someone who might be interested in this book might be someone who got injured badly and thinks that since they got injured they can't follow their dream. Well, a shark bit off Bethany Hamilton's arm and she is living her surfing dream. I think that people should read Soul Surfer because it teaches people to never give up on themselves no mater how bad the case is. So if you ever get your arm bitten off by a shark have a lot of faith in god and never give up on your dreams!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This book is exactly as I expected. The cover says it all, a story of faith, family, and fighting to get back on the board."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This book written by Sheryl Berk and Bethany Hamilton explains and tells the inspiring tale of Soul Surfer, Bethany Hamilton. Bethany lost her left arm to a 15 foot tiger shark, on Halloween morning of 2003. This is not the first time I have heard of her story. but it is so inspiring that I bought this book. I've read it over 4 times, aand it never gets old. It spreads a good message about God, trusting Him, and having faith. It is a great read for everyone in the family, has touched the hearts of many, and have inspired millions. So if you pick this book up, buy it. If you don't like it, that's alright also. But this story has inspired me, has brought me closer with God, an I have more faith. If I had to give it a rarting out of five stars, Bethany Hamilton earns ten."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Bethany is an inspiration to all! I'm glad I got this book and not the original. In this book she goes behind the scenes of her movie \\"Soul Surfer\\". At the end of the book she keeps a journal of the whole movie experience. From picking out the actors to the day the movie was released. It's so awesome to see whole process! I love how she was so open about her faith and just laid it out black and white, plain and simple. Even while filming the movie she would constantly tell the director(Sean McNamara) to keep her faith as the main focus of the movie. Not only did she want to be a inspiration to the world but she wanted to do it through Jesus Christ. This is a book for all ages. Even if she wrote this as a teenager she has the maturity and wisdom that goes way beyond that. I'm 22 years old and I found this book so compelling. I could not put it down! I to am a Christian and in this world we live in it so easy for girls to sell themselves out, especially being in Hollywood. Bethany said in her book that she wants to continue to stay humble and be a good example to young girls out there, even after being famous. How cool is that! Not only has this surfer shown how talented and ambitious she is but, she got to show the world that with Jesus all things are possible! Thanks Bethany! :)"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This is my second time to buy this book, now i have 3 in total. This book is very nice and its good for us.

I actually bought this copy to give to a Christian friend and they were inspired as well."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Soul Surfer is a great book! I read the entire book in a single afternoon! Bethany's story is very encouraging and gives you a great perspective to be thankful for what you have.

I am inspired by her fearlessness and bravery. I am so glad for her that she was able to get past her accident and fear and accomplish her goals. She is a perfect role model for young girls and women."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This book is so very inspirational. Bethany has given many people hope when they are down and out, faith, when they need it most. She is a very human, kind, athletic LADY. I am so inspired by her and her story. BUT......I do have a few issues with all of the religious parts of the book. One does not need to be told how God helps us all the time or have Bible verses quoted throughout the book. But I truly believe that without these religious convictions, Bethany may not have come out of her shark attack, the great LADY that she has become today. I have no issue with her religion or her way of thinking, but to read all about it in a book is a bit much for me. Such a wonderful, if not tragic story that really comes from the heart of a true heroine. Bethany and her story is one to be admired by all who venture to get to know her through her wonderful book. BRAVO to Bethany for sharing her life with so many people and helping them with their tragedies. It was also very interesting to find out the many words that we use in the English language, were started by the surfing world. SURFS UP!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This was a good book that my grandaughter read for a book report and she enjoyed the book, because it showed courage and faith, and wrote an excellent report and got an A for a grade!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I read this book a few months after watching the documentary and it inhanced the story in an amazing way...shortly after I found myself sitting in the movie theater very dissapointed.I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to find out a little bit more about Bethany Hamilton because watching the movie does not, in my opinion, get that story across strongly. There are pictures in the center and it makes for an easy read full of powerful thoughts about the shark attack and fun facts about her family and life in Hawaii.Read the title of this review again...expect that from this book."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"The one major conflict in the book soul surfer is after the attack of vicious shark, Bethany has to overcome her fear of the ocean and overcome the loss of her arm.She solved this major conflick by getting used to the ocean.Also she works extremly hard to learn to keep her balance on the surf board with only one arm.I think the main character in soul surfer, Bethany Hamiltonand the main character tobias Mcivey in the book A land Remembered are very similar.These two characters both have huge obstacles in there life.They both never give up and always perservere.They are different because tobias's problems he faces are mostly about his family,house and cattle.For example when all his cattle got killed by hurricane.Another example is when the confederate soliders bured down his house and killed his animals.While Bethany's obstacles happen after her horrible encounter with a shark resulting with her own arm.Now bethany has to learn how to surf with one arm.Also she has to get over the fear of of the ocean.If these two characters were to meet I think they whould get along great.I think this because because they could help eachother because they both know how to get through struggles in their life.If i were a famous author my Jacketblurb for this book whould be...Ready for exitment?Ready for the story of a professional surfer.Now imagine you were a professional surfer and YOU lost your arm to a shark attack.Your Bethany Hamilton.This is her story....I whould definetly recomend this book to anyone.I whould recomend this book because first it is a amazing story.Secondly because it can help peolple that are going through struggles know that they are not the only ones.Lastly she shows all her readers how to be strong and feirce against many things.I think my friend Aly whould love to read this book.I think this because she loves to surf and she whould learn about a proffesional surfer who went through a shark attack and lost a arm.My friend aly whould be inspired by this book.Everyone who reads this book i think will be inspired."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I bought this book in the paper back version for my fifth grader. She loved the book and wrote a book report on it. This is a true account written by Bethany Hamilton. She wrote her thoughts down, and a writer wrote the story for her. It's a great book of encouragement and faith by her whole family. Her father and mother and both her brothers are wonderful people. Bethany is a lucky girl to be alive, and have a wonderful family. She is also selling parfumes for boys and girls that are shaped like surf boards. Soon a movie is going to be made about this story. I am dying to see it, and compare it to her book. This is a wonderful story, read it, and you won't be sorry. Bethany is a very brave girl, and an encouragement to us all! I wonder though, if they were avid surfers, didn't they know that you shouldn't surf so early, when sharks come in to feed? The water was calm and glassy, not even the kind one would want to try and surf in. Only God would know....."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Storyline - Bethany Hamilton was a great surfer. She was like any other kid, homeschooled, hung out with friends, loved God and family, until one day a shark took her arm. But she wouldn't let that keep her down. She wanted to surf and get back in the water and fulfill her dream of being a pro surfer. With her friends, family, and God, she would make the journey to return to the sport she loves.Personal Opinion - I thought it was a good book but it wasn't the best autobiagraphy I ever read. It talked a lot about her life in the past (what she liked to do, family and friends, and surfing) but I thought there would be a little more about the attack and her recovery after. Also, I don't think the organization of the book was done very well. There were stories but they were told in more of a general way then any specific cercomstance and I didn't really feel or identify with them much (there were a couple that were nicely told but it wasn't the norm). It was written more in a way a magazine writes a story but it was longer. She just told you about things or how she felt but, then again, she does say that is who she is; just tells it like it is. That is fine and all but it made it hard to get into the story. I liked the journal at the end about the making of the movie which was cool. It was a pretty good book and I still think her personal story is great about overcoming adversity but I didn't really learn more than what I was already told."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I saw the movie and loved it. I got the audio book from the library. They leave out so much of the story. There was 15 minutes of just explaining surfer terms, and then probably 30 minutes of her talking about the girl who starred for her in the movie. This part of the book must have been added later??? I assume the book came out first? Usually people say books are better than the movie, not this time! Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Personally I would not recommend this book unless you are a full on Christian. For more than half the book all she talks about is how all she did was pray and that God got her through all of her problems, and how her church and faith helped her most. The book was very boring, and every page was like the page before. My mind would always wander when I would read, because there was nothing exiting. So this is probably not the best book to read."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This is a good inspirational story except it got slow at times and boring. This is a story that should be great and cool to hear about because not a lot of people get bitten by a shark that often but it was not told that great. I was hoping for something better but it didn't happen. Sorry, maybe next time."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Good for Bethany, but this is still a stupid book.I find it funny that she talks so much about God and Jesus and all that stuff. According to the native Hawaiians, the tiger sharks are called \\"amakua\\", which are sea gods. Maybe she should have prayed to the shark so she wouldn't be short one arm!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I had no idea this girl was as amazing as she is! I knew she had been through a lot, but I never knew she was so strong in her Christian faith. It was a fast read that's so worth it!

During the attack she lost her arm to a 15 foot shark. But instead of letting the attack ruin her life, she got right back on her surfboard as soon as she could after the accident. Today she competes in professional surfing competitions even though she only has one arm. When she lost her arm she said it didn't hurt at all. If I were her I would have to say it hurt. Her best friend Alana was right next to Bethany when the shark attacked her and she has been a great friend to Bethany through the whole recovery. She also mentions that her parents and her brothers supported her through everything that she went through or will be going through in her life. I learned a lot from this book. I learned not to ever give up on your dreams and to keep faith in yourself. Another thing is always try to keep a positive mind about anything you want to do. I also learned how important having your family and having their support is and that having faith in God can help you get through difficult times in your life.

Bravo to the professional writers who worked with Bethany to polish this work, yet kept it hers. That is a difficult challenge, met and surmounted in this warm-hearted book. From the eye-catching cover design to the text to the photographs, this is a winnerBravo from a Grandpa who has never been on a surfboard and whose closest encounters with sharks have been through aquarium glass, but who found this work fresh and rewarding, upbeat and honest."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I saw the movie, but it just seemed like the real story would be even more interesting. I'm not too good about reading the books I've bought, but an audio book hit the spot as I can listen to this during my commute instead of mindless DJ chatter. I was right about there being more to the story, and I really enjoyed it. The audio book also includes updates from Bethany about the process of making the movie and her interactions with the people involved. I think these are the notes that are included in the \\"movie tie-in\\" version of the paperback. The only \\"complaint\\" I have is that the woman they chose to do the reading is obviously older than the person whose voice she represents. I'm not sure how old the reader is, but she sounds like she's at least in her 20's. Most of the time it's not an issue, but someone who sounded closer to Bethany's age would have been better. The \\"over too soon\\" refers to the relatively short duration (4 cd's, so about four hours total). Still a great purchase overall and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Love the story. Love the book. I like this version because of all the new photos. Great motivational book.

The shark, mano, represents our subconscious urges. Those urges are to be overcome, through truly growing into our Higher Self, and developing a genuine knowledge of God. There is no substitute for any of this.In this intriguingly titled book, where is the knowledge of the Soul? The Soul of course cannot be constructed or 'ridden' or swapped even decimated as Bethany knows. It is the *experience* of the Soul that is so vital. And it is our experience of conscious growth that we take with us into our next incarnation - Heaven."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Bethany is an inspiration to readers of all ages.

Great idea for gifts!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"At just 13, Bethany Hamilton lost her left arm and a piece of her surfboard to a tiger shark, possibly limiting her accomplishments of her life forever. But did that stop her from surfing? Of course not! Ever since age three, Bethany has constantly been in the water, usually off the beach near her Kauai home. Her parents are probably most to blame. Both her father Tom and her mother Cheri supported her one hundred percent, because they had both surfed all their lives as well. But her parents are also her teachers, since she is homeschooled. Bethany has two older brothers, both surfers, and a best friend named Alana, another surfer, who stayed withher through the entire attack, surgery, and recovery. She has turned pro and is currently sponsored by her favorite surfboard and clothing manufacturer, RipCurl. Bethany really went against all odds the day she got back on the board. No one, not even her own family believed she would ever surf again, but the very first thing she did after the stitches were taken out was go out and buy a new board! Bethany is not only a celebrity in the surfing world, but in the general sports world as well. She has recieved the 2004 Teen Choice Award for Most Courageous Teen, the 2004 ESPY Award for Best Comeback Athlete, and was called \\"The Bravest Girl in America\\" by YM magazine. Soul Surfer is a triumphant and moving account of Bethany Hamilton's fight to get \\"back on the board.\\"Bethany throws her soul into surfing, calling her unique style of the sport \\"Soul Surfing.\\" (Hence the title Soul Surfer). She may have lost her arm in the attack, but she could never lose her faith in God. Maybe her faith motivated her to try again, and it was so strong that she now competes professionally worldwide. Bethany has proved to the world that the body may be a substantial part of surfing, but it's the soul that counts.Truthfully, Bethany's experience has made her a better person altogether, and probably even a better surfer! Her heartfelt passion for surfing has brought her closer to God in faith and in spirit, and could quite possibly prepare her for adulthood better than anything.Bethany Hamilton's first-hand account of the full-on fight to keep surfing is worth the read all the way. This teenage autobiography would interest even the least likely of readers, Bethany's story is so amazing. I recommend Soul Surfer to anyone of any age.-C.

She's the surfer from Hawaii who had her arm bitten off by a shark when she was 14. By coincidence, I was able to watch the movie version the same day I finished the book. Even though it was a wonderful movie, of course Hollywood had to put their spin on it, but what do you expect?Hamilton's story is inspiring because of three things: her ability to not let fear stifle her, the strength of her faith, and her genuine compassion for humanity. Most people would have been terrified to get back in the water, but Bethany didn't hesitate. Only three weeks after the attack, she was back to surfing. As she says, \\"Life is full of what-ifs. You can't let what might happen hold you back.\\"Secondly, she says her faith in Christ helped her through her ordeal. Her faith was just as strong before the attack as after it. This was emphasized heavily in the book, but not so much in the movie. And as for her compassion for humanity, it amazes her when she visits New York and notices that people walk right by the homeless without even noticing them, much less helping them. She says, \\"I can't turn away from someone in need. Not when just a little kindness can go so far.\\"The beauty of this story is that she realizes, at a very early age, that only in our imperfections do we become perfect. She's told, \\"You're something more now than a surfer, you're the bearer of hope for those who have been handed a bad deal in the card game of life.\\" Our biggest liabilities truly can become our biggest assets. That's a choice we make, and it's a choice Bethany Hamilton has made.David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and I am glad I did. What a strong young lady, I admire her strength and love for the Lord. I enjoyed learning how her faith carried her through the shark attack and recovery.It is clear her faith is a major part of her life as well as surfing. Her church, family and surfing all played a role in her recovery. This is a great story of overcoming tragedy and continuing to prosper in your life despite the hardships that you perceive limit your abilities.Bethany has a great outlook on life uses her tragedy experience to assist others with disabilities as well as use her new found fame for a greater cause. She is a great role model for young women and her story is truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Soul surfer is amazing no matter how you look at it.

She was attacked by a shark on Halloween morning while trying to catch a wave.One morning, Bethany decided to surf with her best friend Alana Blanchard. The water was crystal clear until she saw a flash of gray, a split second later, her left arm was bitten off by a shark.Then all Bethany saw was that the water around her turned bright red. She had so much blood coming from where her left arm once was. She didn't cry and she stayed calm and paddle back to the beach. Then she got rushed to the emergency roomThey caught the shark a few days later. After the guy caught the shark they killed it. She thought her surfing life was over. But later she worked on getting back into the water and she went outside and surfed. Bethany did exercise like she would lay on her board and act like she was swimming but with one arm, she would run on the treadmill, and she would move her stump around in circles.I wanted to read this book because it seemed interesting. Also I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie. I would recommend this book to ages ten and up because I think they would like it, because they might like reading about sharks and surfing.I liked it because it was a good story to read and somewhat sad. It was a good story because she got attacked by a shark and didn't cry then managed to get back into the water and now she has finished finals and finished in the nation championship final."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"If you need inspiration, Bethany Hamilton delivers! She learned to live with her tragedy, yet also determined to find direction and purpose from it. She is a living example of Romans 8:28 and how the Lord can turn lemons into lemonade! \\"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to his purpose.\\" The book includes family photos, aerial photos of the beach and the shark that attacked her.

Such an inspiration"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Everyone may know already that this is the book about the 13 year-old surfer who lost her arm because of a shark attack. What they should also know is that this book was meant to be read by people of almost every age starting at 9 or 10 years old. Its language is accessible to fifth, sixth, and seventh graders. I'm actually using it in the classroom, and I have students talking about life lessons that Bethany shares: about being good team players, good losers, patient, and courageous in the face of adversity. In addition, we cover reading comprehension skills, such as main idea, author's purpose, drawing inferences, paragraph types, vocabulary, and grammar skills. Readers also get to know about Bethany's family, which is so important to her strong-willed nature. She goes into great details explaining how her parents and brothers helped develop her courageous character to be able to sustain a quite \\"tragic\\" incident. Courage in a 13-year-old child doesn't come out of the blue. Family and faith make the difference. This book is good not only if you plan to use it in the classroom, it's to be read by anyone who wants to find out the true source of courage. No need for self-help books with this one. It's down to earth and her description of family life and community life gives us the basics for overcoming obstacles and being successful - no quick gimmicks here. It's well written. The vocabulary and sentence structure of the book are appropriate for middle school students. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Soul Surfer is a very inspiring book for 6-9 graders. It encourages you to keep living your dream even if one little thing gets in your way, not to stop and start something else from the beginning. If you've gone so far in your dream, why stop? In my own personal experience, I am able to relate to her story through the struggles and hardships of sports just like she had. Bethany learned took work through her struggles trying to surf with one arm. Just like we do with are troubles with school, sports, and other activities, to help us get to our destination in life. People told Bethany that she might not be able to surf again just like we tell our selves that we cant do that sport or i cant do that homework because it's too hard. If you try you might not know what happens. Bethany tried surfing with one arm and she finally got up and kept surfing."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"this was a choice for required reading for my school. I was totally surprised at her story. She is an amazing girl and I am glad I shose this to read!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This movie tie-in version is much better than the original 2004 version. Not only does Bethany talk about how she helped make the movie about her life, but it has interviews with the actress AnnaSophia Robb who played Bethany, the director Sean McNamara, and the actress Lorraine Nicholson who played Bethany's friend Alana. It also contains new photos taking up to 5 pages. For anyone who wants to know why Bethany Hamilton is such a hero today, this is the book to buy. The way Bethany wrote this book makes it feel like her emotions are ours. This book will bring tears of emotion both happy and sad to your eyes, as it did for me. You'll enjoy this!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"After watching the movie, Soul Surfer\\" I wanted to get the book and here Bethany's own words. Her story is even more amazing and inspirational in written form as it was as a movie. It shows what true faith in God can do. I also suggest her mother's book,\\"Raising a Soul Surfer.\\" It is equally inspirational."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read as a young reader. It is written poorly, And there is more about her trust in god and how she played soccer when she was young then her life after the shark attack. The movie is more what I wanted in the book.Never read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This book was so amazing. I would not even know how much courage it took for Bethany to write this book. I read this book in less then three days! I couldn't put it down, ever. I absoultly admire this girl for being able to write about such a horrible event. I would recommend this book to anybody because it shows so much courage!"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"The Novel, Soul Surfer, is written by Bethany Hamilton. It is an autobiography about her life and her passion for surfing. Bethany Hamilton was born on February 8, 1990 on Kauai, Hawaii. Bethany's parents taught her to surf when she was a just a toddler. When Bethany was 8 years old her parents entered her in her first surf competition. She won her first competition and this triggered her dedication and set her future for surfing. Hamilton's parents were surfers as well, so they strongly encouraged her, and wanted Bethany to love it just as much as they did. She found herself surfing every holiday, making it a tradition. She lived right on the beach in Hawaii; therefore, she would go surfing almost every day. Hamilton was in numerous amounts of competitions since the year she learned how to surf.When she was a thirteen, she was surfing and was bitten by a fifteen-foot shark. She lost most of her left arm in her accident. She had surgery two times and thought she would not be able to surf again, considering she was one arm short. With the constant love and support of her friends and family, she knew getting back in the water was a huge possibility. She overcame her fear, and started surfing again, with even more love and compassion than prior to the accident. She now is spreading words of encouragement to others, and still competing to this day. She is in many commercials and surfer ads.For me, this book was a severe inspiration. Bethany Hamilton is forever one of my heroes. She kept her love and passion for something that she almost lost her life doing. I loved every part of this non-fiction book, and would recommend it to anyone. I always enjoy how she is such a strong Christian, and uses her faith to keep her positive attitude, which keeps her on the waves. Bethany is around my age, so i definitely look up to her, and would love to hear her story in person. This novel actually inspired me, more than any other novel I've read. It also supplies a great message, to never give up something that makes you who you are, all because you lost apart of yourself."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"The book I read for my six weeks book project was Soul Surfer. I chose this book because I thought it would be interessting to read about a younge girl who loved surfing and one day got her arm bit off by a shark. That usually doesn't happen in every day life.A short summary about this book would be Bethany Hamilton was a younge girl who loves to surf more than anything. One day she was out surfing with her friends and family, it was God's plan that her arm would get bit off by a shark. Then the book talks about her recovery through Christ.My favorite character in this book would have to be be Bethany Hamilton. I think that I can realate to Bethany in many ways.Not the fact that she got her arm bitten off , but because we both love sports and we are both Christians. We just seem to have so much in commmon, it's kinda of weird !If someone came up to me and asked me to recommend a book I would probably tell them about this book, Soul Surfer. It's not about some girl's every day life, it's more than that.

This book was surprisingly upbeat as Bethany relates the importance of family, faith and surfing in her life, including the details of that fateful day. You will find vivid descriptions of island life, her friends and her passions, as described by a not-so-typical 14 year old girl. Bethany is an example of overcoming adversity, faith in the face of hardship and an astounding humility. The last portion of the book details how her life has changed as a result of losing her arm, and the resultant fame that comes with being such an outspoken champion surfer who just happens to have one arm, as well as her reaction to the process of the making of the film of the same name.

I turned and followed as they were led to where \\"Soul Surfer\\" was located. After reading the flap, I decided this was a great Christmas gift for many of my young relatives on the mainland. A week went by, and I picked up one of the 5 copies I purchased: DON'T BE FOOLED! This book looks like is is for the 8-16 set but, it is for EVERYONE young and old. A quick, inspiring read that will take your mind off your own problems, and make you realize that God has a plan in everything, no matter what we think or how we feel in times of adversity."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Fourteen year old Bethany Hamilton became a celebrity overnight when a shark bit off her left arm while she was surfing one October morning in 2003. Written in a simple narrative style, Bethany describes her love for her family and surfing as well as her life before and after the shark attack. Living in Hawaii, she comes from a family of surfers. She discusses her faith in God and the strength she finds in her relationship with Jesus Christ.Her description of the events of that morning are the stuff of nightmares, \\"suddenly there was a flash of gray.\\" Bethany's father was awaiting knee surgery in the local hospital operating room when the news came in that a young girl had been attacked by a shark and the room was needed for that emergency. He said later he knew in his heart it was his daughter. The quick thinking of her friends and appearance of a paramedic on the scene helped save her life. There is no doubt though that her survival was miraculous. She learned later that she lost almost half her blood volume.In many ways she is amazed at the interest her story has generated. She does convey her deep faith and hopes that her experiences will serve a greater purpose and help others in times of trouble in their lives.She is just a kid so do not expect high falutin' prose but this is a touching story and the chapter that describes her return to surfing for the first time is quite moving."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"I bought this for my grade school aged niece (it's a young adult readers book), but decided to read it first. Who can forget Bethany's story of getting her arm bit off by a huge shark? It was interesting to learn about her family. Both of her parents moved to Hawaii when they were young to follow their passion for surfing. They met up while working at the island's resorts, and raised their kids to surf as soon as they could. Bethany is a very accomplished surfer, with endorsements from surfing clothes and board manufacturers, and it's uplifting to know she is still surfing and still doing well in competitions after the accident. Bethany mentions that she is happy to do interviews (which she admits are tedious) as long as she can mention what Christ has done for her life."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Anything's possible if you try!!The book \\"Soul Surfer\\" really shows that anything's possible if you try. In \\"Soul Surfer\\", Bethany Hamilton gets her arm bit off by a tiger shark on October 31st. This major situation changed her life forever but she was able to overcome her obstacles with great strength. Not only was it hard to get dressed, it was a challenge to do what it takes in life to survive. With her trust with God, she uses her strength to get through it all and eventually learns to surf again.She was amazingly able to get through any obstacle just like Stacy's grandmother from \\"Ribbons\\". Both of them have a limb that's disfigured and they both have to learn how to use their limb to survive. Unlike Bethany's shark attack, Stacy's grandmother's injury was due to the Chinese custom of wrapping feet. Both girls were determined to not let their disability stop them from doing the things they love. If they had known each other, they would have been a great support for the other.\\"Soul Surfer\\" is about a 13 year girl whose passion was to surf. One morning on October 31st she got attacked by a tiger shark in Hawaii. Luckily she had a great faith in God which helped her overcome the loss of her arm. Bethany wasn't nervous during the attack but her main goal then was to get to shore fast. After Bethany got out of surgery the first thing she said was \\"When can I surf again?\\" Now she is back surfing, has done many interviews and is an inspiration to a lot of people.I would recommend this book to people because this story is an inspiring story. I believe anyone who has a missing body part would love reading this book because they could relate to Bethany and understand her problems. Anyone who loves to surf or enjoys the ocean would love to read this story of a one armed surfer who overcame her tragic shark attack.The theme of this book, I believe, is to never give up. If you set your mind to something, never stop trying. If you get hurt don't tell yourself that's the end. With the help of God you can get through anything! If you get hurt never give up! Anything is possible if you try.Lauren D."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Soul Surfer was a really good book.

She kept her surfing style the same even after the attack. She loves the sport just as much. It is outstanding how she paddled all the back with one arm.

Since the accident, Bethany has won many meddals, and still surfs today!Setting: The setting is in Kauai, Hawaii in modern day.Theme:Bethany has faith and beleives in god,and tries to get back up on her board, with alot of courage.I like the book because it is very encouraging and makes me wonder how life would be with only one arm."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"To be honest, this was an enjoyable and quick read. The writing style of the book was not difficult and had an easy flow to it. I did like how Bethany decided to focus the majority of the book around her life pre and post- attack. Only one chapter was really geared towards the actual attack, which wasn't described in much detail at all.By doing this, she focused on her personal faith in Christ and how that strong bond with her religion and family helped her through the ordeal. Rarely did the book come off as \\"preachy\\" or pushing her religious views, except for the ending chapter. This was a nice aspect of the book, because although her faith was a heavy part of the book, it did not discourage me from reading onwards. One part of the book even addressed the fact that many people think that her family may be too religious, but she countered that with the fact that this is just part of her life. Some people may not understand it, and that does not bother her in the least.It will be interesting to see how my students react to this book. I am asking them the question of the author's purpose for writing the book, and I will be eager to join that discussion. It is a strong lesson about following your drive and determination no matter what the obsticles, but I think they will focus more on the faith aspect of the book and say that trust in Christ was her main objective.Many of my students watched the news reports and have seen the billboards with Bethany's picture and story advertised, so it is definitely a high interest story for intermediate students. The format of the book is also reader friendly because it is sectioned into shorter chapters."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"This is good book for any young person looking for inspiration from a positive role model in our modern world of spoiled pop princesses. Bethany has a rather matter of fact attitude to her predicament, taking it in stride. I read it last year on a trip to Oahu where I got a fin to the head and nine stitches, and as I lay there bleeding I thought how horrible it must have been for her and how my problem paled in comparison. While her attitude is based on her strong religious up bring, the message is not overly strong and is fine for any one's beliefs. It does need to be down rated a star for misspelling \\"Trestles.\\" Shame on the ghost writer and editors for letting such an obvious mistake go: aren't there starving surfers who could have been hired for the job instead?"},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"My daughter needed a book for her school's summer reading project. She picked this book off the list because she'd heard about the author who had her arm bitten off by a shark as an 11 year old, surfing. She was able to get through it quickly and she enjoyed it even though she is not an avid reader."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"At just 13, Bethany Hamilton lost her left arm to a tiger shark, possibly affecting her goals and achievements dramatically in her life forever. But did that stop her from surfing? Of course it didn't! Bethany has been in the water constantly ever since she knew how to swim. She says, surfing is her life and has been since she was three. Her parents have been there for her every step of the way. Bethany has two older brothers, both surfers, and a best friend named Alana, another surfer. She mentioned that without her faith in God she would have never survived and He is the reason she gets up every morning. This book really inspired me to have goals and to achieve and never give up. Bethany Hamilton is a role model to many others and I. I am glad to say that now she is a professional surfer! The sponsor that stuck with her though all the hard times was RipCurl! Bethany is a wonderful girl, daughter, sister and friend to many and I am so glad that I picked up this book and was immediately drawn to it.Bethany throws her soul into surfing; she was born for the board. She may have lost her arm in the attack, but she could never lose her faith in God. He was and still is her greatest hero and model. I really think that her faith motivated her to get right back in the waves.Bethany Hamilton's first-hand account of the full-on fight to keep surfing is worth the read all the way. This teenage autobiography would interest any type of reader. I personally think that to everyone who has read this incredible book including me, there is no doubt that this book has made an impact on peoples lives. What a great book."},{"Title":"Soul Surfer","review":"Bethany Hamilton is a strong in her faith, but when tradegdy strikes, will she ever have the faith to surf again? This is the amazing story of a whose faith and courage could help her surf again. Will it be enough? In this book it really shows the love and passion this has for the sport and the perseverance to take risks again. You will find that faith can be big enough for anything in life, even if you don't think so. This book is targeted to all ages, but mainly middle school students and up.Soul Surfer is mainly for middle school s and up. I also think that this book targets the right audience. For example: indescribable, amputation, and traumatic. \\"I never saw the shark closing in on me. I'm glad that I never had a split second to wrap my head around the fact that I was being attacked.\\" - Bethany Hamilton (Soul Surfer)I think that this book is written in a passionate voice and it fits the character well. \\"Why did God choose me and what does he have in mind for me.\\" -Bethany Hamilton (Soul Surfer) This book is written in first-person.Soul Surfer is an easy book to follow. It explains points and what happened to Bethany in an easy to understand way. \\"It's a thirteen year old female and the arm is gone...\\" -Soul SurferI would recommend Soul Surfer to anyone really. Mainly s though. If you are interested in true stories, this would be a great book to read. I truly enjoyed this book and I think that it showed me how perseverance, courage, and strength are great things to have in life and they can really help in tremendous ways."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],H={key:0},q={key:1};function M(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,P)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(x,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-b0f1a7b4"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/28.md","filePath":"guide/28.md"}'),G={name:"guide/28.md"},N=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{D as __pageData,N as default};
