All you need to know from planning to execution, entry tactics and more. I think this is a good book for police officers (especially for the planning section).If you never have done this kind of work it could sometimes be hard too understand everything , but Mr Londsdale also write in the foreward that he will not explain everything.

More than just a SERT manual however, this book should also be standard training for every police officer. I started my tactical training under Lonsdale and after 6 schools, I would have to say his was the best. I use the tactics I learned from Mark when performing ordinary police work.

The version of the book I have is the Third Printing from 1994, and the only negative thing I could say about my particular copy is that it has a ton of outdated information/pictures of equipment and tactics that are aged (ultimately having been revamped since).Otherwise, it's a great addition for anyones toolbox, and whether you're a Law Enforcement official, military servicemember, or anyone else in a similar field, you should pick this up. I'll be getting the newest copy of the book here myself soon."},{"Title":"Raids: A Tactical Guide to High Risk Warrant Service","review":"This book is well written, and covers SWAT topics at a more realistic entry level vs. other texts I have seen having SWAT in their title.

It is believed that the boy was kidnapped by members of a mysterious cult that lives nearby; however, the Hardys aren't so sure. Their investigation leads them to the remote timberlands of New Brunswick in Canada where they come face-to-face with a mad scientist who calls himself the Devil. This was a fairly good book. The story is interesting and is well-paced. The author obviously put some thought into the plot and setting; however, he still made some minor geographical mistakes (for example, it is Saint John, New Brunswick, not St. John). I must admit though that I'm tired of seeing that every time the Hardy's go to Canada, EVERY Canadian that they meet is French. Despite my complaining, I did enjoy the book and I feel that most fans of the series would as well."},{"Title":"Drachman's Dilemmas","review":"...but not too.

Witty, sharp, and subtly sarcastic, the author's simple writings show a first person sense of underlying bewilderment.

This book was more enjoyable than I had expected."},{"Title":"Drachman's Dilemmas","review":"This is a MUST READ book. It had all the elements of captivating it's readers.

Once I got through that part I loved the book! Being from Michigan I could picture every place Mr. Livernois was referring to and it got me very involved in the book. It is a very quick read. Once it got going I never put it down. His very detailed writing allows the reader to completely picture everything drachman is experiencing. Great book!"},{"Title":"Lost statesman,: The strange story of Pierre Mendes-France","review":"\\"Lost Statesman\\" is a political biography of Pierre Mendes-France, one of the few outstanding French political minds and personalities of the French Fourth Republic of 1944-58. It's also a detailed study of the political culture and system of post-Second World War II France, how and why it was dominated by men, ideas and organizations that were short-sighted, cowardly and dysfunctional, a regime whose chief goals were the protection of entrenched parochial interests at all costs and the elimination of anybody and anything that threatened to upset that system. The Fourth Republic ruined itself with its intractable colonial conflicts, culminating in the Algerian War of 1954-62, a conflict at its peak when Werth published this book in 1957. One of the greatest losses to France, however, was the marginalization and effective loss of one of the country's most brilliant minds and potentially transformative leaders of the post-war period, perhaps of the 20th century. Werth's biography also provides some insight into French society of that era, and the ideological and class struggles that ultimately were the foundations of a regime of vested interests interested in paralysis. Those familiar with recent French history know that this institutional paralysis was broken only by the return to power of Charles de Gaulle in May 1958 during the Algerian crisis, followed by his imposition of a quasi-authoritarian regime that broke the political deadlocks of a deeply divided country. The vivid and detailed analysis of the Fourth Republic provided here will shed considerable light of why this happened.Alexander Werth was perhaps the most astute foreign observer of French society and politics from the early 1930s until his death in the late 1960s. A Russian-born British journalist and commentator on French affairs throughout these decades, all his many books on France have a depth of detail and breath of outlook that even the best of today's \\"investigative journalism\\" cannot approach. He combined a broad view of French history with personal acquaintances or knowledge of almost all the major players of his day in the French establishment of politicians, business magnates, intellectuals and trade unionists, and first-hand understanding of the sensibilities of average Frenchmen from workers who voted Communist to devout Catholics who supported the Christian democrats; to say nothing of embittered petty-bourgeois and die-hard colonialists whose latent fascism helped bring back de Gaulle, to their subsequent regret. But that story is covered in another one of his books."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 514burgundy index) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather","review":"My Dad has an old 1964 publishing of this Bible. It is beautiful, so I thought I'll get one. Boy was I surprised by the difference. The new bibles are of poor quality the paper is not even close to the old. The binding is far less than it used to be. The content is about the same, I really like the chain reference system, any thing you want you can find. So my recommendation for this Bible is it just is not worth the price they have set, back in the 60's it was , but now the workmanship is terrible.

I do have several Bibles published by other companies, and there is one, The Nelson's Study Bible, that I find to be quite good also in its information, so I'm using that as an alternative (opinion) during study. But this Bible will take it's reader clearly into the heart of the message by offering verse after verse (the \\"chain\\") to read on a particular subject.

I also recently purchased the NKJV for myself. Although I do appreciate the commentaries, I believe Scripture should interpret Scripture. Notes from Christian authors should stay outside the Bible covers. When I am reading and dissecting the meaning of a verse, I will follow the chains and have never been disappointed, and have been able to come into a broader understanding of that verse. If ever I want to bless someone who is hungry for the Word, a serious learner of the Truth, this is the Study Bible to give them. It is quality made with genuine leather, not bonded leather. It is hand sewn and pages are also glued, the 9pt font is easier to read, the index tabs are an added plus.

The author refutes this idea, proving that Blixen's physical problems were due to the various drugs and poisons she took to combat her alleged illness. However, Donelson somehow misses one glaringly obvious detail--it's clear, reading this book, that Blixen never had syphilis at all! First, her husband (apparently the only man she was sleeping with at the time) never showed any signs of the disease. Second, Blixen never tested positive for syphilis--indeed, we have no proof that any doctor ever diagnosed her as a sufferer. All we have is her word for it, which is clearly suspect. Blixen, from what this book says, was a fantasist--or, if you want to be blunt, a pathological liar, who clearly loved to create an \\"image\\" for herself. Plus, she had particular reason to have a neurotic fixation about syphilis--her father committed suicide when she was a child, and it was said he did this because he found he had contracted the disease. This was bound to leave its mark on her.Granted, this was a relatively minor aspect of Blixen's strange life, but I find it odd that the author would refute one aspect to the \\"Blixen syphilis legend\\" and not take it to its logical conclusion."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"Dr.Donelson's well-researched biography of Karen Blixen is a balanced look at the Danish writer's years in Africa. Wonderfully sympathetic and leisurely paced, this \\"Untold Story\\" is less a revelation of startling new facts as a skillful new presentation of the many facets of Blixen's life on a Kenyan coffee farm. Donelson's sensible narrative is enhanced by a keen insight into Blixen's literary works. The biographer peels back the onion to reveal the link between Blixen's fantastic adult fairy tales and her relationships in Africa.I am a great fan of literary biographies and this book remains a solid favourite. Donelson shows a great understanding of Blixen's story but her restrained approach lets both Blixen herself and Africa share in the telling."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"Donelson's work makes very compelling reading.

Not only is it beautifully and engagingly written but it describes the setting and the era superbly. The reader learns about the different lives of the aristrocacy and middle class, the Danish, the English and the different African tribes and the development of the city of Nairobi. The setting just before and after Wold War 1 and it's effects on East Africa are very interesting. The African landscape and climate and the differences between the coastal climate and the mountains, the vegetation and animal life are vividly drawn with just enough detail to excite the reader's senses and never ventures to the tedious. Donalsen also draws and fills out the characters in Karen Blixen's life with a superb elaboration of Karen Blixen herself."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"This book is a biography of the author of Out of Africa. The author is a woman who lived in Africa for many years and lived close to the house where Karen Blixen lived. She has done a lot of research about Karen and recorded it in this book. She only includes incidents that have been recorded in Karen's letters to her mother and brother, or have been authenticated in other sources. She does include the rumor that Dennis Finch Hatton was gay.

Extraordinary women like this must be gently, sympathetically revealed, not disrobed or exposed, as they have so much to teach us. It is always a blessing to see fine writing, too, and Dr. Donelson has an especially satisfying style.

I had read some of Dinesen's writings in the past and love the movie, Babette's Feast, based upon one of her short stories. Blixen was a complex person and I've always felt that I didn't get the 'whole picture' in the film 'Out of Africa'. I decided to read this rather than other writings by the author. I was not disappointed. It isn't a simple task to take such a complex personality and distill various facets into a cogent whole. Donelson does a good job at this, particularly giving some insights into the medical contradictions in her life. The one thing that I don't think works quite as well is Donelson's attempts to find the author's own personality/experience in various aspects of her writing. That seemed a bit of stretch at times. But, if you're looking for a good biographical read about a complex personality, and are interested in Eastern Africa during the 20's, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"For anyone with an interest in the life of Dinesen (Karen Blixen), this is a good addition to the library--unless you have read all of Dinesen's letters and books, because this is, verily, a compilation of writings already published--albeit a good compilation. The excerpts from Dinesen's writing can be irksome, however, when the author supposes they are thinly-veiled accounts of her true life. Some of these suppositions require a real leap of faith--especially because, most times, the gender must be transposed for Donelson's theory to hold water.I did not find that the medical notes were the focus of, or detracted from, the book as a whole.I have to ask: why is this book so doggone expensive? It's good, but not worth $35.00, given the fact that nothing new is brought to light."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"Linda Donelson's book is so far (to my knowledge) the only work on Dinesen to move beyond the Hollywood movie &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, the glossy version of Dinesen's own glossy memoir by the same name. Judith Thurman in her wonderful and lauded biography also writes a great deal about Dinesens's years in Africa, but Donelson's book is concentrated wholly on Dinesens's time there.Donelson's writing is wonderful, transporting the reader to another time and place, but at the same time making Dinesen seem very real and very human. It is also the only work that gives us a Dinesen profile that in fact fits the one that comes to light through Dinesen's OWN letters from Africa (still in print and a must read for any true Dinesen fan) to her family in Denmark during the years 1914-31.Her memoir &quot;Out of Africa&quot; was Dinesen writing nostalgically in retrospect about her lost paradise several years after her return to Denmark from Africa. The film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; is without doubt a gorgeous and highly entertaining composite version of Dinesen's memoir as well as other works on Dinesen, including Thurman's bio. However, Donelson's book gets at the truth. Whether one likes her work or not depends. If you are the kind of Dinesen fan who prefers the glossy nostalgic version, you might be irritated that someone would &quot;dare&quot; to go beyond the pretty fiction. If however you want the truth, confirmed in Dinesen's own letters, you will enjoy Donelson's book immensely."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"There's a very fine line between autobiography, literary non-fiction and a historical novel. Karen Blixen's (Isak Dinesen's) _Out of Africa_ walks that line very carefully.Linda Donelson's _Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa_ does a wonderful job retelling the Karen Blixen story that was obliterated when the middle-aged baroness began to transcribe and transform her Africa experiences. Using a voice similiar to Blixen's own sweeping narration, Donelson tells a story of the story behind the story. She often transcends direct quotation by providing a backdrop of letters and journals and memories that evoke what has always been left unsaid.While a good biography, Donelson's short-coming is her literary interpretation, which sometimes becomes too concrete and narrowed. She seems to read the stories only for their insight on the author's life. While telling the story of the story, Donelson risks diminishing the mystical charm of the story and replacing it with only her own specific meaning.But, Donelson, as a physician, is not writing a literary biography. Her tour de force is her reevaluation of Blixen's medical condition at the end of her life. The story teller ends her days by telling herself the story that has syphillis. Donelson exhumes the sad truth: that Blixen, and not her philandering husband, condemned herself to sphyllis-like symptoms late in life.Donelson's book effectively recreates a life that gets blurred in her own autobiography, muted in other biographies and completely lost in film."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"Many reviewers have focused on the medical aspects of this biography, and while these digressins are interesting, I think it trivializes Karen Blixon's life and this book to say her medical history is the focal point.The facet of this biography that most interested me, and is fully explored by Donelson, was Baroness Blixon's genuine love of the African natives. As a social scientist, with major interests in international migration, the foreign born, and various ethnic and tribal groups in the United States, I am fascinated by the depiction of the various tribes in Karen Blixon's writing. Having read a number of books by and about Africans, including ethnographies, I find the descriptions of the Kikuyu, Masai, and Somali people extroardinary. Persons of African descent might enjoy this book (inspite of the English colonizers)simply because Karen Blixon was an ethnographer of sorts and Donelson distills a great deal of information from her written observations.Baroness Blixon acted as employer, physician, friend, and mediator for the people who lived on her farm. She developed medicinal skills to deal with the ailments and injuries likely to occur in daily living. While some of the European practices were bizarre, it is also true that some of the native remedies were equally bizarre.Baroness Blixon was Scandanavian, and seen as sympathetic to the Germans in WWI, a view that caused her enormous hardship in this English colony. As a result, to some extent she remained an outsider to the English community, which probably facilitated her acceptance of and by the native community.The second major aspect of this book that I actually found quite troubling was the wanton destruction in the years the book covers. Baroness Blixon took part in more than one hunting safari (Finch-Hatton was a safari guide). Although she had more regard for animals and peole than many of the other European settelers, I still find the carnage of this era disgusting. It is haunting and sad to imagine what East Africa must have been like before it was first &quot;invaded.&quot;Baron Blixon was grief stricken when she finally left her farm in the Ngong hills, but she loved Denmark, and made a good life for herself after she returned home. She was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature, and lost to Ernest Hemingway. For my money, she should have won on her correspondence alone. (She used the name Isak to hide her sex from readers who preferred male writers in that day and age.)Beryl Markham (Purvis) shows up in several places in the book, and appears very different from her portrayal of herself in &quot;West With the Night.&quot; She is also a bit different from the character Susannah Harker plays in the film &quot;Heat of the Sun&quot; loosely based on her life as an avatrix."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"The difficulty with writing a biography about Karen Blixen lies in the fact that until the latter part of her life, she lived very much as a solitary and intensely private individual. Consequently, the part of her life we are most interested in, her time in Kenya, are closed except for the glimpses one gets from her letters back home. Donelson has done an admirable job of trying to move beyond Blixen's letters. She relies primarily on interpretations of Blixen's books to give more flavor to Blixen's motivations and state of mind. Naturally, it will always be speculative to speak of someone else's intentions. What I appreciated most in this book was the presence of hard numbers. We do get a better sense of the economics of the whole farm deal than with Thurman's biography.Ultimately, the picture that emerges of Blixen is an unflattering one. Donelson downplays Blixen's self-avowed attachment to Africans and points at her neediness and helplessness. I'd recommend this book as a good counterpoint to the unrestrained romance of &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. Why did Blixen write &quot;Out of Africa&quot; the way she did? On reading &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa&quot;, as was suggested in the introduction, Blixen wrote the book to convince others that her experience in Africa was not a failure; but perhaps also to convince herself that despite the trauma of personal and financial loss, it was worth it."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"Karen Blixen/Isak DinesenIn the movie \\"Out of Africa\\" I believe that the writers of the film script missed a wonderful opportunity. In the book \\"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa, Karen Blixen's untoldstoy, by Linda Donelson\\" a reader can find an exciting, wonderful, semsual, complex woman. A woman that is not the same person that appears in the movie. Sometimes, too often movies are made with just the vision of great profits alone, artistry be damned. Too often movie moguls seem to be most interested in maintaining the glory of the lead characters and less interested in telling the great story they have to work with. The Out of Africa Movie would have been so much better with new leading people and a script that didn't have to paint Barron Blixon as such a heavy and could have given a more realistic picture of the marvelous unique man, Denys Finch Hatton. I suspect that the script may have been contaminated by impute from forces that might have been less than insightful. As past history has demonstrated the Moguls some time miss the mark by a long ways.Linda Donelson in her book, which is smooth reading, does a most wonderful job of letting us see inside the rich character of the real people in this story. But not only that, a long the way you taste and feel Arica and you begin to understand the remarkable history , not only of Nairobi and it's surrounding African wonderlands, this book is magic in the way it blends in social history and world events with close personal feelings and experiences."},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"For the past several years, America's premier safari outfitter, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, has recommended one book about Isak Dinesen. Their list of recommended reading says, &quot;Donelson's well researched biography offers a candid portrait of Karen Blixen and her complex relationships. The author spent years living in the Ngong Hills of Kenya, where Blixen farmed from 1914 to 1931. The book recreates the physical, social and political atmosphere of colonial Africa in fascinating detail.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"Beautiful, lyrical writing. So descriptive that you feel as if you were there. Astonishing in afterthought to realize that Dr. Donelson didn't have one actual line of dialogue--no &quot;he said&quot; &quot;she said,&quot; yet it reads as if conversations took place.I gave this book recently to my daughter for her birthday. It is the best gift I could think to give anyone who loves to read.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out of Isak Dinesen in Africa: Karen Blixen's Untold Story","review":"I loved this book and will keep my copy of it alongside my collection of Isak Dinesen's work because I know that I shall refer to it frequently. Dr. Donelson has such a beautiful and completely civilized way of seeing all facets of this complicated woman that I knew from the first page that the book would not startle or distress me with a common, contemporary take on Blixen's life. Extraordinary women like this must be gently, sympathetically revealed, not disrobed or exposed, as they have so much to teach us. It is always a blessing to see fine writing, too, and Dr. Donelson has an especially satisfying style. I recommend this book to all of Karen Blixen's readers today and in generations hence."},{"Title":"The Tao of Silence","review":"I'm sure that the author had the best intentions, but this work comes across as a collection of clever psudo-wisdom that would be more at home in fortune cookies.It is not completly without merit, but if you are expecting a book on the level of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; or &quot;The Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma&quot; or even &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Ingenious Inventions of Domestic Utility","review":"This is a fun book loaded with interesting and weird whimsical domestic devices. The fun is in trying to figure out &quot;what the heck is that!!&quot; This book is loaded with great photos and explanations of domestic devices such as: egg scales, foot warmers, sausage plungers, rug beaters, chimney cleaners, chicken catchers and more. You have a veritable feast of pictorial guessing games in this book. Test your knowledge of artifacts from America's past. It's great fun!!! And educational too. :0)"},{"Title":"Vadose Zone Hydrology","review":"I have used Dan Stephens' book as a textbook in a graduate-level Geology class on the vadose zone. It was ideal. A lot of unsaturated zone books have been published in the last several years, but none of the others was suitable for my purposes. Dan is an engaging speaker and teacher with lots of real-world experience, both as a teacher/researcher at New Mexico Tech and as an environmental consultant specializing in vadose zone problems. His experience comes across in this book, as does his personable way of presenting the information. Yes, there are equations. But this is not a soil physics textbook as much as it is a geosciences perspective on the vadose zone. This perspective is based on his extensive experience in arid and semi-arid settings, but some of his comments shed light on vadose zone processes in more humid climates. I should add that his treatment of this dry subject is not &quot;dry&quot;, and relatively easy to read given the textbook breadth of material covered. Each paragraph could be expanded into a separate dissertation. Stephens has condensed a wealth of material, both practical and theoretical. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Vadose Zone Hydrology","review":"The basic concepts and theory of vadose zone hydrology is presented. The text is well written and organized. I've found the information on vadose zone monitoring, characterizing, and deep soil-water movement very useful. The author also presents case studies which demonstrate the practical application of the subject matter."},{"Title":"The Anglo-Saxons","review":"During the 1960's and into the 1970's Pelican put forth a range of books that covered various peoples such as Vikings, Hittites and Phoenicians. Perhaps unsurprisingly for Pelican they also sallied forth with a book on the Anglo Saxons.Now firstly it must be said that later archeological finds may impact on some of what is imparted here. However my overall 'gut feeling' on this small, somewhat breezy book is that perhaps not a huge amount has changed in our overall understanding of the Anglo Saxons and that later work has perhaps just fleshed out things more and more. And given the brevity of the book it's a fair call to say that only the salient points would ever be discussed in a book of this size anyway.A number of photographic plates are included in the book along with some line drawings (in my edition at least) and it all helps the laymay understand more about the people who in essence came to dominate great swathes of territory in their newfound home. A worthy book overall and one I have good memories of though those hankering after a highly scholarly work may want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"Having read a number of Custer books, and visited the sight twice anything on the bookshelf about this subject is an immediate purchase.The character development in the first half of the book took a while ( thus 4 rather than 5 stars) but once that was over the story was unraveled in very readable, interesting and fascinating style. The explanation of the deployment of the troops before the Last Stand was really well done and as good an explanation and description as I have read on the subject. This will not be the last book on the subject but it will surely rank as one of the best. Thanks for the epilogue. Great to know what happened to the people involved."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"Two of the greatest figures in historical history are put under the microscope. Not only do we learn and walk in the lives of George Armstrong Custer but with General Crazy Horse, an almost Christ-like figure of humility and master of warfare. Crazy Horse fought for his people and their right to their land. Custer was a very complex character who loved his wife and his country, however, he believed he could never be defeated, a modern day warrior with Caesar complex. Robert Skimin has the skill and ability to present these two great leaders warts and all.What exactly led to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. It's inside these pages."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"Mr. Skimin's book is not for people who have in-depth knowledge of the Little Big Horn; but I don't think it's for people who don't know much about it, either.There is too much low-skill novelizing. Too many real people brought in just to make a book, mixed in with invented folk who read like cliches. The true and known stories from 1876 are strong enough without inventing sex in the tipi (Indian side), the jocular inventions in the Bismark brothel (soldier side), and the invented conversations between the Custers (tho fortunately Skimin does draw the veil with Autie and Libbie). And why use a real person's name and make him a racist/sadist if you're going to invent a Jewish victim? Why not invent the sadist too? That didn't seem fair to the real sergeant. Mr. Skimin willingly invented half a dozen Indians and gave them leading roles. Why not the sadist?Aside from mixing up Miles and Myles, at the end of the book the man we've come to know and admire as Frederick Benteen suddenly becomes Thomas Benteen. Fred's brother was there? Clearly there was no editor on this project, but Mr. Skimin must have been napping when he read the galleys.Mr. Skimin did a very good job of building a narrative around Custer's last winter. This may be the first time I can tell you where he was from December to May 1876, and I've read everyone from van de Water to Utley.But I didn't appreciate the fictionalized last stand, with Keogh or Keough being run through by our Indian hero, nor the detailed inventions of how many times Tom Custer was shot or that Cooke was shot twice and also hit with an arrow. The book just isn't written well enough to make that stuff work. For someone who did that fine, try Hoffman Birney's \\"The Dice of God.\\"You can tell this book by it's cover. The photo of Custer is from the Civil War. He was photographed many times on the frontier. Why not use a photo more appropriate to the book? I don't know."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"I was compelled to buy this book because of my long-standing interest in the conflicts between the whites and the Indians. This fictional novel, based on historical events, was found to be extremely light. Robert Skimin fleshed out characters, at times, in odd ways. I especially disliked the way real people were saddled with sexual, sadistic, and/or prejudicial characteristics. At times characters seemed to be introduced in a helter skelter manner just to add to the list of real people that he included in the novel. In places, I felt, he mixed combinations of traits just to add a new twist. For example, he had a former Jewish Russian solder, who was a black belt in Judo, defend himself against a sadistic, bigoted and not too bright sargent. Robert Skimin did stay with the historical facts surrounding General Custer and the events that led up to his defeat at the Little Bighorn but as a whole any grade school history student could have easily gotten the same information about the Sioux, Cheyenne, and the 7th Calvary.Also recommended: Custer's Luck, Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas, Killing Custer, Black Elk Speaks, The Road to the Little Big Horn-and Beyond,"},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"Robert Skimin's The River and the Horsemen is a slashing good yarn that grabs you and never lets go...with a blending of fact and fiction that works a special kind of magic. All the great actors on the Little Bighorn stage are here and Custer's Last Stand has never been better told. This book will jump to the top of the lists and likely stay there.--Frank E. Vandiver, Distinguished Professor of History, Texas A&amp;M University and author of Black Jack: The Life and Times of John J. Pershing and Mighty Stonewall."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"This book is a blend of fiction and history, but works better as history than as fiction. The dialogue is stilted. An example: Custer says to his wife Libbie, &quot;You are uncommonly wanton, Madame.&quot; Libbie responds, &quot;I like that term, you handsome devil, but you didn't answer me.&quot; (p 5) In addition, the characters are little more than caricatures, so the reader does not really get involved with them.As history, the book demonstrates that Custer's decisions were arguably defensible based on the information he had--in one sense, &quot;Custer's luck&quot; had simply run out and the fates worked against him. All things considerred, though, Custer was responsible for the disaster because he was an egomaniac who, thinking he was invincible, recklessly entered into a battle he could not win. Although the book does a decent job of presenting the catastrophe from various perspectives, the book shows signs of carelessness. A minor but telling example is that the spelling constantly alternates between &quot;Miles&quot; and &quot;Myles&quot; Keough.The River and the Horsemen will appeal to people interested in Custer's last stand, but will not hold the interest of the general reader."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"This is a wonderful novel written by a gifted author. It's the best book on Custer ever written. Thanks Bob Skimin for keeping me up nights while reading your book."},{"Title":"Shelter","review":"Title: ShelterAuthor: Dan LjokaThe Plot: A limited nuclear attack on the United States escalates into global nuclear war and, in the process, the US, Russia, and China explode a large number of Cobalt bombs. The story is effectively two novellas, one covering the lives of 19 people in a bomb shelter near Washington DC and the other covering a last minute attempt by the New Zealand government to build large shelters in train tunnels to save thousands of people before the fallout arrives in the southern hemisphere.The story in New Zealand is a tale of honorable people doing their best to try to save something of humanity, in the face of overwhelming odds. The story in the US is a tale of dissimilar people forced into close quarters, eventually developing into in-fighting and madness.The Writing: The writing is well done and the story is gripping. There are a higher than average number of editing flaws, such as misspelled or incorrect words. Perhaps 10th grade reading level, but there is a very adult sexual theme in one of the two story threads.Details on the Volume Reviewed: Published by Manor Books. 1973, 1st printing. Paperback. 224 pages in a small font.Opinions on the Plot: The consequences of the fallout are probably overblown, although the scenario discussed in the book is based on the worst case scenario of widespread use of cobalt bombs, which produce fallout with a half-life of roughly five years. This is a grueling book with an ending that most people will probably find unsatisfying. It is worth a read, particularly in a genre with so many weak showings, but brace yourself before reading."},{"Title":"The Alamo: An Illustrated History","review":"I was very disappointed when I heard that the writer of the book had never even been to the Alamo! The book is put together in a haphazard way and does not offer any new insights.The publishing company seems to have jumped on the bandwagon to have a book about this famous place on its listings. The focus of the book is not really about the Alamo, but about people and places that do not directly relate to the place or San Antonio. True students of history will appreciate and recognize a well-organized work that is put together with the true meaning of history at the forefront."},{"Title":"The Alamo: An Illustrated History","review":"This is an excellent book on the Alamo, very accurate, easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable.

Reading this book brought to life the what really happened at that missionary in Texas.Once you open this book and start reading you'll be transformed back in time and ride along with Fanin's Army, meet Sam Houston, follow Jim Bowie and share a laugh with Davy Crockett.The author's ability to transform the one event that has always remain the folklore of history into so much more is nothing short of remarkable.

This is turly an historical novel, an epic of such proportions that I may never forget the characters.Smith took the powerful history of South Africa through the 30's and 40's and mixed in several powerful story lines with memorable characters. I came to feel that I was living with the central woman character, Centaine De Thiry Courtney, as the author created the fine stories of her life and the lives of her two bastard sons.I learned of their romances and politics and followed their lives, which took me through the workings of the diamond mining industry, the exciting times of the 1936 Olympics, the violent years of WWII, and the forming of Apartheid. All this and let me not forget the wonderful journey through the beautiful and dangerous South Africa."},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"I HAVE EVERY SINGLE BOOK HE HAS WRITTEN STARTING WITH \\"WHEN LIONS FEED\\" AND I'VE BEEN HOOKED SINCE.

He has a gift for getting to the heart of men of power and what shapes them and the continent they have fought to possess.I fell in love with Africa when I was 10 years old and found a Tarzan book in a used book store. My roommate in university was from Southern Rhodesia whose father was a newspaper publisher who was trying to get rid of the Ian Smith regime. Wilbur Smith gives a more gripping feel for Africa than either of those sources did. Whenever I need to come down from a too high stress life of my own, I sit down and read Wilbur Smith. Have been through all his trilogies several times and never tire of them."},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"ALL WILBUR SMITH BOOKS ARE OUTSTANDING. I WISH THEY'D MAKE MOVIES OF HIS STORIES...............I HAVE PURCHASED EVERY BOOK HE HAS PUBLISHED!"},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"Mr. Wilbur Smith is one of my favourite novelists. His style, plot, rich knowledge and portrayal of political and ethnic conflict in Africa are some of many qualities that make me admire him. He tries to write objectively about the different peoples he portrays, though his identification with the &quot;White Anglo&quot; i.e. Whites of English descent is apparent sometimes beneath his facade of impartiality and tolerance. This shows least in this book however. The continuing struggle between the English and the Boers is portrayed in the conflict between Sean Courtney and Manfred de la Rey and their respective families. The Blacks slowly but surely enter into the struggle for power. The mentality and motivtion of each of the three groups is explored and beautifully conveyed. The surprising and complicated long lasting results of the endeavours of each group in the struggle for power is portrayed. The insensitivity and cruelty of the English in their treatment of the conquered Boers and their concentration camps (a British not Nazi invention) directly leads to the bitterness, fanaticism and pseudo-religious nationalism of the Boers, which indirectly culminates in Apartheid; The ANC leaders prefer the more oppressive Boers to the English, because tyranny and oppression can only lead to national unification and revolution, while the cunning British policy of giving them nominal rights with one hand and exploiting them with the other can only enchant more gullibles. The book was no less beautiful to me because I read just before going to South Africa in 1999. It helped explain many historical, political, even modern aspects in inter-cultural relationships that wouldn't have been apparent to me."},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"As I have always said Wilbur Smith brings me the taste of Africa all the time. I am in Zimbabwe and some these things happened so close to home such that when you read his books it is like you have rewinded history. Mr. Smith's knowledge on mining, banking, firearms, politics, love, hate, the African wildlife and research is too good and accurate to be fiction. I have enjoyed the Power of The Sword such that I almost forgot about my exams. His twist and turns, plots and sub-plots are excellent and I am looking forward to the next book in the set. The Poer of The Sword is very powerful."},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"Wilbur Smith has captivated me with his fantastic prose and his ability to convey the magnificence of the African continent. His depictions of grandeur are only surpassed by his excellent story lines and the strong historical undertones. &quot;Power of the Sword&quot; is especially dear to me because I was only able to locate it after two years of browsing and searching. Additionally, to a boxing afficionado like myself, this book furnishes priceless information on boxing theory. Keep them coming Mr. Smith!"},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"This book was great - I plan to read all five in the series.

It's easily imaginable to place the integrity of forethought into the readings he offers.It will be a very sad day when Wilbur Smith writes, no more. He has an excellent fortitude of reality in past times.Related to the Africikana's personified, life. A Country that roiled under oppression and few hero's prevailed.Wilbur has the gift of moving people, into a realm of conjecture and gives credence to the humanity of the underdog.Riches and poverty abound in all his excellent writings. Moving from riches to poverty in a blink of an eye.The small fact that Wilbur personified, a reality, few could appreciate in todays World, his works dates back some time[was it 1976]! And his 'Thick' and elegant works have entraped me into a World, I have known; on a different continent.Few may be able to relate to the hardships, then there are those that can.Because not all, of this fictional work, is in fact fictional. One can or could, read between the lines.My most favoured author. Life should not be so easy, as it these days. Life for many, is a sweet path of ignorance.Life for those that have battled in life, will most definitely appreciate Wilburs works.Cheers"},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"This has become my favorite family saga of all time and I still have 4 left in the series.....Awesome...."},{"Title":"Power of the Sword","review":"If you are looking for lots of action, Smith is one of the best.

So, I thought good...I am always in the market for the next best thing to a home-cooked meal...I bought the book...Well, Mr. Gray's talent sadly, is not quite at the level he professes himself to be...DISAPPOINTED!My Mass Market Author Friend's can breath a sigh of relief tonight! (Chuckling Here!)I do admire the enthusiasm of Mr. Gray however I suggest he get another book or two under that heavy-weight belt of his before he goes in search of a few more shirttails to cling on too!The book is not without some promise. Mr. Gray's characters were okay enough, but should have been developed a tad more. The dialogue a bit tiresome, but doable and the plot interesting, but fell short of all the glowing reviews!Perhaps his next work will be more to my liking, I can only hope!"},{"Title":"Throne of Tamar","review":"Yes, Mr. Gray is a young, fresh voice in today's writing market.His very human characters personify the best and worst society has to offer. From the first page, I was drawn into the characters and their lives as if it might have been a movie. Although this book presented a futuristic concept, the realities were firmly rooted in present problems our society experiences. Fascinating characters and fast paced dialogue kept me moving towards what I prayed would be a happy ending. I rooted for Czar Alexander II and his loyal wife, Catherine and hoped they would survive the anarchy around them. I loathed, but also sympathized with the magnificently endowed bisexual, King Lucas, because I feared his strongest \\"attribute\\" would be his downfall.And I appreciated the steady strength and wisdom of King Jacob.Heretics, turncoats, star crossed lovers, drug or sex addicted royals were but a few examples of the characters introduced in this book.

Normally, I don't read books that aren't mystery novels or the like, however, this book kept my interest. This was the first time I've read from a fresh, new author; and he didn't disappoint. I found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning. The Throne of Tamar, although fictional, helps you to realize that royal families have the same problems as current everyday families. The story concept is about past royal lineage with a futuristic twist and the characters have the present-day life issues that we all deal with. This was an interesting concept presentation and I think Mr. Gray did a good job handling the issues. I found myself rooting for several characters and having disdain for others; it was like watching a movie where you side with the different characters and hope that all ends well. Mr. Gray threw in several twists that made for exciting results. This is a must-read for anyone who wants the inside scoop on royal families. You'll read about it all, and then some, in this book. Good job, Mr. Gray. I look forward to the sequel, which I know will be just as good. Hail to Czar Alexander III!"},{"Title":"Throne of Tamar","review":"The Throne of Tamar is a cleverly put together &quot;back to the future&quot; type novel written in the style of a movie script. Twenty something author (an awesome author's accomplishment age wise) Tyrone Gray has created a tale about life behind closed doors in a fictional royal family, using names from historical times, as well as more modern times and set in the future.The theme of this novel is best described in Gray's words in the book in a conversation between two characters;&quot;Do you think all the royal families that exist in the world are as dysfunctional as we are?&quot; &quot;In the world's eyes, we're families that can do no wrong. But in reality, we're no different from the average commoner on the street.&quot; &quot;Amen.&quot;And &quot;Amen&quot; to author Tyrone Gray's Throne of Tamar. The characters suffer from most of the known dysfunctions one sees on daytime talk shows and then some. Good job, author, you kept my interest!"},{"Title":"Throne of Tamar","review":"This book will make you look at life differently. People suffering from various problems will find the answers on how to cope with those problems right here. From sexual dysfunction among women to over sexually active men. From drug and alcohol abuse to the physical abuse of men at the hands of women. This book will cause the scales to fall from your eyes and make you see real life exactly as it really is. The author did a wonderful job in expressing the problems and giving the solutions. I do believe this book should be read by everyone. It is a classic!"},{"Title":"Throne of Tamar","review":"I read this book over a series of weeks... I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I didn't think I would at first, because I'm not a true reader; but the subjects herein caught my attention right away and held it masterfully. I was compelled to see how it ended. The author did a wonderful job in character development. I was able to draw close to many of the characters, and see them 'grow' throughout the book. I would recommend this novel for all those who like fast-paced drama and lots of 'meaningful' dialogue in their reading..."},{"Title":"Throne of Tamar","review":"I will be honest with you. I could not get into this book at all. I did not even finish it. It was written for the Harlequin Romance Crowd. The characters were banal. No one actually says, (and I am paraphrasing),&quot;Do you think all Royal families in the world are dysfunctional as we are&quot;? &quot;We are no different than the average commoner on the street&quot;. If I wrote a paper like this when I was in college my professor would have torn it apart. I think the story would have been interesting if not for the stale character development. There were no surprises for this reader. I think the author would be better off going to Hollywood and writing a script for a B movie."},{"Title":"Throne of Tamar","review":"The Throne of Tamar was written by my son. All right, you might say, but I'm not being bias. It is really a good book, and if it wasn't, I wouldn't be here promoting it. I had the pleasure of reading this novel before it ever went to print. The author has capture the real essence of true dialogue. If you're the type of reader who enjoys characters speaking their minds, getting inside of characters heads, watching what makes them tick, this is the book for you. Nothing is left to chance. The author also gives you a host of issues the characters are dealing with. One issue, especially, hit home with me, and I continued reading up until the early dawn hours just to see the outcome of that particular person. The author didn't disappoint! I would highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading. You will definitely have an opinion in the end. The author is a very good storyteller, and I'm honored to be sitting here giving this review. Thanks again."},{"Title":"Galileo, science, and the church,","review":"This is a brief, well balanced account of the conflict between Galileo and the Church. It opens with an insightful look at the world view and astronomy of the late 1500's, including a detailed look at the role of Scripture in these views. This is followed with a thorough description of Galileo's life and how his conflict with the church unfolded. The final chapter is a fascinating overview of the relationships between faith, science and philosophy since Galileo's time. It's not overly difficult reading, though it deals with science, theology and philosophy. The book is a fair account, looking at the strengths and weaknesses of Galileo and some Church officials in how they approached the issues. It also critiques some long held cultural assumptions about the causes, events and meaning of this case (ex: Galileo was never tortured; some lower Church officials who disliked Galileo gave the Pope misleading reports, etc). Definitely worth reading!!"},{"Title":"Galileo, science, and the church,","review":"Langford is even-handed and doesn't withhold criticism of academia and the Catholic Church for its handling of Galileo and his books.What I was taught by public school and the popular press:The Catholic Church persecuted Galileo because he asserted the Earth revolved around the Sun, and was threatened with torture and death. Copernicus delayed publishing his theory for fear of persecution from the Church, finally publishing it on his deathbed in 1543.What Langford convincingly shows from research into primary documents:The Catholic Church was more receptive to the heliocentric theory than the universities. Pope Clement requested a hearing of Copernicus' theory in the Vatican gardens, and was \\"quite favorably impressed\\" with the theory. Copernicus was afraid of persecution from his peers, the universities, not the Catholic Church. His fears were well founded, as Galileo discovered years later. Galileo received the full weight of academic condemnation and ridicule for daring to buck the Ptolemic status quo. When professors realized peer pressure wouldn't silence Galileo, they turned to the Church for help. Fortunately, a good portion of the Church was behind Galileo. The head of one Jesuit college wrote to Galileo to say that his astronomers and mathematicians had confirmed his theory, but wanted more proof. Galileo's efforts were further encouraged by Pope Urban. His first trial resulted in being admonished not to teach it as fact, but was welcome to teach it as theory. Unfortunately, by the time of his second trial in 1633, he had managed to alienate his support, partly by insisting his theory be taught as fact. One of his proofs was tides--he believed they were cause by the Earth sloshing the oceans. He also insisted on circular orbits, and refused to consider Kepler's calculations on elliptical orbits, which would have corrected errors he and others found in his model. He was tried a second time for teaching the theory as fact, not for teaching the theory. He was never tortured or shown a dungeon. His house arrest consisted of a five-room apartment with a servant at his disposal, and was free to roam Rome while awaiting trial. After the trial, he was released. True he was threatened with imprisonment, but at his age, Langford asserts, both he and the court officials knew it would not be carried out; the sentence would have been mitigated.No, this does not excuse the Catholics Church's behavior, but this history should considered with both sides of the argument.In short, Galileo and Copernicus were treated by the academia in much the same way they treat new ideas today. For an explanation of why the geo-centric theory isn't Biblical in principle or origin, read Sampson'sSix Modern Myths."},{"Title":"Galileo, science, and the church,","review":"I'll be honest; I picked up this book used (and heavily highlighted) in a bargain bin. When I realized it was written by a Catholic priest, I wasn't expecting much; however, I learned not to judge a book by its cover - or in this case, it's author.I happened to read it immediately after reading Dava Sobel's \\"Galileo's Daughter\\". Both books are excellent, and there are no real contradictions between them, but each has a rather different emphasis. Whereas Sobel's book covered Galileo's whole career, showcasing his human side, this book focused primarily on those things more or less directly related to his trial. What make this book unique is the author's attempt to shed light on the general mindset of the time which led to Galileo's persecution.It's difficult for us to understand how a man could be imprisoned simply for believing a scientific theory, particularly one we now know to be true. We have a tendency to equate the Catholic Church of the time with fundamentalist Christians today, who believe the Earth is 6000 years old and the only reason there aren't dinosaurs is that they didn't fit on Noah's Ark. But this isn't really fair or accurate. The Galileo affair wasn't really between science and religion (Galileo was a very religious man); it was between rigid dogma and and science that could evolve as observations improved. The battle lines were not drawn at the church door. Indeed, some of Galileo's most passionate defenders where members of the clergy, while some of his most bitter and dogmatic rivals where his Aristotelean academic colleagues. In fact, there were great thinkers in the Church and they were trying to come up with a philosophical system that had an absolute system of morals an ethics, while allowing natural science to progress based on observation. It just happens that in Galileo's case, they drew the line in the wrong place.The author is unequivocal in his condemnation of Galileo's conviction and imprisonment. He argues that it is not only a mistake in light of our current understanding of physics, but that is was a misapplication of canon law at the time. On the other hand, he makes a case that things might have ended differently if Galileo hadn't overplayed his hand. In particular, he argues that the church probably would have been persuaded if Galileo had adopted Kepler's far more correct cosmology over the complex and inaccurate Copernican system; however, Galileo rejected that for his own dogmatic reasons.As a physicist, I can attest that the author's treatment of the science is impeccable, and he even makes a few important points that Sobel missed. I can't personally judge his knowledge of history, but the book is well cited.Of course, a book written by a priest can't be without a few problems for non-believers. Like most Catholic scholars, the author feels obliged to explain the Church doctrine on papal infallibility, and explains at length how the Pope could remain \\"infallible\\" while believing the Earth was the center of the universe. Like most non-Catholics, I find the notion of an infallible human ludicrous, not to mention a bit offensive. However, there isn't much of this sort of thing and it doesn't really detract from what is, all in all, a well written and enlightening book."},{"Title":"Galileo, science, and the church,","review":"\\"Galileo, Science and the Church\\" tells the story of how heliocentric astronomy came to be condemned by the Catholic Church in the early 17th century -- a development that led to the censure of Galileo, the foremost astronomer of the era. The book is nuanced, clearly written, and alive to the complexities of canon law and scriptural interpretation. (The author was a priest.) It quotes extensively from primary documents. I liked it a lot. Readers should know, however, that the focus is on the manuevering leading up to and surrounding the trial of Galileo. The book is not really a history of science and does not explain Galileo's new astronomy in detail.I took off one star to protest the author's intrusive anti-anti-Catholic agenda. Instead of letting the story speak for itself, he's super-eager to spot and rebut caricatures of the Church: Galileo, he stresses, was not tortured or even threatened with torture; the Church had many sophisticated leaders who accepted heliocentirsm; Galileo would not have been harassed if he had only taught heliocentrism as an hypothesis and not an established fact; and so forth. I'm sure the author's right about the facts, but his quickness to put the Church in the best possible light comes off as defensiveness, not historical scrupulosity. (It's sort of like arguing, \\"Most priests are not child molestors.\\" That's true but misses the point.) Even if the cardinals weren't ignoramuses, it was grotesque that they could dictate the practice and teaching of science. Four hundred years have passed but we should still be angry about it."},{"Title":"Galileo, science, and the church,","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is mainly about Galileo's theory of universe and the trial of Galileo which was caused by his conflict with the Catholic Church. This book also talks about Galileo's life briefly. I learned about theories that influenced Galileo's ideas and his opinion toward Copernicus's theory which stated that the all of the planets, including the earth, revolved around the sun."},{"Title":"Kirigami Greeting Cards (Kirigami Craft Books series)","review":"I use the projects in this book for kids' art programs, and they've all been a big hit.

I really don't know why people make such a fuss and call it the \\"pram bible\\", yes there is a lot of information about the history of traditional English baby carriages and the different manufacturers, but I was very disappointed when I read it. I was expecting a book that was more in depth than this is, Jack Hampshire did a great thing in saving many prams from being destroyed and did his research into the pram makes, but some of the information is a bit sketchy unless it is about the well known ones such as Silver Cross, London baby coach, Marmet etc. If you are a serious pram enthusiast then the book may be helpful but I do think it is vastly over priced for the amount of information in it.

THe baby is clothed differently on each side, so at the end of the book, baby is changed into new clothes (messy baby), pajamas (goodnight baby), and swim trunks (playtime baby).

One thing I'll say for Harrod-Eagles is she doesn't muck around before introducing the crimes in her novels and I do like that. The crime is done and you get the rest of the book to sift through the past with the detective.The body might or might not have been suicide and Slider's superiors with the Police are pressuring him to call it suicide - thus saving valuable budget dollars. Slider isn't so keen to do that - there are too many anomalies in the case. The body proves to be that of a known lothario, Richard (Dick) Neal and as usual there are suspects aplenty to be interviewed and eliminated. However a stranger and more sinister pattern starts to show up - what is happening to the members of the Red Watch which manned Shaftesbury Street Fire Station in the 1970's?Meanwhile Slider's marriage is coming apart and his affair with Joanna is deepening. This part I find hard to understand - Joanna's patience with him - Slider's vacillations. It doesn't convince me really. In fact I find Slider's personal life a bit of a jarring distraction to the main story.I do like the way the story unfolds and things that are significant are often revealed early on but are only glaringly obvious in the last few pages. I do think Harrod-Eagles can write a great mystery. This is the second book in the Bill Slider mystery series, by the way - the first is Orchestrated Death."},{"Title":"Death Watch/an Inspector Bill Slider Mystery","review":"Originally published in 1992, this was the second in the Bill Slider series, preceded by Orchestrated Deathand followed by 1995's Necrochip (AKA Death to Go).In this book Slider is struggling personally with his disintegrating marriage even as he investigates the death of a womanizing traveling salesman, Dick Neal, whose body was discovered in a compromising position in a burning motel cabin. Murder or Suicide? His superior's superior would plump for suicide-- much cheaper and makes their crime solution numbers look better. Slider, though, has his doubts about this; and with the assistance of his boss, Dixon, he continues to investigate the dead man.Finally the case is connected with prior cases, two definitely murder. But what is the connection between the men involved?The book contains loads of puns-- Harrod-Eagles has a real talent for slipping them in along with sly literary allusions. The relationship between the various members of the police force is intriguing and fills the space between the detecting nicely.If adultery by the good guys makes you twitch you might want to avoid this one, but otherwise recommended for police procedural fans and those who enjoy a good pun."},{"Title":"Angry Women in Rock: Volume One","review":"Up until my early years in college, I really didn't have a full grasp of the feminism movement. I always had this stereotype of bitter, angry women perpetuated by conservatives in the media who thinks that feminists don't shower and are masculine-looking. I was quickly proven wrong when I bought \\"Angry Women in Rock volume one\\" when I was in my early twenties. This book was truly my first taste in female empowerment and that the word \\"feminist\\" should not be viewed in a negative connotation. Author Andrea Juno explores the term \\"feminism\\" with several artists and bands in the alternative music, when 'alternative' truly meant for something and not the bland, dull BS that is polluting the airwaves nowadays. I found this book to be both informative and entertaining. My personal favorite interviews are with Valerie Agnew of the Seattle band 7 Year B***h (one of my favorite bands during the 'grunge' era) and Kathleen Hanna (ex-Bikini Kill vocalist, now Le Tigre vocalist). It was interesting to read about Kathleen Hanna's career choices which included working in the sex industry and her experiences with more conservative 'feminists' like Andrea Dworkin. Another interesting conversation Andrea has is with the San Francisco punk band Tribe 8. In Tribe 8's case, they discussed mostly about lesbian-related issues but the band as a whole. I was totally blown away by the description of their stage performances which involves a strap on, a knife, and occasionally a chainsaw. That was fascinating reading to say the very least. My personal favorite interview is with Valerie Agnew, the drummer from 7 Year B***h. She discusses her friend Mia Zapata's death (RIP Mia), music, and women's sexuality. There are also some really good interviews with artists that I had never heard of before like lesbian folksinger Phranc who occasionally dresses up in drag, Jarboe of Swans, Lois, and Naomi Yang of Galaxie 500. As for mainstream artists, Andrea talks to Chrissie Hyndes of The Pretenders and Joan Jett. Lastly Andrea also talks to a couple of women who run a couple of small, independent record labels Bettina Richards of Thrill Jockey Records and Candice of K Records. I really enjoyed reading \\"Angry Women in Rock volume one\\". Not only did it influence me musically (at the time) but also on a deeper level, mainly on women's issues.

Jarboe, a vocalist, musician, and &quot;artist&quot; really went for disclosure during her time with the interviewer. I fell over with admiration for her and her determination, that is well covered in, and exclusive to that lengthy chapter on her. She talks about her experiences of when she was younger, her time with Swans as an essential player - a WOMAN - in the Swans' saga, her relationship, and her work as a solo recording artist in equal parts. The outlandishness, isolation and pain of her experiences - in life and in work - are balanced here for the reader with the sensitivity and strenght of Jarboe's attitude (not to mention the one of the woman who interviews her). The heart of my old co-worker, a Swans fan, was won over as soon as she read this chapter on Jarboe; up to that point this person was mostly interested in Michael Gira regarding Swans.The other musicians of my taste that are covered in this volume are given decent profiles with fairly interesting articles. I found the articles on Phranc, Kendra Smith and one or two others, quite welcome because I hadn't known those artists at all. Unfortunately, I kept getting distracted by the book's sterile format and unfocused perameters of artistry. Or shall I be fair, and just say this is literally an assortment of artists (of varying scope and breadth) strung together between two covers with really only one thing in common: they are women. Alas, this important factor cannot be diminished.I used to have this book. It was lost or stolen. To its credit, I've chosen to acquire it over again."},{"Title":"Angry Women in Rock: Volume One","review":"This 1996 publication remains a classic. Don't be put off by Andrea Juno's introduction where her sometimes valid concerns alternate with obscurantist ramblings. Yes, she talks about e.g. \\"alternative discourses and economies\\" but she's not quite a moonbat and proves herself a deft & intelligent interviewer. There's a Women in Rock map of Canada & the USA with the names of female musicians geographically arranged; I was pleased to seeMarianne Faithfulllocated just off the coast of South Carolina, representing the UK with 3 other artists. A discography & list of equipment used by the musician/s appear on the final page of every musician interview.My favorite artist,Jarboe(exSwans) is the first interviewee; congrats to both Juno & Jarboe for a constantly engaging discussion & absolute honesty on topics that encompass everything from popular music, the music business, childhood, family & growing up, other prominent artists, the media, relationships, culture & much else besides. Lots of original & some controversial photographs & a few album covers adorn this interview. I found info here that is not available anywhere else.Some of the artists are beyond what you might call \\"obscure,\\" like Tribe 8, Valerie Agnew, Lois Maffeo & Naomi Yang. In between, I would say, come Kathleen Hanna, Kendra Smith &Phranc, whilst June Millington (Fanny),Joan Jett& Chrissie Hynde (Pretenders) were celebrities in their day. I was particularly impressed by the last; not only do I share most ofChrissie'sopinions but she expresses them with an appealing eloquence. Two of the interviews are with the record label owners Candice Pedersen & Bettina Richards.It came as a pleasant surprise that none of these lovely women are irrational or particularly furious, or if they are angry, they express their concerns in an intelligible & articulate way. (Sigh ... this was the 1990s, just before the arrival of the ranting Moonbat). And I love the beautifully illustrated front & back cover and rare pictorial material found throughout the book; the format & presentation are quite special. Serious rock fans, sane feminists (likeCamille Paglia), fans of the interviewees and devotees ofRe/SearchPublications will love it.

Highly accessible, requiring some algebra, but not much more, the book introduces the deceptively simple mathematical subject of game theory. First of all, it indicates what is =meant= by a game -- something more akin to rock, paper, scissors, than monopoly or chess. Game theory (in a way like chaos theory) is seriously mis-named; the games played tend to be ones that are simple models of economic choice or political strategizing. This is why research in game theory has led to the Nobel Prize in Economics for more than one person.In any case, I used this book as a resource in a discrete math class for teenaged students who were extremely interested in math. It was intended for non-math majors in college, but I think it would work very well as enrichment in the high school classroom (or even middle school -- one can use it in developing an application for algebra). After learning the rudiments of game theory, I thought to apply the concept to =The Weakest Link=, and found that, as a game, it is far more complicated than what you'll find in this book.Still, this is just a starting point. There are plenty of avenues to explore beyond what is covered in here, but one can get bogged down with all the different types of situations that have been treated in game theory."},{"Title":"Introduction to Windows '98 Programming","review":"Introduction to Windows 98 programming is a good book for beginners.

Approaching the issue of loving Christ from a number of different perspectives--who Christ is, what He has done, etc.--Vincent's clear explanation of why and how Christians should love Christ engages your mind and moves your heart with incredible power. Neither exceedingly erudite nor sappy in the least, this book hits the question of loving Christ at its core. It reveals the height and depth and breadth of true Christian love in a way that cuts to the heart and cannot be ignored. If this is an issue with which you have struggled, either theologically or practically, do not pass this book by!"},{"Title":"The True Christian's Love to the Unseen Christ (Puritan Writings)","review":"The author states his purpose for writing this treatise in the books subtitle: A Discourse,Chiefly Tending To Excite And Promote The Decaying Love Of Christ In The Heart Of Christians. Love to Christ is as important to spiritual life, as the beating of the heart which pumps blood through the arteries that supplies oxygen to the cells, is to physical life, without it life will not continue. The importance of loving Christ cannot be overstated. Where there is much love for the Lord Jesus Christ there will be great zeal to promote His truth,His Kingdom and His glory. John Macarthur informs us in the forward of the book that the highest duty of the Christian is to love the Lord Jesus. A good portion of the book exhorts the reader as to why Christ ought to be loved. We have an example of this on p.35 the person of Christ should draw forth the believers love due to: &quot;1)His greatness and authority;2)His holiness and purity;3)His wisdom and omniscience;4)His truth and fidelity;5)His fullness and all suffiency;6)His kindness and mercy.&quot; The author encourages the believer to make diligent use of the means God has provided to increase their love for their Lord. Some of those means being: hearing the Word preached, reading and studying the Scriptures, praying for increased love for Him, living by faith, cultivating a sense of His love for you, growing in your hatred of and striving against sin, associating closest with those who most love Christ, exercising the love that you do have that it may grow.Reading and meditating upon the truths set forth in this book will help any Christian to gage their spiritual health or lack thereof."},{"Title":"The True Christian's Love to the Unseen Christ (Puritan Writings)","review":"The True Christian's Love to the Unseen Christ was not written by someone with marketing skills foremost in his mind.

Pity, I'd have loved to have this book in an e-version - guess I'll have to look elsewhere. And it's a pity this company couldn't be bothered to have a real copy-editor go through before releasing the book."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Alongside Agatha Christie and P.D. James, Dorothy L. Sayers is one of the top female mystery writers of the twentieth century. Her singular creation of Lord Peter Wimsey assures that her novels will be full of uncanny wit and sparkling intelligence. \\"The Nine Tailors\\" is a spellbinding mystery with an overabundance of suspects but very little evidence. While some readers may be able to solve the heart of matter, that does not distract from the sheer novelty of this puzzle, steeped in the history and mystery of bell ringing.On a snowy New Year's Eve, Lord Peter Wimsey accidentally runs his car into a ditch outside of the small town of Fenchurch St. Paul. The local rector rescues Wimsey and invites him to stay, soon pressing him to fill in as a substitute for an ill bell ringer. Wimsey gladly takes over the role and has a pleasant albeit strange holiday in the countryside of East Anglia. As he is leaving town, he encounters a tramp looking for work, and thinks nothing further about it. But when a body is discovered buried atop a recently dug grave, the rector calls on Lord Peter again, this time for his detective help.The body found on top of the coffin is greatly disfigured and has had its hands removed, but Wimsey is certain it is the man he met on the road the day out of town. But who is he and how did he get there? Most importantly, who killed him? In searching for this answer, Wimsey and the local inspector are sent following clues to France and retracing the sordid history of some of the town's previous unsavory inhabitants. The identity of the body may prove easier to figure out than the method of his murder.\\"The Nine Tailors\\", the title a reference to the bells that are rung when a man dies, is a unique thought-provoking mystery. Dorothy L. Sayers brings her story full circle and no small piece of information or clue gleaned along the way is left out. For those unfamiliar with bell-ringing, some of the descriptions and dialogue regarding this topic may seem tedious, but are not ones that should be overlooked in order to see the whole picture. \\"The Nine Tailors\\" is an enjoyable, puzzling whodunit sure to please mystery fans everywhere."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey, sleuth extrordinaire, assists the Police Superintendent of Fenchurch St. Paul to identify the body of a man buried in the recently deceased Lady Thorpe's grave. The grave was meant to be shared by Lady Thorpe's husband, who recently died during an influenza epidemic. Wimsey and the Superintendent also endeavor to find out who so sadistically defaced the grave's temporary occupant and why, and hope to uncover secrets related to the theft of a valuable emerald necklace and its connection, if any, to the unidentified body. On the way to the resolution of these misdeeds, I endured an endlessly tedious analysis of the crimes and possible perpetrators' motives. The introduction of a cryptogram allegedly sent by the unidentified victim is an over-elaborate plot device that I found more than a bit trite.What gives this book a big boost, though, is Ms. Sayers' scintillating presentation of synchronized ringing of the Fenchurch St. Paul's bells by rope. Ms. Sayers creates imagery of sheer beauty and magnificence. I almost felt as if I were there experiencing such overwhelming loveliness. The names of two of the bells, Batty Thomas and Tailor Paul are colorful and also figure strongly in the plot. The actions of the heroic Mr. Venables, the church Rector, who assists the towns people and helps to pull them together during a horrific flood is very memorable. I also enjoyed reading various quotations from the Psalms and other parts of the Bible that were peppered throughout the book and gave it the poignance that it might not otherwise have had."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This is certainly one of Sayers' best novels. The plot is detailed and realistic and the characters equally so. Lord Peter is at his most charming and observant.The book centers around a church and it's bell ringers. The chapters begin with quotes about bell ringing, which give it a wonderful flavor.If you only read one Lord Peter novel, make it this one!"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"To the geeks among her readership, this is one of Sayers's most thoroughly fascinating novels featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Peter and Bunter are driving through the Norfolk fens late one blizzardy New Year's Eve when the car goes into a ditch and they have to hike through the blowing snow to the nearest village of Fenchurch St. Paul. They're taken in by the elderly rector and his wife, who assure them the car can be rescued in the morning -- but just now, the rector is planning a big event in the huge 11th century parish church across the road. Mr. Venables is an avid bell-ringer with a crack team of rope-pullers from the village under him and they're about to attempt a full peal of Kent Treble Bob Major -- 15,840 rings, taking more than nine hours. \\"Ringing the changes\\" means following mathematical progression, not playing tunes. It's a peculiarly English avocation and has been for a long time; Batty Thomas, the oldest bell of the eight in the belfry of St. Paul's, was cast in 1368 and the local records of progressive ringing go back more than two hundred years. It's also an arcane subject with its own jargon: \\"\`Make it a 704,' said the Rector. \`Call her in the middle with a double, before, wrong, and home, and repeat.'\\" And Sayers doesn't bother to explain any of this, which keeps it all mysterious and rather bewildering. (One could wishe she had included an explanatory appendix.) Anyway, one of the ringers is suddenly taken by influenza and Wimsey, an old bell-ringer himself, naturally, is dragooned into substituting -- which he carries off successfully, to everyone's grateful delight. And then the car is fixed and Wimsey and Bunter proceed on their way. Meanwhile, the local squire dies and preparations are made to bury him in the same grave with his wife, who had passed away only a few months before. But in opening the grave, another body is discovered just below the surface, an unknown intruder with a battered face and lacking its hands (and its fingerprints). The local cops are having no luck with the case so the rector writes a hopeful note to Wimsey in London: Might he have some suggestions as to how to proceed? Hah! A mystery, and under highly unusual circumstances! Peter's down there like a shot! And then things begin to get complicated. There was this theft of a very valuable emerald necklace back in 1914, and various people died or went to prison, but the emeralds were never recovered. And as Lord Peter's investigation widens, it becomes clear that the two cases are intertwined. The suspects pile up but they all seem to have alibis -- and besides, Wimsey discovers that the people he personally likes appear to be the best suspects, which doesn't make him happy. It's a complex plot, with some notable characters among both the cops and the fen people, as well as the absent-minded rector himself. And the water-logged fens are a major player, too. This is widely considered one of Sayers's very best efforts and I have to say I agree."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Probably Dorothy Sayers' best novel, considered by many to be one of the top 2-3 mystery works of all time. Beautiful writing--literature vs. simply a plot vehicle. The characters of Lord Peter Wimsey and Bunter really come alive, and you fall in love with them.Wonderful depiction of English country life, too. The solution of the mystery is original, unexpected, and completely satisfying. The final section of the book is very moving. This book is a pleasure on all levels. Those who enjoy it but have not yet read other Wimsey books may want to try Strong Poison next, as it tells the story of Lord Peter's love for Harriet Vane. That story arch eventually leads to my favorite Dorothy Sayers book, Busman's Honeymoon.No gory CSI stuff here-- just beautiful writing, thoughtful plotting, an intriguing mystery, and beloved characters whose adventures continue in other great books."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"When you read Nine Tailors you will realise why McGallen Awarded her a special award for this book voting it as the best mystery of all time more than 50 years after its first release.

Totally wonderful and beautifully intricate! I love reading this book over and over again."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This, the ninth of Sayers's eleven full length Wimsey novels, is the one that lifts her above the category of twentieth-century female detective novelist, and places her among the literary greats.It is a thoroughly satisfying mystery - sophisticated, complex, intellectually challenging. Everything in the plot is there for a reason; and the final explanation is ingenious and unexpected.It is Sayers, so there is more than just a plot. The characters have a depth and realism far beyond the caricatures of Agatha Christie. They have individuality and weaknesses and baggage and unexpected strength in the face of adversity. They are, in short, people.Wimsey himself appears more relaxed in this than in most of the other books. A far cry from the self-conscious man-about-town of Whose Body? or the nervy war veteran of The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, this is the Wimsey hinted at in Five Red Herrings: the born and bred countryman, at ease with himself, almost classless at times, an incomer who at once instinctively understands and is accepted by this tiny community.The community itself is minutely and deftly drawn too - partly through its supporting characters, partly through Sayers's own narrative voice, stronger and more distinctive in this book than in the others, and often taking on the cadence and the overtones of a local character to remarkable effect.And then there are the most powerful and enduring characters of all: the bells of Fenchurch St Paul and the place itself. \`The Nine Tailors' is to the Fens what \`The Return of the Native' is to the heathlands of Dorset. It is a work of art, a tone-poem, a sonorous evocation of place and time, a symphony of words and images that endure in the mind long after the last page is turned. (For more on the power of language in \`The Nine Tailors', I refer you to my recent essay on The Art of Reading at [...])Much attention is given in literary circles to the \`great American novel'; little, if any, is given to the novel that depicts England. Yet \`The Nine Tailors', for all that it is set in an obscure and bleak corner of the countryside, is as intimate and accurate a portrait of inter-war Englishness as anything ever written - and an enduring one at that.~~~One must then turn, with the utmost reluctance and distaste, to the current sub-standard UK paperback edition of this masterpiece (978-0-450-00100-0). It appears to have been typeset and proof-read by persons with little knowledge of, and less interest in, either the English language or the basic rules of punctuation. It is further encumbered with an arch and self-congratulatory introduction by Elizabeth George, which adds little to one's appreciation of the work, and which - to add insult to injury - is inserted between Sayers's own foreword and the first chapter, thus breaking the rhythm of the author's original text. (No doubt the same vandalism has been committed in the latest impression of Gaudy Night, where any interruption between the Foreword and Chapter 1 would be even more obtrusive. Fortunately I still have my 1988 paperback of that work.)A minor point, but a further niggle in light of these graver shortcomings, is the faintly 1970s typography employed for the section headings.In summary, this edition gives the unfortunate impression of having been brought to press by an editor who neither recognised nor valued the calibre and significance of the book. I have now placed my 2011 paperback in the recycling bin and ordered a second-hand hardback. On the grounds of the punctuation errors alone, I would urge anyone who wishes to read what Miss Sayers actually wrote, to eschew the current paperback edition in favour of any other second-hand copy available."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This is my favorite Dorothy Sayers novel.

The recordings exist; just reach out to the Beeb and get 'er done."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Oh, golly, which do I love more? Dorothy Sayers' \\"The Nine Taylors\\" or her book \\"Murder Must Advertise\\"?I am a huge Sayers fan. Her first book, \\"Whose Body?\\" was excellent but a bit unpolished and lacking confidence. But the ones that followed that were polished, confident, intelligent, and her writing elevates her above the realm of \\"mere\\" mystery writer. She stands head and shoulders above Christie.Murder Must Advertise is light and flippant, sassy, and so entertaining to read. Think of it as a light meringue cookie by an expert pastry chef.But the Nine Taylors is the meaty and rich main course. It just a beautifully fleshed out book. Atmospheric, descriptive, characters she's just breathed life into, it's just a lovely read, and I have done so at least ten times. It really gives you a feeling of Norfolk and the people, and the intense detail about the ringing of the bells and the draining of the fens is just fascinating. Don't read it for the mystery, read it just for the for the sheer joy of the excellent prose.Whether you are a mystery fan, or just love good books, do reward yourself and take the time to read this one. I rank Sayers up amongst my top authors, including Tolkien, Forster, Gill and a handful of others. It makes me really sad to see her relegated to the mystery shelf for those that can find her at all. She should be on everyone's list of English classics. I wish she'd continued writing novels, but oh well, if wishes were fishes, I'd have an ocean."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This is my favorite Lord Peter Wimsey story of the total of 11.

As an American reader I love Dorothy Sayers description of place and her books never fail to transport me to new and memorable locales. Lord Peter is entertaining, as ever, and the details of the bells and the art of ringing was fascinating. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This was a Lord Peter mystery and the plot was well thought out like all Dorothy Sayers. It was definitely one of the slower Lord Peter novels, and I would not recommend this for a first Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter read.If you are already a fan of the Lord Peter mysteries you will like this. It's a Sunday afternoon with a cup of tea read.Although there was a little more information about church bells than I really wanted to know."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"That was my first encounter with amateur detective Peter Wimsey and it happened more by accident than on purpose. I bought the book just because I wanted to read some crime novel but without any ideas which one.The story is set between the two wars but there is nothing old fashioned about the writing style. I liked the descriptions of people and villages - they were both charming and full of life. Lord Peter quickly became a favorite and I agree with the note son the author's biography that there is something reminding of Bertie Wooster in him. If I didn't give it 5 stars it was only because at times the bell ringing slang felt a bit too much!"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Nobody knows who the body was, why he was there, or how he died. All the clues are dug out one at a time to find the coherent whole. Wimsey at his best, The art of bell ringing is briefly described, and forms a small part of the plot."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I don't usually read &quot;mysteries&quot; but I happened upon this one and the fact that it is in the attractively-sized Trade format (and printed on nice &quot;real&quot; paper) compelled me to buy it (whereas all other of Ms. Sayers' Wimsey books are in the tiny Mass Market format with its unbearable &quot;newsprint&quot; paper). Now, having read it, I consider the purchase a big mistake. This is why:For a mystery to work, the events that occur must be plausible. Even if irrational behavior abounds, the author must nevertheless give me a reason to believe in that behavior (by convincing me, for example, that the person in question has a bipolar disorder, or that ghosts really do exist, etc.). In this novel, most of the behaviors go beyond being merely implausible: they are ridiculous. For example, the crime that sets off the main mystery is a jewelry theft. (I am giving nothing away here, as this is not the &quot;mystery&quot; part of the mystery: in fact all of this is spelled out lucidly near the novel's beginning.) Anyway, everything about this theft is ridiculous, implausible, impossible to believe, even outrageous, from the behavior of the victim, to that of her servant, to that of her servant's friend, to everything about the two thieves, etc., etc. Even this trifle: that a certain &quot;uncle&quot; should place a stranger, essentially, as butler of his brother's home, is ridiculous, as is the uncle's subsequent defense of the stranger when he is accused of the theft.Again without giving away the &quot;mystery&quot; let me ask this: Is it plausible, is it believable, that the man who we have good reason to believe stole the jewels and stashed them away never to be found by their owner or the police, but who nevertheless was found guilty of the crime and sentenced to 8 years, would, after serving 4 years, murder a warden and escape from prison? The jewels, mind you, would in today's terms be worth hundreds of thousands of US dollars. Wouldn't the thief simply wait 4 more years to be released a free (and rich) man instead of one whom, if caught, would be hanged for murder? We would like to say that perhaps he is very irrational or very stupid. But we have already learned that he is neither: He is (or had been, before the theft) a consistent, reliable, hard worker; he's very intelligent, and very well read. There's no excuse for the outrageousness of his behavior!And if most of the events in the book are implausible, the &quot;mystery&quot; itself is totally laughable. When facts come forth which reveal that the victim was in a certain place during a certain period of time, you'll immediately suspect a certain cause for the crime, because Ms. Sayers has set you up to do so aptly. But because hundreds of pages still remain to be read, you will doubt yourself, thinking that this cause is too obvious, that it must be something else. Were that true, the mystery would be highly effective. But credibility begins to get lost as soon as we see that the idea of this cause somehow (outrageously) eludes the (supposedly) brilliant Lord Peter Wimsey. This discover (that the victim was in a certain place during a certain period of time) was elucidated by Wimsey himself during an interrogation! It is this very elucidation that inspires the reader to suspect the cause! Why isn't the brilliant famous detective himself inspired to at the very least momentarily consider this obvious possibility!? But hundreds of pages later, near the very end of the book, this matter remains the one and only of the many complex goings-on about which Wimsey still hasn't a clue (ha)! Only when Wimsey himself nearly suffers the very same fate does this possibility dawn on him! Ridiculous!!!It seems that many of this novel's supporters are impressed by the explanation of &quot;change-ringing&quot; but don't expect that explanation to be lucid: page after page after page deals with the subject, all without ever making clear exactly what it is or how it's done. Ms. Sayers' tedious and ever-present content on &quot;change-ringing&quot; serves only to further obfuscate an already obscure art. One comes away only with just this: that it involves eight church bells which must be rung by eight people who do so using ropes, and that it is probably not very easy to do.Likewise, descriptions of the fen system of waterways, drainage-routes, and rivers are equally tedious and every-present, and equally worthless in imparting knowledge. Ms. Sayers has us suffer through a great deal of cloudy content, all for the relatively lame sake of justifying a little flood. (The effect this flood has on one crucial character--the way that it 'proves' something about his nature--is, of course, totally ridiculous, as we've by now come to expect.)One wonders if there's anything of redeeming value here. Certainly not enough to justify its existence! Nevertheless:Ms. Sayers creates a nice sense of awe regarding the church that is the story's main setting. In fact, I found myself wishing for more of these awe-inspiring moments.While (like many of the secondary characters) the character of Lord Peter Wimsey is inexcusably shoddy--not especially brilliant, witty, or charming is he here!--Ms. Sayers paints a memorable portrait of the scatterbrained but well meaning local Rector.Ms. Sayers is deft at capturing a variety of the many diverse English accents, manners, and idioms.And finally, I loved the casual way that beer is consumed throughout: for strength during a gruelling bell-ringing session, for warmth before one travels off in the cold, to make one well when one is sick, to give one stamina for a drive down icy, ill-marked roads, as sustenance when one is being held captive, etc. A wonderful, (now-)scandalous attitude!But if this is &quot;a classic of the genre&quot; then the genre's in a sad state."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Boring, boring, boring.

This book is a joy to read and is one of Dorothy Sayers finest books. This book is a mus"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The Nine Tailors is a well-written story; unfortunately the crafting of the mystery has not held up over the years. Many of Sayers' plot devices have become routine, if not clich&eacute;d, so it's little wonder modern readers leap to conclusions ahead of Lord Peter Wimsey.The plot revolves around a rural community in England and certain misdeeds past and present. Central to the community is its church, and it is here that Lord Peter spends most of his time, either in the Rectory, the cemetery, or the church building itself.The story is told through the metaphor of &quot;change ringing.&quot; If you know nothing of this English tradition it is possible to soldier through - the text does provide some clues - but it's rough going. A website with some particularly helpful information is www.nagcr.org/pamphlet.html. An online Java application that enables you to ring your own bells is www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/kvdoel/bells/bells.html. Googling for &quot;change ringing&quot; will provide additional examples, but these two cover many of the points Sayers includes in the novel.While the mystery is not the most challenging (outside of a cryptogram, which is almost as unsolvable as the code in Have His Carcase), this is still an extremely good novel. Sayers' small church characters are written spot on, and her inclusion of church and governmental politics feels authentic. Other Lord Peter novels have held up better over time; that this one hasn't serves as a testimony to the effect Dorothy Sayers has had on the mystery writers that came after her. I enjoyed this book and heartily recommend it with the minor caveats listed above."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"the very few 1-star reviews!

Craft...art...design...no simple mystery story, this. The most telling proof of the artistic framework of this book is the manner in which the sleuth himself is enmeshed in the plot...but I can't give that away now, can I? So you'll just have to read it and appreciate it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"For those interested in the intricacies of church bell ringing, look no further. This novel drones on and on about the clangers in a manner that displays Sayles' need to show off her extreme research. Cut out these 50 or so pages, and you might have a rather fine read indeed. Wimsey and his servant Bunter are endearing characters, and there are several other fine creations, including a lively parrot. Yet the mystery itself seems at times to be a wedged-in afterthought. And then there's the Superintendent's line: \\"She's got a stack of money and the meanness of fifty thousand Scotch Jews rolled into one.\\" This is pure anti-Semitism and it isn't that favorable to the inhabitants of Scotland either. Truly this is one of the more overrated books I have ever read. As for Sinclair Lewis stating that this mystery might be better than Dickens' Bleak House, it makes you shudder. Either Lewis was in bed with Sayles, they were pals, she had reviewed one of his books favorably, or the man had gone crackers. I'm sticking with Dickens and Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957) earned a lasting respect for her translations, poetry and Christian writing, but it was her detective novels featuring Lord Peter Wimsey that won her the lasting affection of so many readers. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, Agatha Christie and Margery Allingham are known as the \\"Queens of Crime\\" for their domination of crime writing in the 1920s and '30s.The Nine Tailorswas published in 1934 and opens on New Year's Eve. Lord Peter Wimsey runs his car into a ditch in the village of Fenchurch St. Paul, in England's low-lying East Anglia fen country. Rescued and given shelter for the night by the rector, Wimsey is astonished to find that the church is a magnificent old edifice on Norman foundations with a \\"full ring\\" of eight bells in the tower. To the detriment of his sleeping prospects, the ringers are planning a nine-hour ring starting at midnight. Readers who know Wimsey will not be surprised that when one of the ringers falls to the influenza, our sleuth is able to step in and take the rope.Critics of this book cite the extremely detailed descriptions of change-ringing, or campanology, the very English, very mathematical progressive ringing of large cast bells. You may love it or you may hate it, but the bell ringing is integral to this picture-perfect novel of English country life; it would be a mistake to disregard the role of the bells. The eight bells in the tower at Fenchurch St. Paul have names and voices, personalities even. The tenor bell known as Tailor Paul is typically rung nine times to announce a death in the village; the traditional Nine Tailors of the title.Some months later there is a death in the village and when the grave is opened for the burial, it's already occupied. Lord Peter is back on the scene to investigate. The mysteries of the body in the grave and a stolen emerald necklace have their origins in the past and therefore lack some urgency, but the book progresses to a startling and appropriate ending.The moody countryside and expertly drawn characters lift this book above its genre.The Nine Tailorsis a literate period novel that captures English rural life between the wars. Of the eleven Wimsey novels it's the most readable as a stand-alone, and it showcases the characterization and style that are the best part of this series. This is a good book to start with if you want to acquaint yourself with the Wimsey stories; as long as you don't hate the change-ringing.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I haven't read a mystery novel in ages and this one got me aching for more. Sayers' main character, Lord Peter Wimsey is embraceable because he exhibits a wide range of emotions. The other main characters in this tale - Pastor Venables, Superintendent Blundell - are charming, this charm brought forth by the former's humurous chatter and the latter's sense of self-importance deflated by faulty reasoning. It is a cliche, but the story, which takes place in an English farm town between the two world wars, definitely keeps you guessing until the end, when the mystery is masterfully resolved and all the loose ends tied up.To be honest, I had a rough go at reading some of the bell pealing instructions, which are peppered throughout the novel, although it opened my mind to a musical genre of whose technical difficulties I was unaware."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This was my first but not my last Lord Wimsey novel.

Sayers would have deserved five stars, if Ian Carmichael's performance as the 20s aristocratic sleuth in the TV mini-series,Lord Peter Wimsey - The Nine Tailors, has not been so spectacular, and the story seems more effective when it was told in a chronological order in the film. Those who are interested in more recent aristocratic sleuths may want to check outSir Philip Wild and the Emerald Necklace, an intriguing mystery novel with similar storyline and an attractive baronet as a private detective."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"While I'm a fiend for Lord Peter Wimsey and other Dorothy L. Sayers' fiction, The Nine Tailors is much more than another whodunnit mystery for me.Let's face it, most whodunnits are not very well written, although quite entertaining for a quick read.Characters take precedence over the plot or the place in many of the Lord Peter Wimsey series. Not here. The sense of place, the Fen country, the history of bell ringing, the plot, the characters other than the regulars...just the overall atmosphere of this book contribute to such a wonderful work.Even non-Peter fans and non-whodunnit fans should read \\"The Nine Tailors.\\" As another review wrote, \\"Sayers is in the zone\\" with this book."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I always love Dorothy Sayers, and this mystery is as good as usual. It is, however, bleaker--more like &quot;Busman's Honeymoon&quot; in leaving one feeling both gratified that the mystery has been solved and at the same time unsettled and pained by its effect on a wide range of characters. The change of scene from London to the Fen country is interesting, and Mr. and Mrs. Venables are quirkily endearing characters. As usual, Sayers is very technical and precise about her plot, and I confess to total confusion with regards to the bell-ringing details. But it's nice to know she went to so much trouble to make it accurate! I recommend this book to any mystery-lover (but then, what Sayers would I NOT recommend?)."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"As an English church bell ringer I was intrigued to find a mystery which revolved around my hobby. I was also apprehensive that the book would prove to be only a shallow misinterpreted representation of a very complex subject.What I found was an absorbing novel which captures not only the aesthetics but also the politics, mathematics and passions involved. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and know of numerous others, who are passionate about English style ringing methods and principles, who have also found it a most enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This gentlemanly detective story is set in the bleak Fenlands of Eastern England - low-lying, flat, windswept, cold and vulnerable to flooding. Moreover it's set in the dispiriting era of the 1930s , with the countryside suffering from the great Depression. There's a lot of poverty and ill-health.Into this setting steps the debonair Lord Peter Wimsey - stranded in the village of Fenchurch St Paul after a road accident. He makes the acquaintance of the Reverend Venables, the local parish priest and a source of generosity and encouragement for his flock. Venables is proud of his beautiful church and the tradition of bell-ringing there. Some of the bell-ringing is joyous. but the \\"Nine Tailors\\" is nine tolls of the bell to signify a man's death...The \\"mystery\\" aspect of the novel is slow to develop. But eventually a body is discovered and Lord Peter Wimsey assists the police in the solving of the crime.When I'm reading whodunits I seldom manage to solve them myself - however this time about one-third of the way into the book I confidently deduced who the culprit was. But I was completely wrong!The atmosphere of the Fens seeps into the pages like a cold fog creeping in under a door. The bell-ringing is also an important aspect of the book and indeed some of the bells - Batty Thomas, Gaude, Tailor Paul, Dimity are almost characters in their own right.As for the other characters, Bunter is present but fairly quiet, and there is no Harriet Vane - but she is compensated for by the 15-year-old Hilary, surely an alter ego of Dorothy L Sayers herself.The setting is well-realised, and the mystery parts of the book are satisfactory. However there is a little bit too much incidental detail about bell-ringing (are we really meant to read the first page of each section of the book?) and Fenland drainage.If you a a fan of good whodunits by all means please read and enjoy this book - but this isn't my first choice of the Lord Peter Wimsey stories."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I waited forever for the Nine Tailors to come to kindle and I am not disappointed. If any reader feels put off by the references to campanology (the science of change ringing) the mystery can be fully enjoyed without knowing or learning anything about it; on the other hand, I enjoy books that challenge the reader to dig into learning something new, or old.

Sayers is not a writer who leaves enough hints for the reader to guess ahead, but she always connects ALLdots, and sews up the very clever plots to our complete satisfaction. This audio rendition excised one of the most important discoveries which at least brought hope and happiness and thus some redeeming comfort to the daughter of the Duke at whose homea lady guest's valuable necklace was stolen many years back, he being impoverished by the honorable commitment to pay back it'svalue, thus leaving the daughter unable to pay for schooling, and essentially without future.

Maybe someone heard something I didn't."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This is Dorothy Sayers best. The setting, the plot (good luck solving this one) and the characters. A great wintertime read."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I love the Lord Peter Mysteries, and to me this is one of the finest. I've read it several times over the years and have always found it entertaining, scary, and moving.Dorothy Sayers was an incredible writer, and The Nine Tailors is one of her great triumphs, offering readers a poignant mystery scenario when Lord Peter is stranded in a small parish on a winter's night, and somehow finds himself joining in with a bout of change-ringing. Sayers' knowledge of this ancient art goes beyond the musical and into the mathematical, yet it is never dull, and the writing is so good you can almost hear the different bells of Fenchurch St. Paul ringing across the mournful countryside.As always, the genius of Sayers lies in the rich characters, led by the always-fascinating Lord Peter, who is at his best here -- approachable, kind, human and interested in all those around him. The faithful Bunter adds a dash of humor and steadfast loyalty, as do the townspeople they meet, from the gentle rector and his wife, to a likeable thief, to the young teenaged girl who becomes Lord Peter's surprising partner in sleuthing.Meanwhile: While I've read other reviews here calling Lord Peter 'stuffy' or arrogant, I just can't agree. Is Lord Peter the very picture of the British Lord? Of course, in some ways. But the character's genius is that he may look like one thing yet be quite another. Lord Peter has the ability not only to appear either charming or foolish as needed, but even more importantly, he's a genius able to be at home -- and to make others at home -- wherever he goes, from a small parish church, to a 1930s ad agency, whether in a gathering of reformed street criminals -- or a dissolute socialite's drug den.\\"The Nine Tailors\\" is a superb book, and an excellent introduction to Lord Peter (although I do hope if you like this, you'll go back and start it all properly with \\"Whose Body?\\" and continue along in order from there)! It's a book that goes beyond satisfying as a mystery, to satisfying the soul as an excellent novel. You may think of the rolling bells more than once after reading it, and the haunting line that \\"Nine Tailors make a man.\\" I found it unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Sayers has much to offer the British mystery aficionado. Indeed, readers of that genre must inevitably read Both Sayers and Christie for their engaging characters and well constructed mystery plots.

It may not be the best example of Lord Wimsey, but it's not bad."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The Nine Tailors is on most lists of the Ten Best Mystery Stories. There are many reasons for this. The plot is superb and the general atmosphere of the English Fen Country in the 1930's is exceptionally well done as is its abysmal weather, (I am old enough to remember some of this). Wimsey and Bunter are characterized well, as usual, but the more or less minor characters such as the vicar are exceptionally well done. As I said, one of the very, very best."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I had seen this mystery some years ago and my memory of the bell ringing was very slim. I thought the book spent entirely too much time on the bell ringing without really explaining what it involved. I am a professional musician so I did have a slight knowledge of the way these bells are rung, but I admit to some confusion about the different patterns of ringing. I enjoyed the book - somewhat - but the emphasis on the bell ringing did confuse me a bit and I thought it slowed down the progression of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I am new to Dorothy Sayers and her Lord Wimsey series. I selected this book based on the excellent reviews. Unfortunately, I was disappointed, but primarily because of the author's writing craft. Sayers takes a long time to develop the story's plot. The main mystery is not introduced until page 90. A lot of time at the beginning is spent describing the art/technical aspects of bell ringing and I just did not find these long descriptions interesting, though I do appreciate the connection between the novel and the tradition. The most unattractive aspect of the novel, for me at least, was the way Sayers crafted dialogue, or should I say monologue, as she wrote only a single character's contributions to a conversation, similar to the way one would write a phone conversation: \\"Yes, superintendent? Oh, I see...why didn't you say so...\\" Some of this one-sided dialogue goes on for pages. It is an odd technique, perhaps one that is used for economy of space or for development of main characters? Regardless of the purpose, I found it a bit monotonous. On the brighter side, once the story gets going, the mystery is interesting and Lord Wimsey's character is very likeable. Still that is not enough to compel me to read another Wimsey story or anything else by Sayers."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Classic Sayers, featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, the British art of change-ringing, the fens of East Anglia and other, extremely atmospheric, aspects of a very specific place and time. There is tension and mystery, but little violent action. I cannot say that I understand much about campanology (even after reading the novel several times), but the scholarly approach to the topic is typical of Miss Sayers, and lends much to the character of this particular episode. Those who do not care to have unfamiliar things explained or described might not enjoy Lord Peter's visit to Fenchurch St. Paul as much as I do, but readers who like to gain a flavor of a vanished time (and, no doubt, a much altered landscape) will probably be fascinated."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This is the first Dorothy Sayers book I've read.

Not a very exciting read, but I did learn a lot about church bells and the mathematics concerning their use."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The story is not about tailors at all but about bells. No bells as we know them but a system of bell ringing quite ancient. Not music but some ancient cryptic system.Each belll has a name and no bell is alike in size or tone.The whole mystery revolves around the church bells. Everything in old England. It's totally amusing."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Set in the remote village of Fenchurch St. Paul, this 1934 mystery involves an unknown body, which has been disfigured and mysteriously buried in the same grave as a local woman, shortly after the New Year. Many years before, a magnificent necklace of emeralds was stolen here, though it was never found. Two men and a local woman were implicated in the theft, and both men served time in prison. Now the unknown body, the fate of the two men involved in the theft of the emeralds, the whereabouts of the necklace, and the involvement of seemingly upright citizens of Fenchurch St. Paul are all under investigation.Lord Peter Wimsey, accompanied by his \\"man\\" Bunter, becomes involved in the investigation when their car runs off the road on a snowy New Year's Eve. Lord Peter ultimately agrees to substitute for an indisposed bell-ringer when the rector attempts to set a record of more than 18,000 rings in nine hours as a New Year's Eve celebration. The bells are an integral part of the mystery, with the \\"nine tailors,\\" a pattern of bell ringing, figuring prominently in the action. A coded letter suggests that the bells themselves may be connected to the emerald necklace.Author Dorothy Sayers creates vivid characters--the somewhat arrogant Lord Peter Wimsey, his faithful manservant Bunter, the \\"forgetful\\" rector of the local church and his wife, the French wife and children of one of the thieves, assorted odd characters from the town, and local law enforcement. The opportunity to locate the emeralds and ascertain the fate of the thieves, one of whom escaped shortly after being sentenced to jail, intrigues Lord Peter, and some townspeople have much to gain (or lose), depending on the identity of the man in the grave and his possible killer. Sayers's complex mystery and the equally complex interactions of the various characters keep the reader guessing to the very end.Ingenious and clever, this mystery is full of dry humor, as Lord Peter and Bunter engage in word play, hilarious who's-on-first dialogue, and multiple absurdities as they try to solve the case. The characters go beyond stereotype, eliciting sympathy and often respect, as they contrast with the sometimes stuffy and aristocratic Lord Peter. A mystery which is as satisfying in its conclusion (resembling the divine intervention of classical Greek tragedy) as it is in its immediate action, The Nine Tailors is one of Sayers's best and most intricate mysteries. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This novel, Dorothy L. Sayers' best-known, is, without doubt, one of her best-if not the best. Sayers takes the customary English village, and makes something new of it, by setting it in the Fen country, and by giving to it a church, which, as the well-drawn rector describes, \\"East Anglia is famous for the size and splendour of its parish churches. Still, we flatter ourselves we are almost unique, even in this part of the world.\\" The church services show great feeling and power, and neatly tie in with the theme of religion. The church possesses bells, the book being best-known for the bell-ringing, described in such powerfully beautiful descriptions as:\\"Out over the flat, white wastes of fen, over the spear-straight, steel-dark dykes and the wind-bent, groaning poplar trees, bursting from the snow-choked louvres of the belfry, whirled away southward and westward in gusty blasts of clamour to the sleeping counties went the music of the bells-little Gaude, silver Sabaoth, strong John and Jericho, glad Jubilee, sweet Dimity and old Batty Thomas, with great Tailor Paul bawling and striding like a giant in the midst of them. Up and down went the shadows of the ringers upon the walls, up and down went the shadows of the ringers upon the walls, up and down went the scarlet sallies flickering roofwards and floorwards, and up and down, hunting in their courses, went the bells of Fenchurch St. Paul.\\"The bells are also eerily threatening-\\"Bells are like cats and mirrors-they're always queer, and it doesn't do to think too much about them.\\"-which is fitting, as the plot hinges on bells: both an ingenious cryptogram (again, to quote the rector, \\"I should never have thought of the possibility that one might make a cipher out of change-ringing. Most ingenious.\\"), and an ingenious murder method.The whodunit aspect of the story is not neglected; for once, it is a genuine problem. The body is buried in a grave, and involves a complicated problem of identity, and an unknown method. The victim, as Wimsey describes, is \\"a perfect nuisance, dead or alive, and whoever killed him was a public benefactor. I wish I'd killed him myself.\\" Wimsey is engaging here, and not the parody of Bertie Wooster he sometimes is-he is a human being, without being the equally obnoxious creature found in Gaudy Night and Busman's Honeymoon. The detection is excellent, and, as was to be the trend in nearly every detective story following (especially Nicholas Blake's), the detective \\"felt depressed. So far as he could see, his interference had done no good to anybody and only made extra trouble. It was a thousand pities that the body of Deacon had ever come to light at all. Nobody wanted it.\\" These tie in with the burden of guilt and innocence, redemption and repentance.Finally, the book comes to its powerful climax in a flooded village, \\"with an aching and intolerable melancholy, like the noise of the bells of a drowned city pushing up through the overwhelming sea.\\"This is not a detective story-this is, if anything, a novel."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Unlike some of her Lord Peter mysteries, this novel can be read by itself, and it is a delight. About a murder done in an old church in the English countryside, you will learn more about the ringing of church bells than you thought possible. Lord Peter is at the top of his form, literate, intelligent, and a thinker beyond being just a mystery novel detective. None of the characters are one or two dimensional, and each of them is developed fully and delightfully. When it comes to mystery fiction, you can't do much better than Sayers...which may be one reason her novels appeared on PBS' MASTERPIECE THEATRE rather than MYSTERY! They are indeed, masterpieces"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"When I first read this book, I was in high school. Having encountered the phenomenon of change ringing in Groves Dictionary of Music and read that &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; was a novel which involved it, I assumed at first that something so old and specialized would be long out of print and unavailable. Imagine my delight when I found that the local college library had it! Presumably unable to borrow it, I felt very daring smuggling it into the 24-hour reading room and leaving it on a coat rack so that I could read it even when the library was closed. It was exciting again to discover later that it was actually in print and I could buy it for myself. This I have had to do several times over the years, because my copies keep disappearing-- probably loaned to friends.The continued availability of a novel on such an esoteric subject can only be testimony to the &quot;the worth of the work&quot; (one of Sayers's telling phrases in another of her books). It is, indeed, not as readily available as some of her other Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries. I have read most of them, believe that this is the best, and wouldn't be surprised if the author agreed. Yet many times I have noticed bookstores having several of the others in stock, but not The Nine Tailors. This has to be a sad commentary on the reluctance of many readers, even of mysteries, to venture into a quaint, abstruse subculture foreign to their own environments. Yet, happily, the real connoisseurs of the genre, who knowingly demand it even on special order, are numerous enough to keep it in print.This is the kind of book to take up cozily by the fire, or while snuggled unter the quilts, in wintertime as the snow falls and the wind whistles outside; for such is the weather on a bleak New Year's Eve in its first scenes. The circumstances are important-- so intricately crafted is the novel that almost everything is important. Lord Peter and his valet, driving through the fens between the world wars, meet with an automobile mishap compelling them to venture forth on foot. Soon they encounter the vicar and other salt-of-the-earth folk in the nearest village, and circumstances draw them quickly into the life of this close-knit community of good, solid, honest people unanimous in the love of the mighty, exquisite old church which is their heritage from a long-dissolved medieval monastery.Places like this really used to exist frequently in rural England. To read of them now, when they are so rare, is to meditate on what we have lost as time marches on. Although I doubt that Sayers was writing in this mode, the nostalgia which the book provokes in a reader today can be very poignant. But, beyond nostalgia, we can imbibe a gentle, abiding &quot;wonder and delight&quot; in these humble villagers' experience of their faith, and what it has wrought among them, which badly needs to be recovered in much of Christendom today. Fictional entertainment though it may be, if this book inspires and helps readers more than half a century later to recover this in their own lives, we can be certain that the author would be highly gratified. I would venture to guess, in fact, that this was her larger purpose, devout Anglo-Catholic that she was, in writing it."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I would agree with some others that this is the best mystery of all time. It indeed is a book best to be read in the winter, in a big comfortable easy chair, in front of a roaring fire.I have several copies, but am always on the lookout for another one. Sayers has her ace detective and consumate English gentleman Lord Peter Wimsey in an absolutely engrossing rural landscape. Like many traditional country areas, this one is dominated by a massive church. And the parish has some strong bell ringers, but also some members with dark secrets. The plot develops slowly, like fine wine.I am sorry that the Masterpiece Theater version is not yet out in video. Then I could read the book and watch the video throughout the long, freezing winters we have in my home in Arctic Alaska. Enjoy this book. Cherish it and buy a few extra copies, including a few for very close friends. It is a book you will want to keep handy on your bookshelf for the rest of your days! Earl Finkler in Barrow, Alaska"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The 1934 Dorothy L. Sayers mystery titled &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; is not about the garment industry. Instead it centers on the venerable tradition of &quot;change ringing&quot; still practiced in England in which a given number of church bells or &quot;tellers&quot; are rung in every possible combination. So nine of them would have to be rung in (what we call in math class) &quot;9 factorial&quot; or 362,880 different combinations. You can figure out how long that would take at one peal per second.Well the combinations do play a part in the solution of a particularly involved plot concerning jewelry stolen considerably in the past, a freshly dug grave with the wrong body in it, a flood, a snowstorm, and a villageful of really interesting characters, one of whom might be a thief, another a murderer, and so on. However, I am not reviewing the book itself but a marvelously effective complete reading of it by Lord Peter Wimsey himself, which is to say character actor Ian Carmichael who played Wimsey so well on the television series (now available on both VHS and DVD from Acorn Media). Here is the novel, complete on 6 cassettes, from Audio Partners, which is increasing their catalogue of complete mystery recordings very quickly indeed.Of course, Carmichael is the perfect Wimsey; but he is also very good at every other voice needed to make this an excellent reading. Some books-on-tape readers merely use their own voices throughout; and success depends on how interesting and appropriate that single voice is. Like David Suchet on the companion Poirot readings, Carmichael makes his reading into a full dramatization.Highly recommended for those who love a really intricate mystery read by a terrific actor."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"It's a cliche to say that something &quot;transcends its genre.&quot; However, any time I want to point to an example, I use The Nine Tailors. Sayers' best novel is far more than just a mystery novel. It is well written, with great characters, atmosphere, and a sense of place that rivals the best of Thomas Hardy. Even if you don't like mystery novels, you should read The Nine Tailors."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Wimsey novels and had read all of the books in the series--some twice--except for this one. I had been putting it off because 1) the subject of change-ringing sounded dull and unduly esoteric; and 2) I had heard that none of the usual characters appeared.I must admit that I am still unclear on exactly what change-ringing is. Regardless, I loved this book, even though there was very little Bunter and no Parker, Biggs, or Vane. The writing is outstanding, and I found the mystery aspect of the novel deeply satisfying. Even though I guessed one asepct of the mystery early on (the identity of the man in the grave), the rest of it was a nice twist."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The Nine Tailors is a uniquely English murder mystery set in a tiny town. When Lord Peter slides into a ditch on a cold winter night, he must spend the night at the vicarage in the tiny town of Fenchurch St. Paul. The vicar, a bell-ringing enthusiast, enlists Lord Peter to participate in ringing a 9 hour long peal on the ancient bells in the local church to celebrate the New Year.Later, when a body is mysteriously discovered in the grave of one of the local nobility, Lord Peter is called in to investigate. The theft of some priceless emeralds many years before seems to be connected. Lord Peter's exceptional social skills, enthusiam and intense curiosity cause nearly everyone to open up to him, making him the ultimate sleuth.Once again Sayers brilliantly portrays a segment of English country life, the small village, in a way that transports the reader to another time. The charismatic Lord Peter investigates not only an ingenious crime, but becomes part of this small community in a way that allows us to share in the innocence and crimes of a tiny village in England in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Change ringing is an ancient craft. Lord Peter Wimsey and Bunter have been held up at four A.M. New Years Eve. A snow storm and a bridge cause their car to be upended in a ditch. The rector of the parish offers to put them up for the night. Wimsey thinks the church is impressive. He calls it a young cathedral. The rector claims that East Anglia is famous for the size and splendor of its parish churches.The term tailors refers to bell ringing. Wimsey is solicited to engage in a very great task of nine hours duration, that of change ringing. It seems that additional manpower is needed since many of the men of the village have been felled by influenza.Subsequently, at the death of Sir Henry, the local lord, nine tailors and forty six strokes are rung. Making plans for the burial, an unknown body is discovered. To clear up the mystery, Lord Peter's help is sought. The man is between forty five and fifty years of age. The face has been battered and the ankles may have been tightly bound. On the arms there are pressure marks. The cause of death is suffocation.Wimsey speaks with the heir, Hilary, and learns that the body may have been placed in the crypt at the time of her mother's death. There is already a local mystery of considerable importance. Emeralds were stolen and have never been recovered.The setting of the story is fictitious. Nonetheless the area in the vicinity of Cambridge and the inhabitants there receive compelling descriptions by Dorothy Sayers. A Frenchwoman, Suzanne Legros, writes her husband a letter using the English pseudonym of Paul Taylor. It is addressed to one of the village post offices in the fens, poste restante. Bunter comes into possession of it. It is passed on through Wimsey and the authorities and provides the basis for the unraveling of the mystery.Another factor leading to the solution is an experience undergone by Wimsey, that of remaining in the bell tower at the time the bells are rung. There is additional excitement in fourteen days of flooding resulting in the death of one of the main actors of this tale."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This novel by Dorothy Sayers represents her considerable literary skills at their best. She skillfully weaves her mystery within a highly educational and entertaining presentation of bell chaining, a unique custom of the Church of England. Lord Peter Wimsey is the man!"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"While driving along a country road during a New Year's Eve snowstorm Lord Peter Wimsey slid into a ditch stranding him and the everfaithful Bunter in the village of Fenchurch St. Paul in the middle of the fen country. Soon Peter is caught up in village life, filling in for a missing bell ringer, hearing stories of old scandals and naturally a body appears. Before the novel ends nearly a year later, Peter solves mysteries both old and new, rights a few wrongs, restores a fortune and acquires a ward.The story is another installment in the LORD PETER series, set during the 1930's in England. Both Bunter and Insp. Parker appear briefly, a few other old friends are mentioned but this is most definitely Peter's story. The descriptions of the low-lying fen country and village life are a main attraction here. The people and countryside come to life in Sayers' hand. The rather obscure and complicated art of English bell ringing is described at length and is a bit of destraction to the story. Still the rest of the tale is so good that it more than makes up for this.This is a must-read for LORD PETER fans, and while there are better places to begin the series a new reader would not be at a total loss to start here. Fans of the English cosy or Sherlock Holmes would also enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"sayers was in the zone in this one, a beautiful piece of work, and a wonderful glimpse of england in the twilight of the empire (when it still didn't know it was fading out), all nicely unified around a fen village with its church and church bells and a weird murder mystery. whether you understand the ringing of changes or not, the idea projects a metaphor of a complex interdependent sustaining rhythm that runs through the whole plot and makes the solution of the mystery immensely satisfying. the manners and morals of the fateful period between the wars is captivating. this is the only book you'll ever read where somebody says, without irony, \\"it's fun to be rich. i find it so.\\" a great book."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I like this novel more than all the other Lord Peter Wimsey stories by Dorothy L.

I found it tiresome and boring.The mystery is a good one and the ending is a complete surprise, but the bell facts really slow down the story. I skimmed through the trivia and the story was much better."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"A very good mystery novel but not, in my opinion, one of Dorothy Sayers' best works. She herself admits that the mathematical complexities of church bell ringing is a very British phenomeon. For other audiences, the setting of the story can be almost intrusive and very difficult to deal with."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"A murder mystery? No. A complete history of English bell ringing. It would have been less painful to have my hair set on fire than to read this book. The reviewers recommend this author as comparable to Agatha Christie. They were very wrong. The author was obviously articulate, but to what end? If all you want to do is read, then reread, then reread how mathmatical bell ringing tradition is, then by all means purchase this book. If you are looking for a Christie mystery, forget it."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"As a homeschooling family, we've heard a lot about Dorothy Sayers through the years. I was really surprised to discover that she was the same Dorothy Sayers who wrote all the Peter Wimsey mysteries. Like I imagined her writing would be, this book is fun and educational.The Nine Tailors is a detective story along the lines of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Peroit. Her Lord Peter Wimsey is a smart, finicky, very British aristocrat who doesn't seem to have much else to do except try to find a \\"bit of fun\\" by being a detective. He reminds me a bit of the American Columbo (but before Columbo), asking questions that seem so innocent that it gets people talking and gets them caught on their own stories.Mrs. Sayers makes the English village come alive with all kinds of interesting characters and great dialogue. One of my favorite passages in the book is a dialogue between the town's rector and an older woman of the town. When he tells her that we shouldn't question the ways of Providence, the woman replies, \\"Don't yew talk to me about Providence. I've had enough o' Providence. First he took my husband, and then he took my \`taters, but there's One above as'll teach him to mend his manners, if he don't look out.\\"The story behind the mystery is a story about the English method of church-bell ringing, which is really more mathematical than musical according to the participants, though of course, music and math are always closely related. But the men work out the patterns using permutations of the numbers of the bells, not thinking so much about the actual notes of the bells themselves. Each man also takes his bell very seriously, learning through the generations about the personalities of the various bells. All the bells have names, and regardless of the name itself, all the bells are women. The town in the story is Fenchurch St. Paul (a fictional place) with a 130 foot church steeple and eight bells. The biggest bell is named Tailor Paul, and when someone dies, they ring Tailor Paul nine times, hence the name of the book. Because what would a good mystery be without an unexplained death or two?I enjoyed very much learning about the patterns for the church bells, but I also very much enjoyed the mystery. I hate mysteries where I have figured it out before the detective, so I was very pleased with myself that I figured out the murderer at exactly the same time as Lord Peter. The book was very well-written, fast-paced, with a healthy dose of British wit. I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone, and I'm looking forward to my next Lord Peter Wimsey mystery."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"A wonderfully written mystery, with beautiful observations. There are some who say one of the best. For me I can not say, for I have read very few mysteries. I would not call it a page turner, but I do find it quite clever and unique.

There's a mysterious dead body, an old parish church, a bumbling rector, and lots of foul weather. When Lord Peter Wimsey's car breaks down in Fenchurch St. Paul he is taken in by the rector. When an unidentified body turns up in the churchyard, Lord Peter is on the case.In Fenchurch St. Paul Sayers weaves a gripping and atmospheric mystery. At the heart of the mystery are the ancient church bells. They are tended by a close-knit and somewhat suspicious coterie of bell-ringers, who display an almost-slavish devotion to their ringing. More broadly, the book is fully infused with bell-ringing culture. The bells give their name to the the book; each has a name and together they are called 'The Nine Tailors.' In all honesty, there was more about bell-ringing than I needed to know. Still, this is a gripping mystery."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The story of The Nine Tailors revolves around an English tradition, bell change-ringing, that I'm not sure exists today (the book was first published in 1934). Lord Peter Wimsey finds himself in a small English village on New Year's Eve with a damaged car and no hotel. He obtains lodging with the village Rector, who is an ardent change-ringer. The town bell-ringers are planning an all-night ring to break a long standing record, but alas, one of the ringers falls ill. Lord Peter steps in to fill the void and finds himself involved with the bells, the village and a murder for the next several months.Each of the eight bells of the local church has an ancient history, a special name and ring tone, and together they are an integral part of the community. The bells are rung to celebrate a village event or to warn of an emergency. The Tailor Paul bell tolls the death of a villager. Nine Tailors confirms the death of a man, as it does when the body of an unknown male is found hidden in the graveyard.As Lord Peter tries to untangle the mystery of the unknown body and its relationship with the community, he never gets far from the bells. Sayers are woven an intricate story around the bells, the men who ring them, and has even provided direction and misdirection using the bells' names.This is a well-constructed mystery that will have you guessing right to the end.

It was almost painful attempting to read it."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"The Nine Taylors is mystery revolving around a small English village and an old church bell tower. I enjoyed the novel, but missed many main stays of the Lord Peter Wimsey stories. Other than Bunter, the book lacked many Lord Peter main stays; noticebly absent are Harriet Vain and the Wimsey family, with the exception of some brief appearances by Inspector Parker. As usual the characters are well drawn and vivid, but I found the plot involving a perloined necklack to be convoluted and confusing. The performance by Ian Carmichael was excellect as usual, the cassette format was annoying; I don't know why Audio Parters, Inc. have not transferred all the Dorothy Sayers novels to CD format at this point given the popularity of the series.Although I must say that The Nine Taylors is a must for any Wimsey fan, the book is especially good for new comers to the series as it requires no previous knowledge of the other Lord Peter books.

Peter Wimsey is great as the eccentric aristocrat detective as is his manservant Bunter who almost magically anticipates Wimsey's every need ( even needs Wimsey doesn't know he has). The plots are spectaculary drawn and the characters leap off of the page and into your heart.

She was a brilliant woman who taught and translated Dante;was a formidable apologist for Christianity and wrote eleven superb murder mystery novels. The Nine Tailors is considered one of her best and is a classic in the British mystery genre. Though much less well know than her great contemporary Agatha Christie, Sayres books are better written and contain more well rounded characters.The Plot of the Nine Tailors: Lord Peter Wimsey and Bunter his faithful manservant have car trouble in the fens of East Anglia. They are taken in for the night by the local pastor Rev. Venables an elderly and scholarly padre and Mrs. Venables his chubby wife. Venables is an expert in the complicated bell ringing practiced in England. The nine tailors are to be found in the church of Fen St.John.s. The bells are ancient and an important element in the worship practiced in the parish.Wimsey joins several locals in ringing the bells on New Year's Eve. Nine tolls of the bells (the nine tailors) are rung each time someone in the parish dies.A strange corpse is found in the same grave as that of a prominent female member of the community. His hands have been cut off and face disfigured beyond recognition. The case is complex and includes the theft of jewels. Only Peter Wimsey has the genius to solve the nettlesome mystery.The book is long for a murder mystery novel and contains several memorable characters.

In fact, I knew pretty much nothing about bell ringing -- but I sure learned a lot about it from this novel. The experience was pleasant. I enjoyed the mystery, the setting, the characters, the humor, and the plot. And I was very satisfied with myself when I figured out an important part of the solution, one based on the bells.This is a long book and, at times it might seem longer than it really is due to the information about bell ringing.

The nine tailors of the title are the nine bells that are rung upon someone's death.When a local man dies several months later, and his grave is dug, it's discovered that there's already a dead body in that grave--the body of an unknown man who was seen tramping about the countryside in January by Lord Peter himself. Who is the strange man? How is he connected to the theft of some emeralds that took place in 1914?It's a mystery that stumps even Lord Peter, and it's pretty ingenious--read it and see for yourself. Dorothy Sayers's novels are such a treat because she really knew how to pull a mystery together--she won't kill off one of her characters simply because she can. There's a backstory to everything, and Sayers leaves no stone unturned in this book. The Nine Tailors is as perfect a murder mystery as you're going to get."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"Of all the Lord Peter Wimsey novels I have had the pleasure to read to date, Ms Sayers created the moodiest of all in The Nine Tailors. While I often could barely follow the mathematical intricacies of the \\"telling\\" of the bells, the mere description went far to enhance the environment of the setting in which the intrigue occurs. This novel was my introduction to Lord Peter Wimsey. It led me to seek out and read more of the Wimsey novels, as well as some other Sayer short mysteries. Dorothy Sayers isn't for everybody, just as two of my all-time favorites, John Le Carre and P.D. James, aren't for all readers. If you can accept the pace, the nuances, the manner in which detail is provided to the reader, you'll truly enjoy curling up with a Sayer (Wimsey) novel. While this particular title isn't the best for the uninitiated, it can work. It did for me, and I got hooked."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"This tale finds Lord Peter Wimsey and his ever-present butler, \\"Bunter,\\" on a driving tour of the English countryside when Lord Peter, (who is a bit of a klutz at times), crashes the car, which keeps the two stranded for a day or so in a great and atmospheric rural location, of course, to launch into another great double-whammy mystery: an old jewel theft and murder.Wimsey and Bunter end up staying overnight at a friendly old preacher's home and Peter gets \\"roped\\" (yes, a pun...) into an all-night bell-ringing vigil to ring in the new year at the local church, due to the reported serious illness of one of the bell-ringing team. The bells themselves are the Nine Tailors of the title, each having a separate formal name.I'll stop there, except to say that Lord Peter ultimately has to return much later to solve the theft and the murder mysteries.The story is expertly crafted by Sayers, a master of the mystery-writing art, and few folks will guess the ironic ending. Here are some things that I like about this mystery: It's English; it takes place early on in the 20th Century; there are \\"crusty\\" characters; the location is very good; I learned a LOT about church-bell ringing, clearly an art-form that I was previously unaware of, and; the story has a satisfying conclusion. So, what didn't I like? Well, those are mostly my own hang-ups because these are things NOT so much found in this story, but I savor mystery cliches such as creepy old houses, lots of rain, and a clear nemesis throughout such sagas.Also, I will assert that Dorothy L. Sayers wrote BETTER mysteries than this one, (e.g., \\"The Unpleasantness at the Belonna Club,\\" her best mystery ever), so I'm sort of rating this one solely against her own works. Still, this is a fine mystery and I recommend it to others who enjoy the genre.This story is also available on Audiobook and that version is VERY good, rendered by an excellent reader. I definitely recommend that you read the book first, though, because there are tons of intricate details and clues in this one that are otherwise easily missed in the audiobook version."},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors","review":"I literally ordered it and got it so quickly!

Built around the authors' adventures with a real, large scale project named Delphi, one feels as if she/he is working with the them and their very human cohorts as they cope with problems of enormous complexity.The chapter titles themselves should give a flavor of the book:&quot;Digging Yourself into a Hole,&quot;&quot;Going Where Angels Fear to Tread: There Is No Right Way to Do the Wrong Thing,&quot; and &quot;A Charlatan in Expert's Clothing: Writing a Lie - The Proposal...&quot;being typical examples.Each chapter concludes with &quot;clinical&quot; phrases such as, &quot;The Dog Ate My Plan&quot; or &quot;I Wasn't Involved,&quot; that serve as warnings, in everyday language, that something is amiss. The warnings are then followed by very useful &quot;bullets&quot; that suggest ways for coping with the &quot;dog&quot; or the excuses one gives for his/her participation in a phase of the project that ended in failure.A highly readable book, it should be of interest to all people who are engaged in project management, whether the project involves creating a piece of multi-million dollar electronic equipment or planning a extended family reunion of relatives who are ambivalent about getting together."},{"Title":"It Sounded Good When We Started: A Project Manager's Guide to Working with People on Projects (Practitioners)","review":"Excellent material, well written and cogently organized.

It has his signature unparalleled beauty but is also unusually thoughtful, with intriguing musings on illusion vs. reality and the nature of love, beauty, and art. Keats' lament about empiricism destroying natural wonder has heavily influenced everyone from Edgar Allen Poe to Richard Dawkins, and Lamia remains central to the art/nature vs. science debate. The story is also interesting in itself; Keats brings a fantasy world vividly to life, draws us in emotionally, and even has a devastating ending. Finally, the poem is impressive technically, showing Keats' growing couplet mastery. One should certainly read his best-known works first, but this should be an early stop; that said, the fact that it is virtually every Keats collection makes a standalone very hard to justify. The important thing at any rate is to read it in some form."},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others","review":"Englishman Anthony Chambers arrives in Australia determined to expose the scheming, whoring ways of the woman with whom he shared his inheritance, Annie Ross. The terms of his uncle's will dictated that he live a year with Annie at Camelot station--certainly enough time to expose her for the tart she must be. In his arrogant assessment of the woman who shared his uncle Cedrick's home and life, Tony never even entertained the notion that Annie's and Cedrick's relationship could be based on simple friendship. The world that he comes from in London is a much more calculating one, and men and women play by the rules of high society where friendship between the sexes is unheard of, especially when the woman claims to be widowed and has a small child. But then, Tony has never met a woman like Annie before. And when he does, he finds all of his assumptions, morals and values thrown into question.Annie Ross refused to be intimidated by the aloof, arrogant Englishman. Several years before she left behind his judgmental type when she left her home in Philadelphia to accompany Cedrick to Australia. Fiercely protective of her past, her child, and her home, Annie is determined to remain at Camelot station despite Cedrick's arrogant nephew. Annie's quite surprised by the touch of gentleness Tony exhibits toward her daughter, and even more surprised by the concern he demonstrates toward her. Then again, perhaps the hiring of servants isn't to ease her burden, but only to uphold his proper station in society. Nevertheless, independent and capable, Annie finds other occupations for her time. Yet she finds it difficult to resist her growing attraction to this man, despite the painful memories of her past with her daughter's father.Lovers of historical romance will enjoy Gail Link's gentle, loving romance that provides a step into the past. With a grace and beauty that matches the Australian lands in which it is set, FORSAKING ALL OTHERS follows the development of a passionate love that binds an American heart to an English one in a novel of fulfilled love."},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others","review":"FORSAKING ALL OTHERS is a solid four stars. Ms. Link took a typical romantic set-up but managed to make it interesting. It is 1888 and the setting is in Australia. Annie Ross recently lost her dear friend, Cedric. Older than her by several decades, their relationship was platonic but deep. Unaware until recently, she found herself the recipient of his will. The other person is his great nephew, Tony Chambers, newly arrived from England.Tony doesn't know what to think when he first meets Annie. Expecting the worst, she is not what he thought she'd be like either in looks or actions. Soft-spoken but strong she isn't one to succumb to his charms and this is something he is not used to. He has his moments where is a typical pain in the as*. Belligerent, pretentious, and jealous are a few adjectives that describe the man. And yet I liked the guy.Annie has her secrets and it is nothing the average reader can't figure out soon after starting the book. Most of the time spent between the two concerns the development of their relationship. Trust issues compound how they feel about each other. Secondary characters keep the romance flowing.Tony did a great job at mustering up some conflicts but there was no 'Big Misunderstanding' and that was refreshing in and of itself. Ms. Link described several of his daydreams that I, personally, thought were pointless. My guess is an editor asked her to include these parts to increase the ratings.I've read better historical romances but I still enjoyed this story.

If you plan on having high-end built-in storage added to your home, then this book might be useful.However, readers seeking less costly or more temporary storage ideas should look elsewhere. Most of these tips primarily consist of placing baskets and bins in various places around the home - not particularly innovative.

As a result, these tips really didn't help me much.On a positive note, the pictures are quite nice; even though it was published in 1998, everything still looks fairly current. Unfortunately, the pictures typically show an entire room incorporating several types of storage, and items were not numbered to correspond to the accompanying tip.

Astronomers in Timurid Iran (of all places!) improved on the Ptolemaic system with epicycles mathematically equivalent to those used by Copernicus much later (although they were still geocentrist). That China was more technologically advanced than Europe still at the time of Marco Polo is well-known. Yet, around the 14th century, science in both the Muslim lands and China went into decline, while the erstwhile little backwater of Western Europe eventually developed modern science.What went wrong? Or, from a European perspective, what did we do right?That's the subject of Toby E. Huff's book \\"The Rise of Early Modern Science\\". Huff is a British professor who also worked at scholarly institutions in Malaysia (a Muslim nation) and Singapore (a Chinese nation). He writes in the tradition of well-known German sociologist Max Weber, who is most known for his thesis that the ethos of Calvinism somehow gave rise to capitalism. Weber also analyzed other religious traditions and their impact on society. As for Huff, his argument is complex and only a short outline is possible in a review like this. Like the other reviewers, I will concentrate on the chapters dealing with Islam and the West.Huff doesn't deny that Muslim science was, for centuries, more advanced than European science. Indeed, there was virtually no science at all in the Latin West during the Early Middle Ages. Huff also points out that Muslim science was innovative, the most dramatic example being the previously mentioned astromomical observatory at Maragha in Iran. The eventual decline of Muslim science (except in the field of military technology) cannot therefore be a result of brain drain, lack of innovative thinkers, etc. Something else must be at work here.What factors could have impeded the rise of modern science in the Muslim caliphates? The author points out that the natural sciences were always seen as \\"foreign\\" in the Muslim lands. Many ulama (Muslim scholars) were deeply suspicious of the \\"foreign\\" sciences. Muslim jurisprudence, not science, was at the center of Muslim institutions of higher learning. Even Muslim theology (!) was sometimes seen as suspect, since the most conservative ulama feared that it might lead to philosophical reasoning independent of the Quran and the sunna. Eventually, the natural sciences were assimilated with Islam, but as subordinate parts of a largely religious whole. Thus, astronomy was accepted since it could be used to compute the qibla to Mecca, and astronomers became mosque officials. The natural sciences couldn't develop independently.There were several kinds of colleges in the Muslim world, the madrasas being the most important. However, they didn't function as European universities. The madrasas were religious institutions concentrating on Muslim jurisprudence. Scientific education *did* take place at the madrasas, but not as part of the public curriculum. Rather, instruction in the sciences was given by the teacher in private, often at his own house. A tradition of dissimulation developed, both in regard to science and Greek philosophy. Rather than spreading scientific or philosophical ideas far and wide, they were kept within small, almost esoteric circles. (Jews such as Maimonides had a similar attitude.) Also, instruction at the madrasas was highly personalistic. There was no faculty, and hence no set corporate standards for exams or degrees. Essentially, the student got his degree if and when his personal teacher felt he was ready for it. With the exception of medical science under some rulers, there were no attempts to standardize the degrees over a larger territory.Huff believes that Muslim society was personalistic and heterogenous. This prevented the rise of the universalist spirit necessary for objective science. In Western Europe, the Roman law was considered binding on all. In the Sunni Muslim lands, there were at least four different schools of jurisprudence, and non-Muslims had their own laws. Since Muslim laws were based on the Quran, the sunna and the consensus among the ulama, innovation was difficult or even prohibited. Since the madrasas concentrated on teaching Muslim law, the ethos of these institutions was one of traditionalism and particularism. It was difficult to develop a universalizing, innovative spirit. Huff further points out that Muslim law didn't recognize corporations as legal persons. A corporate institution with a faculty, such as the European university, couldn't develop under these conditions.Huff then points out that there was a de facto secular sphere of society in medieval Western Europe, something sadly lacking in the Muslim lands. This secular sphere was created after the investiture conflict, when the papacy and the temporal power had to compromise with each other. Another important factor was the re-discovery of Roman law, which was often seen as secular. The university of Bologna, where Roman law was taught, was purely secular. In the Muslim society, there was no distinction between \\"church\\" and state, and hence no neutral space (a central concept for Huff) for potentially subversive scientific exploration and speculation. In Huff's opinion, the Western European universities provided such a neutral space. They were independent corporations, with their own laws and jurisdictions, and some of them were purely secular. Temporal rulers and church authorities did attempt to interfere with the free flow of ideas, to be sure, but the institutionalized independence of the universities made this difficult. Also, high and late medieval society at large was a complex web of guilds, communes, and independent cities, making it well-nigh impossible for a strong, authoritarian center to assume control. In this situation, it was easier for free inquiry to thrive, despite occasional setbacks (the fate of Abelard and Galileo comes to mind). Huff also writes that the science education at European universities was public, rather than secret or semi-secret as in the Muslim territories. Indeed, universities sometimes had lectures open to non-students, at which members of the public at large could ask questions to the professors. This was a far cry from Muslim (or Jewish) esotericism.Since the author of \\"The Rise of Early Modern Science\\" is a Weberian, he naturally believes that religious or ideological factors played an important role in the process. The natural choice would be to contrast Christianity with Islam. However, Huff seems to believe that the crucial ingredient was a rationalist form of Platonism. There was a Platonist renaissance of sorts during the 12th century, and in Huff's opinion it was strongly influenced by Plato's dialogue \\"Timaeus\\". From \\"Timaeus\\", the philosophers of the Latin West drew the conclusion that the universe is rational, that it follows strict natural laws of cause and effect, and that humans are endowed with a rational mind that can learn to grasp these laws. The analogy between the universe and a machine was used already during the High Middle Ages. Of course, medieval West Europeans still believed that God could miraculously intervene in his creation, as when Jesus was born from a virgin, but this was seen as an entirely different order of events. Under normal circumstances, the universe worked like clock-work according to natural laws graspable by scientific inquiry. Huff also points to the Christian idea of a conscience as a further source of inspiration for the notion that humans have a rational mind, but he admits that Paul might have gotten this idea from popular Platonism. Later, the works of Aristotle would enter the picture as well.By contrast, Muslim theology was occasionalist. According to this concept, the universe does *not* follow self-contained natural laws created by God at some point in the beginning. Rather, God controls everything directly, from moment to moment. Thus, there is no real causality. That effect necessarily follows cause is an illusion. God wills a certain effect to follow a certain cause at any given moment. He might have willed otherwise. Trying to discover self-contained natural laws (even self-contained natural laws originally created by God) is meaningless. Occasionalism became an insurmountable barrier to modern scientific development in the Middle East.The Muslims had access to more or less the same empirical facts as the Europeans, as shown by the astronomers of Timurid Iran whose epicycles were mathematically equivalent to those of Copernicus. Indeed, many Muslim libraries were endowed with tens of thousands of books, some of them obviously scientific. Yet, the Muslims never proposed heliocentrism. In Europe, the idea that the natural world wasn't directly dependent on the will of God, but functioned independently, made it possible to propose daring new paradigms such as the Copernican one, even when this seemingly contradicted the literal meaning of Scripture. The neutral space of the universities made it possible for such ideas to get a hearing, especially since education was a public, corporate effort. And since the universities weren't directly controlled by church or state, kings or popes couldn't simply close them down.In Muslim lands, ulama could issue a fatwa against independent-minded scholars, while a Catholic attempt to stop \\"heresies\\" at the university of Paris (the condemnation of 1277) proved ineffectual. The ulama could also mobilize the common man against scholars not of their liking, while universities in Europe were protected by legal privilege from interference by outsiders. In the Latin West, a metaphysical leap to modern science was possible (another central and complex point made by the author), while this proved impossible in the lands of Islam.\\"The Rise of Early Modern Science\\" is well-written, interesting and well-worth pondering. Indeed, I ordered several of the books referenced in the footnotes.Yet, one question remains. If the Muslims were so bad, how could they develop science for centuries? How was it possible for this non-secular, ulama-ridden, particularistic Muslim society with its wackie jurisprudence to be scientifically leading for 500 years? Indeed, Huff believes that Muslim civilization at its zenith was better even than China!Why did it work so well for so long? Why did the decline take place during the 14th century? Why not earlier? These are important questions, yet Huff never really answers them. He does suggest some answers in passing, however. One is the ironic observation that science started to decline at the precise moment that it was finally \\"Islamized\\". Thus, as long as there was a creative tension between \\"foreign\\" science and \\"Muslim\\" science, advances were made. The moment \\"foreign\\" science became a subordinate part of a non-secular whole, progress stopped. At another point, Huff suggests that al-Ghazali and a 14th century Sufi revival are to blame. However, the theme isn't explored further.Be that as it may, I give the book four stars.PS. The chapters on China are, of course, equally interesting."},{"Title":"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West","review":"Huff sees science as a social practice which cannot flourish without a social niche for the person who would investigate nature, and covers a long span of history looking at the ways societies create or fail to create those social roles. I have read a good many books on this subject, and Huff's is the most fair-minded, cogent and satisfying. Recommend highly."},{"Title":"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West","review":"I have read Dr. Huff's book, and also read the 1st edition. The 2nd edition is after 9/11. Dr. Huff's main thesis appeared to me very self-evident. Let's examine the crux of the case of Islam vs. Modern Science, as examined masterfully by Dr. Toby E. Huff, a Chancellor Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.Dr. Huff's latest edition, which is better referenced than his earlier (1st) edition, contains a total of NINE (9) chapters. For understanding the role of Islam in the development of Science, the casual reader at least needs to read thoroughly chapter 2 (Arabic Science and the Islamic World), chapter 3 (Reason and Rationality in Islam and the West), Chapter 5 (Madrassas, Universities and Science). These chapters help explain the most important theme: WHY ISLAM FAILED TO GIVE BIRTH TO MODERN SCIENCE, EVEN THOUGH IT HAD ONCE GENERATED THE BEST OF THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SCIENCE.The author has done a very masterful job in supporting his views by extensively citing noted researchers like Max Weber, Joseph Needham, George Makdisi, Ignaz Goldziher and others, in addition to referring to his own research papers and books about the comparative analysis of scientific development and its universal spread (globalization).Going to chapter 5, the reader finds that the madrassas were aimed at teaching two classes of science(s),and legal systems (or jurisprudence with associated logic/analysis/metaphysics). There were \\"Prophetic sciences\\" and \\"foreign sciences\\". The former was actually based on logic systems whose boundaries were very clearly drawn: the prophetic sciences were in line with the concept of upholding \\"divinity\\" as revealed by the Quran. The foreign sciences, on the other hand, were those analytical body of knowledge that were at odds with the Quranic traditions and the theological propositions.The bedrock reason that explains the failure of Islam to usher modern science is articulated very well by Dr. Huff in his book, page 158, that reads as follows:\\"It was even essential to Islam, ..., because the 'method was part and parcel of the Islamic orthodox process for determining orthodoxy. Where it failed ws in the creation of a set of objective standards of law, against which all other laws and principles could be judged. Since the legal principles of Islamic law had been given once and for all, in the Quran and the sunna, and in the principles of fiqh worked out by al-Shafi'i, the only task left was to use logic in the narrow sense, to uncover faulty reasoning and thus preserve the doctrinal status quo....\\"This explains clearly, as one finds that application \\"freethought\\" was arrested and persecuted by the dictates in the theological canons of Islam, why modern science did not take birth from the womb of Islam, but rather took firm foothold in the European rennaisance ushering the birth of quantum (wave) mechanics and modern science.The book is a must reading simply because of sheer amount of research that has been done by Dr. Huff to explore this aspect. It would be an asset for anyone doing research and wishing to include comparative aspects of Islamic societal functions into the research.This is a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED book for a serious reader."},{"Title":"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West","review":"This is an honest, deep, and well footnoted description of why the Middle East and China did not develop the full power of science, philosophy and technology for the full service of mankind like Western Europe did. I read the book as part of my on-going effort to understand what drives Middle Easterners to act the way they do on the World Stage. I learned that after about 1200 AD, Middle Eastern Islamic scholarly denial of the concept of cause and effect made and makes the scientific method null and void for the people of the Middle East. This prevents them from creating for themselves the body and soul enriching fruits of advanced science, philosophy and technology. For reasons predating the Renaissance, Europe had and has no such fear of accepting the scientific method. This includes accepting critical examination of the historical accuracy of Holy Scripture, and also learning in exquisite detail how God runs His Universe. I'm now reading in the book about China."},{"Title":"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West","review":"The book chronicles the retreat of Christianity from pure faith (and Islamic-style fundamentalism) in the face of reason and science. Huff explains how and why it happened in the west--and NOT in Islamic countries, Eastern (Byzantine) Christianity, or in China.Arab scholars preserved and extended Greek thought -- yet Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras and other Greek thinkers had no impact in the Islamic or Byzantine Empires (where the language of Aristotle was the language of everyday life).Huff exhaustively establishes the reasons why western Europe was different. There were many factors, the most significant being:THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF FREE WILL, and the corollary that man has a conscience, which has no counterpart in Islam. In Christianity, the human being is free to choose his own destiny -- admittedly, between the narrow choices of heaven or hell. A corollary is the principle of secondary causation: when you hit the white billiard ball which strikes a red one, the movement of the red ball is caused (secondarily) by the action of the white. In Islam, there is no secondary causation: everything, including the movement of the red billiard ball, is caused by Allah.THE SEPARATION OF STATE AND CHURCH: After the collapse of the western Roman Empire, Europe still had its monopoly Catholic church, centered in Rome, which was occasionally divided by dissension; but political power was fragmented between dozens of kingdoms and tiny principalities. Thus, temporal and spiritual power were separated, and competed for power. In Islam (and the Byzantine Empire) the Caliph was the ruler of both church and state, and the law of the state was the law of the church, and vice versa.THE \\"UNIVERSITAS\\" AND THE REDISCOVERY OF ROMAN LAW: The rediscovery of Roman Law led to the idea of regular, universal laws, the codification of civil and canon (church) law, and the universitas, or corporation. Unlike today's corporation, the universitas was a cross between a guild and a mini-state: it could make laws binding its members which had equal force with the laws of the state and church. One profession that established the universitas was that of teachers, the result being the University, which became yet another center of power, jealously guarding its legal privileges against both church and state. No equivalent to the flourishing universities of Oxford, Paris, and Bologna existed anywhere else on earth. They became transmitters of knowledge: a certificate from one university was recognized by others. In the Islamic world, a student could learn from an individual teacher, but if he changed teachers he would usually have to begin again. In any event, to Muslims everything was (and still is) to be found in the Koran, so any other source of knowledge was seen to be unnecessary, if not dangerous to the health of state and society. Such independent scholars as did exist did so on sufferance, or thanks to the (usually temporary) protection of a relatively-open-minded ruler.The European universities of the time offered just four courses: Natural Philosophy (mainly Aristotle), Medicine, Law, and Theology. Natural Philosophy was the prerequisite for any of the other three schools. One result: Catholic theologians were all steeped in the methods of reason they learned studying the Greek philosophers. The greatest of these was Thomas Aquinas who, so to speak, turned Augustine on his head. (Another consequence, the reaction, was the Inquisition.)In the process--without, perhaps, necessarily intending to--Huff shows why Islam remains hostile to science and reason (in the same way early Christianity was).I've touched on merely a few of Toby Huff's work. There's lots more here, as other reviews demonstrate. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West","review":"Really, it's an excellent read. Well documented. I love books debunking the Dark Ages, showing how they lit the light on the future.Although it's very \\"sociological\\" in the early part, to Huff's credit, he largely succeeds in tightening up the weak definitional / conceptual framework he has inherited from some of his less disciplined peers. Some very weak concepts there. And, though I enjoyed the historical exposition in the intervening pages, I found it strange that he didn't introduce the powerful new analytics from institutional economics (Douglass North et. al.) and economic history until near the end of the book. I would have given it five stars, but for that."},{"Title":"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West","review":"Not delving into the thesis over and above written above for fear of spoiling the entirety for future readers. Huff outlines numerous aspects of societal advancement, and the causes or hindrances to advancement, reflective towards the creation of Modern Science within the West, Arabic/pseudo-Islamic and Asia societies; namely China. Although over validation of the \\"Arabic\\" or pseudo-Islamic society, Oswald Spengler showed the opposite - modern flaw - of Huff within his \\"Decline of the West\\". Huff further outlines the various historical cultural, religious and social differences that spawned evolutionary thought and creativity within the West that had not appeared, or allowed to appear, within the East. Huff's work here tends to supply validation to other related works by authors in other fields in both a historical and modern nature like that of Hanson's \\"Carnage and Culture\\" or \\"Intellectuals\\" by Paul Johnson. Theo-Politically speaking, Huff's efforts show an aspect that provides a foundation to those written by Ibn Warraq, Robert Spencer, Andrew Bostom and Bat Ye'or efforts relating to the historical and modern interactions between Islam and the non-Islamic world especially that of the Arab-Israel conflict as expounded by the fabulously documented tome by Joan Peters' \\"From Time Immemorial\\". Socio-Politically speaking Huff's outline of the development of different paths of thought and social progress in the West give credence to the works by such authors as William Gairdner's \\"War Against the Family\\" and \\"The Book of Absolutes\\", Zygmund Dobbs' \\"The Great Deceit\\" and \\"Keynes at Harvard\\", W. Cleon Skousen's \\"Naked Commun/Capitalist\\", Rose Martin's \\"Fabian Freeway\\", Antony Sutton's various works and of course much within the nightly utterances of News Talk Radio host and author of such works as \\"Death of the White Male; the Case Against Affirmative Action\\" and \\"Trickle Up-Poverty\\" by Dr. Michael Savage. All of the aforementioned deal with the bi-products and influences of Huff's positions stemming from ancient to modern-day problems in realpolitik. Huffs work is a very well laid out and documented effort that suggests the base differences in differing development and advancement of differing societies.

The majority of books on Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio fall into three categories: (1) Books for children, (2) Mystical mumbo-jumbo, and (3) Books claiming you can use Fibonacci numbers to win in the stock market (!). Even Mario Livio's book, which is better than most, uses so much of its space to _debunk_ some of the mystical mumbo-jumbo that it de-emphasizes the wonderful patterns that can be found in the Fibonacci sequence, which is beautiful enough in its mathematical properties that one doesn't need to make such digressions. Dunlap's book, by contrast, _does_ emphasize those patterns. And when it's not directly addressing the Fibonacci sequence's properties, it's discussing things like the golden ratio and Penrose tilings, which are completely within the category of mathematics related to the topic.I really enjoyed the book, even though it has some typographical errors and minor omissions. The formulas collected in the third appendix alone justify buying the book. I could wish that there were more given, but this is the best collection I have seen."},{"Title":"The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Numbers","review":"I wanted a book that was concerned on nature observations, but much more on mathematical demonstrations, equations and formulas.

In Dallas, she exits the highway only to become lost in a bad neighborhood. Before long, she loses her vehicle with all her worldly possessions except for what she is wearing, and much of her cash. Freezing, as she is not dressed for the cold weather that grips the area, Wendy must do something before it can get any worse.Worse arrives when a tall knight on a motorcycle arrives and offers her a ride to temporary safety. Feeling no other option is available, she reluctantly accepts his offer though her savior looks more like her worst nightmare. Bounty hunter Michael Wolfe will keep Wendy safe though she treats him like a serial rapist rather than the stud who took her out of the cold. As she helps him capture a bail jumper, Wendy and Michael fall in love, &quot;but she is gonna be an actress and he is gonna&quot; fly after jumpers.Names aside (perhaps the male darling should have been Peter or John) and why Wendy withdrew her life savings in an age of electronic banking, readers will enjoy the meeting of the wholesome Midwesterner and the bad dude. The story line is fast-paced with plenty of action, but it is the repartee between the lead twosome that make this a joy ride as Wendy knows deep inside that her fearsome hero would not harm her. TALL, DARK, AND TEXAN is a fine suspense laden tale for those who appreciate a good girl with the mislabeled bad guy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tall, Dark And Texan (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Almost out of gas on her way from New York to Hollywood, hopeful actress Wendy Jamison gets carjacked, losing everything. The huge and dangerous man who pulls up on a motorcycle looks like the end, but he turns out to be a hunky bounty hunter--Michael Wolfe. With no money, no clothes but what she's wearing, and with a blizzard raging, Wendy needs rescuing, but only for a little while. She's on her way to Los Angeles, to the movies and television. Some day, she's going to have her picture on People Magazine and she's never going to settle again.Wolfe has made his own way in life and he's now the top bounty hunter in Dallas. He lives alone, except for a bad-tempered cat, and he likes it that way. He doesn't need a woman in his life, especially not one who makes trouble, can't take orders, and who lies about being a gourmet cook. Still, Wolfe is all male and something about Wendy turns his hormonal thermostat to full blast. But Wolfe knows that girls like Wendy don't fall for guys like him. He's too big, too scary, and too damaged to mean anything to her. Besides, she's only going to stay in Texas long enough to get her feet back under her, earn enough for the breast augmentation sadly necessary to succeed in Hollywood, and then she'll be out of his life forever.Wendy finds herself falling in love with Wolfe, with the way he cares for others and the fierce protectiveness he offers her, but she can't give up on her dreams. They have kept her alive, motivated, going, when everyone else in her large family settled for working in the chewing gum factory. She simply can't give up on her dreams, even for love.Author Jane Sullivan, who also writes as Jane Graves, delivers a super-sexy story with some charming humor and just a touch of adventure. Wolfe is a wonderfully damaged hero and Wendy makes a spunky heroine, filled with energy and a willingness to try anything to reach her dreams. Sullivan's strong writing propells the story along, making TALL, DARK AND TEXAN a book that you'll want to start early in the day if you plan to get any sleep that night at all."},{"Title":"Tall, Dark And Texan (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"What a great book!

By the end of the century, according to one source cited by Carnes, as many as 40% of American males belonged to one or another such society. What accounted for this popularity?From the \\"sodalities in taverns\\" they were the eighteenth century, as the nineteenth century progressed, Freemasonry and Oddfellowship became more and more formal and ritualistic, the emphasis changing from the festive board to somber, quasi-religious ceremony. Entirely new orders were created, imitating the older ones. Many adopted a policy of teetotalism. Some of this was in reaction to the Anti-masonic movement that arose in the 1820s after the disappearance and alleged murder of \\"Captain\\" William Morgan by Freemasons.Carnes correctly ties the Anti-masonic movement to the influence of women. The connection between teetotalism and early feminism is well-documented. Maurice Healey quite perceptively suggests that prohibitionism was a popular feminine cause because women believed it would force their husbands to spend their time at home attending to domestic duties, rather than at taverns, and their money on fineries for their wives, rather than on strong drink. Yet while making the connection between Anti-masonry and female influence, and pointing out that lodge affiliation amongst males was in many ways both cause and consequence of the feminization of religion, Carnes attributes teetotalism in the lodges to rising \\"middle-class values.\\" He neglects the obvious connection between female influence and low Protestantism's elevation of teetotal abstinence to a Christian virtue - though completely foreign to Him who made water into wine at Cana. Finally, how much religious antipathy to the orders was simply a consequence of their successful charitable fundraising, which some critics may have felt diverted money from its appropriate channel through the churches?Carnes relies heavily on nineteenth century ritual expos&eacute;s of the various fraternities, while neglecting, or perhaps avoiding, much excellent historical work that has been done by such bodies as Quatuor Coronati Lodge No. 2076, E.C., the American Lodge of Research, and the Scottish Rite Research Society. He falls into errors that someone familiar with fraternal orders from personal experience would not have done. For example, he states (p. 178) that \\"...the crucial story concerning Hiram Abiff in the Master Mason degree was introduced into Masonic ritual in 1825.\\" The Hiramic legend in Masonry is at least a century older than this, being found in such early expos&eacute;s as Pritchard's \\"Masonry Dissected\\" (1730). Carnes's explanation of the Ancient/Modern division in Freemasonry is equally ill-informed.Another area in which Carnes's coverage is faulty concerns supposed drastic revisions in ritual during the mid-nineteenth century. It is true that American masonic ritual differs substantially from that in use in England. American ritual is derived from William Preston, whose late eighteenth-century recensions were used only by his splinter Grand Lodge in the north of England. They little resembled the work of London lodges except in the essential obligations, words, and grips. Preston's work was adapted by the American Thomas Smith Webb in the early nineteenth century, widely spread by the masonic lecturer Jeremy Cross, and has remained essentially unchanged since then. English ritual changed dramatically with the union of the Ancients and Moderns under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Sussex in 1814. The one major American masonic ritual change of the nineteenth century was that of conducting lodge business on the Third rather than the First Degree. Otherwise, American ritual more resembles Scottish than English practice. Far from having been radically revised, it represents the survival of archaic usage amongst an immigrant population - a phenomenon well-known to linguists and anthropologists.Albert Pike's career is discussed more factually in Carnes's book than in most sources. However, the claim that Pike completely re-wrote the degrees of the Scottish rite is repeated here uncritically. The Francken manuscript, one of the eighteenth-century source documents for Scottish rite ritual, shows that in most cases Pike elaborated on established themes. He seldom created anything completely original. Carnes, despite his emphasis on fraternalism as a northern, urban phenomenon, sets little importance on the distinction between the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of the Scottish Rite (Pike's authority was over the Southern Jurisdiction). He pays no attention to the intense jurisdictional conflicts, including that over Cerneauism, which raged in the northeast during the middle nineteenth century.Carnes is confused about York rite ritual. For example, the the Past Master degree as a prerequisite for the Royal Arch was not an American innovation, but a survival of the requirement that the candidate have \\"passed the chair.\\" In England, this archaism was completely abolished. In American Royal Arch work the High Priest is not a chaplain, but the presiding officer. This is a real departure from English work, where the First Principal represents the King. Carnes often conflates and confuses Freemasonry with Oddfellowship, Pythianism, and other orders. At the same time he misses some obvious points, such as that Oliver Kelley, founder of the Grange, was the first man made a mason in the first masonic lodge in Minnesota (today's Saint Paul Lodge No. 3). Oddfellowship's First Degree borrows from the masonic Order of the Secret Monitor, and the Knights of Pythias borrow a part of their Third Degree from another masonic side-degree.Freemasonry never involved an insurance scheme, whereas most of the other fraternal orders did. The Woodmen, for example, even now have a sizable insurance operation headquartered in Omaha. This difference was reflected in the different class of people from which Freemasonry derived its membership as compared to the insurance-based orders. Carnes does not emphasize this contrast, yet it seems more significant than his treatment implies. The decline of many orders may be traced to the Great Depression, which led to the introduction of unemployment compensation, Social Security, pension plans and employer-funded benefits. These rendered fraternal insurance much less important. The foregoing may seem a litany of fault-finding. Still, Carnes's book is worthwhile, and blazes a trail for further investigation."},{"Title":"Secret Ritual and Manhood in Victorian America","review":"There is a lot of garbage out there on the topic of Secret Societies. This book is a refreshing change from all that, and a delight for the serious student of fraternal orders.The author is an academic, and the book is exhaustively researched. This is no mean feat given the lack of public information on fraternal rituals. However, through what was undoubtedly a painstaking data-triangularization process and a good modicum of common sense, he seem to have cut through a lot of the hype.The book focuses on what drove the huge growth in the membership of fraternal orders in the US in the latter half of the 19th Century. Particularly, it takes a look at how mid-century revisions in the rituals of the American Freemasons, Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias and Order of the Red Men fulfilled a need among young men for clear symbols of manhood in a society that eschewed such symbols.In examining the rituals, he culls from the work of historians, cultural anthropologists and psychologists in order to view them in societal context. The veracity of the claims made by the orders is not the issue, although one gets the sense that he does, in fact, reject them.It's not hard to see why he might do so, when you look at the astounding changes the rituals underwent in the 1840s-60s. It becomes rapidly apparent that the ritualists were more focused on providing compelling experiences for their members than on passing on ancient secrets about the bloodline of Christ or the fate of the Druids or whatever the newest ridiculous theory is.Add to that the fact that the book is extremely readable, and you have a work that should be the starting point for anyone studying the rise of fraternal orders in America."},{"Title":"Secret Ritual and Manhood in Victorian America","review":"\\"Secret Ritual and Manhood in Victorian America\\" is an important book that explores the role of masculinity in the creation and popularity of fraternal societies in the nineteenth century. Freemasonry, the Odd Fellows, the Grange, and a host of other \\"secret societies\\" emerged as powerful forces in American society and politics during this period. Of course, the first to do so were the Freemasons, which extended back at least to early modern Europe and numbered among its membership leaders of the American Revolution and a wide range of U.S. Presidents. It even sparked an anti-Masonic political party in the 1820s that argued that a massive conspiracy of Masons was underway to destroy the Republic.This story is well known and has long been a part of the master narrative of the early Republic. Mark C. Carnes does not repeat this in detail, but concentrates on why Masonry, and other ritualistic fraternal organizations, was so popular. Indeed, most adult males seemed to be affiliated with one of another of them during the Victorian era. No doubt they served valuable social functions, as well as provided contacts for business, politics, and other tangible objectives.But Carnes argues in this uniquely convincing book that the popularity of fraternal lodges in the Victorian era were motivated at a rudimentary level by the desire to restore order and to resecure the patriarchal authority lost in the Industrial Revolution and its attendant social upheavals. Status anxiety about the loss of traditional male roles fostered the rise of this organization, and initiation ceremonies helped recapture the male's place in a fast changing society. He asserts that the centrality of women in the home, and their encroachment into a variety of male social and political concerns, prompted the creation of lodges as a haven from women. \\"Fraternal members built temples from which women were excluded,\\" Carnes wrote, \\"devised myriad secrets and threatened members with fearful punishments if they should \`tell their wife the concerns of the order,' and created rituals which reclaimed for themselves the religious authority that formerly reposed in the hands of Biblical patriarchs\\" (p. 79)Carnes finds that efforts to secure traditional gender roles in a society in flux in Jacksonian America resonated with the male population of the nation and led to the attractiveness of these secret fraternities. This was in no small part because of the accelerated change resulting from the Industrial Revolution, as virtually all of the cherished ideals about life and home and family were altered in fundamental ways.This is an important study in gender history and a must read for all who want to understand the rise of fraternal orders in the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"School Nurse's Survival Guide: Ready-To-Use Tips, Techniques & Materials for the School Health Professional","review":"I was looking for a practical guide to school nursing, to helpease my transition from hospital practice to community health.

Second, this is no ordinary chronicle of automotive history. Instead, the author takes the reader on an imaginary journey across America, much of it on historic Route 66, where each car is photographed (beautifully) in a period setting appropriate for the vehicle. The author loves cars and loves photography, and her passion comes through in the book. Much of the text of the book is about the &quot;roadside experience&quot; and the development of auto travel in America rather than detailed technical descriptions of the vintage cars.

For the rest of us there is Lewis's affection for Americana. She shoots a '35 Ford pickup, black with red-rimmed wheels, against the bleakness of Two Guns, Ariz.; a ruby red '59 Cadillac Eldorado convertible in the glitter gulch of Fremont Street in Vegas; and a muscle-car legend, the '64 Pontiac GTO, beneath a towering doughnut sign in L.A.A great gift for car loving guys &amp; gals on Valentine's Day or any day.

Maps of the Shaker West lifts the veil of nostalgia which often surrounds the Shaker experience and we can see the pioneer Shakers of the west as they were with all their strengths and weaknesses; their struggles, failures and successes.In chapter 8 of the book the extent and the depth of the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky comes alive. For those of us with roots in southern Ohio, this chapter can touch home directly. The spiritual choices of Barton Stone, John Dunlevy and Richard McNemar at the turn of the 19th century are still influencing us today as we quickly approach the 21st century. The Restoration Movement (The Christian Church) is still strong and active in southern Ohio and the Society of Shakers continues and their many friends are influenced by their faith and story.Another intriguing line of research is suggested in the book. Some of the land acquisitions made by the Shakers may have been due to their participation in the Underground Railroad. In this endeavor, old religious adversaries joined in common cause: Quakers, Presbyterians, the Christian Church and the Shakers. More study needs to be directed to this line of research.The maps of Dale Covington and the drawings of Richard Spence help bring alive the old Shaker sites, especially those which have been altered beyond recognition. We can feel again the presence of Union Village (Lebanon, Ohio) the seat of the Shaker bishopric of the west, as it nurtured many other villages: Watervliet (Dayton, Ohio), White Water (New Haven, Ohio), North Union (Cleveland, Ohio), Busro (Oaktown, Indiana), Pleasant Hill (Harrodsburg, Kentucky) and South Union, Kentucky. Other lesser known Shaker sites are also discussed in the book.Reading Maps of the Shaker West helps a person to experience the furor of the New Light Revival, the excitement of committing to a radical and tranforming faith, the personal and the financial sacrifices made to become a Shaker, and the excitement of participating in a socially important communal project that would so influence the world. Maps of the Shaker West is a welcomed and insightful resource in the ongoing study of the Shakers."},{"Title":"Maps of the Shaker West: A Journey of Discovery","review":"This book was a real find for me. Having visited 7 of the eastern Shaker villages, I wanted to know more about the remaining Shaker sites in the \\"West\\". There are more than 20 such sites set out in this excellent book. Each has a written explanation and sufficient maps to find and explore all of them. Both the maps and the text are accurate, having been carefully prepared and researched by the 3 authors.The book inspired me to visit Ohio and Kentucky to see the sites. My wife and I were taken around Union Village by Mary Lou Warner, the historian for the Otterbein-Lebanon Community. Martha Boice showed us Whitewater village with her friend Julie Schlesselman. We went to Watervliet, Ohio, then down into Kentucky to the Cane Ridge Meeting House where a camp meeting took place in 1801 as part of the Kentucky Revival. We stayed at Pleasant Hill and then went to South Union. All in all a wonderful experience which would not have happened without this book. I hope to return to the area soon to see the sites I didn't have time to visit.Most of the interest in the Shakers centres on the well preserved eastern villages such as Hancock, Canterbury and the still active village of Sabbathday Lake. However, this misses the western villages which have a charm and interest of their own. There is much to see in Ohio and Kentucky, and for anyone interested in the Shaker experience as a whole visiting the western sites will expand your knowledge and understanding of why the Shakers have lasted for so long. This book will appeal to anyone who is seriously interested in the Shakers - add it to your bookshelf now."},{"Title":"Maps of the Shaker West: A Journey of Discovery","review":"I have just purchased a copy of Maps of the Shaker West: A Journey of Discovery and have been reading it over the past few days.

Secondly, the three of them have provided an invaluable service to the field by uncovering and/or compiling research on the histories of &quot;lost out-families&quot; such as Eagle and Straight Creeks and Shaker-owned properties such as Berrien Springs, Michigan. The prose is clear, accessible, and veritably sparkles. The illustrations are excellent and the maps are a first-rate aid to anyone who wants to pinpoint the people and places that are written about. The book is a pleasure to scholar and layman alike."},{"Title":"Control of Generation and Power Flow on Interconnected Systems","review":"The book arrived within the schedule stated upon order, and the book was in excellent shape.

The puzzle is either too simple and the reader solves it long before the story ends, or the puzzle is too hard and the reader ends up feeling cheated. Finding the right balance is hard, which is why so many mysteries are unreadable, formula-driven hack jobs. Trying to write a good mystery in a science fiction setting is even harder because the background sociology, technology, history, and settings all need to be explained in a way that does not bore the reader to tears, and still allows the story's puzzle to be at the right level. This is a lot harder than it sounds and only a few authors have been able to pull it off.Larry Niven is one of the few. \\"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton\\" is composed ofthree novellas about Gil \\"the Arm\\" Hamilton, a detective operating the 22nd century Los Angeles. The stories are strong and, with the exception of the third story, the characters are believable. All of the clues needed to solve each mystery are in place long before the story ends, but solving the puzzle requires thinking outside the box.The problems with these stories are the same as the problems with most of Niven's pre-Pournelle writings: the writing is bad and the society that he describes is a 1960s version of southern Californian university life transported into the future. It does not feel dated as much as it feels immature. The bad writing, however, is more than made up for by the steady flow of interesting ideas that Niven gives the reader. There are better mysteries, and there is better science fiction, but \\"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton\\" is one of the best fusions of these two genres in print."},{"Title":"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton","review":"Gil &quot;the arm&quot; Hamilton, named so because of his prosthetic arm, and the strange telekinetic ability he has that was developed after he lost his real arm and before the replacement, is a detective for ARM, the United Nations police force. The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton is a few stories of deduction and logic involving weird technologies, monstrous crimes as well as equally monstrous punishments in a world obsessed with staying young at the expense of everyone else. Very cool addendum to the Known Space Series."},{"Title":"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton","review":"I read this book years ago and have ever after searched to find this kind of cleverness.What we have here are locked door mysteries set in the future. An ARM (Amalgamated Regional Militia), the police force of the United Nations, detective named Gil Hamilton solves mysteries that seem unsolvable.The extra added is that Gil , who lost an arm in a space accident was given a new arm, but comes to find that his lost arm is not entirely missing. What he's left with is a telekinetic arm that can sense things and manipulate light objects.Great stuff.The stories are a bit dated but the cleverness shines through.Niven reprised Gil Hamilton in \\"The Woman in Del Rey Crater\\" (1995, Flatlander)) but stated that he will not write any future stories because the locked door scenarios are too difficult to create.I recommend this book all the time hoping that someone will tell me of an author that can top it. So far no one has.But just in case you are better read than my friends - let me know what you think.caslono@yahoo.comcaslo"},{"Title":"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton","review":"I loved this book a lot, but it was far too short, i was expecting a full length novel two hundred or three hundred pages i wish it had been that long becuase the characters and the setting in the book are very unique and the technology very exotic. I love sci fi mysteries and i really hope and pray this genere grows becuase sci fi and mystery were made for each other despite what people say to the contrary. The quality of the writing in this book is somewhat weak but, the interesting plotting, characters, and technology make up for that. The story i really wanted read was the patchwork girl and i was dissapointed to see this story was not included in this collection of short stories. what should have been done to make this book better was to collect all the short stories and put them in this volume why bother just to have three short stories and not include the others? i wish larry niven would have made more hamilton stories the character is like a blend of james bond and the invisible man who has the elements of a hard boiled detective and a secret agent."},{"Title":"The Rise and Decline of the Late Roman Field Army","review":"This book lacks any substance whatsoever.

I've done a through read of this book, and ofNicasie's 'Twilight of Empire' for comparison purposes. It is myconclusion that 'The Rise and Decline of the Late Roman Field Army'really is not worth buying. It contains only 54 pages of text, therest of the book taken up with discussion on references contained ineach of the meagre 6 chapters that comprise the book. There is verylittle discussion on the equipment and arms of the Late Roman army,its tactics and doctrine etc. The research appears to be at timeswoefully out of date. For example, even at the time it was publishedit was known that the division of the Empire between Valentinian I andValens did not create the 'Seniores' and 'Iuniores' division of units,yet Crowell still cites this. It is also apparent that Cromwell maywell have not invested as much time and research as he might of done,possible due to the fact that he must have known that Nicasie was alsodue to have his book published at the same time as his book, whichalso covered the same ground as 'The Rise and Decline of the LateRoman Field Army', only in much greater detail.In conclusion, my advice would be to invest your money in 'Twilight ofEmpire', it's much more upto date research wise, covers the sameground that Cromwell's book does, and contains better and more usefulinformation on the Late Roman army as a whole.If you do insist on buying Cromwell's book, then for god's sake tryand find a copy that is not going to cost you nearly $100!

I've chosen Jan's book for my class text because it is, by a wide margin, the best single book on the Universal Serial Bus I've seen. Jan has the unique talent of talking directly to the user in a very friendly, clear, and easy to read style, while losing absolutely nothing in scope or detail. The chapter on how to coerce Visual Basic into making the Windows API calls necessary to support the USB HID class got me over major hurdles while preparing lecture materials. Instead of the usual kitchen sink approach, Jan zeros in on exactly what you need to know to do the job and covers it completely. And her examples actually work!If you're looking for a book that spans basic USB principles to advanced topics, all clearly explained, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"I purchased this book with the intention of learning how to communicate with USB peripherals from the PC perspective. What I later found after reading this book is that the author is heavily reliant upon 3rd party products to do the work, which simply means you'll need to pay more money for evaluation modules, and more software rather than being able to make the end product yourself. For someone who is at the hobbiest level, this book would be great perhapse, but the ultimate problem is it lets others do the work which IMO defeats the purpose of a book. If I am going to use 3rd party tools, I'll read their documentation-- not pay for a book to tell me what else I need to use.On another note, this book is an EXCELLENT reference book when you need a little refresher about other things, but you can also find this info online"},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"The author does a great job reviewing the details of USB. However, if your intentions are like mine to design some hardware and transfer data from the device to the PC, I think your pretty much out of luck.I understand this is a very hard subject but the author does not include sample drivers that allow you to communicate with a generic part, let alone, helping you develop a driver for your application.I think this book is only good to get a sense only for what USB is and how it works. Unfortunately, blocks diagrams do not solve anyones problem, and knowledge-hungry individuals such as myself find these books rather useless. Buy the book only if you have no clue what USB is, else do not waste your money."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"When it comes to developing USB hardware, there aren't many off-the-shelf-how-to books. This is the only one I am aware of. As a result, it wins by default.Axelson starts by covering the pros and cons of USB, and would be perfect for explaining to a non-technical manager. It covers the USB protocol, and even covers the Cypress USB development kit, which can be used to develop a USB peripheral.Simply stated, this book won't make you a USB genius, but if you are charged with developing a USB device from scratch, it can compress the time required to ramp up. It can save you hours of frustration.Unfortunately, reading this book won't make host (PC) programmers into USB geniuses, but it does explain USB reasonably well."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"With the help of this book, I went from knowing virtually nothing about USB to having a device programmed and communicating with a PC. The book covers everything from what's important to know in the USB specification, to selecting a controller chip for a device, to writing the device firmware and application programs to communicate with the device. About the only area not covered is how to write a Windows device driver (this is probably a book-length topic in itself), but Jan explains why this is often not necessary and describes tools that make the job easier when needed. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"My use of the book was primarily as a second opinion, against which I could check my interpretations of the USBv2.0 specification. In a few instances, this was very useful (i.e., clarifying exactly what is meant by the terms transaction, packet, handshake, etc.).The chapters on the computer software side of USB development serve as a decent introduction to how the Windows OS will interact with your device, but is written at the introductory level. If you already have some experience with Windows programming and still have questions that you want answered, you will likely find these chapters too basic. Also, if you are interested in interfacing with another OS, look elsewhere.All in all, this book serves as a good companion to the USB spec sheets if you are confused about a particular issue, but nothing beats reading the actual spec for yourself."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"This book got me up and running with my PIC 18F4550-based PICDEM FS USB board very quickly.

This is by far the best USB resource that you can get - included with the book is a CD-ROM with Visual C++, Visual Basic and example Tools that you can work with to develop your own USB applications."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"I used information from Axelson's ealier edtion in a project that employed a USB magstripe reader in a Windows application that demanded no operator intervention. This is quite tricky, because HID devices often require that focus be set to a text or edit window -- and this was not possible in my system. The Windows HID interface API data thar Jan provided were vital.This edition adds new information for application programming use the Microsoft Visual Studio (.NET) programming environment, and also details on USB OTG (ON THE GO) which is designed to allow USB communication between \\"client\\" devices -- capability that is missing from non-OTG enabled devices.Anyone with a serious interest in USB needs to have this book on their shelf; they also need to do what I plan to do, that is to take it down and to review it from time to time.The following is what I wrote for USB Complete, 1st Edition, and it still applies. >>>I was sceptical. I no longer am. This book shows you how to get started implementing USB in Windows based programs. Visual Basic may be used on the PC side, and Jan shows examples that do just this. While USB design is usually thought to require C/C++ programming, this isn't necessarily true. Of course, actual design and/or performance requirements may dictate that VB not be used, still it may be a viable way to implement specific USB designs. Jan also shows that USB design involves the firmware that is implemented in the USB hardware itself. She covers these details well."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"Jan's book, USB Complete, is an essential resource to study to gain an understanding of the Universal Serial Bus. The book covers the major topics of general USB operation, as well as the implementation of USB in a Personal Computer host, and the design of USB peripherals. The book should be used as a key development tool to implement a USB design.Jan provides source code examples of interfacing to a USB device, using a slow step-by-step approach to make it easier to grasp the often obscure details of the Windows USB API. The examples are presented simultaneously in Microsoft Visual Basic and Visual C. The examples are not a rehashing of USB API documentation, but a clear presentation of code born from actual development efforts.Frankly there is no single source of USB information presented in a way that is easier to read and comprehend."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"The first sentence of this book is: 'What if you had the chance to design a peripheral interface from scratch.' She goes on to describe a set of idealized criteria that not coincidentally describe the USB interface.Actually I liked the first sentence in the previous edition better, it said: 'Computer hardware doesn't often get a chance to start fresh.'In any case the USB was a chance to start fresh. The PC was started by IBM as part of a crash project. They did a quick and dirty bus. It got expanded into the AT or ISA bus with the PC/AT God knows how many years ago. From this Intel developed the PCI bus.After several revisions (that never took off) Intel/Microsoft/Apple/Motorola and I don't know just how many others finally got together and started fresh with a design for a peripheral interface.The result was the USB. A point Ms. Axelson didn't mention was that the basic interface in the PC was cheap, really cheap. Motherboard manufacturers started including the connector on all their motherboards because the additional cost was something on the order of ten cents.For years we motherboard companies produced motherboards that went into computers that had USB and no one ever used them. Then all of a sudden, there were literally hundreds of millions of computers out there with USB and the peripheral manufacturers detected that a critical mass had been reached and behold, why connect using anything else.The USB interface at neither the basic signal sending hardware level nor the bit diddling software level is simple. But an inexpensive interface chip (because they're now produced in huge volume) and standard software in Windows and Linux and you can implement an interface. It's not the easiest thing in the world to do, but this book explains it in reasonably simple terms. If you're designing your new peripheral, here in one well done book is all that you need.Ms. Axelson starts with the basics about the USB and goes on to explaining how to select a chip (you'll want to look at the manufacturer's offerings as well, they change things a lot), implement it and program it. If it's your job to design the USB for a peripheral of some kind, this is the place to start, hands down, no question about it."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"i've incorporated usb to my applications by using ftdi's royalty-free solution...The chip is a usb-to-serial convertor, appearing as a virtual comport on the pc, OR through the use of direct drivers enables the chip to be recognized as s true usb device. its probably the most painless way to quickly get usb on your device, but FTDI has yet to get their XP drivers digitally signed."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"This isn't the first time I've seen this assumption, but having been on mailing lists with Ms. Axelson, I can tell you Jan is a she, not a he, as the previous overly negative reviewer said. &quot;Complete&quot; comes from the title of a previous book by this author on RS-232.

It's a conversational book with an easy-to-read style and clear examples. What it is intended to do is explain the hardest-to-understand parts of the USB Standard, fill in common problem areas such as host programming, and get you comfortable thinking about the USB structure. It does not contain every nuance of the USB Standard; in fact, the book would be very confusing if it did. This book is more of a companion or guide to the USB documentation. It's like having an experienced friend nearby to explain things to you in order to get over the rough spots, and recommend hardware and programming tactics that worked for them. Using this book, you can very quickly determine what your target application will require, and zero in on the structures you will have to design as well as the relevant portions of the USB Standard. It helps you to actually *understand* the structure of your application, instead of memorizing routines and not knowing how they really work. I used the first version of this book a while back, and the second version is just as good but with more of today's technology.

Ms. Axelson sets the bar very high with the title theme of her books, i.e. \\"Complete\\". Some come closer than others to this laudable goal, but I'm not sure if any of them quite reach that high bar. On a quick look, my biggest issue with this book is that it is Windows-centric. I don't see how you can call it complete without addressing Linux and Mac OSX. If you are only working with the Windows environment, then this is no doubt a very useful reference. If, like me, you only rarely work in the Windows environment, I think this book is still worth having, but keep in mind that you probably won't find anything here to address matters specific to your OS."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"Anyone who is new to USB interface and products should read this book first.

Why? Becasue it is orders of magnitude more complicated. The idea that you will know and understand USB completely by just reading a book of this size is simply laughable.But the complete in the book's title doesn't even really claim to make a USB master out of you anyway: it simply refers to the fact that following the information in this book, you will succeed in building a USB enabled peripheral and access it using VB and device drivers supplied by Windows 98.The book first imparts upon you a basic knowledge of USB and once you are fairly knowledgeable about that, it then ventures to show you how to use commercially available off-the-shelf USB controller chips, available from Cypress and other manufacturers, and how to program them for use in your own USB peripheral.At this stage in your USB career, it would be nearly impossible for you to build a USB enabled peripheral without the help of these USB controllers, since it'll take you at least a year to fully absorb all of USB before you could be in a situation to even attempt doing so. USB is really that complicated my friend, trust me.Using these specialized USB controllers in your design, shields you from the complexities of USB's intricacies and having bypassed them, you can focus on getting the job done i.e. building your USB peripheral.Now, once you have successfully built your first USB enabled peripheral, using USB controllers, as taught to you in this book, you can then take all the time in the world that you need and incrementally learn more and more about USB using for example, a tool like a USB protocol analyzer to really get to know USB intimately, inside and out."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"I would say this book is about 1/4 very general information, 1/4 Windows specific stuff, 1/4 hardware level stuff, and 1/4 USB protocol stuff.

My project resources also included implementation examples supplied by device manufacturers, the industry USB spec and the MSDN library, all essential and available online for free. By comparison, this book was neither complete in the way the spec is complete, nor were implementation discussions useful to the level that free online detailed examples were useful. The more abstract discussions and the technical facts are a repeat of what is available in the spec.Its not possible that a device engineer would make suitable progress if relying solely on this book. The same conclusion would apply for a Windows application engineer. Only after I learned the subject through other means could I place the book's content into context and spot the shortcomings.The author's contributions to public developers forums proves that she is a technical subject master, so I'm guessing that this product was created and managed by the publisher and targets the technical manager.

I should have bought this book months ago.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"This is very good introductory book on USB for embedded devices. It provides a good overview including a brief comparison of USB with other devices. Admittedly the term complete is a bit of an overstatement; if your going to program own Window's drivers you're going to need a lot more information than is provided here. However, for small-run embedded developers and hobbyist this book is ideal. It is up-to-date and provides a the information you need to consider before jumping into USB development. One of the other reviewers complained that this book spends a lot of time on third-party products. However, for those of us that are grudgingly porting hardware from RS232 to USB this very helpful and very important. Yes all of this information is on the web; but much of it is misleading. For example; a lot of people start with and HID (human interface device) as it does not require a special Windows driver. The online documentation for our developement system gave the data transfer rate as 1.5Mega baud. However, reading this book you find that your likely only to get a fraction of this speed and the guaranteed transfer rate is only 800 bytes per second which is positively glacial.The USB interface is very complex. One of the major issues is that anything you develop will likely require drivers for both the PC and the device. In choosing a vendor is probably more dependent on the quality of the drivers and the quality of the documentation of the drivers than on the hardware itself."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"USB has emerged as a very useful standard for compact peripherals for the personal computer.

In a much more readable style than the official documentation. Axelson writes for electrical engineers more than programmers. Who might need to know more about the controller's requests and how the host communicates with the gadget, using a layered driver model. He thoughtfully includes a chapter on testing and debugging.

I would however, encourage the author to update the book ASAP to cover the new requirmensts in the recently released USB2.0 specification"},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"Axelson gives about the widest-ranging introduction to USB that I can imagine. Large parts of it explain the standard, from the electrical level on up. If you've ever tried to use the specification document from a standard as your introduction, you'll appreciate the extra clarity and reduced clutter of this presentation. Although it covers everything of interest to the implementer at the circuit or embedded processor level, it skips minutiae like the mechanical drawings that specify the exact shape of each plug and receptacle (important stuff, just not important to most people). And, although USB 3.0 products are only just starting to hit the streets as of this writing, he does an equally good job with the very different implementation of the multi-gigabit supers-speed protocol.Axelson goes beyond just the standard. He also names a number of microprocessors and other hardware gadgets with built-in support for some subset of USB's wide range of capabilities. He also covers the arcana of Microsoft's USB-related APIs. Perhaps there isn't enough Windows information to write a real app using only this source - there's still plenty to get the reader oriented and ready to go into the detail that other sources provide.Despite all the good in it, I found a few maddening flaws in this book. The biggest, and one that repeats frequently, is its tendency to use terms that have not (or not yet) been defined. OK, that has to happen at least some times when different parts of the standard depend on each other, but the index wasn't strong enough to help me find all of the mysterious terms' definitions. It's certainly a good reference for the deeply technical reader, and helps make sense of the standard (which is freely available). With just a bit more work, it could have been an outstanding reference.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"I teach a USB class, so I've had occasion to review every book on the subject.

Jan has the unique talent of talking directly to the user in a very friendly, clear, and easy to read style, while losing absolutely nothing in scope or detail. The chapter on how to coerce Visual Basic into making the Windows API calls necessary to support the USB HID class got me over major hurdles while preparing lecture materials. Instead of the usual kitchen sink approach, Jan zeros in on exactly what you need to know to do the job and covers it completely. And her examples actually work!If you're looking for a book that spans basic USB principles to advanced topics, all clearly explained, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"This is an excellent tutorial and reference with detailed coverage of all aspects of USB. It is well-organized and very readable, so it makes a good tutorial. It also has a great index to serve as a reference. What more can I say. I am not doing USB 3.0 \\"SuperSpeed\\", so I can't evaluate, but it has significant coverage of USB 3.0 in every section.It does not provide line-by-line \\"how to\\" example code, about which some reviewers complain. Any competent programmer will find this book a great complement to the usually-sparse documentation of specific USB driver libraries and USB stack APIs, and together with them will have no trouble implementing USB. The book could better serve novice programmers by including some line-by-line example code for a specific library or device stack. I did not find this lack to be a hindrance in any way.This books is focused on understanding USB, its organization, enumeration, transactions, etc., in significant detail. It includes significant detail on all of the primary and many of the secondary standard USB \\"Classes\\" (though the book doesn't focus on \\"Classes\\"). Those details tilt a bit more toward the device (embedded) side where that information is more applicable, than to the host side programming where most of the low-level implementation detail is hidden in stack and driver library implementations with which most programmers don't need get into that level of detail. It has an entire chapter dedicated to \\"Chip Choices\\", factors to consider in chip selection, and several pages each on Microchip, Cypress, and ARM USB-capable microcontrollers; and on ST-NXP Wireless, PLX Technologies, and FTDI USB controller interface chips. It also has host-related chapters on \\"Host Communications\\" (layers, drivers, etc.), \\"Matching Drivers to Devices\\", and \\"Detecting Devices\\".In summary, I've been programming professionally at all levels for over 40 years, but have never written any USB-related software until now. This book provided me all of the information I needed to implement custom software interacting with USB at all levels and transaction types from the host using a popular driver library (libusb), and to assist in the definition and implementation of custom embedded code for an ARM-based compound device. It does not, however, tell you line-by-line how to use any particular USB library or stack API."},{"Title":"USB Complete: Everything You Need to Develop Custom USB Peripherals","review":"These book is USB bible.Can only strong recomend.

David Arnold's Spying from Space focuses on the command and control (C2) system set up for the CORONA satellite reconnaissance program in the 1960s and deals significantly with much its early history. I am pleased to recommend this book by David Arnold, an Air Force officer with a Ph.D. in history from Auburn University and a colleague in the small community of historians interested in spaceflight.Arnold focuses his attention on the development and operations of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). The network originated in the latter 1950s and 1960s to serve the national security apparatus of the cold war. Managed from its control center at Sunnyvale, California, and at other \\"undisclosed locations\\" throughout the decades its operators oversaw the systems necessary to gather satellite reconnaissance data. No doubt, the ability to see what the Soviet Union was doing, and the counter-capability of the Soviets to see what the United States was up to, helped in ways still not fully understandable to keep the cold war from becoming a hot one. At least military decisions were made on the basis of \\"real\\" data rather than supposition!Arnold begins with the efforts of the Department of Defense in the 1950s to expand capabilities into space. At first this included the development of missile technology for the delivery of nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union, but quickly the ability to fly reconnaissance satellites required additional research and development (R&D;). He traces the evolution of this system since its first development.This is a very fine book, one that should be on the shelf of anyone who seeks to understand the development of the U.S. military in space."},{"Title":"SPYING FROM SPACE (Centennial of Flight Series)","review":"Very good and accurate book.

Even the approximately $50 pricetag didn't seem too much to pay for what I thought I was getting. I was a bit disappointed when I did receive the book, but after re-examining the text, I found it did have its merits.First of all - it is not a 'highly-charged' read about the U.S. Air Force's space surveillance capabilities. It is a systems engineering book about the contractors and Bluesuiters that built the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). Granted, it does have its interesting ancedotes and even General LeMay makes an appearance in one. But it seemed the information presented may have been easier to digest in a chronologically tabulated format (i.e. year - event).I wanted stories of design and operations of the AFSCN and its control node, the Satellite Control Facility or 'Blue Cube' in California, from its inception to present day. There are a couple images of the SCF from the early days, but no outer images from the later years (even passing motorists on Highway 101 can get better images). To add insult to injury, there isn't even a AFSCF logo printed on the photo pages.I am a realist and unfortunately also a space professional, and I understand that contracting decisions and conversations from 40 years ago do have relevance on today's systems. For the life of me, I cannot figure out who this book was aimed at - systems engineers, space professionals or just the author's Ph.D board? But the least the author could have done was NOT set us adventurers up for failure by including the \\"Spying from Space\\" in the title.Borrow this book (or buy ONLY after reviewing it at a library) if you need 'brownie points' for your required CSP hours or for your \\"Crew-of-the-Quarter\\" or \\"CGO-of-the-Quarter\\" package."},{"Title":"The Buddhist conquest of China: The spread and adaptation of Buddhism in early medieval China.

This current reprint is as useful as ever in its analysis of early Buddhism in China. It also builds on previous research and shows how prior theories such Liang Qichao's theory of Buddhism being disseminated from the south, through the maritime ports is no longer tenable.The book makes good use of the textual analysis and also balances it with a good understanding and depiction of the historical period and the political events that characterized each period, which helps place the Buddhism in context as one can start to get lost in the large number of monks and their translations. The part on the period of the three kingdoms was especially good, with the author dealing with each kingdom in turn, and this shed additional light on some of the characters that one may have been acquainted with from the romance of the three kingdom novels - like Cao Cao and Sun Quan and the Sima family.The book is also very useful in that it includes the Chinese characters for all the names and difficult concepts within the text, unlike some books where you have to flip backwards and forwards to a glossary at the back of the book."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"I am a big stones fan , and Keith Richards fan.

Victor Bockris' study of one of the most important icons of the 1960's unfortunately falls far short of what I've come to expect.The book reads like a lazy retread of thirty years of news clippings and has very little insight into what actually made the Stones become the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. He's good at knitting together a constant series of quotes and old interviews into a below average narrative but seems to be unable to actually have any real understanding of the people behind the words.With less than a quarter of the book dedicated to the years when the Stones actually had some validity and almost half of it dedicated to the incredibly tedious 'heroin' years Bockris misses the whole point of why a book about Keith Richards should be written. One unproductive junkie is just like any other and I don't need nearly two hundred repetitive pages to get the message. As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, the author seems to have an unnatural admiration of Keith's heroin addiction and completely fails to comment on the fact that it neatly coincides with the band's rapid creative decline.I can only hope that the next four hundred page book on one of popular music's most influential guitar players will have three hundred of them covering the period of 1964 to 1971 with the remainder dealing with the following thirty six years when the Rolling Sones simply ceased to have any relevance."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"\\"You've got the sun, you've got the moon, and you've got the Rolling Stones\\".

In this regard, while its true that a lot of the content already exists elsewhere, the unfolding story is well presented with appropriate quotes from contemporaries to back up the authors point of view along the way. The book draws you into a world of drugs, women, touring, drugs, breaking up, and more drugs! Mick Jagger comes out looking less that rosy, with a number of clipped quotes and responses, and Charlie Watts is barely mentioned throughout, which is odd for a founder member of the Stones! That aside, its a worthwhile read and you come away understanding the tortured nature of Keith and other musicians of his ilk.Originally published in 1992, the digital edition includes a 2002 update from the author, reviewing the previous decade and drawing on their mammoth tours of the 1990s. That's a worthwhile inclusion, given that this was the period where the Stones moved from mere stadium fillers to a corporate behemoth.

As hard as life can be, even being a herion addict, he can joke about his drug use and make the reader laugh. As much as I oppose using drugs, I admire Keith Richards as a musician and as seemingly honest,funny caring man who has outlasted many others in his profession. This book tells the story of a man who comes from &quot;good stock&quot; and I am sure you will enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"This is a great book that explores Keith Richards extraordinary body of work. Although I have been a major Stones fan since 1964 I learned a great deal about the history and dynamics of the Stones. Keith is a tremendously gifted individual and I found it fascinating to read about his difficulties with Mick Jagger and his strong belief that the Stones must stay true to their musical roots."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"Great account of Keith's entire life as told by the man himself. The book gives a vivid account of Keith's musical beginnings, development and maturation as a musician and songwriter. Discusses his many musical influences, relationships with women, highs and lows with the stones and his 10+ year battles with heroin. The guy lives and breathes music 24/7, he is non-stop. By the end of the book I got a profound sense of someone who is a truly dedicated musician. It leaves no doubt why he has become a musical influence himself. You will not be disappointed with this book. A job very well done."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"This book is the definitive biography of the greatest rock guitarist/philosopher of all time. Bockris, as usual, is sensitive, brilliant, and insightful in dealing with one of the most mysterious musicians to ever play rock, Keith Richards. Because the book probes not only his public life but also his private life, this book is as close as most people will ever get to understanding rock and roll's greatest enigma. Essential reading for Keef junkies (and I choose my words carefully!)."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"Entertaining and interesting look at one of the few &quot;legends&quot; that are one, for real, and two, still living. Richard's childhood, family, musical background, habits, drug excursions, and idiosyncrasies are described and explained by Bockris in a way, that makes ya love Keith Richards for the person he is, both musically and personally. Keith can play piano ballads from from 1930s by heart, in addition to being the foundation of the Stones sound, which is exemplified by his solo work and stints with &quot;The Expensive Winos.&quot; I loved what Keith preferred for breakfast, as well as his food sauce that he had flown to many parts of the world where he toured. And, the Doctor says he's healthy. Richards doesn't appear to live the life of an accomplished rebel, he just lives life the way he wants to, regardless. Few can attest to that. So far he hasn't apologized for anything--and I hope he never does."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"Like a swinging Keith Richards riff on top of the powerful backbeat of Charlie Watts's &quot;Engine Room&quot; I tore through this book so fast the pages were almost burning in my hands. I couldn't put the book down or stop reading it. Bockris proves with this biography that Keith Richards truly IS the ultimate rock n' roll icon through his inimitable, rhythmically driven style, attention to what makes music &quot;swing&quot; (something multiple modern artists have discarded) and an incredible presence that oozes off the pages. While Bockris backs his book up with the dialogues of those who knew Keef, these accounts often seem contradictory-- perhaps shedding some light on the paradox that is legend. Either way-- a must for all Richards apprentices, Rock afficinados and anyone who wants to learn a thing or two about how to feel their pulse more effectively..."},{"Title":"Keith Richards: The Biography","review":"Bockris paints a delightfully interesting portrait of the rock legend. I never truly knew just how great an impact Keith Richards has had on rock and roll. Very well written with a clear theme: Richards was a rebel, a true original who played by his own rules. Whether it be the drugs, relationships, or the band; Richards had a unique passion towards life that has made him a legend."},{"Title":"A North Carolina Christmas","review":"This beautiful book is full of the sights (and smells) of North Carolina.

The photos are beautiful, the recipes yummy, and the stories bring back many happy Christmas memories. My family and friends had fun looking at the pictures and saying &quot;I've been there.&quot;"},{"Title":"Southern Families at War: Loyalty and Conflict in the Civil War South","review":"This well-written collection of twelve chronicles of southern families during the Civil War is worth reading. It provides rarely reviewed images of the struggles of Southern women trying to salvage what remained of family life while their husbands were at war. Daniel Stowell's presentation of \\"A Family of Women and Children\\" was especially valuable, providing images of a \\"temporary\\" female head of household trying to cope with family and slaveholder responsibilities. Judith Hunt's description (The Middleton Family's Civil War) of the 1865 crypt desecration and remains abuse of prominent white plantation owners by newly freed slaves was chilling and a Civil War reality often ignored.Interesting reading although the generalized findings of some authors are questionable based on the limited amount of original materials used to support their research."},{"Title":"Captain Red","review":"I read Russell Goldbaum's novel, &quot;Captain Red&quot; with more than average anticipation. The book is about an unforgettable character who is bigger than life. Red's life and adventures chronicle a time when young men could dream and become their dreams. While based on a real life person, the author has managed to give him a larger than life persona. The reader will be fascinated by the adventures of Captain Red and will be given an insight into the fledgling beginning of the helicopter era. The last time I had this much fun was when I read Huckleberry Finn!Bob Papaioanou"},{"Title":"Captain Red","review":"This is one of the few times when I, as the author of nine published novels, can say I wish I had written this one. So when I say I &quot;could not put it down,&quot; I say this literally. The author denied me sleep, one night until nearly dawn, the next night until I reached the last page -- which I reached with regret because I wanted more. I found it at once a story of humanity and man's insatiable desire to better himself. The story of the pioneering helicopter flights were especially gripping, but equally gratifying is the story of the protagonist himself, the unforgettable, irrepressible Captain Red. Read it, you will not be sorry!"},{"Title":"Water Vapor Measurement: Methods and Instrumentation","review":"This book is of no interest to the general public. However, for engineers, scientists, and others who face the challenge of understanding and measuring water vapor, this book is a unique resource. Pieter goes beyond the basic information found in most technical handbooks. He includes practical information on instrumentation and a variety of real-world applications, as well as thorough description of water vapor physics."},{"Title":"Romanized English-Japanese dictionary","review":"I bought this dictionary because I wanted to improve my vocabulary and look up words on the go. I couldn't read Japanese, so of course I bought this romanized dictionary. It was a mistake. When I looked up an English word, there were too many possible Japanese words to choose from. After trying to use them, and my audience not understanding them, I showed them the book. More often than not, poth parties became more confused than before.Here's the solution: buy a dictionary that uses kanji. Every kanji character has a meaning, and all Japanese people can read the 2000 or so basic kanji that are likely to be in the word you looked up. If you buy a good dictionary, like Kodansha's Furigana dictionary, the kanji's pronunciation (hiragana) will be displayed over each kanji character. This makes the dictionary usable by beginners.If you can't read hiragana, I suggest you learn. Don't waste your money on a book that you'll stop using as soon as you learn hiragana, which should be within the first month of studying Japanese."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Using humor, love letters, essays, poetic language, and Marxist/Leftist rhetoric Eldridge Cleaver's \\"Soul on Ice\\" creatively outlines a perspective from which the 1960s might best be approached: \\"the smell of anger, tear gas, and the sound of skull-cracking billy clubs, helicopters, and revolution is present in its pages\\". \\"Soul on Ice\\" is a classic whose achievements are manifold. Here are three of the strongest:1) In 1992, when Malcolm X was being transformed into a fashion accessory/popular culture icon and the black influence on the cultural politics of the 1960s whitewashed, the reissue of Cleaver's book reminded us that \\"what was great was not Malcolm X but the truth he uttered\\" and that the survival of black genius is crucial to the good mental health of white America.2) Inasmuch as the 1960s of the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement was about closing ranks -among other things- \\"Soul on Ice\\" did not support any dysfunctional black unity, which explains its challenge of author James Baldwin's unconstructive and unfair criticisms of writer Richard Wright and Negritude advocate Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire.3) Useful condemnations of slavery's racist (re) presentation of black/American sexual politics (subtle or blatant) can be found in the pages of Cleaver's book; it anticipated much of the contemporary scholarship intervening in part or wholly in this domain: Ed Guerrero's \\"Framing Blackness\\", Mike Marqusee's \\"Redemption Song\\", and Spike Lee's cultural politics and cinema.Cleaver had his soul on ice but managed to produce this brilliant collection of essays. As readers we must, in turn, freeze \\"Soul on Ice\\" in the 1960s fridge; let us consume it 1960s-frozen for therein lies its Twist(ed)-Hula-Hoop(ed) richness. The author of \\"Soul on Ice\\" was no prophet, just an intelligent angry young black man who wrote under duress during an era when it was very difficult for his people to free their psyches from subjugation to the point where they could \\"say it loud: I am black and I am proud!\\"."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"The overall effect of the book was one of an eye opening experience where I was able to crawl inside the mind of a Black revoltuionary. The fact that this man was an American and not a part of a revolutionary force somewhere in the Uganda showd me that the crystal clean superficial of what we call America does not always have the same tint when we strip it down to its roots, with the oppressed. I wanted to read more about the author himself rather than read his highlt intelletual essays and for that reason, it took a great deal out of me to pick up the book after bringing myself to conclude one previous chapter. Not completely agreeable were some of the essays but at least they provided me with a new and often militant outlook on the situation that encased America for years. Cleaver opened my eyes and ears to an experience that will often be attempted to be left behind, but as long as the word is out, it will never die. &quot;Stay Strong!&quot;"},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"This is a lively, entertaining work. Cleaver never seems to lose sight of the fact he needs to entertain his audience, or sell books (or his ideas). Near the end Cleaver develops his own sexual philosophy of sorts and fleshes it out with a bit of detail.In the 1992 preface Ishmael Reed writes, \\"(although Cleaver criticized writer James Baldwin) it is obvious that Soul on Ice is influenced by Baldwin's flamboyantly eloquent taxidermist's style\\". It's said Soul on Ice is a classic and influential work. . . When I read this I wondered if what I write has been influenced by Cleaver. That is, I wonder if I've been influenced by those who've read and imitated Cleaver. I've come back to this review and given it 4 stars instead of 3. It's worthy of the 4 stars I just can't myself agree with the message. At times Cleaver makes a profound statement hidden simply inside half a sentence and then moves on to something else in the wink of an eye without following up or expounding upon the apparent revelation.In the middle of the book he writes, a bit facetiously, \\"all red-blooded Americans who love TV and gentle toilet tisue know that the negro revolution was conceived in Moscow (scratch Moscow, insert Peking) and launched by left-wing fanatics, and that the growing mass movement in opposition to Americans war in Vietnam is \\"communist inspired, manipulated and controlled\\"'.When I read that I thought it was one of the best things I've ever read. Looking back over it, I noticed 'toilet tisue' is misspelled. For a moment I thought I discovered a typo but most likely Cleaver misspells the word on purpose for effect.Overall there's a conciliatory or hopeful tone to the work. He seemed to see the white youth of America as ready and willing to change. Elvis and the Beatles were not going to corrupt white youth but liberate them. On the inside Jacket Cover, Media and Methods, writes, \\"this book is a black man's spiritual odyssey away from hate and crime towards understanding and 'convalescence'. Best Sellers writes \\"Cleaver is not simply a zealot or reactionary. . . He moves through Soul on Ice with a hunger to reaffirm his existence, sometimes in anger, sometimes with abundant pride, but the need is there to speak out, to comment, to seek truth\\". I have to disagree with that very last idea.Soul on Ice is divided into four parts. In part one, Letters from Prison, Cleaver talks a little bit about prison life and his previous experiences being a member of the Nation of Islam. At the end of part one there's a subchapter titled \\"initial reactions on the assassination of Malcolm X (Cleaver was ex-nation of islam but not yet a Panther when he wrote this book, I believe)\\". Of his pre-prison life, He writes, \\"I became a rapist. . . rape was an insurrectionary act (against white male domination or whatever)\\". Summing up his fall from grace, he writes, \\"After I returned to prison, I took a long look at myself and, for the first time in my life, admitted that I was wrong, that I had gone astray -- not so much from the white man's law as from being human, civilized\\". For the most part, though, he doesn't talk about his past \\"crimes\\".Part two, Blood of the Beast, is about the white race and it's heroes, and the heroes of the black race, Muhammad Ali for one. Cleaver suggests that a previous champ, the black Floyd Patterson, was the white man's hero, \\"There is no doubt that white America will accept a black champion, applaud and reward him, as long as there is no \\"white hope\\" in sight. But what white America demands in her black champions is a brilliant, powerful body and a dull, bestial mind--a tiger in the ring and a pussycat outside the ring\\".Part three, the aptly titled? 'Prelude to Love', is simply a short love letter to his Lawyer, and her reply. The love letter was so mushy and flowery even I had to pull back from the passage, thinking, 'come-on now'. Then Cleaver writes, \\"NOW TURN THE RECORD OVER AND PLAY THE OTHER SIDE\\" and proceeds to contradict every thing he's just written - a warning perhaps or a reality check? We love it when you keep it real. \\"I have tried to mislead you. I am not humble at all. I have no humility and I do not fear you in the least. If I pretend to be shy, if I appear to hesitate, it is only a sham to deceive. . . I had planned to run for President of the United States. My slogan? PUT A BLACK FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR TRIGGER. 400 years of docility, of being calm, cool and collected under stress would prove I was the man for the job. . . then came Watts!. . . Most Emphatically Yours, Eldridge Cleaver\\".The beginning of part four (titled White Woman, Black Man) is the best part of the book. It's basically a recounting of a speech given by an elderly black prisoner in the mess hall who sits down to eat with him and two brothers from the Nation. They refer to the old man as 'Lazarus' and 'the infidel' and 'the interloper' and 'the accused', as he tells his story, \\"we had him written down as an Uncle Tom - not that we had ever seen him buck dancing or licking the white man's boots, but we knew that black rebels his age do not walk the streets in America: they were either dead, in prison, or in exile in another country (I should note that the black man they are allegedly talking to is in prison with them)\\". The old man explains why he thinks black men want white woman. It sounds a bit like the story told in the movie \\"Jungle Fever\\". Cleaver expands upon this in the next sub-chapter of White Woman, Black Man, called 'the primeval Mitosis'. He calls black men 'Supermasculine menials' and white men, 'Omnipotent administrators'. Black women, 'self-reliant Amazons' and white women, 'Ultra Feminines' He says we're each striving to achieve a 'unitary sexual image' we're drawn towards each other, basically. It's quite interesting, but I don't think I believe all of it.The final subchapter of White Woman, Black Man, the very end, he dedicates, \\"to all black women, from all black men\\".The blueprint is laid out here in Soul on Ice. . . He calls on black women to remain faithful to black men while black men are being 'oppressed' by their need to sleep with white women. Soul on Ice is not so out of date. . . at Duke University recently the campuses was up in arms (about the patterns of abuse evident in the lacrosse player scandal) reiterating these very issues of oppression."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"I read this in the fall of 1969 and was struck then by the essay dedicated to James Baldwin and sexual orientation, particularly by the term \\"ghost\\" in reference to male homosexuals. Cleaver's comments are acute and, in a certain sense, prescient and prophetic. This work is about much more than black frustration and rage (remember the violent riots of the 60's) and for Americans who are interested in the past, in order to comprehend better the present and anticipate the future, this is good reading, much better than the bestseller pulp out there."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Mr. Cleaver seems to have been a very conflicted man. In this book he discusses his predicaments in his life and how he feels he came about them. He discusses his imprisonment, his life thereof and how he ended up there. He also shares his ideas on everything from corrupt government to his feelings about his convicted rapings of white women. I don't always agree with some of his views but they are very powerful nonetheless. If you are at all interested in the writings of Mr. Cleaver and have not read this book, I highly suggest that you do. To better understand his mindset. A very interesting book."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"racism is still alive and well in the USA, despite surface gains by some people of color. this book goes into a theory for black/white tensions: the primeval mitosis, when humanity split into male/female, black/white, etc. and our dichotimies became external rather than held within each human. eldridge has some very serious ideas about why our gender roles are lined up with &quot;race,&quot; and how the Body and Mind have become province to certain ethnicities. to heal our world, all humans must become whole: Mind, Body merging instead of blacks being all Body &quot;supermasculine menials&quot; and whites being &quot;omnipotentent administrators.&quot; eldridge's glance into inter-racial love are interesting, if not at times confusing since he fell in love with his own (white) lawyer. eldridge's writing is strong and his prose is evocative. i think the best essay in this book is the one on primeval motosis, where he lays out his theory on tensions between the races. but all of them are excellent, especially when cleaver examines the vietnam war and wars against colonionalism the world over and links colonial/liberation struggles to the struggle for equality in the US! deep stuff, seeing as how &quot;liberation&quot; has been &quot;won&quot; because all nations, no matter how squalid and repressed, have the honor of participating in capitalism (aka globalism). blacks and other oppressed people in the USA have also bought into the switcheroo. read cleaver and see that many of the issues happening in the late 60s have not been resolved.another thing i often found myself thinking: for a man who was incarcerated, and before the advent of the internet, cleaver must have put in so much effort to get the political/social information he did. even prison can not hold the mind/thoughts of someone who will reach out despite constraints."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Was a very good \\"read\\" , until the last 2 chapters..........I can't put into words why I write this , but the rest of the book was excellent , showing a very complex man , troubled while he wrote , in love , in hate , in patriotic tones , in slander , in lust , in life.........in fact I have to look up the rest of Mr. Cleavers life , I HAVE to know how it \\"ends\\".........Don \\"G\\""},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"As a college student, I chose this book due to my interest in history. It relates to that and much more. The black man's struggle with trying to find an identity in a white society which continues to ignore it. How the prison system oppresses rather than empowers. This book paved the way for the Black Panthers and a better understanding of the civil rights movement. Even though Cleaver is angry and hateful, he is an intelligent and observant writer.

He was possessed of a rich, raw eloquence and the ability to manipulate profanity as a form of punctuation. Cleaver epitomized a form of thought leadership manifesting itself in this whirlwind period of Black radicalism which had wrestled ideological dominance back from the sanitized presentation of the centrist Black clergy and political class. Its orientation was towards a grassroots fusion of street knowledge with a rediscovered deep leftist political ideology. An ideology which had flourished in the Black community throughout the Harlem Renaissance only to be subverted by the Great Depression, Red Scare nativism and individual economic gain. This fusion, while possessed of the noble aim to draw urban youth in from exile to be politically engaged, was also lacking the long view which renews political ties with a progressive past in order to build upon prior knowledge instead of duplicating present effort.This latest reading finds my views matured in their acknowledgement of the profound sociopathy inherent in Cleaver's description of exploring rape as an insurrectionist act (\\"On Becoming\\"). Where once existed an intellectual curiosity to understand the psychology, I can now experience only the utmost antipathy as he outlines refining his technique by practicing on Black girls before crossing over to white. The brisk logic of his confession no longer strikes the necessary emotional tone which would convince me of his empathy for the victims. He seems certain of his rationale, but unable to discern any true fault in his decision which factors into the literary construct he builds throughout the text. In prison studies, he was able to master a militant discourse made routine by the cultural fluctuations of the time. This proficiency was juxtaposed against a narcissistic indulgence in his own opinion which was nearer to didacticism than dialogue often leading to conflict between his rhetoric and action. As one of the beneficiaries of a cult of personality in which the white counterculture emphasized a revolutionary narrative above the continuous resistance required to overturn an oppressive system, his writings would be widely circulated in the political magazine Ramparts garnering support for his release. This support was forthcoming even as his sole contribution to social transformation consisted of a series of strident political dispatches and dexterity in prison debate.In further inspecting his trajectory from fiery American iconoclast to conservative ideologue, his longstanding admiration of Malcolm throughout the text peaking in the essay \\"Initial Reactions on the Assassination of Malcolm X\\" returns to haunt him. Malcolm had rooted himself in the organizational hierarchy of the Nation of Islam only to be rebuked for expressing an opinion not conforming with the established guideline. His analysis that the program espoused by Elijah Muhammad was ineffective did not lead him to conclude that the American experience held any greater virtue by contrast. Cleaver adopted precisely the opposite position upon his return from exile surmising that because communism as it was practiced in Cuba, Algeria and North Vietnam was injurious to members of its population, capitalism must be the only socioeconomic construct capable of producing a just and democratic society. In a telling line from the text about coming to atheism in his early years in prison, Cleaver writes \\"Unsophisticated and not based on any philosophical rationale, our atheism was pragmatic.\\" The conclusions drawn by Cleaver from his expatriation fostered an inability to launch any deeper inquiry into the nature of American society beyond the dichotomy of America and its antithesis hindering any evolution from his nascent pragmatism. His later life reflected an unprincipled commitment to a multitude of complementary and contradictory causes. Thus he returns once to the arms of the Republican party, another time to evangelical Christianity, again to the Unification Church and later to his own personal synthesis philosophy, Chrislam, searching for a place to belong, but never elucidating a single point of focus as succinctly as Malcolm.Cleaver's most egregious criticism in \\"Soul On Ice\\" is reserved for James Baldwin (\\"Notes on a Native Son\\") whose work he alleges exhibits \\"...the most grueling, agonizing, total hatred of the blacks, particularly of himself, and the most shameful, fanatical, fawning, sycophantic love of the whites that one can find in the writings of any black American writer of note in our time.\\" Cleaver goes far beyond mere literary critique in order to advance a vicious personal vendetta founded not on any principled disagreement with those critical insights raised in the writings of Baldwin, but on his distaste for the homosexual lifestyle. Cleaver presents the following three points as evidence of Baldwin's racial disdain: the dismissal of Norman Mailer's premise in \\"The White Negro\\", an alleged snub of Aime Cesaire in the report from the Conference of Black Writers and Artists in Paris of 1956 and the censure of Baldwin's mentor Richard Wright in the opening essay of \\"Notes of a Native Son\\" which disassembled Bigger Thomas as a Negro stereotype. Cleaver fails to build his case against Baldwin on any intellectual basis using those three points and peppers the remainder of the essay with a variety of ad hominem attacks against Baldwin's Blackness, sexuality, masculinity and sincerity. Here we discover the young Cleaver in critical collapse for his arguments become incoherent. As with his sexual victimization of women, he seems unable to confront his deep seated issues of misogyny and masculinity choosing instead to assert his literary domination over the political direction of the Black community while framing the world to conform with his vacillating conviction.At the outset of this review, I had every intent eviscerate of any further need to study this text in earnest. When I first entered organizational activism, my admiration of Cleaver was once so great that I took his title of Minister of Information as my own and sought to exhibit as firm a grasp as Cleaver of the political micro and macrocosm occurring about me. My initial desire was to exorcise the part of me that once accepted the gorgeous rhetoric displayed here so uncritically. Upon further contemplation, I have come to understand that it is necessary to retain Cleaver as a picture of fanatical naivete which encircles both his participation and our own. The fluctuations which he exhibits should remind us to never locate the success of our radical endeavors so far outside of ourselves. Cleaver's vision of a successful socialist revolution was located in Algeria, Cuba, Korea and each of the other places he was able to experience in exile. When combined with a mostly self absorbed radicalization and the crushing defeat suffered by the Panthers at home, his appetite for resistance was left fatally injured upon his return. He now resembled a character from Soul On Ice described as an \\"Old Lazarus\\" (\\"The Allegory Of The Black Eunuchs\\") whom Cleaver and some fellow inmates confronted for not being dead and accused of lacking the dedication to offer his life to the struggle for Black liberation. Cleaver exhibits here another momentary lapse in the certainty of his masculinity as he reaches down to examine himself \\"afraid that my rod would be missing\\". The pseudo-mythology from the conversation with the \\"Old Lazarus\\" is then used to formulate the bizarre thesis of \\"The Primeval Mitosis\\". This essay is presented in so a compelling fashion that such terms as \\"omnipotent administrator\\" would work their way into a broad array of Black Panther literature including the writings of Huey P. Newton. One of Cleaver's own narratives again returns to haunt him as a new generation found itself prepared to pummel him with the same question \\"Old Lazarus, why come you're not dead?\\" His answer appeared as a jumble of changes and permutations with no discernible objective to be found even in his writings and speeches taken together.After a fresh reading of \\"Soul On Ice\\", I am cautious to consider if I have judged Cleaver too harshly solely on the basis of this extreme transformation following exile. If the author of memoir and essay is to be judged by the philosophy he espouses in textual form, he must be bound for worse or better effect that those words form ideas remaining attached to his personal actions and are affected by each new transition. While Malcolm's activism gave him a wider lens through which to dissect and offer criticism to the internal socio-poltical mechanisms of America, Cleaver opened his eyes and seemed content to return to squinting through the eyelids once more. \\"Soul On Ice\\" appears now as a series of malformed ideas and incomplete analyses of a proto-revolutionary which is sufficient to get the wheels stirring in the minds of those who would study history to extract the lessons left behind, but not fruitful enough to sustain a growing consciousness or fortify one's personal philosophy. There are thinkers with a wider and more consistent body of work who can occupy that role with greater adequacy whose attractive language is not merely a vehicle for speculating upon perverse ideas."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Eldridge Cleaver wrote this book with an incredible sense of description of what being African,African-American is and means. He walks you through his exeperiences with honesty and he is not afraid of exposing his weaknesses. Here is somebody who definitely left a mark in African, African-American litterature. 'Soul on Ice' is a must-read."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Soul On Ice is a very good book to read. Various sections of the texts were underlined, but the book was purchased in a used condition. I was very satisfied with my purchase."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"This is absolutely one of the the most overrated books of all time. Soul on Ice is a collection of outdated essays, along with a few love letters to his attorney written while Cleaver was serving time for being a serial rapist. Cleaver shows a poor understanding of the political workings of the elites, the reasons why many middle and working class whites are \\"racists\\", and virtually every other thing he opens his mouth on with one major exception. His observations about the disturbing mental and sexual pathologies that exist in the American black males mind towards white females are very insightful and realistic. At one point Cleaver actually says that his whole motivation for raping white women was that he considered it a \\"revolutionary act\\", it was his way of striking back at \\"white\\" society. He also goes into blacks pursuance of white females having more to do with black self hatred more than anything else. Although I think the general pathology black males have towards white females has evolved into something slightly different now, given the system now approves of and out and out promotes relationships between black males and white females, this book is still brilliant as far as delving into the psychological illness that exists within that dynamic. Other than that most of Soul on Ice is a complete lump of garbage. I can't fathom why this book is used in many University literature and sociology classes in America except to brainwash and indoctrinate white students with white guilt. I bet those classroom discussions are a real hoot!Cleaver was certainly the weak link in the Black Panther leadership, ultimately contributing more towards its destruction than helping it. He wasn't really a hardcore black nationalist or racial seperatist when you get down to it, he wasn't, which was common for that time, an overblown hardcore Marxist or leftist. What Cleaver was really all about was expanding his overblown ego more than anything else. He also later proved himself to be a complete flake going through stages as a black right wing conservative, a born again Christian, and I think he even got involved in some sort of bizarre eastern religion for a while. There are lots of reasons to admire the Black Panther Party, Cleaver is not one of them."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"If there is another book out there that more effectively excavates the subterranean foundation of American race relations in a mere 200 pages, I'm not aware of it. Barack Obama's presidency has demonstrated both how far we've come as a nation and how far we have yet to go. While it could be argued that visible, public evidence of racism seemed to steadily decrease prior to his nomination, we have now seen the miscreants smoked from their dens and they're running around, coughing and organizing, wiping the tears from their eyes and wondering what the heck happened. Read \\"Soul on Ice\\" and you'll understand much of what we see in the news today. While some of Cleaver's views are nave, outdated or just plain wrong; his sexism, idolization of Mao, demonization of homosexuality, and blanket condemnation of law enforcement and the military, for example; most of this book is as applicable to 2010 as it was to 1968. The book is not without troubling contradictions. Cleaver's letters to Beverly Axelrod capture the essence of new love's manic infatuation but the absence of any kind of empathy for the women he raped leaves us wondering. His enlightened embrace of Malcom X's acceptance of all races clashes with his surprisingly hateful attacks on gay people. The truth he utters, however, far outweighs the lies; and the light he sheds on the taboo dynamics of race in America is still needed today. The breadth of his knowledge and his masterful illumination of the interplay between historical, social, psychological and physical forces responsible for our daily on-the-ground realities makes \\"Soul on Ice\\" compelling. The fact that most of his assertions make sense but are rarely discussed makes it required reading.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"One must remember, this man is a convict, sent to prison for attempted murder. If you understand the mind of the incarcerated then you know it is all a front for parole.Once Cleaver was released from prison he proceed to get involved with more criminal activity both in the United States and abroad. In France he is suspected of the murder of a man that had an affair with his wife. In Algeria he ran a auto theft ring. Does this sounds like the re-incarnation of Malcolm X. Or does it sound like the a street thug. The fact that he became a crack addicted whore towards the end of his life renouncing the Black Panther attest to the fact that Eldridge Cleaver was a phoney only hustling the system to get out of jail.I read his book and essentially was bored.

Cleaver is an excellent writer that proves that you don't have a PhD. to be an intelligent, articulate, person. Cleaver has knowledge he gained from school of hard knocks and the school of life.

What is also amazing is how people focus on the fact that it was written by a professed rapist and chauvinist. These very same individuals who would dismiss this book on the basis of the author's shortcomings would have no problem reading about George Washington, Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, King David of the Bible, Henry the VIII, and many more that were known rapist, bigots, chauvinist, slavers, kidnappers, and serial murders without batting an eye. They celebrate these criminals and their crimes without shame. This book gives the reader a glimpse into the mind of someone who has gone through his own hell and gained some enlightenment and insight that a wise reader can glean. No one is calling Eldridge Cleaver a saint unlike the people mentioned above that some fools adore without question. Mr. Cleaver is wreckage, but among that wreckage there are gems of hope. He is not promoting rape or chauvinism, but is being more honest and open about how misguided he was in his life. It today's society a pathological liar who refuses to admit guilt is forgiven before a person who acknowledges his crimes. With shallowness being the new deep it is a wonder that people understand the difference between a Dictionary and an Encyclopedia.

Despite those that believe that this book pertains only to this era are obviously blind to the fact that many of the same issues then exist today. What makes it worse is that many people are unaware of it now, the gimmicks of media and political correctness have only mastered camouflaging it.

Judging from the present injustices and the apathy of the black masses, as well as the disproportionate black prison population, it is certainly true that the white man has ruled the back man's mind and body; however, Cleaver's testimony is proof that their spirit is unconquerable."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Written from Folsom Prison in 1968. Some people have referred to this as an autobiography, though I don't remember the author calling it that. It is more a series of essays. It is pretty deep. To understand it at all you have to constantly remind yourself who is writing it, from where, and when.Cleaver has a lot of insight on several levels. He offers his thoughts on the society as a whole during his day and particularly on the origins and effects of classism and racism. He talks about forces at work and the effects of such diverse phenomena as hula hoops, Elvis Presley, and the Beatles. Reading it as Barack Obama was being elected President was particularly informative, because we could see the longer range effects of some of the directions Cleaver saw the country moving forty years ago. I wish he could have seen it happen. The author goes deep into his analysis of the role of sex in society and especially in racism and he uses some graphic, colloquial terms.Cleaver was the Minister of Information for the Black Panthers, and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.A Call to Arms!

The uncomfort it produces explains much of the reason why it will endure as a classic"},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"I first encountered this tall white haired man standing curbside along 5th street in San Bernardino awaiting the west bound city bus. His complexion was a grayed out brown and his skin looked warn yet he stood tall and erect and desplaying an air of confidence. I passed him day after day and had no ideal that the man awaiting the morning bus was Leroy Eldridge Cleaver. At some point it was pointed out to me that \\"he'd once been somebody important,\\" but that was obviously along time ago. I pondered stopping for quite sometime but decided against it. At this stage in my life, Cleaver was a relic from the distant past. A man whose importance I was faintly aware of yet had no ideal of how I should feel about him and his contribution to black history. Once I'd learned of his activities first as a writer and activist, my impression of him changed. I found him not only shameful but contemptible as well. I continued to pass him by casting clear and purposeful glances tinged with emotion. I wanted my contempt to be obvious. Day after day this continued and I began to wonder if he was ashamed of what he'd allowed himself to become. For the manner in which he'd allowed himself to be used in the war against his own people. I was equally angered by his duplicitous dealings with prison authorities, the FBI, CIA and ultimately right-wing Evangelical Christian zealots and the GOP.F--- that fool I thought, look at him now. All that scheming and scamming and he's catching the city bus? He'd once been a celebrated author, respected community activist and Presidential candidate. He was beloved and respected but he'd traded it all away and for what? As I glanced upon this broken down shell of a revolutionary I couldn't imagine the depth of his fall. He now occupied a place in society that was no better than my own. I made absolutely no since and so I picked up for the first time \\"Soul on Ice\\" and then I began to understand. The faults and frailties were always there plain as the snow white goatee on his aged face. I read line after line and kept running into ideals that seemed completely disingenuous for someone in his position. We are often damned by our own words and deep within the pages of Soul on Ice, the author opens up in a confessional manner that should have served as a warning for all those who allowed him into their inner-circle and placed trust in him.\\"I mislead...I pretend...I...sham to deceive...I sucker my fellow men in and seduce them of their trust. And...if it suits my advantage, I lower the boom-mercilously...\\" In this letter to attorney Beverley Axelrod, the man formerly known as Leroy E. Cleaver Jr., Eldridge X., and ultimately Eldrige Cleaver went on to say \\"my vanity is vast...my heart is that of a tyrant, my arm is the arm of the Executioner. It is only the failure of my plots that I fear...\\" I often wonder at what point did that decrepit old man feel the fear rise from his failures? I wonder what role did the arm of the Executioner play in the death of little Bobby Hutton? There were so many things to regreat in the life of Eldridge Cleaver none more so than the granting of his wish to be the \\"voice of doom,\\" for the black panther party. I suppose it fitting that the quisling should end his life disdained and forgotten. However there is something sad and disappointing with the story of Eldridge Cleaver and the disingenuous penning of Soul on Ice."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Controversial book written from prison. This is the 1968 paperback edition somewhat oversized and easy to read with larger type than a newer mass market edition would have."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"In this piece, Eldridge Cleaver writes about many times, experiences, and happenings during one of the most critical times in the 20th century. After reading this, I'm shocked it isn't given the respect it is surely due. He talks about various people, such as the contrast of styles between James Baldwin and Richard Wright, the assassination of Malcolm X and the aftermath it left from Folsom Prison(where he was serving time) as well as other places around the country, and an eye-opening examination between himself, two of his comrades, and another fellow prisoner, which was shocking and all too surreal to say the least. Like other books which has been previously written during that time, there is still major relevance for it in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Even though this was one of the most important and popular books of the 1960s, it is not discussed that much now, some thirty-five years after its initial publication. \\"Soul on Ice\\" is as much an allegorical masterpiece as it is a real description of black male (whom he refers to as Supermasculine Menials) attitudes towards prison-life, white racism (and white women in particular, who are here referred to as Ogres and the Ultrafeminines) and the Nation of Islam (Cleaver writes compellingly about his disassociation with the Nation, citing their racism--\\"The onus of teaching racial supremacy and hate, which is the white man's burden, is pretty hard to bear\\"). Cleaver's at-times amazing writing gives this book a peculiar power, and given this, it is easy to understand why the book was so popular in the late 1960s. For several reasons, though, it is easy to see why this book doesn't get as much attention as, say, James Baldwin's \\"The Fire Next Time\\" [1963]. The chapter on Baldwin in \\"Soul on Ice,\\" entitled \\"Notes on a Native Son\\" (a reference to one of Baldwin's early essays) is exceedingly homophobic, and other sections fairly hateful towards women (even though, in this regard, Cleaver is at times aware of his own misogyny--especially in his blushingly honest letters to one-time attorney Beverly Axelrod) and exceedingly macho. Many contemporary readers might not have the patience for this (especially given Baldwin's elevated status in the world of literature). Also, this book has lost some of its bite over the years because of excellent books written by participants in the Black Power Movement and the Black Panther Party. \\"Soul on Ice\\"--especially when compared with George Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" (1971), Huey P. Newton's \\"Revolutionary Suicide\\" (1973), Amiri Baraka (1984) and Angela Y. Davis' (1974) autobiographies, and Elaine Brown's \\"A Taste of Power\\" (1992)--lacks the political vision, accuracy and believability of these other books, but it should also be credited for setting some of the standards by which these books would later have to judge themselves against, especially in regard to prison life (though Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" is much more powerful in this regard). Nevertheless, \\"Soul on Ice\\" is a compelling read, and I agree with a statement that Ishmael Reed makes in the introduction that this book IS the 60s. If this memoir were a western, we could smell the sawdust on the floor."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Eldridge Cleaver writes his memoirs here, and much of the book seeks to justify his actions and sentiments. It is as if he knows that his actions have been looked down upon by America and he needs to tell us where he is coming from. I found it shocking, not only that he should admit to raping women, both white and black, but more so that he makes excuses for why he HAD to rape them. He also explains his veiws on the inferiority complex that has plagued the African American since slavery, and his motivation for violent response. These views, though, are exceedingly hard to sift out of the pontificatory run-on sentance that permeates this book. He will launch into the feelings of a black woman in this society, and while his point may be valid, his statement consists of two pages of metaphorical secondary clauses. But, for all of his circumlocution, Cleaver's points provide great insight not only into a black revolutionary, but a convict, a Muslim after the style of Malcom X, and the african american experience in general. In all, his thoughts are hauntingly true."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Soul on Ice, written by Eldrige Cleaver is a collection of essays (written during his 9 years in Folsom State Prison during the 1960's) in which Cleaver discovers his racial identity. \\"I knew I was black, but never really stopped to take stock of what i was involved in. I met life as an individual and took my chances.\\" Cleaver was sentenced 9 years for raping a white woman. Cleaver felt his crime was a way to \\"spit\\" on the white man's values and women. He lived his life only to benefit himself. After meeting with his attorney, he realizes the value of listening and absorbing what another human being has to say. \\"The price of hating other human beings is loving one's self less.\\" Cleaver, educating himself in prison, also writes \\"In prison those things held and denied from the prisoner become precisely what he wants most of all.\\"Cleaver becomes especially interested in the writings of Thomas Merton, particularly his excerpt on the \\"New York Black Ghetto: Harlem.\\" After many religious endeavors, Cleaver found himself most intrigued by the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. Malcolm X appealed to the black convicts caught in the vicious prison paroll cycle, like himself. One aspect in which Cleaver felt most attracted to in Malcolm was that the society owed a debt to prisoners and not vice versa. Malcolm X did not \\"compromise truth to have favor with the white power structure.\\" The American tactic was to emmasculate the black leadership and to manipulate them. The unique black leader who would defy white power would ultimately end up dead, in prison, or forced out of the country. Classic illustrations of this policy are the careers of Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Dubois, and Paul Robeson. White America crushes the black leaders while inflating the images of Uncle Tom's (black on the surface, white on the inside)and celebrities. Power is taken out of political and economic context and plainly debased to the level of good sportsmanship. James Baldwin was an author who wrote \\"Native Son\\" and \\"White Negro.\\" Cleaver, inspired by Baldwin, felt that police brutatily was not caused by the hatred for the black man, but for social, economical, and political reasons. Blacks, having their freedom for approximately 100 years as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation, were still treated as \\"part of someone's invetory of assests.\\"After the most violent negro uprisings, the Burning of Watts, the white power structure pacifies the black community by appointing John Roseboro, an African American baseball player for the dodgers, to consultant for community relations. Cleaver also writes about the Vietnam War. Black soldiers are called upon to sacrafice their lives for freedom in Vietnam. In Watts they are killed because of their desire for freedom. Cleaver felt the black man should stay and die here for a better life.Cleaver's first imprisonment in 1954, for a drug charge, set the tone for his next 9 year term. Cleaver hung a poster of a white woman in his cell like the other prisoners. One of the guards came by and tore the poster down. The guard would only allow Cleaver to hang a picture of a black woman. Cleaver realizes that his attraction to the white women is not because of beauty or sexual appeal but because of their status and symbol. The white woman displays a symbol of freedom while the black woman is a symbol of slavery. \\"I will not be free until the day i can have a white woman in my bed and a white man minds his own business.\\"Although Cleaver's actions were not always moral nor did he go about things in a peaceful way, his fight was to allow the black race to revive their eradicated identity. From the moment the blacks were brought to this country from Africa, the white man imposed their culture and heritage upon them. Cleaver's quote, dealing with the white woman in bed, hits the nail on the head. He does not care for trivial freedoms and rights such as drinking from the same water fountain or riding at the front of the bus, he cares for the freedom where he can do what he wants, when he wants, without the white man looking over his shoulder. \\"One task that we have in the black community is a coupe de'etat against our present leadership, to strip them from that machinery that controls the community. So that new ideas and new people can percualate up, then we can have a new agenda.\\"I thorougly enjoyed this book because Cleaver moves from hate and violence towards an understanding of himself and humanity. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to gain a better understanding of the black struggle in the 1960's."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"I've spent the last thirty-two years being reminded of the brutal honesty and truth of much of this classical work on race, sex, and poverty by Eldridge Cleaver. I was honestly shocked by some of the sexual/racial ideas it contains the first time I read it in 1968, and decided to try it again to see if my present understanding of and assumptions about America now render this work moot- or affirm it.Not surprisingly, as much as I'd like to confirm or refute this work, the jury still won't come in and remains out. You should read this book if you've thought deeply about the &quot;why&quot; of our race problem in America, our prison problem in America, or the psychology of gender. You really owe this one to your real-world educational and intellectual development, whether you agree with it, or like it, or not.

It may even move up to four upon a second reading. It is a harsh book that is difficult to accept at times. The homophobia and sexism can be usettling. Of course, one must understand where Cleaver was coming from. The rascism is easier to understand in that light. And it should be noted that a lot of the anger and bitterness began to wane in later years. Cleaver seems to have undergone a spirtual transformation similar to that of Malcom X. This remains an important book from the 60s. It is critical for Americans both black and white (and yellow, brown and red as well) to read books like this to try to understand the horrors that have underscored this nations evolution. Cleaver, overcame tremendous obstacles to achieve this degree of success."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"The FBI could not have created a better person to sow the seeds of destruction for the Black Panther Party than Eldridge Cleaver.The treatise from jail - before Cleaver became a BPP member - catapulted him into the 1960s revolutionary/black power movements. But his so-called consciousness was never for the greater good of the whole.Cleaver failed to gain control of the BPP during his time in exile - and when he was essentially booted out of Cuba - by making what he felt was a left-turn by placing the organization into solidarity with nation's \\"at war\\" with U.S. imperialism. The attempted coup was foiled when Huey Newton kicked Cleaver and his followers out of the party. But Cleaver sounded so good when barking out orders thousands of miles away!The split began the fragmentation of the party. I contend it was the cornerstone development for the U.S. government to manipulate as a means to destroy the party from within. And I still have questions concerning the police shoot-out where Cleaver emerged basically unscathed, but his comrade in arms was shot dead.Cleaver - a convicted rapist - was legendary for his physical/verbal abuse of women. Again, the sickening spector of control through intimidation.It should have come as no surprise to anyone that years later Cleaver made an abrupt political turn into a right-extremist camp. He feared not being the head of the game, and with no place to turn on the left, Cleaver scampered to the right in hopes his new friends would pick him as captain of the team.As a slice of American History, Soul On Ice remains an essential read. But Cleaver's ideology cut severe wounds in the BPP, caused death and dissension, while arguably driving Newton into consolidating a national party into one Oakland chapter.Cleaver a revolutionary? Hardly. An egotistical coward? Yes."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"I have seldom read anything as offensive as Cleaver's attempt to pass off rape as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; act. By his own admission he is a serial rapist,and if he'd served time for all of them would never even have been out of jail in the sixties in the first place! While the other content of this book isn't totally worthless, I found that Cleaver came off as a typical criminal, filled with reasons why SOMEBODY ELSE was responsible for everything he did wrong. The first step to self respect is to accept responsibility for one's actions, Cleaver has not done that, nor does he give the slightest indication that he ever will. If you want to read an autobiography of a panther read Huey Newton's, because with Newton, instead of self pity, there was substance and intelligence behind the anger."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Mr. Cleaver wrote a semiautobiography about how society sets itself up along racial and gender lines. Raping women is reprehensible and evil and it doesn't help solve the racial/gender problem. It excabates it. Challenging the racist/sexist society by making alliances with people whom he considered to be his enemies will solve most of the problem. He should have shown love for his fellow man/woman. Didn't Jesus tell people to love your enemies, not hating and violating them? Later on in life, his views have changed for the better."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Outside the generally detached and often cynical reviews that are so typical of those who have little to no understanding of the inordinate complexities commonly born by blacks of the period, do I humbly submit this evaluation. I believe that if one is open enough to the notion of understanding life from an entirely foreign perspective, then one might also be able to appreciate the indefatigable efforts on an impossible journey to sainthood by this book's author. In my mind, Eldridge Cleaver most adequately personified the rebirth of the black conscious alpha male. His writing in this book was the perfect blend of a sort of primal rage coupled with the suave literary sophistication of the most accomplished poet. Soul on Ice is essentially an allegorical retelling of some of the most profound experiences in the life of a man who's awakening in a world drenched in terrorism (of the European variety) was anything but kind.As a black man in his thirties, I am always impressed and then ultimately relieved to see how men of my own ethnicity have torn through the societal constraints (real or imagined) seeking to right the wrongs of their lives that the whole of the community can begin to heal, thus being at peace with itself. Many can learn from this book -including whites- but only if the goal is not to seek justification for condemning the overall purpose of the black panthers harping on the imperfections and past sins of many of it's heralds. Believe me, there are quite a few reviews written about this book that give precisely that impression, only to concede begrudgingly of course, that these black men & women were indeed human after all.For Eldridge Cleaver, the book was a catharsis, in which he admits to the unsavory truth of his involvement in rape - a nearly unforgivable crime in my opinion. Nevertheless, one soon discovers that the author is not beyond the reach of redemption thankfully. His prose and allegory give strong testament to his skill with a pen. The back-n-forth love letters with his one-time lawyer Beverly Axlerod, are endearing and is sure to make every women blush. His unflinching analysis on the social politics of the day is defiant but also lucid; to suggest that the U.S. government (p. 153, paragraph 2), was sending 16% of blacks to Vietnam in order to butcher peasants who like themselves, were fighting for the right to self-determination - not so much to die - but that hate for blacks would metastasize across the rice fields of Asia like a cancer is jarring, but not entirely without merit. Lastly his appeal to black women was a call for reconciliation with the brothas, a call that has mostly gone unanswered even today sadly. Cleaver was no angel, nor should he have been as the world in which he lived, was no place for the faint of heart. And he was not trying to explain away, much less mitigate the severity of his crimes which quite frankly, pale in comparison to the force of the upswing in his life. I don't think his goal was to assuage white people or anyone else for that matter. Instead, he set out to discover himself and the world around him. In Ismael Reed's preface in this extraordinary book, is a most fitting description of Cleaver, given first by Amiri Baraka: Bohemian Anarchist!(Page 34, Paragraph 3)That is why I started to write. To save myself. I realized that no one could save me but myself. The prison authorities were both uninterested and unable to help me. I had to seek out the truth and unravel the snarled web of my motivations...It may be that I can harm myself by speaking frankly and directly, but I do not care about that at all. Of course I want to get out of prison, badly, but I shall get out some day. I am more concerned with what I am going to be after I get out. I know that by following the course which I have charted I will find my salvation. If I had followed the path laid down for me by the officials, I'd undoubtedly have long since been out of prison - but I'd be less of a man. I'd be weaker and less certain of where I want to go, what I want to do, and how to go about it."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"Whew! The how-to shows the success of a writer who bootstrapped his way to the top a best-sellers list, deftly using his experiences and the several mentors who recognized his brainpower. The life path Eldridge Cleaver spent in getting to this writing peak is the not-to part. Much of the book is the kind of rant one might hear on Sunday morning TV, often with a socialist twist. But the ranting is quite clearly written, and sometimes just when the reader is about to say, \\"Oh, for pete's sake,\\" the author nails a concluding sentence right on the mark, and not necessarily where the reader thought the thread was heading. Such an unexpected thought hits in the middle of \\"The Primeval Mitosis\\" chapter: Cleaver concludes that, \\"liberality is, in fact, charity.\\" How true. To do the thought fairly, one has to read the chapter up to that point, of course.Then comes the chapter, \\"The Allegory of the Black Eunuchs.\\" If Cleaver could write like this for a whole book in a row, he would be a best-seller without resorting to polemics. Polemics, unfortunately, was the whole point. The disjointedness and flights of fury and semi-sense that showed up sporadically in the first part of the book suddenly funnel into a well-told story, almost in the style of the biblical tale of Job. Job's \\"friends\\" were more interesting (and speak better) than Cleaver's wooden pen pals, but \\"Lazarus,\\" or \\"Infidel\\" is arguably a much more complex person than old Job. He thus makes several key points using a character who changes page by page, chameleon-like. Here is a master story teller.Whatever the \\"yeas\\" and \\"boos\\" for most of the earlier book, the last chapter stands out as a worthy piece of writing. The reader realizes at this late point that the whole book was leading up to this ending, an apology and a love letter from all black men to all black women, from souls on centuries of ice. This was wonderfully done, and all the earlier diatribes and nonsense look like mere practice writing for the finale.

Cleaver spends a great deal of time writing on the injustices Black people face in America, and how even though he is what society wants him to be, it is his fault that he allow society to be right. He pledges to take steps towards change and to become a benefit to society.I know that a lot of people think that they know about the civil rights movement and the effects it had on the Black race, but they don't. This story of a man who, at the time, had been locked up for more than half of his life, is the story of all real Black people. I think that sometimes Black people do things and think that it is their nature, which is how stereotypes brew. Cleaver shows us that it is history and hatred that have made us a collective in an usual individual world. We do think for ourselves, yet a racist society continues to force us to travel down a road that we have not set for ourselves, and that he has fell into racist America's trap. He has become the stereotype: (supposedly) uneducated, a prisoner, and a victim of \\"The Ogre\\" (the white woman)."},{"Title":"Soul on Ice","review":"I enjoyed the book, but I'm on the hedge with my opinion of him as a person.

It's harsh, it's gripping, and it was his reality.

The Jewish ethical work called Ethics of the Fathers 1:2 reports that Simon the Just said that the earth endures because of three things, two of which are religious: \\"Torah, divine worship, and acts of loving-kindness.\\" However, in 1:18 of the same volume, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel offers a practical idea, \\"the world rests on three things: truth, justice, and peace.\\" Henrik Ibsen has a similar view.The protagonist in this excellent play is Bernick, is a highly respected owner of a ship building business. Bernick lives in a society that he controls because of his wealth and the prestige that wealth produces. He donated many items to his community and placed his name on them. At one point in the play there is a mass demonstration of citizens praising him.But Ibsen shows us why we should despise him. Bernick insists that his community follow the traditional ways, meaning the behavior that the masses sanctioned for some generations, notions that they read into the Bible although a fair reading would not find them, ideas that stagnate human development and societal advancement, thoughts that enlightened people reject. He views women as inferior to men, childlike, foolish, unable to understand, beings that should be subservient to men. He talks down to his wife during the few times that he talks to her. Outrageously, he says to her at one point, as if he were speaking to a wall, I have no one to talk to. Dina, a young woman who he squashes because of his view of women, says that her life in this city is \\"so proper and so moral\\" that it is impossible to live with these people. Lona, another character, comes to Bernick's house, to \\"let in fresh air.\\"Ibsen shows that Bernick is a hypocrite, a liar, a crook, a man who intends, in a Bernie Madoff fashion, to steal from people who trust him, a man who could care less about seeing people die if he can make money. He persuaded a close relative into taking the blame for one of his crimes, and this individual suffered for more than a decade because of it.Ibsen ends his book by saying that the true builders of society are not people, but \\"the spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom,\\" the very things that Bernick squashed."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Dictionary & Phrasebook: Hawaiian-English/English-Hawaiian (Hawaiian Edition)","review":"With this book I am able to talk in hawaiian to my daughter and get her to know the language."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Dictionary & Phrasebook: Hawaiian-English/English-Hawaiian (Hawaiian Edition)","review":"I bought this book as a going away present for someone moving to Hawaii, considering it was used I was concerned a bit, but it was in great shape, Aloha."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This is an incredible book about real friendship,chastity and honesty written in the most humorous fashion.Fielding brings out the true values of friendship beteween Parson Adams and Joseph and true love between the latter and Funny.He points out the sad but true &quot;false&quot; nature of the upper class and brings out questions about real life.I like this book because it encourages chastity and esteems honesty."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"The prize of this novel is the ability of the author to actually poke fun at his own readers...Fielding encourages us to stop, take a break at each short chapter; at some points he even laments that certain passages aren't worth reading, and just skipping over them would lose nothing in the reader's understanding of the content. This of course, works for us in that it makes us more prone to envelop ourselves in every chapter, following the always clumsy journey and comic circumstance of Parson Adams and Joseph Andrews. The journey from country to city is a prevalent theme in the novel, and through these distinctions, we are able to pinpoint the nuanced comedy Fielding finds in living in his own time period. To understand this you must put yourself inside of the 18th century, and more helpful would be to read the novel that this book is a parody of, \\"Pamela\\". Fielding challenges the notions of love and chastity in his time in a hysterical way; that is, if you can follow the winding text and dated grammar....But what a great book. Really."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Second only to Voltaire'sCandide: Or Optimism (Penguin Classics), Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews is the funniest, most intelligent, satirical commentary I've ever read. Actually, let's get rid of the qualifiers, Joseph Andrews is one of the two funniest books I've ever read. (I first read it in college and it introduced me to the idea that important old books could also be highly entertaining, interesting, and illuminating.)The book was first published in 1742 under the title \\"The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, and of His Friend Mr. Abraham Adams\\" to some controversy. Fielding did not hesitate to poke merciless fun at just about everything 'respectable': religion, the law, lords and ladies, and sexual mores. Fielding attacked the moral hypocrisy of Joseph Richardson's popularPamela: Or Virtue Rewarded (Oxford World's Classics). (Fielding also wrote a short work, Shamela, that was a direct response to Pamela. Shamela is often sold together with Joseph Andrews See e.g.,Joseph Andrews and Shamela (Penguin Classics).) Pamela created a huge literary controversy; Shamela and Joseph Andrews were just two of many mocking responses, although few others survive (see, e.g.Anti-Pamela and Shamela).Joseph (who is Pamela's brother!) is a genial but nave rustic and a footman in the service of Lady Booby (wink, wink, nudge, nudge). When Joseph rejects her very direct and bawdy advances, Lady Booby sends him packing. Joseph then begins walking home from London to the country to seek out (and marry) Fanny Goodwill, his lifelong sweetheart. Along the way he meets his hometown friend the amiable and forgetful Parson Abraham Adams. Parson Adams is on his way to London to sell his sermons for publication. When Adams discovers he has forgotten to pack said sermons, he and Joseph decide to travel home together. The trip is the departure point for many adventures and mishaps that expose the society's hypocrisy and inequities. Along the way, the reader meets many colorful characters whose pretensions often land them in dire circumstances - furnishing much hilarity to us.Fielding purported to aim at nothing less the invention of a new literary form, the \\"comic epic-poem in prose\\". He says in his Preface, \\"it may not be improper to premise a few words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language.\\" Fielding, however, was also known to write 'serio-comic', ironic introductions to his works, so some caution is in order. Nonetheless, the Preface accurately describes his \\"comic epic-poem in prose\\" as \\"differing from comedy, as the serious epic from tragedy: its action being more extended and comprehensive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and introducing a greater variety of characters. It differs from the serious romance in its fable and action, in this: that as in the one these are grave and solemn, so in the other they are light and ridiculous; it differs in its characters, by introducing persons of inferiour rank, and consequently of inferiour manners, whereas the grave romance sets the highest before us; lastly in its sentiments and diction; by preserving the ludicrous instead of the sublime.\\"Absolutely the highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"I bought this book for one of my literature classes at the beginning of the term (It was the last book on the syllabus) because it was only available online and no longer in printing production. The book arrived late compared to when it was supposed to arrive ( I live in OR and the book was coming from CA). Other than that, I was satisfied with my purchase overall."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding has written a very funny novel that attacks the hypocrisy and vanity of the times (around 1740's London). Just about every character in the novel suffers from one or both of these traits. The barbs the author throws at these characters are often hilarious. His writing style is a treasure, and his sentence structure is overloaded (lots of commas, semicolons, dashes, etc. in his sentences). Furthermore, the author quite readily goes off on very long tangents.For example, the main characters Joseph Andrews, his friend Parson Adams, and Joseph's love Fanny, happen upon the home of a very noble gentleman. The book then goes and liberally describes the history of this man they met - which really has nothing to do with the novel (at least at the time it occurs). Now that I think about it, this wasn't an unnecessary tangent, as it has meaning at the very end of the novel.Nonetheless, there are many instances in the novel where the main character happen upon someone, or someplace, and all of the sudden we are fully thrust into this direction that takes us away from the simple journey of these characters. This stream of consciousness is seen in the later novels of Thomas Pynchon - and this is important to me as Pynchon is one of my favorite authors. As I read the novel, I really felt a strong presence of Pynchon's novel \\"Mason and Dixon\\".Now, Fielding writes in a very fluent, and complex dialogue which I found a little easier to read in a flowing way than I felt with Pynchon. His flowery wording perfectly describes scenes, people, and attitudes, and the laughs are much funnier with his writing style than if told straight up.Everyone is exposed as a hypocrite or quite vain, except for Joseph Andrews himself. It's evident that the author uses him as a paradigm for how to behave in this world. Parson Adams comes a close second, but even he suffers from some of the things he preaches against. Fanny doesn't really do much but look pretty and serves primarily as Joseph's love interest - although I believe the author indicates that she is very virtuous.The primary plot of the novel involves a journey by Joseph and Parson Adams, and the adventures they get into along the way. Near the end of the novel, it shifts focus to some elderly ladies who fancy Joseph to the degree that they lose all sense of propriety in trying to have him. Additionally, the supposed gentlemen of their relation desire to have Fanny. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say the author is indicating that the only people who are good enough for either Fanny or Joseph are Joseph and Fanny, as they seem to be the only ones lacking in either vanity or hypocrisy. Additionally, each of those two hold onto their virginity, waiting for their impending marriage (which is not a sure thing as the novel shows).The ending of the novel allows for what the author promises at the beginning of the novel, and that is in the realm of the ridiculous. This part of the novel - I don't want to say much - had to be the inspiration for some of our situational comedies of today.Please read this novel, if for no other reason, because it can be screamingly funny in parts - I laughed out loud in several places.As a last note, the themes addressed by Fielding are very relevant today, so this novel has a certain timelessness to it - but just know that it does occur in the 1740's, so there will be some things common to that time which are unusual to someone not acquainted with London in that time period. But the writing is so good and easy to understand, that I don't think it will be much of a problem."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding wrote one of the great comic novels in Tom Jones. Joseph Andrews is similar in nature but falls far short of Fielding's, masterpiece. The book starts out well enough. A handsome, viral young man of low birth (Andrews) is placed in the family of Lord and Lady Booby. The mistress takes a fancy to Andrews and makes him her footman. Lord Booby dies and the lady tries to force her affections on poor Joseph. Being virtuous, as well as attractive to the opposite sex, he refuses her advances and is promptly dismissed. Joseph then sets out to London to meet his true love, Fanny, and along the way joins up with his mentor, Parson Adams, a kind of Don Quixote character complete with a stumbling horse. Before too long Fanny joins the retinue. A good start.But Fielding gets into trouble because he can't seem to make up his mind as to who his protagonist is. As Joseph begins his journey he is set upon by a group of robbers, beaten, and left naked in a ditch. A coach comes by and the passengers debate whether or not to save him. At last, persuaded that if they did not try they might be liable to be sued for his death they agree to take him up. But a \\"lady\\" riding inside the coach refuses to allow a naked man to be placed beside her. There then ensues a debate over who will give their coat to cover Joseph. This depiction is both humorous and a telling commentary of British values in the first half of the eighteenth century. But Andrews it seems is too staid and pure to be the target of the kind low slapstick comedy that Fielding has in mind, thus much of the remainder of the book focuses on the adventures and foibles of the good parson. Joseph is reduced to the role of defender of Fanny and the parson from various assaults on their person and character.Fielding also goes off on tangents such as the story of Leonora, Mr. Wilson's life history and the tale told by the parson's son toward the end of the book. Fielding's intent is to display some aspects of the social mores of the times, but these asides distract from the flow of the story. At the end of the book Mr. Wilson's history does, in fact, come to play an important part in the story, but the others are mere sidebars to the action. One interesting diversion does occur when Fielding, as an author talking directly to the reader, interjects into the story to provide a rationale for why books are divided into chapters.Finally, after a series of humorous and often outrageous adventures Joseph, Fanny and Parson Adams return home and face a new series of problems when Lady Booby re-enters the picture and continues her pursuit of Joseph. At his point other characters including Joseph's sister, Pamela and her husband, Mr. Booby (Lady Booby's nephew), a pedlar, an obsequious character, Beau Didapper who lusts after Fanny, the elder Mr. and Mrs. Andrews and finally Mr. and Mrs. Wilson add to the complications. This section of the book is filled with rollicking humor (including a wonderful scene where Parson Adams mistakes Mrs. Slipslop for a man and battles with her in bed and then wanders into Fanny's bed where he is discovered by Joseph), mystery, and problematic situations (including the possibility that Joseph and Fanny are really brother and sister!), until after a tortuous series of events all ends well with even Lady Booby finding love, or at least lust.I give the book four stars because it really is not on a par with the great comic novels. But it is a fun and enjoyable read. Joseph Andrews is a humorous book and Fielding provides a look at the foibles and character of various English types in his era. The book is well worth reading even though it falls short of the great pieces of satire and humorous literature."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This is a fine work both to allow the reader insight into England in the 18th century away from court and cathedral, and to provide a peek into the early invention of the English novel.Fielding's characters paint a vivid picture of how well, or how poorly, people reside within their assigned class levels. Parson Adams, though often playing the naive fool, establishes an expectation of noble Christian behaviour against which Fielding's 'Canterbury Tale'-like characters can be measured. At the same time, Fielding uses Adams to allow the title character to evolve from the pure innocent, who falls into difficulty, to become resurrected as the fully realized, real-life hero.As a story of life among the lower and middle classes, this is a fine read. But I found the brilliant, excellent construction of this novel to be a real eye-opener as far as the development of the early novel is concerned."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This book was assigned to me in my British Literature class for a book club. Shortly after being assigned this book, I quickly went out and began reading it. While Fielding's writing style does seem to run on a bit, his narrative wit and dialogue is enjoyable.I found myself liking the three main characters, Parson Adams in particular. He told some interesting stories, and has kind of an older brother relationship with Joesph, making him a good side character. The brief moments of action were pretty good in the story, as were the humorous bits. Its easy to see why this novel will go down as one a classic in literature."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding wrote SHAMELA for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. The fact that Richardson's earlier PAMELA had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. In his preface, Fielding makes it clear that he has placed Richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. He attempts to expose \\"the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela, Are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless Arts of that young Politician, set in a true and just Light.\\" He makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether Pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary Fielding sees as the latter.Like PAMELA, SHAMELA is a novel (much briefer than PAMELA) written as letters. But in Fielding's hands, Shamela is seen as the master manipulator. Where Pamela faints whenever her Mr. B. grabs her, Shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. With each passing episode, Fielding inverts the moral universe of Richardson so that when one considers Richardson's subtitle of PAMELA as \\"Virtue rewarded,\\" one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of Pamela and the virtue of Shamela are alike only in their spelling. I am glad that I read PAMELA first, for if I had come across SHAMELA first, I am pretty sure that I would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"I enjoyed Fielding's sense of humor, his appreciation of human foibles. Joseph Andrews is a good story and becomes more entertaining as it moves along. Parson Adams is my favorite character."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Fielding's basic concept is describing 'manners, not men.'His main characters are two paragons of chastity (Joseph and his girlfriend Fanny) and a model Christian (parson Abraham Adams).During their tumultuous itinerary, they are confronted with vanity, avarice, envy, ambition, ingratitude, selfishness, intolerance, venality, hate, lust, folly, malice, deceit, rage and all this behind a veil of hypocrisy (Do as I say, not as I do): 'Lord, it is true I never obeyed one of thy commandments, yet punish me not, for I believe them all.'The overall mentality is calvinist fatalism: 'We must submit to Providence', and 'no accident happens to us without the Divine permission ... the same power which made us, rules over us, and we are absolutely at his disposal, he may do with us what he pleases, nor have we any right to complain.'There is also a Malthusian accent: 'he shall not settle here, and bring a nest of beggars into the parish.'Christianity is only a tiny film of varnish: 'that it was possible in a country professing Christianity, for a wretch to starve in the midst of his fellow-creatures who abounded.'Socially, the few wealthy rule over the many poor. 'The worst consequence of poverty is dependence on the great.'Another characteristic is the blatant misogyny, through its picture of the lewdness and vulgarity of women (in sharp contrast with Fanny's manners): 'I am no meat for a footman.'This rich, lively, fresh and satirical text contains anti-novel sparks and many modern ingredients ('a set of jolly companions ... Their best conversation was nothing but noise.')But the novel as a whole is loosely built (no real plot) and sometimes too scholarly and boring. It ends in a pure Menander-style.Still, it is a worth-while read."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"As I first time reader of Fielding I found this book unexpectedly comical. In the same line as going to church to hear a boring old pastor and finding your self humoured throughout the sermon. The charactors keep their distance through the third person narrative which allows the reader to judge, pity and find in the case of Fanny and Joseph perfection which is annoyingly unreal.As for Parson Adams he well may be a saintly man but surely someone other than myself finds his lack of tact, condenscending tone and total innocence extremely irritating."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader.

I just could not get quite as into this book as I might have had I known what I was in for when I bought it.

It was a simple story from a kid's point of view, encompassing very difficult subjects: Poverty, abuse, and the biggie... race. When I was a kid in the sixties, it seemed like all the rules changed. The trouble was, no one had made up new rules yet, so everyone fought and posed and tried hard to survive adolescence, which is typical, only there was a feel of craziness in the air.

It was a story that only Edna could tell, and Barry got it just right."},{"Title":"The Good Times Are Killing Me","review":"I recently mailed a box of books to a friend of mine and had wanted him to read this, so it was one of the first books I placed in the box.

Her novels seem so real, so autobiographical that I am not sure how much of The Good Times Are Killing Me is even fiction at all.I loved the spirituality, the music, the warmth and the honesty of Lynda's story. I couldn't put it down. It's very short and perfectly suitable for young people. However, I do not believe it to be best for young people. I don't know if they'll appreciate the story as much as an adult would. I think that because the protagonist is young, and because the story is about race and school and growing up, people want it to be a book for young readers. I'm just not so sure. I don't think there is ANYTHING in here that is inappropriate or bad for younger readers, I just don't think they'd appreciate it as much as an adult would."},{"Title":"The Good Times Are Killing Me","review":"It won't take you long to finish this book of vignettes that weave together into a complete story.

And what happens when girls grow up and graduate out of grade school?Lynda Barry has the voice of the young girl down perfectly, expressing the things that young girls think and worry about, including the angst and dreams of fitting in and belonging.

This book brought back memories of teaching and really will encourage learning.The book/tape set is nice because children can learn the songs before they can even read. Later, they can read the book and teach their friends the fun rhymes. Children will especially enjoy: She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain. Down by the Station sounded very familiar and I was wondering if my mother might have had fun singing this to me when I was a young child. I thought I heard her voice in the song, well, in the back of my mind while it was playing.Nice English flavor and accents. The rhymes encourage playfulness and silliness. Oh, to be a kid again! Children are comforted by music and there is no reason you couldn't sing some of these songs to a baby. Some of them are quite funny because the singers improvise a bit. I really don't remember the ending to Row, Row, Row Your Boat and here it has three verses.The pictures show how to act out the rhymes so this not only becomes an exercise manual for kids ;), it also serves as a babysitter.You might also enjoy Nursery Rhymes by Debi Gliori and Playtime Rhymes (a similar book/tape set).~TheRebeccaReview.com"},{"Title":"Large-Scale Organizational Change: An Executive's Guide","review":"An excellent read!

With his assistant the dandyish, snuff-snorting detective inspector David Lingard, the tough-minded Rogers gets deeply enmeshed in a complex murder investigation. It's a grisly, gory, complicated plot, fast-moving, with a cast of distinctly unpleasant characters.A spooning couple in a rowboat under a bridge is interrupted when a bloody knife is dropped into their rowboat. From that point on, it's a roller coaster ride of a procedural where the squeamish dare not go. It involves a plethora of adulterous and voracious wives. The autopsies alone will be enough to make your flesh crawl. An exhausted Rogers gets a broken leg and a shotgun blast for his troubles. His police crew is well-drawn.I've always been intrigued by Ross's hard-boiled British police fiction, and this one will keep readers involved and, at times, appalled by Rogers savage take on life. Certainly not a coy British cozy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Behind the steel wall,","review":"This is essentially the diary of a neutral Swedish journalist in Berlin in 1941 to 1943. It was published in late 1943 after Fredborg left (or was kicked out of Germany) Based on a his name in the flyleaf the book was given to my Uncle in July 1944 when we was serving as an infantry captain with the 25th Division in the South Pacific. I think he was in Auckland NZ on R&R at the time he got this. He died in 1955 from Polio and I inherited his collection of books. I was 14 at the time and a voracious reader. I don't remember reading this book at that time since my memory is pretty shot these days. This book has been out of print for a long time although it is available on Amazon. The exact same copy I have is for sale for 80 cents plus shipping. Since he is Swedish I doubt it got much press in the United States. William Shirer's books on this same subject were huge bestsellers and still are. I enjoyed reading Fredborg's book as he had access to high ranking Nazi's and had relatively free access in Berlin and other areas of German although they were constantly watched and of course their material was always censored. Since his book was written before the end of World War II there are still a lot of things Fredborg was not aware of. He knew the Nazi's were killing Jews but thought that maybe when it was all over they might end up killing 2 million or so. He was off by 4 million and no doubt was shocked when he learned that. He was clearly anti-Nazi and gives a clear picture of the fools they were. He writes of the infighting about the leadership and the constant difficulties of the propaganda officials to explain what was happening after the tide of war starting going agains the Nazi's. It was certainly an interesting book from a neutral with no particular ties to the British, Russians or Americans. He seems to have a keen eye for what is really going on and worth reading for those with an interest in this period of time."},{"Title":"The Exotic Art of Glass Bracelet Forming","review":"This book addressed my needs on information about borosillicate glass and fusing and slumping,Nice layout, good information and excellent projects with instructions."},{"Title":"The Art of True Healing (The Classic Wisdom Collection)","review":"Besides the clear exposition of the Middle Pillar exercise, the book also contains an element borrowed from astrology - the seven principal ideas symbolized by the sun, moon and inner planets (every idea and thing can be classified within one of these root ideas). For example, the sun represents power & success, life, money, growth, etc., its positive color is orange, its negative color is yellow or gold, and its magical name is Elohim Tsa-vo-os. So for example if one has a need of money, you would visualize the negative color (yellow/gold) as a next step following the Middle Pillar and vibrate the name. To help someone else who needs money, one would visualize the positive color (orange) and the person concerned and vibrate the name. I have seen the Middle Pillar described using six chakras (Ted Andrews)or all seven chakras where Regardie uses only five (he combines the Throat & Third Eye centres), but I suppose it doesn't matter, since the effect is the same.

The text has been summed up well in other reviews. A word about the author seems appropriate. It is worth pointing out that W.Y. Evans-Wentz was an American (one reviewer stated that W.Y. E-W was English).The confusion here stems from the fact that W.Y. E-W went to Oxford, England, as a Rhodes scholar. He was a very articulate and erudite man - well versed in the Western classics, Western mystery tradition etc. - and in his footnotes, he made frequent cross references to such.A few people now fault E-W' work - because of the universal sweep of his intuitions.It has even been suggested that he corrupted the purity of the Tibetan teachings - by his inter-cultural or trans-cultural horizons.Some Tibetan Lamas (i.e. Trungpa) have faulted E-W's work on such grounds.Western afficionadoes of Tibetan Buddhism - people who like to imagine themselves among the elect(Professors and pop followers alike) have chimed in.Such people forget (or prefer to ignore) the fact that W.Y.Evans-Wentz spent many years studying and working with Tibetan Lamas. Be assured, W.Y. Evans-Wentz' projects had the blessing of his Tibetan co-worker - Lama Kazi Dawa Sammdup. There are those who would argue that this blessing did not extend to the commentary material - subsequently added by E-W, after his work with the Lama. But how E-W presented the material to a Western audience - was his business.Death is most certainly a universal experience - and E-W placed it in a truly universal context. Is that so surprising?The Jungian commentary appended to the first ed. of this text has also come in for criticism (some editions now delete it). But Jung had something - when suggesting that we ought to read the TBD 'BACKWARDS' - to understand the difficulties modern minds get into - when trying to approach such territory. Still, as E-W points out, late medieval Western culture had a similar perspective on death. It was part of life, we similarly understood the need to 'live our dying' - and the need to 'die-in-life' to find the greater spiritual life. There are chapels in Europe, constructed entirely of human bones. It looks morbid to modern people - but, in fact, it signified a triumph over death. Death is the greatest adventure. Whatever we may be doing, death is the ultimate destination that awaits us. Many European cathedrals have a 'memento mori' - an image of death, saying: \\"I was as you are;as I am, so shall ye be. \\" Will you be able to pay the ferryman - when the boat comes?"},{"Title":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","review":"You've got to be ready to concentrate and wade deep to enjoy the introductions and translation, but the effort will reap great rewards. Using exacting and poetic prose with a disciple and intellectual honesty that is probable too good and un-dumbed-down to get published these days, this remains the best translation for those willing to work."},{"Title":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","review":"This is the original \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\". All other versions are a toned-down version of this work by different authors who want to accommodate people who do not want to put the work in. You need to put the work in. No one can spoon-feed this kind of wisdom to you.The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an extremely authoritative translation of the original texts of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup who schooled W.Y.Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Buddhism. The book is an extremely important piece of work for both the scholars of psychology and religion, and the lay person who has the time to spend working on it. The book is also the reality behind the \\"Necronomicon\\" which has been popularized by fiction writers, such a H.P.Lovecraft, but has been completely taken out of its true context.To begin with, this book is a beautiful book once you truly understand the message that it is trying to convey to the reader - or more correctly, when the reader correctly understands the message that is being conveyed. It has a primordial air to it and is certainly ancient in its wisdom and understanding. The book was translated in the early 1900s and was first published in 1927. Be warned - this book is exceptionally difficult to read because the standard of grammar used is of the highest acumen humanly possibly. Evans-Wentz was a Doctor of Literature, a Doctor of Science and a Master of Arts. If you don't have a full size Oxford dictionary, then you will have trouble reading it. There is also a difficulty in the translation. There are many Tibetan words that do not exist in English so Evans-Wentz sometimes derives a more descriptive meaning behind the message that is trying to be communicated to the reader. Dr. C.G. Jung has written an introduction at the start of the book which is mostly concerned about explaining the Tibetan meaning of the words \\"Soul\\" and \\"Mind\\". It is for reasons like these that the book requires multiple readings to fully absorb the information that is being presented. So what exactly is The Tibetan Book of the Dead? It is a corpus with several teachings. Tibetan Buddhist monks believe that if you understand the meaning of death then you will understand the meaning the life. It expounds in detail on the illusions of the human mind and gives a context for working out many questions that are philosophical and spiritual in nature.The book is essentially split into three parts. The first part has introductions from various students of theology, psychology and Buddhism. Evans-Wentz then explains the nature of the book and gives a rough breakdown of what we will find in the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" and how it is used to help the dead find their way to Nirvana during the after-death ceremonies (like an Irish wake) but also how the book can be used as a guide for the living, which is its true intended purpose. The middle part of the book is the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" translated directly into English and third part covers the topic of Buddhism in general with references to the different schools of thought and Christianity.The middle part of the book, the actual \\"Bardo Thodol\\", is split into three parts. There is an introduction at the start which explains the entry into the \\"Chikhai Bardo\\", the first of the Bardo regions that one automatically enters at the point of death. Then there is the second phase of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\", the \\"Chonyid Bardo\\" before the final phase of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" the \\"Sidpa Bardo\\". Essentially these three areas can be explained as - the moment of death and the dawning of the light or nirvana, the karmic illusions of worldly things and finally the rebirth process. However do not think that this means that everybody is reborn or that Tibetans/Buddhists take reincarnation literally. It is all part of a thinking puzzle. You have got to work out things for yourself. There are hidden meanings in there. You must compare the different concepts in this book to find out what it really means! Question the \\"Bardo Thodol\\". Question what it teaches! Question what it says about itself!The Bardo Thodol is a technical and thoroughly scientific examination of consciousness that is still highly regarded as one of the most logical and controlled methods of understanding the mind and its relation to the world of phenomena. At first glance the book may seem horrid, uncanny and evoke a fear by the mere mention of the word \\"death\\", but this is a book about the living, dedicated to life and expounds on some of the most important questions that man can ask himself. It is extremely satisfying and worthy of repetitive readings. There is a pile of footnotes to help guide you through each page.Enormously recommended! ! ! !(As a side note Evans-Wentz wrote several other books to follow up on this one. They should be read in the following order - (1)The Tibetan Book of the Dead, (2) Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, (3)Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines and (4)The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.)"},{"Title":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","review":"Tamuning, Guam February 5, 2000&quot;The Tibetan Book of The Dead&quot;; translated by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup, edited by W.Y.

Translated by LAMA KAZI DAWA-SAMDUP. Edited by Dr. W.Y Evans-Wentz, formerly of Jesus College, Oxford who spent the rest of his life dedicating himself to following the teachings of this very translation. This writer is the one who first produced the teachings of 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' to occident man in the west. It still remains the definitive edition to this day. The book also has many footnotes and an important lengthy introduction by C.G. Jung to introduce the occident mind to the nature of the book. The footnotes are the helping hand in reading and understanding the text.This is a book about the raw mind. It may take you many lifetimes to understand. You may understand it after the first reading. There are no devices, tools, sects, schools or Gods used to get you there. This is a book about your mind. The mind is the only device you should need along with the book to bring you to the understanding of - knowing the nature of reality. Then when you are done with the book pass it on and use the only tool that this book expounds on. The mind.I have not even attempted to read anything else since I found this book. That is because it is definitive. The book only needs your mind. Nothing else. That is why this book is THE definitive book of the mind. Christians should not be afraid of this book in any way shape or form. It is good natured, good willing and does nothing more than help expand your goodness.It is through the book of the dead that you will learn the book of life.As the recently deceased Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, of Tiruvannamalai, South India, admonished Evans-Wentz when he sojourned in his ashram he said - \\"Each of you should ask yourself, 'who, or what, am I?' Why am I here incarnate? Whither I am destined? Why is there birth and why is there death?'\\"This book has never been equaled by any other book.

This is the work of an English academic in the early 20th Century, as he uncovers an &quot;Oriental&quot; classic for a Western audience. Evans-Wentz even brings Carl Jung into the picture for the Westerners, as Jung's psychology was &quot;New School&quot; at the time and offered a sublime link between Oriental and Occidental thinking. I hold this book in the highest regard, not because it is a mystical Buddhist text, but rather because it offers tips for daily living and and self-actualization. As with most quality philosophical doctrines, this book is a paradox...a book of the dead that is really an abstract book for the living, regardless of religion or nationality.

That said, I still found the book quite readable &amp; thought provoking. However, I would encourage all readers of this book to pursue at least a basic understanding of the philosophy / religion of Buddhism before taking on this puppy.Although much of what the western reader will find in these pages is antithical to western thought, I still found more than a few parallels. Many passages will bring to mind Plato's allegory of the cave, the &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; the philosophy of Hericlitus, the inscription of the Oracle of Delphi and various cantos from Dante's &quot;Inferno.&quot; That said, however, I believe the best approach is to attempt to engage the text on its own terms, at least at first. After one has held communion with this eloquent work on its own merit would be the more appropriate time to indulge in what Hegel would call &quot;synthesis&quot; between the two cultural paradigms.Perhaps what is most shocking in this book is just how much the Buddhist idea of the afterlife resembles solipsism. I have difficulty with the idea that everything I experience in the afterlife is a but a hallucination of my own invention. Perhaps I am the only one who finds that bizarre - I don't know. But it is nevertheless....unsettling.It must also be admitted that Buddhism is a rather dark &amp; pessimistic (if not morbid) philosophy / religion. The idea that it is better to escape the womb at birth with the efficacy of reaching Nirvana is.....somewhat alien to me. But, my opinion has little relevance in the scheme of things.This is a great book on ; your tour-guide thru the Bordo.

Stripped of culturally conditioned paraphernalia ( various Bodhisattvas, elaborate Mahayanist mythologies etc ), what remains is probably the most descriptive essay on the &quot;great beyond&quot; ( apart from Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot;, which I find even more aesthetically and cognitively persuasive, but greatly differing in spirit ).Among the greatest merits of the book are, IMO, a clear exposition of the Trikaya doctrine, ie. Mahayanist ontology; subtle psycho-spiritual analysis ( mainly in footnotes ) of 'Knower' ( principle of consciousness, caitanya or shes-pa - permanent reincarnating &quot;I&quot;: an entity in perfect concordance with Tantricism but not very plausible in Buddhist Theravada orthodoxy ) and visionary cartography of the three ( &quot;Divine&quot;( Chikai ), noetic/causal ( Chonyid ), and psychic/imaginal ( Sidpa )) supraphysical Bardo states/worlds.Probably the biggest failure is Jung's introduction, something that makes a man suspicious whether Jung had read &quot;Bardo Thodhol&quot; at all. Avalon's foreword is not bad, but also not very illuminating. What makes the book readable and understandable are Evans Wentz's intro and footnotes without which &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; would be a dry and dull read. Since inception of Wentz's &quot;Tibetan Canon&quot; ( 4- 5 books ) many eminent authors ( Chogyam Trungpa, Tarthang Tulku, Sogyal Rinpoche,..) have written numerous works on the Vajrayana, but, as far as I'm concerned- they haven't succeeded in surpassing these early masterpieces."},{"Title":"Tibetan Book of the Dead","review":"According to this text the mind is nine times sharper in the bardo.

Several different editions and translations exist, but the 1960 edition remains the \\"classical\\" one. Translated by Walter Evans-Wentz, it also contains introductory comments written by Carl Gustav Jung, Lama Govinda, John Woodruffe and Evans-Wentz himself. The editor has also appended extensive footnotes to the main text.\\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" is a translation of a Tibetan mortuary text, known in original as \\"Bar do thos grol\\". Or rather, it's a translation of a portion of a text from a genre known as \\"Bar do thos grol\\". The English title is the translator's. In original, the text is used by the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism.Those who read this book should also obtain a copy of \\"Prisoners of Shangri-La\\" by Donald Lopez, which contains the true story surrounding this mysterious book. It turns out that Evans-Wentz was a member of a New Religious Movement, the Theosophical Society. For this reason, his interpretations of the Tibetan text should be taken with a very large grain of salt. Thus, Evans-Wentz claims (on the authority of a real lama, no less) that Tibetan Buddhism has a secret message similar to that of Theosophy. Of course, there is no evidence whatsoever for such a claim. Another \\"lama\\" associated with this book, Anagarika Govinda, was actually a German national who couldn't even read Buddhist texts in their original language and claimed to have been initiated into the Kagyu sect. Lopez points out that the initiation ritual described by Hoffman (Govinda's real name) doesn't exist. In other words, \\"Lama\\" Govinda was something of a fraud. I readily admit that he seems to have been quite a character!This is all extremely interesting, even entertaining. But what about the actual Tibetan text? \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" describes the fate of the soul after death. Or something to that effect - officially, Buddhists don't believe in an actual \\"soul\\". After leaving the dying body, the soul passes through a number of intermediary states known as bardos. In each state, liberation from the cycle of rebirth can be achieved. If for some reason the soul doesn't accomplish this, it is reborn as a god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost or denizen of hell.The book describes the various bardos in chilling detail. At various points, the soul comes face to face with wrathful deities or is chased by demons. Small wonder Jung regarded the book as a description of a deliberately induced psychosis. (A later American commentary on the book, co-written by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, compares it to a psychedelic experience.) There are also certain similarities to a near-death experience. Depending on your psychological state of mind, \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" might strike you as boring, incomprehensible, absurd or downright scary! How I reacted the first time I read it, I won't disclose here.Regardless of what you think of this text, \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" plus all its forewords in the 1960 edition, are required reading for everyone interested in Tibet, Buddhism and above all comparative religion. What the book really tells us about the bardos is anybody's guess, but it does say a lot about how the Western mind wants to look at Tibet.

It is the 1897 edition. This book is very dry. The children moan when I bring it out, but it is serving it's purpose. I have to stop often (sometimes paragraph by paragraph) during oral reading to explain terms, summerize what is being said, and discuss the ideas. It is very thorough."},{"Title":"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (Illustrated Classic Editions)","review":"&quot;King Arthur and the knights of The Round Table&quot; is an excellent abridgement of mainly the first but also the end of the fourth of Howard Pyle's unabridged four King Arthor novels. It isn't detailed enough for adults or very advanced kids to enjoy. It got under four stars in my view, but I rounded up. This rating would only meet one for adults. This book has action, magic, and romance and all youngsters will love this version of King Arthor. It has the Athorian basics; such as Arthor suceeding in pulling out the magical sword in the stone to become King of England, breaking this sword in a duel and receiving the more powerful excalibur, the marrige of Arthor to the magestic Guinevire, and Sir Modred trying to take his own uncle's throne. The ending is a tragic one, but I will not give it away. The is only one drawback from this book and that is that this book does not include more than a few sentences about Arthor's knights. It has the Launcelot and Guinevere thing (only having them more innocent), but doesn't say much about the other amazing Knights. I would reccomend for adults or very advanced kids, other books by Howard Pyle and &quot;Morte D' Arthor&quot;. &quot;Mortte D' Arthor&quot; is intended for more mature readers, but isn't vulgar and sitcomedys are worse."},{"Title":"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (Illustrated Classic Editions)","review":"&quot;King Arthur and the Knights of The Round Table&quot; is an excellent book for readers who are young in age. It isn't quite four stars, but I rounded up. This grade is for children; as an adult book it would be only one star for the lack of detail and blood. This book is based on, the amazing aurthor and artist(unfortunately this book doesn't include his drawings), Howard Pyle's four King Arthur books; though this abridgement only includes some of the tales from the first and last of his series. It includes the basics of most Arthurian tales; the drawing of the seord in the stone, Arthur breaking this and then receiving the even more powerful sword excalibur, and Sir. Modred's atempt to take over the King's throne. This book also includes black and white pictures on every other page and have romantic and action stories which all young children will love. For adults or advanced children, I recommend &quot;Le Morte D' Arthur&quot; and other unabridged books by Howard Pyle. It should be said that &quot;Le Morte D' Arthur has some adult context, though it isn't vulgar and most advanced teens would be fine with it."},{"Title":"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (Illustrated Classic Editions)","review":"The story takes place in England in between 500-700 A.D. The main characters in the story are Arthur, who becomes King of England, Merlin, the great sorcerer, Guinevere, Arthurs queen, Morgana, Arhturs evil sister, and Sir Lacelot, Arthurs best friend and world's best knight who also falls in love with Queen Guinevere.The confict is man vs man.Arthur becomes king of England by pulling the sword form the stone.

Find this \\"knight\\" in King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A boy named Arthur, whose father died when he was just a baby, was given to a farmer to hide from the bad knights trying to take over his father's kingdom. Merlin, a powerful wizard who has a gift of telling the futures of others, but not his own, creates an obstacle to try to find the true king of England. The obstacle is a sword in a stone and whoever can pull it out, which eventually Arthur does, is king of all of England.The knight of the round table was brave, fearless, and daring to save his kingdom. He fought evil knights that plotted against him. He helped those in need and he pulled a marvelous sword from a stone. Journey to England and see this \\"Hero Knight\\" fight his enemies!King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is my favorite book that I ever read! I like the sword fighting action and all the knights fighting for King Arthur.

Though it lacks the artistic prose and wonderful illustrations of Howard Pyle, readers young and old will enjoy reading this magical tale of courage, romance, and adventure. Unlike some King Arthur stories for children which contain several loosely related stories, this book possesses a great deal of continuity. We learn about how Merlin advises Arthur, the story of the romance between Guinevere and Arthur, the origins of the Round Table, the fate of Merlin, and the end of Camelot. Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine make their appearance as well. The quest for the Holy Grail is not mentioned in this version. The editors of the Great Illustrated Classics series have done an excellent job with this classic story based on the Arthurian legends.

Correction - I have never before come across such a great story.Make no mistake about it, this is one of those books that, if you are fortunate enough to find stuck in some far flung second hand bookstore, you will devour every word.Wolhuter matter-of-factly explains his life from about age 10 when his adventures began in a South Africa that was every bit as wild as the American West, but with the added dangers of lions, hyenas and other dangerous beasts.Those of you expecting to read something derogatory about the natives though will be sadly disappointed. Wolhuter, in fact, obviuously was not blinded by prejudice for he was not fooled by rumors of uprisings that turned out to be false. Fortunately, though, Wolhuter spends no time discussing the natives and far less discussing the politics of the time that led to the Boer War and so forth. Indeed, although he did fight for the British side, one imagines through his narrative, that he could almost as easily fought for the Boer side, such is his empathy for friends and his antipathy for politics.I found his investigation of the scene following a lion kill of a native woman and her child to be riveting - surpassed only by his account of his own harrowing escape from death by two lions.Memories of a Game Ranger is a must read. Hollywood will discover this story soon and make it into a blockbuster, perhaps starring Kevin Costner or Harrison Ford."},{"Title":"Memories of a game-ranger","review":"One of the few books written by a dying breed of man.

It ranks up there with Reitz, Milford & Christy (\\"Foundations of Electromagnetic Theory\\") and Symon (\\"Mechanics\\") as one of the most-used textbooks in the upper-division undergraduate physics curriculum, and for very good reasons. While not detailed enough for graduate-level treatments (the standard in this case is Born and Wolf, \\"Principles of Optics\\"), as its title states, \\"Fundamentals of Optics\\" starts with the assumption that the reader knows absolutely nothing about optics and goes from there. Without getting bogged down in daunting mathematics (see \\"Principles of Optics\\" for that!), \\"Fundamentals of Optics\\" covers ALL of the main points of optics in a very consistently clear and concise manner, so much so that, after twenty years in the business of optical engineering, this book is STILL the first book I go to when I need to review a fundamental optical phenomenon (for actual optical engineering, I still rely on Smith, \\"Modern Optical Engineering\\"). Interestingly, some of the more complex aspects of Optics are handled better as chapters in \\"Fundamentals of Optics\\" than they are in whole books devoted to these topics! For example, the chapters in \\"Fundamentals of Optics\\" that deal with crystal optics and birefringence are pretty much the best treatments that I have ever found that actually explain the phenomenology without getting lost in the finer details. I refer to these chapters all the time in my work with solid-state lasers.This is a great book, and you won't regret owning it."},{"Title":"FUNDAMENTALS OF OPTICS - SECOND EDITION","review":"Like another reviewer stated, the authors here assume you know nothing about optics. Unlike Hecht's text on the subject they do not start out with wave theory, but instead start with lenses in part one and progress to wave optics in part two. When the authors finally get around to wave optics, they explain wave theory to the point of distraction - an entire chapter actually. Finally, part three discusses quantum optics, with chapters on lasers, holography, and the dual nature of light.The explanations here are largely prose. There is not much in the way of derivations if that is what you are looking for. Equations are presented, explained, and used in mathematical examples but not derived. The book is well-illustrated. Each chapter has a set of largely numerical problems with answers provided for the odd numbered problems. This is a great text for an undergraduate, particularly for engineers that are trying to approach the problem of learning optics - I say that because that is my background, and I appreciate the emphasis on problem solving coupled with solid explanations. Physicists will probably continue to prefer Hecht.The only thing I can really complain about is the sky-high price. I suggest looking for used copies, since if you are willing to live with such minor inconveniences as a crease in the cover and coffee stains on one corner that do not obscure the text, you can find usable copies out there for thirty dollars, as I did.

This is not a book that preaches to you, or offers advice that is difficult to follow. Although it was written over 50 years ago, everything said still holds true today.The reigning theme in this wonderful book is this: Anything you can conceive and believe, you can achieve. This simple yet powerful idea is proven via numerous examples, and the author offers multiple techniques, hints, advice, and even secrets - that will change your life forever.I think one of the reasons this book stands above any other books written by similar authors is that in each chapter, practically in every paragraph, the author finds a way to explain how this phenomenon works, and why it can work for anyone. If one example doesn't sink in with you, the next one will.If I had to pick one part of the book that changed my life more than anything, it would be the section on creating treasure maps. This technique alone has enabled the majority of my personal and professional dreams to become to reality. If I had to pick one book, which would be the only book I could read for the rest of my life, this would be it.

I got this book when I was \\"full swing\\" in my metaphysical/spiritual search for answers and it wasn't because he really said anything new that endeared me to this man's writings, what endeared me to this author was the way in which he said it.He is so convinced that Mind is the only Creative Power there was/is/will be that every page is filled with glorious reasons as to why this is so. He is a very thoughtful writer and encourages his readers to keep on keeping on in the pursuit of all that they desire to achieve. I know that even today, after almost 20 years on the spiritual/metaphysical path, I have those days where I doubt this \\"mind stuff\\"; that I just want to kick it to the curb and lead a \\"normal\\" life...whatever that means...and pretend that I have never even heard of this stuff, but then I will manifest something that I've been working on for some time, and I get in awe all over again at how true and valid and beautiful this mind stuff really is and I become very grateful that I am on the path that I am on.I have not read more of Robert Collier's books, which I am quite embarrassed to admit, because, as I mentioned in the first part of this review, he is often overlooked, and here I am overlooking him by not reading more of his stuff. My Amazon friend mentioned that his book 'Secret of the Ages' was featured in the beginning montage of the movie, The Secret. You would think after 30+ viewings of the movie, I would've noticed, well, I guess we really do learn something new every day.Perhaps, I will order this book very soon.You see, after 20 years of studying, practicing, and teaching classes based on this stuff, I have come to know, and rather joyfully I might add, that there is never anything \\"new\\" in metaphysics, but that does not mean it should ever become stale or boring, in fact, just the opposite is True. We should always be getting fresh insights, new lights should be turning on in our minds,hearts, and souls, new ways to apply this invaluable stuff to our lives should be taking place because Truth not applied is merely theory, but when we live our Truth...when we live our spirituality...our metaphysics, people look at us and say, \\"Why is your life so charmed? What do you do?\\"And in our heart of hearts, we'll know why; we were blessed enough by the Laws of Grace to have the gift of Truth brought to our awareness.Don't be telling me that you came to Truth, Truth came to you and \\"she\\" knocked, and you answered.(You can thank God, now.)Here's is hoping that you stay in awe; that you continue to plant new seeds in the garden of your mind, heart, and soul and that you reap an abundant harvest. Here is knowing that even now we are blessed, healed, and prospered and so it is.Peace & Blessings, friend..."},{"Title":"Riches within your reach: The law of the higher potential","review":"Robert Collier's book is premised on biblical fundamentals and points to the starting point of much of what is written as self development and self improvement literature today. It brings an informed basis of rethinking one's view on life's possibilities and point's to the underlying and foundational thinking in most of today's literature - book worth purchasing for your library."},{"Title":"Riches within your reach: The law of the higher potential","review":"I received a copy of this book some 25 years ago, as a young man, from my Mother's estate after she had passed away. Myself and my siblings were given the opportunity to look over her things and decide what we wanted. There was this box of old books that had been given to her decades earlier by her brother John, a priest. I flipped this book open and was immediately amazed at the content. Especially for a young person just starting out, this book is full of extremely useful knowledge about how the universe works. I have read it over and over since then and will read it again for sure. My mom certainly left me treasure.In this book, Robert Collier describes how the power of God operates in the universe, how to develop faith and motive yourself, and how to pray and utilize the law of attraction for success. This book is an absolute must read for anyone who wants to improve their understanding of the way of the universe is and how to succeed - it is so insightful. It is full of step by step, easy to understand, methods that work and I am sure anyone can implement. I highly recommend this book and can say that it was helpful in formulating some aspects of my book entitled: The Master of Evolution: An Illustrated Voyage of Truth and Light http://amzn.com/0988027526.

Even more telling is the life of the soldier after he came home--what happened with his friends, family, and his own personal life. This book is not only for and about the veteran, but for any one who lived through the WAR in Vietnam. The reader will find an attachment with the individuals in each chapter, and find themselves drifting back in time to those days that they had tried so hard to forget or hide.The pains of a long-past war are revealed here--told by those who have lived with the pain daily for 30+ years. Their stories are a beacon pointing the way toward respect for the soldiers of today, and rememberance of those who went before."},{"Title":"Vietnam - Our Story - One on One","review":"I, like a lot of other Veterans, do not induldge in a lot of reading on the Vietnam war. It is much to hard for us to go back to that place with our minds. Mainly because our bodies will follow. This is a way of life for us. Alot of books talk of Vietnam and the hardships and life of the soldiers. This book goes right to the heart of the subject. This book lets the soldier that was there in that foxhole or bunker tell what he saw and felt. He told it with vivid unabridged clarity, that is the only way that it can be told and told truefully. This book is one that a veteran will pick up many times. He may not be able to read it all at once. But even after he has read the whole book, he will go back to the book again and again. This book should be read by every American.

Each time I took a test in your book I improved my score on the next one, using your great instructional material and strategies.

After reading your specific advice on how to improve after each test, I increased my score steadily on each upcoming tests in your book. By the time I got to the last test in your book, I scored 1520.

That's more important, I feel--learning to get answers right the intellectual way than using gimmicks and tricks like the Kaplan and Princeton Rewiew folks teach you.Tons of practice, refreshing almost everything you need from Math (lacking High Logic and Pattern problems and how to attack them).Only thing I have a problem with is that I think the Verbal section lacks a little &quot;substance&quot;.

The word lists are simply amazing, and the idea of categorizing synonyms really helped so much that two years after taking the SAT, I still remember most of the word lists (example: PRAISE :- &quot;acclaim, applaud, commend, eulogize, ...&quot;). Some of the words in these lists are a little easy, but that's what helped me remember them even more (It would have been very intimidiating to read a word list in which ALL words were new!).There are many useful practice tests, and quite a few of them are amazingly similar to (but a little harder than) the ones you will find on actual tests.I ended up with a pretty good score in the end: 800M (as before) and 700+V (much better than before!).

Mabel Dodge Luhan led a fascinating life from being born into the \\"first circle\\" in Victorian Buffalo NY, to recreating a Renaissance villa in Florence, Italy, to her stint as a New York City \\"salon\\" hostess, to her discovery of the austere landscape of New Mexico and Native American philosophy. This abridged autobiography does omit explanations of some of the people Mabel encounters in her life so it may create momentary confusion, but these little hiccups are more than compensated for by the overall story Mabel weaves in her inimitable style, recounting her unique life.

Thomas died in 1995, and most of his books are either out of print or difficult to find. Many people consider CHINAMAN'S CHANCE to be Thomas' best novel, so I thought I would give it a shot.In short, I liked this book but didn't love it. This is a book brimming with wit and intelligence. It was obviously written by a highly intelligent, perceptive man -- Thomas is a highly skilled wordsmith. However, I found the plot remarkably convoluted. The blurb from the NEW YORKER for this book states that CHINAMAN'S CHANCE has \\"enough plot to overwhelm a trilogy\\" and I agree with that statement. Unfortunately, too much plot is not necessarily such a good thing. I ultimately found the storyline confusing and the twist-filled ending kind of ridiculous.Also, there are too many colorful characters in this novel to keep track of. Every couple of pages, Thomas changes the point of view. Virtually every character is eccentric and over-the-top. This can be fun, but I thought it was overdone here. There was no one in this book I related to, and I never found myself emotionally invested in the storyline.In the end, CHINAMAN'S CHANCE is okay if you like witty, humorous caper novels. But if you're looking for a book with genuine thrills and characters you genuinely care about, you may want to look for something else."},{"Title":"Chinaman's Chance","review":"I chose to stop reading the book due to the wide usage of foul language."},{"Title":"Chinaman's Chance","review":"Lifelong pals since they hooked up in a San Francisco orphanage, Artie Woo and Quincy Durant are two of the best characters you'll come across in any thriller.

Chinaman's Chance takes place in the greater Los Angeles of the 1970's and features recurring Thomas characters Artie Wu, Quincy Durant and Otherguy Overby (seeVoodoo LtdandOut on the Rim).To refer to the plotting as byzantine doesn't do it justice. Thomas tirelessly piles on imaginative subplots throughout the course of the narrative forcing the reader to continually reassess the nature of the underlying mystery.The search for a dead congressman's mistress (a famous folk singer in her own right) is somehow connected to both an eccentric mob figure and a rogue CIA agent. Not to mention a former Marine sergeant trying to peddle a Ho Chi Minh City treasure map.Ross Thomas had a real knack for creating quirky characters, memorable for their eccentricities. Chinaman's Chance has an abundance of such characters all of whom are hilariously described.Bottom line: Chinaman's Chance is a richly plotted novel with great characters.

Nurture the Heart, Feed the World has certainly broadened my interpretation of \\"foreign policy.\\"Nurture the Heart, Feed the World is a delightful autobiography written by Dr. Leon Hesser. The book tells how he used his background in agricultural economics to increase the production of food on three continents. In some ways, the book could almost be considered a co-autobiography, if there is such a thing. Dr. Hesser writes often about his wife, Dr. Florence Hesser. Starting with their early years, exploring youth, marriage and family, the reader learns about Dr. Leon Hesser's interest in farming, as well as his wife's initial reluctance to live on a farm. Their various foreign postings made sure that they and their family experienced a wide range of cultures and climates. Dr. Florence Hesser had a great deal of success as Professor of Education and Director of the Reading Center at The George Washington University. Her career, like his, has been very interesting and has touched many lives.The book is filled with so many pictures, I felt like I was having a private showing of a family photo album! In my opinion, this added significant value to the book. Many books of this nature have a selection of pictures all together toward the middle. However, Nurture the Heart, Feed the World spaced pictures throughout the book, so they were in context with the print. Moreover, nearly all of the pictures had captions underneath.Born in the Midwest, Leon Hesser earned a Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University. His subsequent career as a Foreign Service Officer in the Agency for International Development, U.S. Department of State took him and his family to various postings around the globe. Currently, he and his wife, Dr. Florence Hesser lead a very active retirement life in Naples, Florida.

Neither the wine nor the cookie had any special qualities but together they were wonderful."},{"Title":"Red Wine With Fish: The New Art of Matching Wine With Food","review":"Book is ok if not a bit dated. Got the title from a list of books after I took a course on wines. Nice reference to have but I think there are likely more contemporary books out there."},{"Title":"Something Ventured: Telecourse Guide","review":"I really liked this book. It ended up taking the place of the main text because it outlined everything so well &amp; provided a lot of good information. It contained all the notes I would have taken from the book, except with this book I didn't have to. It is also really easy to justify buying this book, which is useful, to the point, a quarter of the size of the text and a third the price."},{"Title":"The Baker Street Reader: Cornerstone Writings About Sherlock Holmes (Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture)","review":"This is an excellent selection of classic BSI (Baker Street Irregulars) and other criticism on the Sherlock Holmes stories, with entries by such famous Sherlockians as Rex Stout, Vincent Starrett, Christopher Morley, etc. Most of the individual articles are available elsewhere, but as a compiliation of essential writings about Holmes this is hard to beat. Mr. Shreffler does a fine job of sorting the wheat from the chaff -- I have dozens of books on this subject, and if you are only going to purchase one Sherlockian book in your life (but who in their right mind would ever do that?), this book would be a fair choice.Two potential caveats for newcomers: 1) I am not sure why this book is so expensive; perhaps the number of remaining copies is limited. When I acquired my copy a few years ago, it was substantially cheaper. If you're on a tight budget, you can probably get more Sherlockian bang for your buck elsewhere. 2) Keep in mind that this is almost entirely a compilation of SHERLOCKIAN criticism, as opposed to the more conventional brand. In other words, the articles proceed under the tongue-in-cheek assumption that Holmes & Watson were real people -- thus, this book will probably not help you very much if you are looking for sources for an academic, literary study of Doyle's work. If you are reading for personal enjoyment, though, and have the cash, it's great fun, and **highly** recommended.A fine addition to this volume would be Shreffler's \\"Sherlock Holmes by Gas-Lamp\\", which includes highlights of the first 40 years of the Baker Street Journal."},{"Title":"Moroccan Collection: Traditional Flavors from Northern Africa","review":"From fiery chillied fish to cooling, refreshing mint tea the Moroccan Collection by author Hilaire Walden is full of inspiration and atmosphere. The beautiful photos and book layout are evocotive of souk markets with their vibrant colours and aromas but at the same time give clear illustrations of what the food should look like when recreated at home.The recipes are well laid out with the majority accompanied by a photo. Ingredients are listed in bold type to one side of the page, the method is given in a clear numbered sequence, and best of all most recipes have a short explanation of the dish's history or some background to the ingredients. Ingredients used are those found easily in the west and explanations of traditional methods are given when they are no longer necessary to acheive the desired results today - for instance when using 'instant' couscous. Walden has also adapted the recipes, when necessary, to suit a western palate for example reducing the amount of oil used traditionally in some recipes. No Moroccan book worth its salt would be without lots of lamb and seafood (of many varieties) and chicken recipes, but there are also lots of grain and vegetable dishes and some luscious middle eastern sweets. Yummy!Sit back with this book and soak up the atmosphere - or - head straight for your (better equipped than the Moroccan home) kitchen and whip up a dinner of nutty couscous and rice salad accompanied by saffron chicken with apricots."},{"Title":"Moroccan Collection: Traditional Flavors from Northern Africa","review":"&quot;The Morocco Collection&quot; is authentic and accurate. The recipes are easy to follow and have ingredients most of us can find in the US. I really recommend &quot;Moroccan Prawns with Spices&quot;.

No stone is left unturned. You will need to be REALLY interested in the subject, because the book is long. However, it is well-written. Robert strikes you as a real man of flesh and blood; not just a name from history books. His wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, is a feisty match for him and their love story adds spice to the tale."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"After seeing Braveheart in the theatres 4 years ago, and seeing it over and over again on video, the flame that this movie has sparked in me still has not abated. That is one of the reasons why I went searching for a book to read about Sir William Wallace. Am I glad that I did a little research ahead of time and chose to read about Robert the Bruce instead! The man was so admirable, I can't even begin to express my esteem for him!Based on the reviews that I read on this page, I decided to buy Nigel Tranter's account of The Bruce's life versus all the other readily available biographies. I couldn't have made a better decision!My life was put on hold while reading this book! I just could not put it down! I would read a little of it in the morning, go to work, and come home and read it some more in the evening until the wee hours of the morning! That's how consuming this book was!This book was so good, and the man revealed was so nobel, that I almost wished they had portrayed him more accurately in the movie. Just almost...since Braveheart is my most favorite movie of all time. If they had made it any differently, I might not have been so inspired, might never have gone searching, might never have read this book....Well, whether it is sad to say or not, my life is back to normal now, since I have just finished this book this past weekend. But my spirit will never be the same again. Thank you King Robert, for the inspiring life that you lived. Thank you Mr. Tranter, for putting it into words."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"The saga of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, contaporary of William Wallace, is enthralling in its vivid imagery and detail.

A brilliant achievement for Nigel Tranter and very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"With my interest in Scottish history, I found this story a good way to learn more about the Scottish Wars of Independence. While it may not be historically accurate, it is a stirring tale of the difficult journey of Bruce to the high kingship over Scotland."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"The movie Braveheart (one of my favorites) inspired me to read the Wallace Trilogy which in turn inspired me to read this outstanding trilogy. Both trilogies are outstanding, and after having read both Robert the Bruce has left a deeper impression upon me than William Wallace, something I would have never believed. A movie of Robert the Bruce should be made which does him justice. His portrayal in Braveheart (although I like Angus McFadden's character) doesn't do him justice after reading this. The Bruce of this trilogy is a character I will remember a long time. I read on the internet Mel Gibson bought the rights to Steps to the Empty Throne. Make the movie Mel!!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I read this a few months ago. I was recovering from a back injury and thankfully I had this book with me. There aren't many books that pull this level of detail and numerous character introductions without overwhelming the reader. It engages you from the beginning and gets better and better as you read. I let out a long breath when I was done,and I actually felt as if I had accomplished the deed of freeing Scotland myself. Spectacular!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I wanted to know more about the Scottish war for independence. There are a lot of romance novels featuring handsome Scottish warriors but frankly I wanted to try to understand the actual history behind it without having to wade through dry details. I do not know how true to historical record this collection of 3 novels are but it feels very realist. It is horrifying what the Scottish people had to endure at the hands of the English. It was a very brutal period of history (\\"Braveheart\\"). The problems that Robert Bruce and his people faced were enormous.Bruce was a young man when he got caught up in the struggle. He could only guess what actions to take. The author does an excellent job in fictional form trying to interpret what it must have been like for him. There are cautionary lessons here for current times. This collection is for anyone intrigued by the choices made by rulers and the ruled. As this is three novels in one, it is a huge book. It is not something easily carried around but very worth reading."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I do not read many books but I was introduced to Robert the Bruce through another book called \\"The Great Scot\\". I searched for another book on the subject and came across this one. For any person who does not read that often, the book is extremely long but the author kept is so interesting that it didn't require any work to read. Everything flowed together neatly and sufficient amount of details were added to give your imagination enough data to create the whole scenario in your head. Very good job by the author!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Tranter has written so many excellent books about midieval Scotland - the Bruce Triology is my alltime favourite!!!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"The Brue Trilogy is without a doubt the finest book to be written for a very long time.It is as exact and detailed as it is well written with flair and passion.Mr Tranter has given this fool great pleasure by bringing such an amazing and near perfect book to print.I refuse to say even the remotest thing about the book...just incase i do spoil it for any of you...But to let you all know...this is where the true Black Douglas comes from...simply breath taking!...and for the record....im English...and it made even me feel bad and good at times...All that remains to be said is....Thank you for sharing your talants Mr Tranter."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"If you have seen the movie 'Braveheart' and want to know more, but have time only to read one book, then this is the one for you (OK - it's three books in one!)

(MacBraveHeart, May 1999)"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Tranter succeeds in bringing to life all the characters from this crucial period of Scottish history. His portrayal of Robert the Bruce presents a hero of the greatest magnitude - a man every great leader of the modern world should be familiar with.Our hero, Robert Bruce, is introduced as a young dandy in British high society - a protege of his future nemesis, Edward the first of England. His struggles to gain freedom from the oppressive English monarchy for the Scottish people make for a marvelous tail of adventure, romance and heroism, well ended with the tale of Sir James Douglas and the Brave Heart.The historical accuracy of this story makes it an important read for any fan of the medieval British history."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I had much pleasure reading &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; and &quot;The Wallace&quot; both by Nigel Tranter, and both at the same time, as events were concurrent. I have read nearly all of this author's books and these are two of my favorites. Not the most favorite but perhaps 3rd and 4th.The film director of &quot;Braveheart&quot; should have done a little more research as he would have discovered that Robert the Bruce would have, according to the legend, been the true Braveheart. When you read the book, witness what it was that Jamie Douglas cried out as he made his fatal charge against all odds, and find out why........here is the Brave Heart."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Containing three books originally published under separate titles, this trilogy tells the story of Robert the Bruce, who became King Robert I of Scotland. It begins with THE STEPS TO THE EMPTY THRONE, which portrays an impetuous strong-willed young man who agrees to co-govern the country with his personal enemy in an attempt to win its independence from England. The effort soon fails and Bruce steps down, but then he makes a separate move to unite Scotland under his sole leadership. Amongst much internal fighting, he makes great strides.The second book, THE PATH OF THE HERO KING, reveals a passionate, courageous leader who has learned to win over some of those who would oppose him through a mix of diplomacy and cunning. The winning doesn't come easily, though. Bruce is excommunicated as well as harassed by Edward I's efforts to keep Scotland under England's control. This story culminates in the Battle of Bannockburn, which was an amazing win for the Scots.THE PRICE OF THE KING'S PEACE, the third book, tells of the years of struggle to obtain a peace treaty from England after Bannockburn. During this time, Bruce's brother takes Scotland's fight into Ireland in a blatant ploy for power. Bruce's dealings in this treachery reveal a savvy leader, whose goals ever are to strengthen Scotland's independence. The story ends with his death.All told, the trilogy covers about 1296 to 1328. Tranter is at his best when describing the history while the interaction between characters is sometimes stilted. Nonetheless, lovers of historical fiction will enjoy the action and adventure as well as a story that sticks close to the facts. I enjoyed books 2 and 3 the most."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I, being of Scottish descent, found this book to be especially informative and compelling. Tranter gives such life to all the characters and such detail regarding the progression of conflict between the Scots and the English that the book is a real treasure. Just as many North American tribes learned they had to unite so the different tribal organizations within Scotland itself had to learn to co-operate with each other to have any chance at defeat King Edward's armies. One understands what is at stake for Scotland...it's people and culture destroyed by the English for England's own gain or win the right through suffering and bloodshed to live as Scots in a country of their own design. I devoured this book."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I have owned this book for years. I've read it six times. End up with tears in my eyes every time when the King and the Primate look back over their lives together, fighting for the freedom of their beloved country.A HUGE story that will totally engulf you in the lives of the characters. If my house were burning down, I would return to rescue this one!!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"This is the third book in a trilogy on the life and times of Robert the Bruce, King Robert I of Scotland.

Nigel Tranter is (was) an awesome author, great attention to factual historic details. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Hi again, friends;THis little review is to let you all know,( not that you really care) what i am reading, now. I have purchased about 20 books the last half-year, and have read approximately 11 of them. From Dostoevsky (2), Dumas(3), Tolstoy (1),Joel C. Rosenberg (2) Margaret George (1), B. Cornwell (1) now N. Tranter's \\"Bruce Trilogy\\"( is that 1 or 3 ??). I am 2/3 of the way through it and it is very exciting. The Battle of Bannockburn at the end of Book 2 was so real, it seemed Mr. Tranter was actually there. The characters are well-drawn and come in and out of the story at just the right times. Robert the Bruce comes across as a truly very human person who was humble and wise. Yes he did terrible things that we could not stand for in our time, but they couldn't be helped. The King Edwards' ( pere & fils ) were vicious to the extreme in regards to there Scottish subjects( ahem ).If there is a flaw in the book it's the archaic Scottish dialect that grates on our modern ears. some of the terminology of the landscapes were hard to figure out, at first, but I think ive got the meaning of them If someone does a new edition of this work in the future, maybe a glossory of terms or footnotes would be helpful to those not familiar with the Scottish dialect.In the future, I may look into Diana Galbaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series and the \\"Outlandish Companion\\" to get some of these straight in my mind.I'm going to try and finish the 3rd book of the Trilogy by the weekend, then I think I'll tackle the \\"Tales of Genji\\" or \\" A Suitable Boy\\" ( or maybe something heavier, heh, heh ).Keep reading, everyone and enjoy your favorite authors and books.I recommend this book, highly!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I am nearly 52 years of age and not much given to callow enthusiasm but after reading the story of King Robert I can say that the Scots are very fortunate to have Mr. Tranter. If only our own country were so blessed. On a scale of 1 to 10 I say 1000."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I first read this book about four years ago. I am a sasanach Englishman and it made me ashamed to be English. The book instilled in me a passion for Scotland which has not diminished even to the point of calling my two sons: Robert Bruce and Jamie Douglas, though I have to say my Jamie is much sweeter than the Black Douglas portrayed. Nige Tranters book is a passionate account of the fight for Scotland's freedom from the English invaders but also a contest between the warring faction Scots tribes. It has all the hallmarks of a Shakespeare tragedy including Politics, Love, Backstabbing, Murder, Duplicity etc. It is for all of this that I am purchassing this book again. My last one has been worn out."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"The Bruce Trilogy is actually a set of three separate novels written by Tranter about Robert the Bruce of Scotland, and I think enough previous reviewers have stated the basic outline of the novels that I don't need to restate it again. This was a fascinating story of an honorable, courageous man and an incredible military tactician, and his battle for freedom and peace for Scotland from the English, and most especially Edward I and II. The author did a marvelous job bringing not only Robert to life, but the secondary characters as well. I did find the third book, The Price of the King's Peace to be a bit slower than the first two, but in the end culminating into a spectacular finish as Scotland and Robert find peace at last.Well worth taking the time to read this for anyone interested in this period in history, I found it both fascinating and educational at the same time, and isn't that what historical fiction is for after all? And I loved the epilogue with James Douglas as he made his final battle cry, \\"Lead on Brave Heart\\". Although I am probably the only person on the face of the planet who hasn't seen the movie. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"A quality read without question. I was with The Bruce. I struggled right along with him.. My my, I cried at the end, and at some parts in between.. Mr. Tranter was a talented man who knew his country and its history well. Whoever said that Tranter cannot write like Penman, I say, read it again. To love your country, to give up everything and everyone for the good of it.. Wow, Im off to read Wallace, for he is in this novel as well, and just makes it enough that I am happy that he has his own tale to tell."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"The Bruce Triology is an oustanding work detailing the life and times of Robert the Bruce. Fictionalized or not, it creates for the reader a real place in time and the reader shares the atmosphere of time and place. The terrain, the battles, the people, all come alive in this book. A great book that leaves several of the other books by Tranter lacking. If this book is truly based on historical facts and events, then the movie Braveheart is an interesting tool to compare and contrast for they have little in common."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Another excellent novel from Nigel Tranter which vividly brings the period of Scottish history &quot;The Wars of Independence&quot; too life. Mr. Tranter masterfully weaves his story &amp; set it out on a template of people &amp; places that you almost feel you can relate too. His characterisation of &quot;The Bruce&quot; is excellent as well, shown almost as a man torn between ambition &amp; a duty to his people. I wish I could give this book more marks than 10, that's how much an impression it made on me. Excellent!!!! :o)))"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"A good historical treatment which is all the more enjoyable thanks to the period language used by the author.

It is well written in that the reader can actually enter into the character feelings and situations."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Great historical fiction is my specialty and discovering Nigel Tranter has been a real treat. This the first thing I have read by this author and for me it was also a fine introduction to a crucial period of Scottish history. This 3 part series covers the life of Robert Bruce, a truly dashing and gallant hero if there ever was one, and it is a true rags to riches story. The whole series is well written and though lengthy is a pleasure to read with a medieval feel to it. There are many battle scenes throughout the book, and detailed strategies described, the Scots being so outnumbered by the English had to be very clever to win.Book 1 - Opens with Bruce in his 20's, a spoiled young nobleman, forced like all the other Scottish nobles to pay homage to Edward of England and be his lackey. Later his meeting with Elizabeth de Burgh, and finally the birth of his ambition.Book 2 - Hitting rock bottom with the capture and executions of his brothers, the imprisonment of his wife, and his other female relatives kept in cages, he is finally driven into the wilderness to live as a hermit. Eventually, he rises again and is able to unite the many clans and tribes from the northern Highlands with the Norman/Celt mixed nobles from the south to fight together for the common cause of Scotland. Part 2 finishes with the Battle of Bannockburn.Book 3 - Finally the undisputed King in Scotland though there is still the ongoing struggle to have England recognize Bruce as King of Scotland.A novel I will enjoy reading again, especially loved the parts about Christina MacRuarie, ruling woman of the isles, also the Highland chiefs and sea captains. So much historical detail with never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I have now read this book 3 times and enjoyed more each time. The book starts with the Scottish throne sitting empty and Edward of England ruling Scotland. The young Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce and his younger brothers are enjoying the attentions of Edward and living a care free life.Two events change all this, the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which unites the common Scots people behind a commoner called William Wallace, and the slaying of the Red Comyn at Berwick, on holy church ground. Robert immediately declares himself King of Scots.What follows is a marvellous account and insight into a remarkable period of Scottish history. The way Tranter protrays Bruce's internal turmoil, of being excomincated from Mother church, worrying over his diseased body and the consist struggle to free Scotland ; the obsession that Edward Plantagent has with crushing Scotland and the hounding of Bruce, keeps the reader's fullest attention.This book is a must. Superb, excellent, buy it."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I first was introduced to Nigel Tranter when I bought this book in a castle gift shop on a visit to Scotland. On my next visit, I bought every Tranter book I could find as this book was so fabulous! In fact, after reading many, I think it's his best work, and I continually read it again and again. No other book can bring Scotland to life as this does. It allows you to get into the heads of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace like no other book does. You HAVE to read this book! A 10 is not praise enough."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"There are many great writers in the field of historical fiction. But there are few storytellers. Storytellers are so much more than a writer. In the Gaelic, they are called seanchaidh and they were the keepers of stories, lore and history of the Clans, the historian, the recorder. When the seanchaidh wove his tales of magick, Auld Gods or warrior-kings of Scotland, he was not recanting something created from his mind; he was passing on oral heritage that was handed down through the ages.Nigel Tranter was a seanchaidh, and he is sadly missed. Yes, he was a highly successful writer, but he was so much more, and in the tradition of old, he wove many tales of Ancient Scotland as few historians could.And THE BRUCE TRILOGY is Tranter at his best (a wee bit redundant since Tranter was always at his best). Tranter created the three books of the Trilogy to bring forth the tale of Robert Earl of Carrick who went on to become Robert the King, but he does not just tells the story, he brings Bruce alive for you to meet, to understand. He was a young man caught at the centre of Scotland's struggles. It was a separate country from England, having its own kings since the dawn of time, but Edward Plantagenet - called Edward Longshanks because of his great height and long legs - was determined to unite all of Britain. Two men stood in his way: William Wallace and Robert Bruce. Wallace (see Tranter's THE WALLACE) was a shooting star that lit the conscious mind, giving cry to a national identity Scotland often lacked, since Clan ties and oaths were generally put before homage to the King. Wallace created the spark, in common man and noble alike, that Scotland was a country and would never bow down to the English King. By very nature of whom he was, a commoner, Wallace drew Edward's wrath as no noble ever would, so Wallace's pivotal roll in Scotland's struggle to remain free was cut short. It then fell to Bruce save Scotland, a man in his twenties, who not only had to fight his family's role for him, Edward's attempt to bend him and control him while at English court, but ultimately saw him fighting 2/3 of his own Country due the mighty Clan Comyn's determination to put one of their own on the throne. You feel for Bruce, his loss of his family, the imprisonment of his wife, sister and daughter, jealousy of his brother, and maybe will understand him more as man after reading this. So much power and force behind the man and the story as only Tranter could deliver.This is a complex history, since Bruce often was seen as serving himself more than Scotland, witnessing him making homage to Edward on four separate occasions. But you learn why Bruce bought his time, played both ends against the middle, and succeeded where Wallace failed. Tranter does not just tell you these events happened, he make you see Bruce the man, not the man who would be king. Tranter opens a door into Scotland's past, and permits you to walk with him, walk with Bruce, not as a historical figure, not a King, but as a man, faults, fears and all.This is a magick that transcends being a writer, even a very good writer. This is a tale told with wonder, passion and awe by fireside by a seanchaidh.If you have never read Tranter, I cannot image a better introduction to Scotland's Seanchaidh. Once you read him, you will hungrily devour the rest of his works.WISE WRITERS AND READERS Recommended Read"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I purchased &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; from the Gift Shop at the National Wallace Monument in Stirling, Scotland during a recent visit. I was already learning a tremendous amount about Sir William Wallace but wished to learn more about the complex, mysterious Monarch known as Robert the Bruce. I could not have asked for a better resource. Nigel Tranter's narrative prose takes you from Bruce's early day's as a young Earl still on courting terms with Edward I of England through his transformation into Scotland's Savior and Liberator. I also enjoyed learing about the historical innacuracies surrounding other resources such as the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; of which there were so very many. But most of all, &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; leaves one with a deep appreciation of what the Scots went through and survived as a people and a nation in the face of a level of adversity and aganist odds that could scarcely be imagined--even by today's standard's. Nigel Tranter is truly a gift to the realm of Scotland and the realm of literature alike. A marvelous piece of work."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Although the film Braveheart is tremendously entertaining, it suffers as history. Part of the problem is that it is based on Randall Wallace's book rather than Nigel Tranter's. Nigel Tranter was the pre-eminent historical novelist of Scotland, and although William Wallace's tale is epic, it pales in comparison to the life of Robert the Bruce. Bruce's life is so full of adventure, tragedy, heroism, intrigue, and statesmanship, that any author of fiction would be hard pressed to just imagine the story line ... but this is based on factual events. A must read."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Nigel Tranter is an amazing author. He has brought all Scottish history to life with his series of Scottish historical novels. You can tell his research is incredible and he keeps things historically correct down to the detail. He just adds emotion and dialogue the way he thinks it happened. These are more history than fiction. It is History that breathes. This is the story of Robert the Bruce and how he went through amazing times of hardship and despair to claim the throne of Scotland and free them from English rule. This was my first Tranter book. I will not rest until I have read them all. Anyone of Scottish blood or even just interested in Scottish history should read this book. There is no dry factual text here. It is pure life, emotion and thought. Robert the Bruce lives again through Nigel Tranter."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I can't add any more to the other reviews except to say it's the best novel I've ever read. After reading it I acquired dozens of Tranter's other works, including many from the Bannockburn gift shop, and have been absorbed in nearly all, but none are as good as The Bruce Trilogy."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"This book is well writtten from beginng to end, very accurate despite the book being fiction. I had real problems putting the book down because of the drama that was Scotland.This book is a must for history lovers everywhere with romance, murder,wars,backstabbing and man's greed for money above their country.The bruce shows what live was like in Scotland in the early 13th centuary as brutal and short. It is a reminder of what a major achevement Scotland had against hugely overwhelming odds.This man put up with every indignities imagineable, including his sister and wife being caged outside for many years.This is a great read for me as I live near many of places in the book, Melrose Abbey being the main one.I highly reccomend this book to anyone intrested in war and romance novels. Brillant !!!"},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"Nigel Tranter is one of those exceptional authors that can bring a half remembered (or half forgotten?) legend to life. The depth of his research is apparent as is the feel of and for his country and social conditions prevailing at the time of the story. His coverage of the obvious gaps in history, (caused by Edward's desire to destroy the culture as well as later events that destroyed the records) pass unnoticed. He truly is a master of the genre.Tranter's story of the Bruce is told with depth, passion and a style that can transport the reader so that they live the story as it unfolds. The characters are superb as are the depictions of the events (political, military and otherwise) leading to the re-establishment of the King of Scots. In all highly commendable."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"I received the book ordered promptly and on time. We are well pleased with the purchase. My sister-in-law purchased volume 1 and I now have volume 3. We will share when we go the mountains for vacation. Thanks for sending the book so quickly."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"After quickly plowing through this book in 3 weeks, because it was due back to the Library, I decided to read it again, taking copious notes and locating the places mentioned on a map of 13th century Scotland. I am now a proud owner of my very own copy of this magnificent book. I have added this book to my most favorite books of all time and it sits along side other 1000 page tomes like: \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" \\"World without end,\\" \\"Shogun,\\" \\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\\", and several others that are my constant companions. The Bruce trilogy will take you to the depths of despair and then elevate you to new heights as you live with Robert the Bruce from his brash beginnings, growing into a man and winning Scotland. This book allows you to do what truly great books should do; transport you to the time and allows you to live as a companion with Robert, William Wallace and Edward \\"Longshanks\\". Read and let yourself be absorbed in the life of \\"Bruce the Hero King\\" at the turn of the 14th century."},{"Title":"Path of the Hero King","review":"This is the fourth copy of The Bruce Trilogy I have purchased over the years.

The bibliography is among the best organized I have seen in a medical text. I am hopeful the publishers will continue this series with annual, or semi-annual updates."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This gorgeous, compelling, heartfelt story is everything a novel should be. On Halloween Eve, Oisin, a middle-age recluse living on an island off the coast of Maine, finds a child ghost in his house who, at his touch, is given life. Aisling had died as a child on the shores of the island, a victim of a shipwreck and a debilitating voyage to escape the potato famine in Ireland. She awakens in Oisin his own longing for his long-dead twin sister Nieve. As Aisling grows up at a frantic rate, the two must face their pasts and origins, who they were and are, as well as the special relationship between them.If the plot sounds maudlin, the novel is anything but. In Carey's capable hands, readers are guided through the intricacies of these two lives without sentimentality or melodrama. The lyrical prose is infused with the ache of longing, and the story finds the perfect balance between the past and the present, with a fully realized nineteenth century Ireland contrasting with a contemporary Maine.I can't recommend this book highly enough. Of all the books I've read this year, this one has lingered longest in my heart."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This book is a beautiful, melancholy flight of fancy from beginning to end. It's exhilarating the way Lisa Carey breaks the rules about what's allowed to happen in a novel. Ghosts are main characters, myths are real, communication with the dead commonplace. I read this book in one sitting--it was so bizarre I just had to keep turning the page to see what would happen next.Carey intertwines harsh reality with the magical and mythical. The details about the Irish famine, the tons of food that were exported from the country while over a million people starved to death, and the horrible conditions on board the &quot;coffin ships&quot; are all--sad to say--historically accurate. It may seem morbid to some, but for the ancestors of those who crossed the Atlantic in those ships--or were buried at sea along the way--the famine is a watershed event that will remain embedded in our psyche for generations, like one of Carey's characters who die but stubbornly refuse to go away."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This vividly-told love story is so difficult to describe to others that you will find yourself simply buying copies for friends and family rather than risk spoiling the chance for them to experience the tale themselves. Lisa Carey's unpretentious writing style delivers an engrossing romance complemented by brilliant imagery. You will spend hours after reading the last page, repeating the seductive storytelling to yourself."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This book is awesome! I have never read anything like it. The characters were interesting and well written, the plot was unlike anything I had ever read, and the details were fascinating. I feel like I am gushing, but the book left me with such a feeling of peace when I was done reading it.The story is completely fictional, but I could &quot;see&quot; the characters and &quot;hear&quot; their voices. The idea that there are people out there to help those who have died along their way is something that has interested me, even though I don't totally buy into the theory. The parts of the story with the young Oisin and his twin Nieve countered with those of Aisling and her brother are heart rending.The novel is one of a reawakening and a realization that one can overcome the losses faced in your youth. Through Aisling, Oisin is able to absolve himself of his guilt for the death of his twin, and Aisling is able to achieve the one thing she was denied while she was alive.This is a wonderful book, and I would heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm so glad I took her advice!! Anyone who values beautiful writing and a haunting love story would really be missing out by not reading this book. I had chills most of the way through, and was crying (on the subway, no less) when it was over. One of the best books I read in 2000, without a doubt, and I read a lot."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"Oisin is a lonely artist who has cared for no one since the death of his sister, when they were both teenagers. Aisling is the ghost of a child who died on one of the Irish coffin ships--died despite her firce will to live. It is her will to live that gives her the power to come back; she returns to the earthly plane, and one day Oisin finds a little girl in his cottage and begins to care for her.Then the little girl starts to grow up, seeming to age years in a matter of weeks. And one day she is a teenager, looking like a beautiful grown woman, and Oisin is disturbed by his new feelings for her.Intertwined with the story of Oisin and Aisling in the present, we also have the story of Oisin and his sister Nieve as seen through Oisin's memory, and the story of Aisling's dysfunctional family in Ireland during the time of the famine and the epidemic. While the story irritated me at times--generally when Oisin was acting obnoxiously hormonal--but there was a reason for it--he was getting his youth back. And the relationship between Oisin and Aisling was dealt with in a way that made it romantic rather than sleazy.All in all, _In the Country of the Young_ was a sensual and entrancing novel, complete with echoes of Irish legend. I recommend it to those who like a good story and don't mind sex scenes."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"&quot;Exquisite and beautifully written&quot; may be overused words when describing books like this, but it's difficult to find a more apt description. Lisa Carey is a major talent, and her fluent and lyrical prose is praiseworthy indeed. A constant reader, I'm never without a book and it is certainly rare for me to stumble across writing like this. Yes, there are a few sex scenes, but in my opinion they are in no way gratuituous or out of context as some reviewers have suggested. It should be remembered that the book's characters are, in essence, sensual beings and the sensuality expressed between them is beautifully and sensitively portrayed. Saying that, the book won't be enjoyed by the conservative reader. As a fan of the early Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, I felt strongly that 'In the Country of the Young' required a similarly gothic sensibility. There is no greater pleasure than stumbling across a book you've never heard of only to find it's one of the best books you've read this year. I loved it."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This book is an exquisite, rare treat. Her writing is described as lyrical and that word barely does her justice. I've read all of her books and they just keep getting better. She has the ability to touch you way down deep, primally deep, until you find yourself sobbing out loud. Long after the book is finished I find myself thinking of her characters and pondering her themes. I will be eagerly following the career of this talented artist."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"I bought this book in a clearance sale because of its title and was forever hooked on Lisa Carey. I loved the historical flashbacks that tied in with the island's current traditions; adaptations of the old ways of Ireland and many of the old Pagan holidays.This book is both charming and shocking at the same time. I've read a lot of ghost stories, but none so creative as this. I couldn't wait to get to the ending which, I must say, did not disappoint."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"I just finished this book. I had never read anything by Lisa Carey and was completely unfamiliar with any of her books, I happened to find this book by chance. After reading it, I can't wait to find all other books this writer has written. I can't tell you how gorgeous this book was, I never wanted it to end.It is filled with tragedy and hope. Rarely have I read a book that moved me to tears like this one did."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This is a really great book. I ordered it from the teen people book club, not really knowing what it was about but that it has a ghost in it. Some parts in it can be really kinky, but all in all its a great book!

I found that I was skipping whole paragraphs, especially the ones dealing with excessive and explicit sex, just to get the book finished. I found the author's over description of the sex scenes offensive. This book jumped around too much - no cohesiveness, it wasn't insightful enough to fully grab my attention. No substance!When I finally reached the end of the book, disappointment awaited me - there did not appear to be any closure, a complete letdown. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This ghost story HAD potential. Two lives merging over the distance of 150 years, drawing from one another's experiences to discover what one had missed in his own life, revealing their secrets bit by bit. The idea was there. The unfinished purpose of the dead. The waste of time and life in the living. Regrets. Both characters revealed stories that were captivating and were enough to make the book great in the simple telling. However, the story is littered with excessive sexual exploits, some incestuous and circumstances that frankly didn't belong.So many lines and pages of this book are wasted on describing things better left to the imagination that I was led off course and left with the disappointed and empty feeling that the story ended without reaching its full potential.I am sad that my 17-year-old cousin, who gave me this book for Christmas, won't be able to read it b/c of the graphic descriptions of sexual intercourse and adolescent discovery.She will be sorely disappointed as she thought she was giving me a ghost story, a true piece of literary art."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"a blending of the horrible effects of poverty and the irish potato famine and the coffin ships...with banshees, suicide, a loveless marriage, and the ghost of an invisible girl who knew she was never wanted......who comes back to present times. i couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"Forgive the pun, but Lisa Carey's \\"In The Country Of The Young\\" is a hauntingly, poignant ghost story. It is a novel that often enchants and provides a compelling read throughout. There are actually three tales interwoven here. Aislin's story: a melancholy tale of girl-child born out of wedlock to a woman of the lower-classes in Ireland, in the early 1840s - just before the potato blight. She is unwanted, unloved and lives a solitary existence, ostracized by all except her older brother, Darragh. There is Oison's story, along with that of his twin sister Nieve, beginning in the 1960s in Boston. They are the children of an Irish couple who do not love each other, and the tragedy of their dysfunctional family has an enormous impact on the two. And lastly, cohering all, is the story of Aislin and Oison in the present day on the island of Tiranogue, just off the Maine coast.The novel opens in 1848, when an Irish \\"coffin ship\\" carrying starving immigrants, including Aislin and Darragh, crashes off the coast of Maine. One-hundred-fifty souls are rescued, one hundred are children. Aislin is one of them. However, more are lost at sea, including Darragh. The survivors are taken to the nearby island of Tir na nOg, which is Gaelic for \\"Country of the Young.\\" There young Aislin, a beautiful, sensitive child, dies, calling out her brother's name.Over a century later, the wee ghost of the girl-child Aislin makes her way to the home of artist Oison McDara. He lives as a recluse on Tiranogue, haunted by his twin sister's memory. Every year, for the last 30 years, on the night of the full moon equinox, (Halloween), Oison leaves a candle lit in his window and the door open for Nieve, his dead twin - in case she wants to come home. Aislin is drawn to the light, and perhaps, to Oislon's longing. As a boy, Oison had the gift of \\"sight.\\" When Nieve died, during their teen years, he lost this ability - but now he sees Aislin, clear as day.\\"In The Country Of The Young\\" is much more than a ghost story. It is primarily about the living, and though very sad at times, the narrative rings with life and color. Aislin has an opportunity, though brief, to live some of the life she lost when she was so young. Oison, emotionally dead for such a long time, also has another shot at life. And those whose lives they touch, are much richer for the experience.Ms Carey's prose is lyrical, rich, often just beautiful, as is her imagery. What really makes the novel special, however, are her characters, their depth, complexity and growth. She illuminates them all. They have remained with me well after completing the book.I highly recommend this magical, uplifting novel.JANA"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"After I finished reading Love in the Asylum, I immediately began to search for other books by Lisa Carey. I found In the Country of the Young and was not disappointed -- in fact, I liked it even better than Love in the Asylum, which was a wonderful story.Carey has a magnificent way with words. I'm an author, a book coach, an editor, and a voracious reader. I try to read a book a week, but sometimes, I skim things, especially if I'm reading for my book club. Carey makes me want to slow down and savor every word, or to go back and reread a page or chapter to better understand the characters, and the message.She has depth and substance, and this book was extremely well researched. Lisa Carey also has a terrific ability to describe life's tragedies and heartaches without being gloomy or maudlin.Seven-year-old Aisling is en route to a new life in Qu&eacute;bec, leaving behind unimaginable hardship during the potato famine in Ireland in the 1840s. She was unwanted by her parents and treated despicably; the only one who loved her was her brother, Darragh.Aisling lands in Maine and her life intersects with that of Oisin, who has had his own share of grief and disappointment. She dies aboard ship but returns from the dead on All Hallow's Eve to heal her own wounds, and tend to Oisin's guilt and broken heart.The fantasy elements are presented so well that I was easily able to overcome my resistance to the notion of the credibility of a ghost. Carey makes the unbelievable seem real. She has great literary talent and I would highly recommend this heartwarming tale.Sigrid Macdonald"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"I have not read an entire book in 10 years. One night alone, while looking around for something to do(anything but TV) I find this book left by my mother. I picked it up and started to read. I am SO lucky and glad this is the first book I read after so long.The entire story went back and forth from the two main characters fascinating/gripping past, to their present unusual (ghostly) &quot;existence&quot; together. I was interested in reading further to see how each of their past came to the present and how their &quot;journey&quot; together (although only one year) would end.Being a person whose attention span to reading is short this book was not confusing, not boringly long, very interesting, and kept me reading till the end. Thanks to Lisa Carey and my mother, I will start reading again."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This has got to be my favorite book not only because of the incredible plot and extremely well-developed characters, but the eccentricities like the Irish names (Oisin, pronounced &quot;O-sheen&quot; and Aisling , pronounced &quot;Ash-ling&quot;) and the fairy tale its based upon. By the end of the book I wanted to be in it, be Oisin and Aisling and everyone else. I've even tried reading it over from different character's points of view. This book is remarkable, and I still have yet to touch the surface of &quot;The Mermaids Singing&quot;..."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"Can you imagine what it would be like to wake up to a houseful of dead people?

We each, in our way, can join with the celebration and grief that aging brings, and with the pain of knowing our families too well.

I feel sad that so many people miss the opportunity to encounter such a beautiful story."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"The reviews stated below describe the book exceptionally well and I will do little to add on to them.. but I feel that this book had an emotional impact for me.. it really hit home and nails several key issues lingering in my heart. The book relates to the pains and pleasures of life and death. It details the loss of innocence and the maturing of the mind. It describes in depth how time changes people and how the aches of yearning of had-beens and what-ifs can develop and consume people. I felt a whole array of emotions when I read this book but overall, I felt it had a good, if bittersweet ending and is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"I loved this book, it's magical and awesome!Its so easy to get swallowed up in the emotions of the characters and to get lost completely in the story. To sympathise with Aisling and her longing for something real and too easy to grieve along with Oisin for his sister. You live in their world, experience what they do and even shed a tear or two.Definitely a heart warming and unforgettable book."},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"This is one of those books that is difficult to put down, but at the same time you don't want to finish it. In this story, Oisin McDara is a man who has chosen to stop living, and Aisling Quinn is a ghost who never had the chance to live. It's a story filled with so much sorrow you find yourself weeping half way through. The characters learn that life is filled with sorrow, yes, but there is so much more. Lisa Carey's writing is poetic and beautiful, even when she describes some pretty terrifying and terrible things. As a ghost story, the ideas are not terribly original, but what is original is the way she writes about it. The story shows what the characters are able to give each other, and the readers also take away some of these gifts. Thank you Ms Carey for a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"What an astonishing, lyrical and moving work, full of layers and portents, and the kind of meaning that can't be snatched but only experienced.

I expect a lot from a novel. (Given the resources that go into the publishing of one, I think this is reasonable.) My expectations tend to rise if the writer's talents are recognizably big and if the premise of their book is equally sizable. And, more than anything else, I'm a harsh critic when it comes to storytelling. Most times, it's not done particularly well. Sometimes, it's not such an issue as it is at others; there are opportunities for writers to create something that's less a 'story' than it is a riff on a particular view of the world. If the author has a powerful enough a voice, inventively expressing his or her take on things, then it is possible for the novel to end up a satisfying experience for the reader. But as I say, most times writers are not particularly good storytellers. And my reaction tends to be harsh. I am, after all, investing a fair amount of time in reading the novel, so it's reasonable that I get the chance to react to the experience.In Ms Carey's sophomore effort, 'In The Country of The Young', she set out to tell a tale, a nicely-imagined tale, one chock full of possibility and scope. With the foundation she lays down, I was intrigued from the start. However...However, there is a chasm (at least at this point in her career, some 10 years ago at the time of this review's writing) between Ms Carey's intellectual and writing skills and what's required to majestically tell the story she's proposed. And this being the second of her efforts that I've read, I'm beginning to wonder if that chasm will ever be crossed.At its core, 'Country' is a ghost story, one with a unique slant. But it's much more than this, and perhaps in this 'more', what I refer to regarding her shortcomings is best revealed. To me, the novel is a meditation on some pretty substantive themes, most of them revolving around the main male character, Oisin. Lord knows there's enough to work with there, given his past, where he is now, and that he's a middle-aged male going through his version of an existential crisis. But as much as I admired Ms Carey's ambition, as much as I admired her willingness to relate things-sexual in healthy, 'muscular' way, there was little in what she had to say that moved me. (Yes, there were some bits that did. And kudos to her for those.) It was as if she had a list of 'issues' she wanted to deal with, and was able to relate them well enough, but not so powerful a way as to leave an impression on the reader. Her reach, her grasp and all that?For me, what connected this shortcoming with storytelling that just didn't do justice to the premise, everything she had at her disposal was the tendency to see the relating of interesting facts as telling a good tale. Or, in the harshest way possible, providing an 'information dump'. Exposition in narrative is a mainstay of the novel. And it's not as if Ms Carey doesn't grasp how to tell us what we need to know. But... But it's like there's a tool missing from the assortment in her writer's kit. The one that elicits empathy, the one that hooks the reader, gets them caring, gets them involved. There were times when a silent mantra wandered through my thoughts: 'I don't care.' (I've just started reading Ms Carey's third novel, 'Love in the Asylum' and it struck me that where she seems most adept, where she appears most in command and comfortable is when she's relating backstory. 'Just the facts, ma'am.')Maybe that sums things up nicely, that despite all the components she'd assembled, I didn't really care about the characters. I didn't care about their circumstances, their travails, their tragedies, the crux of the situation that had been presented. It was, in its own way, far too sterile and neutral for me to really embrace. And of course, knowing this just made me feel all the more harsh towards the novel specifically, and Ms Carey in general.A personal trait of mine is to see the difference between what's in front of me and what might have been. In the case of 'In The Country of The Young', I was saddened that such a fascinating premise, such a wonderfully-wrought mythology, such a carefully considered examination of what it is to be human, to be real had been...well, squandered. I was grieving for the lost opportunities, for the lack of real character development, for the moments that could have been, should have been. (I'm compelled to allow that there are some nice segments near the conclusion of the novel having to do with sexual communion, with expectation, with habit, with personal wiring.) In the end, I was left with a hollow feeling, but for all the wrong reasons.Personal rating: 7/10"},{"Title":"In the Country of the Young","review":"My first book by Lisa Carey. I did enjoy it, but I have to say I was disappointed in the ghost story turning Romance. I'm not against a good romance novel by any means, but that was not what I was looking for this in this book.

When a serial killer infiltrates the city, she starts losing sight of who she is and the secrets that she's held inside threaten to slip out. This also succeeds in alienating her husband, although she has no trouble in giving every ounce of her love to their little boy, Matthew.Her husband, Charlie, has no idea as to what's bothering his wife. He only knows that the recent murders have added to their troubles. He finds himself fretting over his wife's cold manner and her outright indifference, something that he's having trouble in accepting. This inadvertently throws him into the arms of a woman he'd never expected to have feelings for.As the murders continue, Mary Elizabeth starts questioning her sanity. She denies vehemently that she knows nothing in regards to why they're taking place. Yet deep inside, she also knows that's not true. She does know, but she's refused to deal with her traumatic past all this time.As the danger escalates, she and her husband are thrown in different directions. This, of course, is because of her own doing, but she chalks it down to the fact that she needs more space in order to make sense of her dark thoughts and feelings. Little does she know, time is running short.Driven to the edge of insanity, Mary Elizabeth takes things into her own hands. She wants only to make things right. To set the ghosts of her past to rest once and for all. Although she's pushed herself, and husband, to the point of no return, she knows that there's still hope. She, alone, has the power to make the killer go away. But only if she sets aside her doubts and insecurities. Only then will she able to see the light at the end of that dark tunnel.While this book may seem to have a bit of a slow start, don't let that fool you. It's one of those diamonds in the rough. I enjoyed reading this story and discovering what happens between Mary Elizabeth and her husband. The story is both bittersweet and heart-felt. I think we can all relate to the situations in which the characters find themselves. Definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Wired","review":"Wanting a mystery novel that also adds the element of drama and family sagas to the mix.

They were a happy family unit until recently , Mary Elizabeth has been acting very strangely and it makes you wonder if there's something in the air. After being married such a long time , it makes you think and wonder whether couples really are like this and hide secrets that can tear marriages apart - secrets so extreme you could'nt ever imagine it. Up till a year ago , I would have said that if you have been married a long time e.g 15+ years , you should be able to share secrets and overcome all obstacles in your marriage's way but that proved not to be true as I experienced a marriage of close ones separating after 25 years over a dark secret- just like that . In Wired , Mary Elizabeth's whole life starts to crumble piece by piece when articles of murders at the Bluff start to circulate in Rosewood's newspaper. We discover that something happened with Mary Elizabeth and the Bluff and that now the murders are starting back up , she may be in vital danger. Not knowing how to cope, she pushes away Charlie and we see him finding comfort in a friend's sister Thelma. Can the pair of them work out what is going on and share their secrets before neither of them can stand being near each other ?

Right down to the very last page, you, the reader, are taken on a FANTABULOUS whirl wind of twists, turns, ups, downs, ins and outs of a superbly written novel. Ms. Carr fills this novel with deep intensity, darkness, suspense, thrills and chills of a secret past, a missing piece to the puzzle, a family drama.I can't begin to tell you what I liked about this novel. I loved every aspect. While Mary Elizabeth was not my absolute most favorite character, she really fit the role of that confused, withdrawn and difficult to live with soul. Charlie, her husband, was a fantastic character. He really was concerned about his wife, and truly wanted to help her, though he didn't know how. It really went haywire when he had to move out! Their son, Matthew. Bless him, my heart really went out to him. He was wonderful piece to this family!With a serial killer, gone for many years, reentering the picture, it really turns up the heat on this suspenseful read. Secrets, things better left untouched, come unraveled and Mary Elizabeth is in an upside world. Following along side Mary Elizabeth as she tried to protect her and her son, thinking so many things at once.I highly recommend this novel to EVERYONE. It's suspenseful....it's dramatic. It's just plain GREATASTIC! If you are looking for a novel that will take you an intense roller coaster ride, then look no further than Martha Randolph Carr's Wired.

I'm always the first to scream in a theater during a PG-13 movie so the fact that I read this at all is all Martha's fault! The moment I read the excerpt provided by Novel Publicity in order to decide whether I would be a host reviewer or not, I was hooked. The excerpt was candid, raw, and I had a gazillion questions that I wanted answered and could only get answered...by reading the book.As I read, I wondered if Al and Peggy Bundy lived in a small town like Mary and Charlie if this is what their life would be like? After all they have three things in common:1. Mary and Peggy are both stay at home moms in denial2. Charlie and Al both work at a shoe store3. Both couples are part of a very dysfunctional marriageThe differences begin to show themselves the more you read. Peggy's denial is a choice of frivolity and/or selfishness and Mary is in denial because of a terrible experience earlier on in her life with which she has not dealt.Al worked at the shoe store and had no ambition, Charlie owned the shoe store. As dysfunctional as Al and Peggy were, Al would never have thought about cheating on Peggy, although they did team up to hide from their kids if they had food or money, which was totally unlike Mary and Charlie's love for their son, Matthew.Anyway, as Mary's denial increases, her marriage deteriorates and they come to a parting of the ways. The cause of her pain and mental anguish comes back to town and becomes the catalyst for change...what kind of change?I guess you will have to read the book to find out. (Stinker, aren't I? )I gave this scary, yet touching, scary, yet real book a 4 out of 5 stars. Martha's skill as a writer is awesome in that a book written in 1989 still holds water now in 2011. This goes to show that a good book is just that-a good book!"},{"Title":"Wired","review":"\\"Wired\\" by Martha CarrIt is 1989. Living in a small town, we meet High School Sweethearts, and now married for fourteen years, Charlie and Mary Elizabeth, who have a beautiful son named Matthew. They seem to be living the American Dream. Mary Elizabeth is a stay-at-home Mom, and Charlie runs and owns the local shoe store downtown. All of a sudden, we see Mary Elizabeth starting to experience some difficulties with her life. Something is bothering her in as terrible way, and she is acting out in strange ways. We are left in the dark and can't see exactly \`what' it is that is bothering her, yet we can tell something absolutely horrific had to have happened because of the severity of what might seem to be flashbacks that she is experiencing. The story does not tell us exactly what is going on. We are left in suspense over this perplexing problem she is going through. Eventually, the problems she is experiencing start to become too difficult for her to handle, and she needs some time to herself to get through this. Instead of leaning on her husband to help her, she ends up asking her husband, Charlie, to move out. He is dumbfounded. He cannot understand why or what happened along the way for things to get this severe. He moves out, reluctantly. He is concerned about the safety of his wife and son because recently a serial killer seems to be in the area they live after being gone for so many years. Charlie ends up living with his employee's family until he can get on his feet. This arrangement is working out very well for Mary Elizabeth, and she seems to be thriving and working things out in her life. She does become aware that there is a serial killer on the loose, and takes preventative steps to keep her and their son safe, yet . . . then she starts acting out again, the severity starts to escalate and she can't figure out what is going on. She finds out something about her husband which she cannot believe he did. He finds out something about her which he thinks she has done and they are both at odds with each other. The serial killer is going wild at this point. All of a sudden, with this knowledge, her acting out, everything finally become crystal clear to Mary Elizabeth.. She knows what she has to do. No, she knows what she must do. She acts on it. We are now left on the edge of our seats flipping page after page after page. We have to find out what happens next. The intensity keeps building and building. Then, . . .I enjoyed this book very much. It seemed like things did not make sense at times, but as you keep reading, the author did this intentionally, which made the book that much more suspenseful. At the end, things escalate so highly, the intensity is unbelievable. This is a MUST READ! 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion! Get your copy today!

A murdered teenager is discovered at the local teenage hangout on a bluff high above main street bringing back memories to Mary Elizabeth that she would rather forget but may hold the key to saving an entire town. But when the bodies keep popping up everyone must struggle with feelings of guilt, shame and redemption.ReviewNow those that read this blog know that I am a sucker for romance and thrillers. Well in Wired I got both. Martha Carr's writing is an interesting blend of characterization, plot, and dialogue that is so real and dynamic you think you are reading a movie. Only the screen is in your head. I'll also mention movie rights are being discussed. I'm not surprised.It is expected in any novel that the reader identify with the main protagonist. That the readers feels what they feel, cries with them, roots for them and just all around connects with them. While you will feel, cry and even root for Mary Elizabeth it is hard to like her...until the end. From the first paragraph I didn't hate her but I didn't like her. Charlie, her husband, was typical yet layered. It's obvious he has a much better relationship with their adorable son. It takes talent to make a reader to feel so strongly about the characters as I did in Wired.Martha has a craft similar to thriller authors like Vincent Zandri where they reveal a little here and there. And then at some point you start having these moments where things begin to click but still leave you surprised with the ending.However, her writing of the sexual scenes and thoughts were tasteful yet emotional and poignant like the romance authors I adore some much.I highly recommend Wired. It's a great read especially for right before Halloween."},{"Title":"Wired","review":"\\" 'A life Daddy. I want a life. A good one this time.' \\"\\"Charlie smiled to himself and pulled out the little yellow knife with a sailboat on it, and handed it to Matthew. 'No, this is a wiggily life. I want the life that doesn't wiggle.' \\"You can't help but immediately feel a connection to Charlie Eames, his wife Mary Elizabeth Eames and their adorable son Matthew from the very beginning of Martha Randolph Carr's novel, Wired. Carr's conversational and familiar writing style takes you to the heart of the home within the first few chapters. Set in a rural community of small town America, in 1989, this struggling marriage is not unlike so many families we see today. Charlie and Mary Elizabeth were high school sweet hearts, shuffling along life's unpaved road for fifteen years, laboring to travel together. They seem lost and disconnected from each other. It is clear that their marriage has been failing for years, and that each spouse is only going through the motions.\\"When Mary Elizabeth was feeling kindly toward him, she admitted to herself that he was big and sweet and when she wasn't, she was sure he was stupid.\\"\\"He (Charlie) watched her lift her shirt over her head and flip her hair back and felt a sadness that spread through him. He didn't really know this woman and he couldn't bring himself to try harder or to hate her.\\"At first glance, this novel is about a husband and wife trying to find their way back to each other. Mary Elizabeth is privately battling past demons; horrors only alluded to in small doses to keep the reader questioning what could have happened to her twenty years earlier. We are left wondering what could have been so life altering, following her into her adulthood and in to her marriage. Early in the story, she says to herself, \\"Less of me exists every year\\", a sinking feeling I think many stay at home moms can relate. Charlie is a small business owner, oblivious to the true needs of his wife, perhaps even content to live in ignorance. He appears to just allow life to happen around him, rather than really be a part of anything. Another pivotal character in this novel is Douglas, an older black man that works for Charlie. He is the voice of reason, an unexpected father figure and a true friend to the Eames family. Each of these characters must make a personal journey, exploring their perspective about life, love and friendship through a series of hard decisions, heartbreak and honesty.I think what makes this book so entertaining is its multifaceted story line. Carr combines a raw description of life and marriage with a brutal series of murders and the journey to solve these crimes. Clues are dropped cleverly throughout each conversation, interaction, character and scene description in a very Alfred Hitchcock kind of way. The reader doesn't even realize that they have been gifted important insight into future events. Several times, I had an \\"a-ha\\" moment, recalling a previous passage that suddenly became very relevant, like a harmless nickname or nervous twitch. Carr also does a great job of throwing the reader a few distractions, so that the true killer and unresolved secrets are not revealed too quickly, allowing the reader time to savor each plot development.Although a minor character, Douglas' sister Thelma became my favorite. She brought an element of whimsy and joy to an otherwise dark and depressing plot. I found myself wanting to get to know her better, learn more of her story and understand what made her so desirable. Her relationship with her brother and Charlie was both believable and necessary in order for each of these men to gain personal growth and maturity. In Thelma, I saw optimism and the possibility of a fruitful future, something all of the main characters were in search of, reminding me of Matthew's sweet way of calling a knife, a life and Charlie's response of, \\"I want the life that doesn't wiggle.\\"I could relate to many of the characters in this novel. It is not hard to imagine a stay at home mom searching to find her identity or a husband hoping that ignorance will be bliss. Prejudices and prejudgments about people's skin color, economic background, religion or politics is always a struggle, which has been evident throughout history, as well as in this book. And perhaps, one of the most unfortunate and believable elements of this novel is the ease in which the killer was able to lure his victims. As a parent of two girls, it definitely gave me something to think about in regards to talking to my children about being safe.It was also surprising how easily Carr was able to weave together the perspectives of so many different characters without confusing the reader. And it was refreshing how she manipulated romantic scenes in a way that was sexual without being obscene, as well as reveal certain sexual elements of the murders without being overly graphic. Carr allowed just enough exposure in each situation to be either stimulating or heartbreaking, but never uncomfortable. The story line unraveled quickly and did not waste time with unimportant details. This book was a very fast read, and definitely worth recommending to a friend.If I had to choose one quote to summarize this novel, it would be the description of Charlie and Mary Elizabeth's neighborhood. It was a flashback about their realtor when they first moved in to their starter home. She described the neighborhood as \\"nearly dead or newlywed\\", something that struck me at the beginning of the novel, but then took on a whole new meaning by the end."},{"Title":"Wired","review":"Imagine surviving a brutal attack. One where the obvious conclusion is your death but somehow you get away. Now imagine you are only 15yrs old, terrified to get help from the police and unable to confide in your mother.Fifteen years into the future is where you will begin this story. Mary Elizabeth has a family now. A husband and beautiful son but there is something missing in her soul. Her heart doesn't seem complete and those closest to her have begun to distance themselves. Her husband Charlie knows something has been wrong with Mary Elizabeth for some time but is unable to get her to talk with him, so he avoids the problem. Her young son is obviously much more closer to Charlie.I found the beginning of this thriller to be very dark and oppressive. I identified with Charlie but found I truly disliked Mary Elizabeth. This was at once awkward and authentic to me.There is an unwritten rule most of us subscribe to when we read a thriller or suspense story like Wired. We will ALWAYS identify and like the main character. Most especially if she is a victim. The problem with this is it isn't always reasonable.Given the circumstances of Wired and the role Mary Elizabeth has been given by Martha Randolph Carr, there is no way you will believe she is a strong, loving, sympathetic character.I promise you this, you will understand her and you will eventually empathize with her.Martha Randolph Carr does and exceptional job in the creation of Mary. The building of tension is felt by all characters and I felt it as well. As most people who have read my reviews know, I put great stock in characters. I just have to believe them in most cases. There is always the exception but if you feel as I do, pick up this fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Wired","review":"Loved the book! Started out fast paced and stayed that way. Had plenty of twists and turns and didn't see the ending coming."},{"Title":"Wired","review":"There are moments in life when you freeze. It can last for seconds or minutes or days. The world continues to spin but you're stuck where you are with nowhere to go and nothing to say and your insides keep running in place because to stop would mean you'd have to confront whatever it is that's wrong with you. Somewhere deep inside, you know you're not strong enough, not brave enough, not fast enough, not smart enough, but if you're the one who flinches first, you'll drop to the ground and scream and scream and scream, and that can never ever happen so you keep your mouth shut and wait for the moment to pass.These are the moments that make up Wired by Martha Randolph Carr. Mary Elizabeth's traumatic past, Charlie's crumbling marriage, Mitch's breakdown, Rose's cantankerous attitude. Each character is unable to move forward, stuck in suspended animation. Even the setting, a small town in the 80's left relatively untouched by change, seems frozen in time. Businesses are owned by local families. Racial intolerance, while not acknowledged out loud, is the accepted norm. Cell phones and technology are virtually nonexistent.As a serial killer begins to kidnap, torture, and murder young women, the horrific news shake each character to life. Mary Elizabeth, unable to deal with her past at first, finds solace in tending her garden at night. Charlie's first secret tryst, hidden in the shadows late one night, is with a woman who is, in every way, the opposite of his wife. But it's not until they learn to see themselves, and each other, under the harsh light of day that they learn they are stronger together than apart.Thoughts: I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started to read this book. To me, the title suggested something high-tech or drug related so I kept second guessing myself. The pacing was slow at first, reinforcing the feel of Mary Elizabeth and Charlie's state of mind, before picking up about half way through. Carr spends a lot of time fleshing out each character and their relationship with one another.Showing trumps telling in a well-written novel, and in the hands of an experienced writer, very few words are needed to tell you everything you need to know about Charlie and Mary Elizabeth's failing marriage. The writer in me clapped enthusiastically. The reader in me shed a tear for the characters. The wife in me ran to hug my husband out of the blue because \\"omg, we should never ever fight and end up like these two characters, m'okay???\\"Though despite her fantastic skill at creating depth in her characters, I wished she had taken the time to do the same with the killer. Carr basically paints him with a crazy brush and leaves it at that. There are hints of a disturbed relationship with his mother and a possible electrical accident but aside from the creeptastic voice in his head, we never find out why he is compelled to not only murder and rape young women but to do it in such a methodical and bizarre way. \\"The voice told me to do it\\" or \\"electricity turns me on\\" doesn't cut it for me. If I'm forced to read passages from the point of view of a sadistic killer, I want to know the WHY even more so than the HOW and the WHAT.By the way, I loved the use of symbolism in the story. Carr doesn't beat you over the head with it but uses it as a consistent theme throughout to demonstrate the growth of individual characters. For example, Mary Elizabeth trying to explain to her neighbor why she loves to garden or one of my favorite characters, Lucy, who serves as a source of strength and wisdom to Mary Elizabeth as they work together in the garden.And the smutty sex scenes? I give it four heaving bosoms out of five. Tasteful but hot. Slutty but leaves you wanting more.Bonus: Any book containing hot dogs and turtles all in the same scene deserves two thumbs up from me! (And no!! Neither were used for sex!!)Side note: I found myself distracted by the odd formatting of the Kindle version, often needing to go back to reread certain passages, when quotation marks went missing or paragraph breaks appeared out of nowhere. I nearly spat out my coffee at one point during a chapter that switched back and forth between Charlie and the killer's point of view. It read horribly horribly (did I say horribly??) wrong without an obvious section break.Conclusion: Wired is an entertaining read though I hesitate to classify this as a thriller. It's less a villain-driven, suspenseful, oh-my-god, nail-biting novel and more a slice-of-life fiction with the added drama of a serial killer plot line. If you enjoy reading books that are a little less visceral (suspense lite, so to speak) and more character-driven, I highly recommend Wired by Martha Randolph Carr."},{"Title":"Wired","review":"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~A lifetime of suffering has plagued Mary Elizabeth, a mother and wife.

Change brought on by unspeakable tragedy, and change brought on by self-discovery and survival.Mary Elizabeth and Charlie have been together for fourteen years, and have a young son. All that time, Mary Elizabeth has been hiding a horrifying secret, more so from herself than from anyone else. But recent events in her small town pull at her inner fortress, pushing her further away from Charlie and their son.Soon, Mary Elizabeth pushes Charlie out of their house, promising him it's not forever, but not really knowing for sure. All she knows is that she's falling apart and can't seem to stop it.Charlie takes refuge in the basement of the shoe store he owns, until being invited to move into the home of his only employee, Douglas. When he moves toDouglas's home, Charlie also moves into a world within the world of the town where he grew up. A world of black families, familiar individually yet foreign as a unit to Charlie.As the horrors in the community continue, Mary Elizabeth continues to unravel, and Charlie starts his own journey. Charlie grapples with issues of race, new love, and how he fits into it all. Mary Elizabeth fights to keep herself together, not realizing yet that she must first fall completely apart in order to make herself whole again. They first travel on separate paths, discovering new friends who guide them to places within themselves that they never knew existed. Building to a crescendo, their struggles to survive emotionally crash against the terror stalking the community, until everything explodes in a resolution that saves them and brings them together more deeply than ever.Carr creates sympathetic characters with depth, even as their faults show through. Supporting characters, as well as Mary Elizabeth and Charlie, grab the reader with their raw emotions. Each character is drawn against the backdrop of what is tearing the town apart, bringing their own fears and strengths to bear for themselves and for each other.Most thrillers center around the events, with characters, even the major ones, acting as support to the plot. Character-driven stories use the plot secondarily, focusing on the personal and emotional development of the people who in habit the story. In Wired, Carr skillfully combines the two. Solving the crisis at the heart of the title plays equally with the growth of Mary Elizabeth, Charlie, and the people in their lives. The story is resolved with redemption, if not always peace, for all."},{"Title":"Wired","review":"--a secret that has never left her. Indeed, it has grown and festered in her psyche, hard as she's tried to control it and live with it in a dusty corner of her memories.But now that secret is manifesting itself again, and wreaking havoc with the people in the small town where Mary Elizabeth and Charlie call home.It's more skilled and efficient now, and it's hit too close to home.How this couple exorcises the secret Mary Elizabeth holds is the journey you take when you pick up Wired.Wired is like a roller coaster -- a slow climb up, ...up... u p ... until you reach the peak...... and then one long, whip-fast, twisting, emotional ride all the way down to the final resolution.Charlie is the rollercoaster car the reader rides along in, identifying and sympathizing with his emotions - indignation, bafflement, frustration - and turns them into self-discovery, wonderment, joy, and finally, a satisfying resolution. The reader can't help but root for this hero who comes to learn more about himself in the midst of devastating loss than he ever did in the tedium of safe, everyday life. Ms. Carr takes us through a wringer of a journey in learning Charlie's essence and the stuff he's made of.Mary Elizabeth's character arc doesn't disappoint either - like kudzu that can overwhelm a garden, until a gardener appears to prune and shear and manicure it into submission.Mentors and temptations appear for both characters on their journeys, which makes for a satisfying analysis if anybody wants to talk Vogler's journey or Hauge's plot structure over some wine with this writermason.Get Wired.

Dean Koontz is one my all time favorite and I have to say this novel is right up there with any of Dean Koontz's novels.Martha Carr's writing style is superb, from creating a cast of characters you will be able to relate to, almost hate but them empathize with in the end. I really like Charlie and their son Matthew. I was amazed at how the author was able to give us so many different perspectives of the characters without being lost and confused, but she made it work. It was a fast action book with romance scenes that you knew were sexual without going overboard to the point of too graphic, it let our own imagination take each one of us where WE wanted to go with it. This novel pulled you right in from the very first chapter and would NOT let you go until the very last page, I will be in line for her next book guaranteed, It gave me a battery of emotions going through this book, and just when you think you have it all figured out, no way, the author throws at you a curve to throw you off the track and make you think its someone different than what you thought. It's twists and turns and around and around and not once getting lost, I am very in awe at how she did this and wove a fantastic story at the same time. It's suspense, dark, intense with the right amount of chills.I recommend this book to EVERYONE it is a fantastic book and you will be missing out if you don't grab your copy to read, I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.

It is packed with death threating adventure, tragedy, romance and so much more."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"I loved this book! The author creates visual images that will have your palms sweating as you read about encounters with head hunters. This book inspired me to do more research about Osa Johnson. It was also enjoyed by members of my book club."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"This would be excellent for an adolescent or teenager, and is pretty good for adults, too.Osa Johnson describes the many adventures of herself and her husband in a &quot;gosh, golly, gee whiz&quot; fashion. In some ways, it seems like an old movie with, say, Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed in the starring roles.While Osa Johnson does well describing their amazing trips, her weakness is in describing people. Many of the characters in this book come across only as caricatures -- the crusty sea captain, the gentlemanly british national living in Kenya, the faithful-but-slightly-comical African servant. This isn't a book where you get inside the heads of people.Still the Johnsons had remarkable adventures, and since any one of the trips probably could have been a book in itself, you'll likely be left wishing for more details. Also, the book offers an interesting historical perspective on a period (not that long ago) when the world still had many mysterious places to be explored."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"My interest in and use of Osa's book are fairly narrow, but I enjoyed her retelling of her life with Martin. They were truly remarkable people, who lived up to her title.Rick Chapman"},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"The most exciting thing about this book was it all really happened. Martin really did meet Jack London, Martin really did take pictures of cannibals, Osa and Martin really did discover a lake in Africa. The adventures were thrilling and fun."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"This book is a biography of Martin Johnson, written as a loving memorial by his wife shortly after his death in a plane crash. Martin, born in 1884, led a fascinating life. From Osa's descriptions of his school years, it sounds like if Martin had been an adolescent today, he might have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. He was obviously a very intelligent youth, but had no patience for sitting at a desk and studying topics that weren't of direct interest to him. He was quite taken with photography however, and established himself as a professional photographer while still in high school. He also had a lifelong love of travel, and he managed to spend several years in France while his peers were off in college or getting started in their careers. A lucky break with Jack London got Martin's career going. London hired Johnson as a cook for his ill-fated around-the-world sailing expedition. It was the photos that Johnson brought back from this trip that were to provide the original seed money for all the travels and photographic projects that were to occupy him the rest of his life.Osa's story of meeting Johnson is incredibly wild. Before she knew it, she had eloped with this young man, and found herself at the tender age of 16 trying to see his dreams of travel adventure come true. Osa was considerably younger than Martin, and it was perhaps her youth that made their partnership work. Osa was still quite unexperienced when she began traveling with Martin, and was foolhardy in the face of danger, which any person would have to be in order to keep up with him and his crazy notions. Her youth probably also gave her the physical conditioning and stamina needed to run up mountains and away from cannibals. It's amazing to read of their adventures today, especially given their time in history, starting well before World War I.Osa left school at 16 when she married Martin, but she nevertheless became a skilled writer. She was very much a product of her times, however, when it came to her attitudes towards non-Anglo-Saxon peoples. She seemed to look upon members of \\"primitive\\" races to be so far beneath her as to be just as appropriate as animals as subjects for their photographic studies. As for animals, although she repeated endlessly their desire to go on safari in order to photograph, not shoot animals, she blithely reports shooting a variety of game, both big and small during their African travels. As she tells it, she and Martin would set up the cameras and provoke animals to charge to they could capture the charges on film. If an animal came too close, however, they would of course have to \\"bring it down\\", be it a rhino, elephant, or lion. And they couldn't escape the responsibility of providing fresh meat for their native porters, so of course she had to develop her hunting skills and shot many a Thompson's gazelle along the trail. If you can set aside such flaws and stomach-turning gaffes, the book can be an amazing account of the lives of perhaps the most adventurous couple of recent times."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"This is a wonderful, engaging story of some most adventuresome people.I loved reading it and plan to share the book with others."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"This book is written in such a friendly, conversational style, it's easy to forget that Martin and Osa Johnson were married 99 years ago.

GREAT READING!"},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"Martin and Osa lived exceptional lives, of a sort that can't really be lived today. The strength of the book is that it is Osa's first-person narrative. This is someone who was really there. And the Johnsons do some amazing things together. The book keeps moving at a fast pace, the adventures keep coming, and I didn't want it to end.The book is a window into a very different era. The Johnsons were products of their time, and some of their viewpoints will bother a few readers. They were not bigots, and in fact appear to me to be rather enlightened for the time, but some of her descriptions of native peoples seem slightly condescending. I may be reading something that isn't there. Some of their practices while exploring and photographing new places would now be totally unacceptable--Stirring up inoffensive animals to get some action for the cameras, or casually introducing an alien plant (watercress) into Africa. Again, these are products of the views of that day, rather than something to condemn.The book does have some weaknesses: The biggest one is that this is (effectively) &quot;The Authorized Biography&quot;. Many problems and difficulties are glossed over. I read in the modern Introduction that Martin continually struggled with health problems during his adventures, but there is no hint of that in the text. Because the book covers so much ground, in many cases the description of their adventures is scanty, and I wanted more detail. And I suspect there's more to the story in some cases. So I am going to find some other books on the Johnsons and try to learn more about them.Perhaps that's the strongest thing to say about the book--That it left me wanting to know more, and inspired to find it out! I'm also going to visit the museum in Kansas dedicated to their work."},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","review":"I read my girlfriend's mother's copy in 1943 when I was ten years old. All my life I wanted a copy of that book. I discovered Amazon and received my much beloved book. You learn to love Osa and Martin Johnson. What a brave girl Osa was to follow her husband to wild Africa, to be such a great helpmate and joy. I will read and re-read this book because it is like you are on an adventure that continues on and on. You feel like you are right there taking part in their adventures. I am so thankful that this book was republished for generations to come. (The book I read in 1943 was large, hardback and the cover was black and white like Zebra skin.)

They made a great contribution to the world of adventure.

I boughtit second- or third-hand twenty years ago as a young adult,and lost it in a house fire two years later. Ive beenscrounging used book stores for it ever since. This bookhas often been in my mind over the years as a story of adetermined young woman who followed her own dreams andfound, in her husband, a friend who shared her ideas.If you have an interest in history from the first quarterof this century, photography, airplanes, anthropology,wildlife, Africa, headhunters, or just enjoy love stories-- you will find this a fascinating read. I heartilyrecommend it as a book about the role women had in theexploration of the world early in this century. AmeliaEarhart didnt go half the places Osa did: she just hadbetter press.The path that an average, turn-of-the-century womantakes from the ribbons and ruffles of her little-girl daysto the pith helmets, rogue elephants, and head hunters thatfilled her life as a young bride is astounding. I believethat even if Osa had never met Martin Johnson, we would stillbe reading about her accomplishments today. What happens tothem in their travels around the world will hardly bebelieved by todays young readers. This was a time whenthere were still undocumented civilizations, fantasticunseen lands, and undiscovered creatures. Film cameraswere turned by a hand crank at just so many revolutions perminute or the film was ruined. Precious film could be ruinedby heat, fungus or moisture. Often, first-encounter footagewas ruined due to spoiled developing chemicals, or was lostin the scramble to leave an island before the Johnson couplebecame the main course at the next party.This couple defined the travelogue&quot; format in a timebefore talkies. They are the cinegraphic ancestors toJacque Cousteau and to shows such as Omahas Wild Kingdom,National Geographic Specials, and Nature. Osa writes of atime in history that few of us today can imagine.

When I came by this deck on sale at a book store, I new I had to buy it because I love The Lord of The Rings as well as divination. This deck is relatively good, especially for the small price I paid for it. It provides an interesting look into middle earth. The artwork on the cards are okay, not exactly breath taking, but even so it works fine.The book provides pretty good describtions of the cards meanings, and works just fine for an orcale reading.Some people say that Tolkien would not have approved of an orcale deck, being that he was a Catholic. Well I believe that is rubbish. If Tolkien wrote stories containing things such as wizardy and elf magic, I highly doubt he would be so intolerant of sometime like this. He wanted to create a legend, and this deck farther proves how influential Lord of the Rings is.I do not recommand this to divination practicers who have not read or seen 'The Lord of The Rings'. Nor do I recommanded it to narrowminded people.

These essays, originally given as talks to medical professionals, are the easiest exposition of the attachment theory that I know of. Bowlby was the chief developer of the theory and he explains it well.Attachment theory is a great advance on earlier work by Freud and others. It is based on true science, reproducible experiments, rather than theorizing based on the fuzzy memories of early childhood. And it explains much of observable human emotional bonding behavior. The easiest to observe is mother as a \\"secure base\\" to which the child as expeditionary force stays in touch with, and, when unsure, returns to.His little noticed or further explored remarks on parent/child inversion of nurture/attachment instincts has been of special value to my understanding of myself and some others. Check \\"inverted\\", \\"invert\\", \\"inversion\\" in Amazon search or index of book. It is a difficult concept to get a handle on. Requires much self-examination. It is understandable that successors have not developed this part of Bowlby's great work further."},{"Title":"A Secure Base: Clinical Applications of Attachment Theory","review":"This is an intense book on the subject of parent-child attachment and healthy human development. Bowlby's main contribution here is his theory of an attachment control system which operates, more or less, automatically, particularly when the child has a secure base of attachment with the mother and the father.The concept of a secure base Bowlby obtained from Mary Ainsworth to whom this book is dedicated.Bowlby says that the pattern set up of the ways the parents treat the child tend to be perpetuated in the child as an expression of his self or identity. Thus, an anxious attachment to the mother and/or father will produce an anxious child. So long as the child's feelings and modes of perceiving that ensue from his anxious attachment to his parents have been shut away from consciousness, the child will be prone to inappropriate and maladaptive behavior.180 pages"},{"Title":"THE SONNETS","review":"Although many critics and readers have crowned contemporaries John Ashbery or Frank O'Hara the champions of abstract expressionism in poetry, Berrigan's work is often dismissed because on the surface it is overtly stylistic.

One should know that this was written by a resident of Florida who had access to the sea where he many times collected as opposed to many of we aquarists who are landlocked.

You feel forced around a story that you may not at all be familiar with or sympathize with -- although I found many similarities between myself and the narrator, the narration was distracting and annoying.One main difference between this and \\"Less than Zero\\" is that McInerney puts forth a more cynical and lonely narrator, while Ellis's narrator seems to be a part of the pack, and considering that these books were written in the '80s, I think that the latter is more effective in being a sort of zeitgeist novel.Also, given the title, I had imagined something along the lines of Wolfe's \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" as far as a grand opus about the wonders of New York City. However, I was disappointed to find that the city was rarely discussed at length or in any sort of meaningful or epic sense.The best part of the book, that nearly redeemed it, are the scenes between the narrator and his brother Michael and the scene of the narrator at his mother's deathbed."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Meh, nothing over-the-top or outrageous about this. Actually, pretty boring and bland. Too bad, because it could have been a really great novel. Instead it's just an okay read. This is a borrow not buy kind of book."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is one of the most abominable books I've ever had to read.

Shallow characters, empty lives. If you must read McInerney, try Last of the Savages instead."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The book Bright Lights Big City was written by Jay McInerney in the early 1980's. The book tells the story of a young man living in New York who uses drugs in order to forget all the troubles he has had in life. The book is very short, almost 200 pages long, and for the story it tells, is more than enough. The book is badly written since the beginning, and it is not interesting at all. The book seemed to be good at the start, but as you continue reading it, it becomes terrible. The book suffers a decay from good to terrible since the beginning to its end. The main character is a young man who has suffered the loss of his mother and his wife, and the only way he sees to get out of the troubles is to use cocaine. The main character has no name, so the author is saying that this problem could apply to anyone who has lost their parents and is a drug addict. The book is written in second person, so the author wants the reader to identify with the main character, which I find very amusing because no one in a sane state in mind would identify themselves with a character with such characteristics. The main character lives in a fantasy world where he tells all the people that his wife is on a trip, but she really left him. He works at an important newspaper when the book begins, but with al his problems with drugs, he gets fired. The book has no central theme, the only idea that could be concluded is that the whole book tries to tell the story about a young man who uses drugs to forget about his problems with relationships and work. As the book progresses, the quality decreases from good to terrible. The book is very short, because if it would be longer, it would be a waste of time to finish reading it. The central theme of the book is not clear, the only thing that can concluded is that the author is telling the story of a young man who uses drugs to forget about all the problems he has in his messed up life. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, but if someone needs to read it for school, read it fast and get over it, because if you read it slowly, you'll want to throw away."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"A man named Jay McInerney wrote Bright Light, Big City. The book is about 200 pages long. It is about a young man that moves to New York With a great life and pretty much as soon as he gets to New York his life goes down hill. It seems that the best thing to happen to him since he got there was meeting his wife thew model who leaves him when he talkes her on a vacation to Europe. But when he decides to leave , his wife says that she is leaving him and she stays in Europe. Personally i think that the book has its good and bad parts, but the book overall is not good in my opinion. But as i said before , it has its good and bad parts. The yuoug man's life is just stripped away from him as soon as he gets to New york. and he paid for being there by having turned to drugs for redemption but in the real deal , he was just pushing himself deeper into the darkness. To tell the truth , i wouldn't recomend thius book to anyone. it's just a book that tries to get to your heart by making you feel sympothy for the main character. that's why i think this book is not good and why it got one star from me."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The beauty of this book is that it is written in second person. Another reviewer (whose name I would give if I remembered it...not trying to take credit) stated that as it was written, you became too close to the problems of the character to see the severity of them, wherein lies the genius. How many of us know to what level our problems have arisen without an objective outside party? People always embellish or play down their no-no's, depending on who they are. I think the author took this human flaw and ran with it, making a painfully realistic and potently moving novel. Watching the character's fall to rock bottom and then rebirth at the end was absolutely engrossing, and the black humor of it was well appreciated."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Bright Lights, Big City is timeless book that will be remembered for generations to come as Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; and Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; McInerney uses the second person narrative to put one in the shoes of the protagonist and does a superb job doing so. This work is pure art. Some call this book a guiltly pleasure but I beg to differ. The wit and irony in this book are paralelled by few authors such as Flannery O' Connor. The book is art. The symbolism is subtle and not shoved down the reader' throat. It is one of the greatest novels of our time. It is soon to be one of the books that high school students learn in English class if there are not teachers who do it already. People not from New York seem to be anti-BLBC but this book could have taken place anywhere. A must read for it's style, wit, and,realism. This book not only teaches, but entertains."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This book was an easy read in that you follow a man's life spiral downward to the bottom of the barrel after a marriage breaking up.

You almost feel bad for him because of the problems he has at work, with friends and his marriage. But, I said almost"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This book was fantastic. McInerney's writing is engaging and addictive. He is able to relate the story's main character directly to the reader, which serves for a poignant connection. It was, unfortunatly a quick read. Since I was so inraptured within the novel I finished in within several days. I haven't read anything as good in a long time. The irony of having the main character lose his wife to a somewhat materialistic career (modeling) just adds more to the scene of materialism and greed that was so rampant in the 1980's. The book if full of instances of the main character trying to find himself within a whirlwind of drugs and the night life. McInerney's writing almost has a J.D. Salingeresque tone to it, and the main character is somewhat strikingly similar in expression of thought as was the character of Holden Caulfield. The main character (referred to as You) could be anyone, and this is perhaps why the novel is so engaging, because one can witness theirself struggling with the same problems and addictions. As a young person myself I completely understood the experiences the character was going throughout the story, but I easily compared them to the 1990's. I recognized all the choices the character made and was awed to note that even thought the setting for the novel was the 1980's, the circumstances which the character finds himself within could take place in any time and place, making the story so entirely possible. And that's what a great book should be able to accomplish! ::Sigh:: it was WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I ordered this book and received it very quickly.

The author captures a life out of control"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The book is well written, written perhaps as an exercise in writing in the second person. As a story though it is thoroughly predictable and utterly dishonest. McInerney tapped into a particularly scene, probably researched in the pages of New York Magazine and The New Yorker's \\"Talk of the Town\\" pieces. It was embraced at a time when the publishing industry was desperate for new voices that would appeal to young readers, reared on the superficiality of TV after-school specials. Why I don't think this book will have lasting appeal is that its observations are actually reflection, heard second hand or experienced vicariously. (Reports to the contrary, the book was not a contemporary, urban, \\"On the Road.\\" The writer was always and remains a poseur. Which is to say though seductive on the surface--the reader is led to believe he or she is given a privileged peek into the hip New York of the early 80s--the book is notable for its lack of authenticity. \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" made McInerney a literary star although he never produced another book actually worth reading.

This book is one of the few. As our narrator wanders around from party to party, we eventually find that he is not lost, and not ever wandering, but running. This narrator is a little boy in a big city, and he took life on too fast and he lost control. Also the fact that he is obviously depressed is not helping him. People who hate this book, hate it because they cannot see how this man is unsatisfied with his life. wake up, that is the point OUR NARRATOR CAN NOT SEE WHY HE IS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS LIFE. Our main man has an empty space inside him, and the whole novel he tries to fill it, unsuccessfully. Eventually he wakes up to the world, and the smell of fresh baked bread, but no more shall be said. Read it. The 2nd person is interesting, and I honestly dont know what to make of it.

The word surface has a gloss, which is pleasant enough, but which falls far short of sustaining repeated readings. It is disposable literature, masquerading as something more permanent.*The protagonist identifies himself swiftly as enjoying an elite, Ivy League, background, with an accompanying modest cushion of wealth. His talents and, more desperately, his potential are hailed as grand and admirable. His interest in literature, in particular, is implicitly cited as rescuing and validating his moral worth. All this is somewhat tiresome and self-satisfied, and does recall the basic scenario of Catcher in the Rye (for better or for worse). Unlike in that alleged classic, here the author feels obliged to explain the protagonist's lack of direction, and he does so clumsily, resorting to a poorly realised appeal to grief.*The minor characters fair still less well. Amanda, the prodigal model cum wife, is empty and vacuous - no attempt is made into fathoming how or why this might be so. Similarly, Tad, an accomplice in drugs and clubbing, is rendered flatly. The surface might well be amusing, or even alluring, but in a novel one could expect more than what could be provided in the space of a thirty second television commercial (and that's all that's offered).*The eighties in New York might have been interesting in some sense, but the source of that interest remains opaque after reading this ultimately rather dull book."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is a very good book. It is about a young hedonist who, on the surface of things, has everything. The truth, however, is that he really has nothing. His life is without value; he is running away, immersing himself in a group of shallow friends, shallow women, drugs, and a job he despises. Ultimately, he confronts himself and begins a relationship with a real woman of depth. He also returns to the memory of his mother, confronting both her death and his love for her."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Many others have stated how well Mr. McInerney employed the second person in this book. It was refreshing to see a good usage of that often-ignored perspective. There were some great lines (\\"Tad was one of those guys who was always on the way, but rarely arrived\\" or \\"She had freckles. I didn't know they still made them.\\"). Overall, the book was a drug-induced exercise in addiction and loss. We are led most of the book to believe his wife's abandonment of him (she runs off to France) is the main cause of his fall from grace. We learn toward the end it was probably his mother's prolonged illness and finally death from cancer. But these are experiences which have shaped his life, and would not be possible if the seed had not been planted long ago for the protagonist to try to escape whenever possible. He runs from his feels for Amanda, he runs from his feelings for his mother, he runs (literally) from his brother Michael when he comes to visit. Coke, sleepless nights, juvenile pranks and the friends he keeps all point toward an escapist attitude that is inherent in the protagonist and I believe transcends the time and setting of the book. Mr. McInerney keeps us grounded in 1980's NYC, but the problems his character faces could be traded for the troubles of any young man in any city at any time. I enjoyed the book and I recommend it as an easy, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This book should be good for a roundtrip subway ride. It seems to be the inspiration (while itself derivative) for other &quot;young-man-in-NY&quot; stories, including Davies's Frog King.The narrator is a nameless second person voice in yet another story of anonymous Ivy League (proper names omitted) post-collegiate limbo. I get rather tired of reading about these singular rehashings of the well-educated but immature and self-absorbed aspiring writers forever stuck in their all-encompassing artistic and spiritual block. I am also sick of the over-represented 'dream of writing' - a tired and lazy choice of occupation because of its ambiguous objectives and mystical artistry. Come on, friends, let's write about something far more fascinating and esoteric than deceptively vacuous hobbies.There is little story, and what story there is is of little interest. This book, while eliciting smiles at times, is nothing more than a trivial account of hooky work-evasion of a mid-20's male and coke-snorting social languor. These narrators always come from the same place (the middle-class suburbian vacuum, are going nowhere slowly, and regard little besides themselves (which is to say, nothing of consequence).Thus my search for a truly funny author (minus Heller and Vonnegut) continues."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is a book I would definatly recommend to anyone who feels ready to read something orginal and unique.

This is the book that put McInerney on the map, and it serves as the blueprint for a certain brand of contemporary fiction. Without this book there would be no Brett Easton Ellis, Jonathan Ames, or David Foster Wallace. Still entertaining after 15 years, it's important because it changed modern fiction. McInerney may not write sprawling epics like John Irving, but it doesn't make him any less important."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Jay McInerney is an extremely talented writer, and this book alone proves it.

I can't say that I agree with this review. The book does not care about making an ending, cause this is not the purpose of this book, yet it has one though not a usual one with a clear statement).McInerney makes us witness the life of this guy, who can be us, me.

All messed up and no place to go.\\"That line sets the tone for \\"Bright Lights, Big City.\\" Jay McInerney's bestselling debut stands above other urban-angst novels of the time, which tended to go with shock value. Instead, McInerney experimented with second-person narratives and a vision of a fragmented, coke-dusted New York.\\"You\\" are a young man living in New York, and wife Amanda has recently left you for a French photographer she met on a modelling shoot. Understandably you are depressed and unhappy, and the loss of Amanda haunts your moods, especially when her lawyer urges you to sue her for \\"sexual abandonment,\\" even though you don't want a divorce.By day, you work in the fact-checking department of a prestigious magazine, where your malignant boss is getting tired of you. By night, you halfheartedly prowl clubs with your pal Tad, doing drugs and meeting women you care nothing for. Will you be able to move past your problems and become happy again?Consider that summary a little slice of what \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" sounds like -- the reader is the main character, which allows the reader to slip into another's skin for a brief time. Second-person narratives are often annoying, but McInerney's style is so starkly compelling that the little narrative trick pays off.The New York of \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is basically a big, glitzy, hollow place, but still strangely appealing. And McInerney adds splinters of reality here and there, like the tattooed girl and Coma Baby, which add to the gritty you-are-there feel of the novel itself. His dark sense of humour comes out in \\"your\\" thoughts: \\"your\\" boss resembles \\"one of those ageless disciplinarians who believe that little boys are evil and little girls frivolous, that an idle mind is the devil's playground.\\"And while many trendy novels of the time relied on shock value and obnoxious characters, McInerney keeps it low-key. The young man is likable and sympathetic, despite his tendency towards self-pity. And the people around him -- the self-absorbed Amanda, likable Tad and nasty \\"Clingwrap\\" -- seem surprisingly realistic, as well as the minor people who flit in and out of our hero's vision.\\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" has gained a reputation as a trendy urban novel of the 1980s. Too bad. Though the trendiness has worn off, McInerney's style and story are still worth reading."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Bright lights, big city...Where skin-deep is the mode, your traditional domestic values are not going to take root and flourish. -Jay McInerneyIt seems hard to account for the visceral loathing that Jay McInerney provoked in critics after publishing this best-selling first novel. Here's a typical comment from Weekly Wire:Hot young actor Ethan Hawke's first novel, The Hottest State, is mostly reminiscent of what used to pass for literary writing in the 1980s: a first person narrative of a vapid young man living in New York City, told without allusion, metaphor or self-reference. Essentially, the kind of airport-novel-taken-as-art for which Jay McInerney and Brett Easton Ellis were once praised, and then later reviled.Bad enough to be hammered like that, but to be lumped with the truly awful Bret Easton Ellis? Ouch! Perhaps it was simply the jealousy that authors always seem to feel towards successful fellow writers. Perhaps it was a generational thing; who was this punk kid to replace Hemingway's wine drenched Paris with a coke sprinkled New York? And, of course, his own generation was hardly going to defend an author who told them that they were all shallow and wasting their lives. Whatever the cause, the literary establishment has been so aggressively dismissive of him and this novel that liking it feels almost like a guilty pleasure. But I do like it very much.The book is unusual in that it is written in the second person, which, combined with the tone, makes the whole thing read, appropriately, like an admonishment. It opens in a Manhattan night spot with the line: &quot;You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning.&quot; But, of course, that is exactly the type of person that the nameless protagonist of the novel has become, hopping from night club to night club, looking for cocaine and women, with &quot;no goal higher than pursuit of pleasure.&quot; He alternately avoids and seeks out his friend Tad Allagash (Tad calls the hero Coach, so we will too) because Tad represents the worst of his own personal tendencies, but is also a ready source of drugs. Coach is well on his way to blowing his job at a magazine that is a hilarious put on of the The New Yorker, with burned out writers haunting the hallways. Eventually he is fired after turning in an error filled piece on France that he was supposed to be fact checking. We also discover that his wife Amanda has recently abandoned him to pursue her modeling career. Coach has taken to wandering by a department store window that has a dress dummy modeled after her. Over the course of several days of avoiding responsibilities and the brother who is trying to contact him, abusing coke &amp; booze at every waking moment, the remainder of Coach's life collapses around him.McInerney's portrait of these young New Yorkers is truly devastating; they are all surface with no depth. Coach remains friendly with Tad because:Just now you want to stay at the surface of things, and Tad is a figure skater who never considers the sharks under the ice. You have friends who actually care about you and speak the language of the inner self. You have avoided them of late. Your soul is as disheveled as your apartment, and until you clean up a little you don't want to invite anyone inside.Coach had doubts about marrying Amanda because:You did not feel that you could open quite all of your depths to her, or fathom hers, and sometimes you feared she didn't have any depths.Meanwhile, he finds himself asking, &quot;when did she become a mannequin?&quot;, because she is little different than her fiberglass doppelganger in the store display. When he meets her in a nightclub at the end of the novel, she is with an impossibly handsome young man who she claims is her fianc&eacute;, but he turns out to be an escort. The woman Coach is dancing with that night turns out to be transsexual. Noone is real, like the neon lighting in which their lives unfold everything is artificial; at best they are playing roles, at worst they are truly empty at the core (they have become the &quot;Men without Chests&quot; that C.S. Lewis warned of). Coach himself frames the episodes in his life as chapters from a novel, complete with titles. It's as if he is incapable of handling reality and must make a fiction of his own life, must turn himself into a literary construct.Finally, as he hits bottom, Coach begins to rebound. His brother catches up to him and they discuss the loss of their Mother, who sickened and died a year earlier. Coach is, at last, able to confront his own sense of loss. He calls an old girlfriend and tells her: &quot;I was just thinking that we have a responsibility to the dead--the living, I mean.&quot; The novel ends with him down at the docks, trading his sunglasses for some fresh baked bread. Hard to avoid pedantry here, but the bread pretty obviously represents the Staff of Life, the values of the heartland and the pleasures of hearth and home, as well as a means of resurrection--in the most fundamental sense, he is taking communion. Coach's decision to abandon the bright lights (he won't need the sunglasses anymore) and turn back towards the basics is a triumphal moment in modern fiction.In an era when &quot;white bread&quot; has become pejorative, an author who has his hero saved by a bread roll is obviously trying to communicate something. It would be a shame if those same shallow folk whom the book is aimed at were to succeed in dismissing it as no more than a &quot;drug book&quot;. It is a really fine novel and one of the few significant social fictions, along with Bonfire of the Vanities and Love Always (Ann Beattie), to emerge from the 80's.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I never understood why critics always want to trash Mc Inerney when his work is so obviously good. This is the book that made me desperate to write in the 2nd person and failed miserably! The characters are both hilarious and tragic and the scenes with the main character at his job as a fact checker seriously made me want to jump out of a window. You can feel this guy's pain in a gripping, terrible way and can understand why he does what he does and becomes a cocaine cripple. The writing is fantastic and evokes a world that truly doesn't exist anymore- New York in the mid 80s. The ending struck me as odd on the 1st read but then I loved it. I've become a real fan of all of Mc Inerney's books and can only imagine that people were jealous of him when he published- that such a young guy could write such an interesting, gripping book. Writers always want to talk trash about other writers it seems and critics love to talk trash about authors. It's their job, unfortunately. But Mc Inerney and Ellis and Jamowitz got all this criticism when I would have given them praise. Read Bright Lights Big City- I dare you to not like it!

Written in the second-person rather the otherwise de rigueur first or third, this novel is the story of a young man's plummet from the life to which he'd always dreamed (position at a prestigious literary magazine, beautiful wife, friends in the social in-class) to a nagging, tormented hell in which each new day greets him with the mocking revelation of what he has become. This character, primarily called simply \\"You\\" throughout the book, is burnt-out professionally and socially. His cocaine usage has surpassed destructive levels, the wife whom he brought to the city from a rural dead-end life is divorcing him, and the first-anniversary of his mother's death (which he has so far avoided dealing with via drugs and the fast life) is approaching and with it an obligatory meeting with the family he's tried hard to leave behind.Is this the study of a soul doomed beyond reprieve to post-modern Hell, or is it the bitter darkness before the dawn? At novel's end we are left with reasons to hope it is the latter, and as we depart from the story within this barely-more-than-a-novella, we want the young man with whom we've spent the last hundred-some pages to cling to the possible escape Mcinerney has set just within his reach.One can read Bright Lights, Big City in about as long as it takes to sit through the less-worthy film version. I'd recommend the chilly gut-punch of Mcinerney's prose to anyone who appreciates the future classics among late-twentieth century literature."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"In a second person voice Jay McInerney does the near-impossible and writes the great all-american novel for his generation. This is a style which is strange at first, but draws you into the story just the same. If any writer has done more to capture the pulse and spirit of the 80's then I can't figure who that might be. Using a young yuppie writer's struggles with love, career, family and cocaine he speeds the reader through several manic chapters until low and behold, the book is over and you're wanting more. The manic pace is what makes this book work so well. The movie starring Michael J. Fox and Phoebe Cates follows the book well and wins points as a good book-to-film movie (unlike so many others). The paradox here is how a writer can say so much in so few pages. It's also the only book I know of where the first chapter could serve as a great short story all on its own.

With absurd humor, he satirizes the \\"high\\" life of New York City and the non-stop action and party scene of young professionals whose frantic activity keeps them from having to deal with the real world.The unnamed main character becomes the reader as the author uses the second person point of view, telling the story as \\"you\\" go to work and clubs, and jaunt around the city. \\"You\\" work for a magazine at which no one has ever been fired, and where old, burnt-out columnists maunder in the hallways (a satire of The New Yorker, perhaps). \\"Your\\" immediate assignment is to translate and fact-check an article about the French elections by a deadline that \\"you\\" cannot possibly meet.Gradually, \\"your\\" story unfolds. Your marriage to Amanda, a fashion model from the Midwest, has collapsed after less than a year--you are devastated by her desertion, and you have told no one of your divorce. Your article for the magazine is a disaster. You avoid dealing with these issues and the death of your mother (more than a year ago) by creating a new reality for yourself through cocaine. The turning point of the action comes with the arrival of your brother Michael, who summons you back home for your mother's memorial service and the scattering of her ashes.It is difficult to write a novel that focuses on shallow people living shallow lives without having the novel be shallow, but McInerney's point of view forces the reader to identify with the main character, and his uncompromising vision of this empty life, which he presents with absurd humor, is entertaining. Similes and metaphors here are sometimes over-the-top. (\\"Her voice was like the New Jersey state anthem played through an electric shaver.\\" Tad is \\"a figure skater who never considers the sharks under the ice.\\") But these provide some variety within McInerney's short, staccato sentences, most of which march along like the \\"Bolivian soldiers.\\" A snapshot of New York life in the early 1980s, Bright Lights, Big City is a landmark novel for its insights into an era. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"\\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is a short book and reads very quickly. I think this is one of the reasons many critics feel justified in dismissing it. You can read this novel in an afternoon, and perhaps BLBC's digestibility works against it; critics tend to take this slim, sometimes breezy work far too lightly.I am often mystified at the sneering dismissals. What is the objection, exactly? The sophistication of BLBC's prose is something that is hard to argue with: there are lovely sentences and phrases on every page, and the wit is finely modulated, often tempered with a note of scarcely-contained despair. The protagonist is in such spiritual agony that the jokes are never merely flippant; it hurts to laugh when someone is this far down, although laughter is necessary to leaven the starkness of the situation.Maybe some people were turned off by McInerney's use of the second person. When the character is \\"you,\\" the reader is inevitably going to be aware of a certain friction between their own values/character and the narrator's. What saves BLBC's second-person voice from gimmickry is that the story is universal; we have all, at some point, been at the cusp of a far-reaching disaster, when every moment feels like borrowed time and we live in the dead-zone interstices between day and night. The situation is identifiable; ergo, the second-person is not only seamless -- it is insidious, conspiratorial. Yes, McInerney made a risky choice, but he sustains the \\"you\\" conceit very skillfully.What makes BLBC so successful is that it eschews self-indulgence, easy satire, obsessive autobiography. In short, it avoids the usual flaws of the first novel. Instead, it is characterized by modesty and generosity. Generosity is particularly needed by the protagonist, a cocaine-addicted fringe player on New York's literary scene. His life is on the verge of total catastrophe, and he has adopted a fatalistic attitude toward his inevitable unraveling: he doesn't have the energy to try to stop himself from falling.What results is a lost weekend that begins in puerile self-gratification and ends on a note of hope. McInerney doesn't treat his emasculated yuppie with contempt, which is the first instinct with second-rate novelists, filmmakers etc. Instead, he takes the courageous route: he looks at his protagonist's life as a symptom of a wider affliction and indicates a path out of the wilderness.BLBC isn't perfect -- the last twenty or thirty pages turn on a rather unconvincing revelation. McInerney seems to feel the need to give us a single explanation why his protagonist's life is in such disarray. But the \\"explanation\\" for the narrator's downfall was already implicit and entirely convincing; you could imagine yourself coming to the same pass given similar circumstances: good money, wilting ideals, a bad marriage, and a steady decline in ambition and prospects. The revelation, which I won't give away, weakened the book significantly, but not enough to make it any less than a minor classic. \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is an original, compassionate and wickedly funny riff on a decade that deserves to be re-examined, reviled, but never, never relived.Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"&quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; is notable only for its second-person narrative, a device that would have been interesting in the hands of a more skilled author; with McInerney, however, it comes off as little more than a cute trick. This book somehow manages the feat of reflecting the shallowness of 80s yuppie culture without offering a single perceptive observation about it. Indeed, this may be the only book ever written specifically for shallow yuppies who have never read a book and will never read another one. The main character's &quot;rebirth&quot; at the end is trite beyond belief. (He walks past a bakery and smells bread. It smells &quot;wholesome,&quot; so he trades in a yuppie status symbol for a loaf and eats it, thus saving his soul. Get it?) The great modern American novel about a young man at war with himself in the Big City remains &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; This book isn't a tenth of Salinger's masterpiece."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"You first heard about this book in a creative writing workshop, and you made a mental note to eventually get your hands on it and read it. You order it from the library; for some reason the book wasn't on the shelf, perhaps someone nicked it. You end up ordering it on inter-library loan to the dismay of booksellers. You read it cover to cover, and then, like an addict, you read it again since it's on interlibrary loan, and it won't be handy unless you go whole hog and place another Amazonian order.You reflect on the advantages of writing in the second person. You think, it's not a bad way of getting inside someone's head. Of course, you know that you're not exactly the un-named character. You wonder if the un-named character is actually Jay McInerney. Perhaps the quantity of cocaine used has been exaggerated. It's tricky writing second person fiction. You almost forget what you're doing and write and word that is homonymous with eye.You know what is special about this book? The geography of New York, especially references to the World Trade Centre...and the familiar interior monologues dealing with one's hopes and dreams for the future...newlywed stuff. You might not have been exposed to this party lifestyle if you were like me, a systems analyst, who had to go into work every day. But it's not bad to see how the other half live...Cheers."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Reading this 15 years after it was written, I was struck by how quintessentially '80's this story is. The values, the slang, and the obsessions are a snapshot of the period. I lived in metropolitan NY at the time and was surprised by how distasteful I found McInerney's somewhat exaggerated, but none the less fairly accurate, portrayal of a particularly shallow period in the nation's most self absorbed city.Probably in the mid-80's reading about the carpe diem decadence of Manhattan yuppies was more entertaining than it is now; today this novel's satire and irony are mildly amusing, but hardly uproarious. While I recognize the point was to develop frustration and a lack of sympathy for the self destruction and self pity of the protagonist, I simply got grossed out reading about excessive snorting of cocaine, imbibing of vodka, and sleep deprivation. After the author made the point he proceeded to beat it to death to the point where it was beyond any credibility. The point, I realize, was to emphasize the incredible self indulgence and aimless waste that characterized this group during the era; however, it starts to d r a g.After I had found myself plodding through about midway into the novel the complexity developed and some of the earlier metaphors became more self evident. Fortunately it's a short book because I was ready to give up, but reading the second half I was glad that I didn't. The last third is thought provoking, and moving, with a significant message.I began this with expectations to be highly entertained by a witty, sardonic period piece. Instead, I found it generally an unsettling reflection of a recent era and specifically a tale which touched me."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"In my English II honors course that I am currently taking part in, we hold monthly book clubs. My group chose McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City. I loved the second person narrative. This book, was hard for us to relate to. It was, however, insightful and I enjoyed being in the place of the character. It entangles you in every emotion and leaves you satisfied at its closure. It is a book that you should read at least once in your life!"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I just read a review of this book in which the author stated that he loved it. He raved about how &quot;fun&quot; of a book it was. Quite the contrary. Quite. I loved the book too, but for different reasons. Bright Lights, Big City was about a lost soul in the depressing eighties. Glitz and glamour and decadence. He was lost in it. Like all of us. And he had a major drug addiction. It wasn't &quot;fun.&quot; Was it fun when he coughed and coughed and then found himself with a bloody nose? You don't notice that these problems in his life are serious because of the use of second person. When something happens to you, you are too close to it, you can't see what happens. I got completely wrapped up in that frame of mind and didn't realize until the last chapter that the only thing he had consumed all weekend was crack. Very clever on McInerney's part. I liked the book. Oh, and to the person who wrote that review, I am in a college class and it was on the curriculum. I guess schools are getting a little more liberal!"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"In this supposedly zeitgeist novel of the '80's we see a protagonist who incorporates the essence of that decade: hedonism, urbanity, wealth, cocaine-fuelled nightlife in a competitive social minefield. Coming to think of it, not alot has changed really. Speaking in the second person singular, the writer is following himself around New York as though singing an extended version of &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Suicide&quot; by David Bowie.The structure is innovative and the tone is innane and babbling at times, which reflects our coke-head heroes mentality perfectly. Anything to drown out the sorrow beneath. From his rash decisions to the reasons behind his nihilistic spiral, all questions are answered slowly.It may seem like I am slating this book but I am not. He is describing a character who is a complete mess. It would be criminal to give cerebral insights and flowery desciptions about such a sullen, defunct lifestyle. Yet pity grows for him as his unfortunate past is revealed. For anyone who has lost someone close to them, his passage of loss is a touching and painful reminder.It was once described as the Trainspotting of the '80s. Perhaps in an obvious drugs/dilemmas/adventures kind of way, but this novel is more about one man who is a heretic of a scene rather than of how or why a scene works. He is not from a poor background, he is not unemployed, he is not living in a dreary council estate in middle fof Sotland. It is too personal to be considered a social commentary and its singular tragedy surpasses even those of Welsh's protagonists.So overall, not a fantastic book, not something to bring on holidays, not something to cheer you up, not essentially something to learn from, as the heroes coping mechanisms leave a lot to be desired. A tale of self-indulgent decadence and why. Certainly a book to read at some time in your life. It has its time."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Jay McInerney gave me a book, Bright Lights, Big City, where I was the protagonist via second-person narrative but decided to throw me into a mess of destructive drug use and jaded commentary. Aggravated, I pushed through the party-ridden, self-pitying beggining and got to know myself.As it turns out, I've been slumming with coke buddies and slacking off at work, because my life has ran away from me. My wife of one year, whom I brought from the trailor to the city, has left me for her modeling career. I hate my job. I wanted to be a writer when I came to New York, not some slave checking facts for a stuffy magazine. Add to this boring day job an equally boring nightlife of repetetive bathroom stalls with the same drug and new bimbos, and I begin to see why I'm feeling so down. I think about my wife and what happened, but there's never any resolution. So, how am I going to figure this mess out?Reading through my darkest hour, I came to some conclusions. Eventually, I drop the jaded tones in exchange for some beautiful thoughts. My optimism comes honestly when I'm not expecting it and keeps me going. There are a few people around me who care, and with their help, I might just sort myself out. Bright Lights, Big City is a candid view of me at a spiritual traffic jam, a pile up, really. I want to just float away from the city and forget my troubles, but my life hasn't disappeared yet, so there's a chance of me catching up with it."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Immature New York turd facing life issues before Ellis decides to turn him into a national psycho. Greatly played in the nyc 80s."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"A modern-day classic. An excellent, fun, quick read. This book is the inspiration behind so many young novelists of today. Unfortunately, it's also the inspiration by pretentious English Grad Students who wish they could have written this book and have been trying to ape it ever since.But it's a great book. And, by now everyone knows, written in second person. Yeah, yeah, it gets a lot of press for that alone. But look past it and just enjoy the thing. It's a quick read, a real exploration of the 80s, and what it's like to peak young and fade out fast.I could tell you the plot, but just go read it. It's about a magazine drone who becomes a bit of a cad due to his shallow model wife leaving him. It's the 80s, so he drowns his problems in booze and coke. But there's so much more to it than that. And told in such a simple way. Check it out."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This wonderful novel nicely captures the downward spiral that comes from love lost. The character, talented and charming but nonetheless traumatized, so we discover as the story unwinds, is sufficiently detached to refer to himself in the second person throughout the entire novel--and as such the narrative proceeds. Dumped by his wife, a narcissistuc, self-absorbed model, his downward spiral is painful, despite his witty self-effacing ironies. His descent includes escalating drug use, a restive search for his wife's replacement in all the wrong places, an abandonment to the hedonistic club culture of New York of the eighties, and self-destruction in the workplace. All is described in a peppy monologue that entertains but is just another aspect of his pain. Amidst this absurdist life, working for the New Yorker of all places, in a menial job with varied literary characters, his earnest side struggles to arise, finally doing so in a redemptive ending. The sort of chain reaction of disaster is quite poignant, and hardly hidden by the glitz and glamour of the city life which provides an alienating backdrop of superficiality."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"In an era when neon lights, supermodels, MTV, and yuppies were gaining prominence in popular culture, Jay McInerney's \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" caught the 80s wave and became one of the forerunners of a genre concerned with chronicling the ins and outs of the white urban male in the metropolis together with say, Brett Easton Ellis and that would arguably spawn other cult authors like Douglas Coupland and Chuck Palahniuk, who came to prominence in the 90s.This novel is essentially about an aspiring writer of fiction who is biding his time in the Fact Verification Department of a cutting-edge magazine (in New York no less), whose primary job is to verify the claims and content of its articles. His fashion model wife, Amanda, inexplicably leaves him, and he finds himself 'sexually abandoned'. He has a bunch of helpful colleagues and a bully of a boss Clara whom he nicknames 'Clingfast'. In between dodging his boss and getting wasted on drink and drugs with his best friend Tad, who proves as reliably unreliable, he tries to deal with deeper issues like his relationship with his family, while coping with acute loneliness.The writing style is sparse and fast-paced, and McInerney employs a second-person narrative that makes the reader feel implicated, and perhaps even accountable for the success and failings of his protagonist."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"A lot of books got a lot of hype in the 80s for supposedly describing the shallowness of that decade. This is one book that in my opinion, deserved and still deserves the hype. The nice thing about this novel is that it doesn't try to do too much or jam too much into its pages. Furthermore, although the hero of the book is basically a nice Midwestern boy who takes a good job in publishing in NYC and quickly gets in over his head, the book doesn't succumb to all those \\"yuppies on the wild side\\" cliches. Sure, the narrator runs into a few weird characters, such as the bald girl with the tattooed head in the first chapter, but these are minor encounters, the type you'd expect. He doesn't go off on some crazy \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" wild ride of the type that launched a thousand plots in the 80s, each of them less believable and less funny than the last.It would have been so easy to go that way too, because our hero has a coke habit and money problems and appears in some danger of ending up on the wrong side of a dealer or three, but the book stays realistic. Our hero gets up, throws away the dunning letters from Brooks Brothers, and goes to make an attempt at keeping his job before getting dragged out again by his party-hearty buddy Tad Allagash. He occasionally grieves for his dead mother or his lost wife (who has run off to pursue a career of her own in modeling) before drowning his sorrows in the next round of booze and coke. At the end, he finally realizes that he will have to learn to live all over again and get over his loss, and that life unmedicated can still be sweet despite its pain. This is truly a story that could happen to anyone, or at the very least, to anyone's friend.I also liked that the narrator and his wife did not appear to come from very wealthy backgrounds and therefore were a lot more relatable than the characters in Bret Easton Ellis's books. The narrator and his wife are wide-eyed kids when they come to the city, and it's easy to see how they get led astray by its delights. Nor does the book sink into the overly literary mode of, say, Michael Chabon. Mcinerney's prose is airy and descriptive and yes, similar to F. Scott Fitzgerald updated to a more modern age. It captures a lot of great details in a minimum of sentences.I was charmed by this book even though I never had a coke habit or a fast-paced job in NYC. It's a nicely crafted little remembrance of an era that's past...or is it? I bet a lot of the same stuff is going on in NYC today among the young people who move there and get exposed to the \\"bright lights, big city\\" for the first time. Five stars. I just wish McInerney's other books had been this good."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Few books capture the essence of an era or a generation the way that \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" does. Written in second person, a style used back in the 1920's when there were celebrated excesses in a generation, McInerney semi-autobiographical novel reveals the superficiality of a generation and an era through a life. A young man with a cocaine habit, loses his job at a magazine and his super model wife within a space of a week. All that was glitter is now dust. What was once an illusion of having it all, is now the reality of having nothing. More than anything, McInerney revamps a style and creates one of his own in this tribute to the GO-GO 80's. A funny read and a stylized read."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is a pretty good first novel and is intriguing insofar as it shows the themes which engage McInerney's later works. This reads a bit like Holden Caulfield getting his first job in the big city. And it also reminds me of JP Donleavy's extraordinary novel, The Ginger Man. One can see hints of Fitzgerald and almost make the case that McInerneys novels simply keep re-telling Gatsby. Such, at least, seems to be the case after reading The Good Life and Brightness Falls, the latter of which is an American masterpiece. There is something universal about this bright, young man taking his bright ideals into the crucible of New York where they are pummelled after much heartbreak into reality. The public perception rarely seems to match the private persona, either in you or in others. Despite the heaps of artifice which you pile upon upon yourself to keep the dogs at bay, it's all still self-deception and it never fails to disappoint. I wish we had seen more of Tad Allagash, the Falstaff figure whom Dunleavy uses so brilliantly to bring out the comedy of his protagonists in so many of his novels. I enjoyed the second-person narrative voice and it was bold to start a literary career by depolying such a technique. I really think that if you want to get the best of Jay McInerney, you need to read Brightness Falls. But this accessible, brief, first novel will lead you ineluctably to the real brilliance that awaits you in Brightness Falls."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I am in a Advanced Placement english class in school. Usually, the books we have to read are pointless, dull, and I always question why they are so special. This one is so important, it speaks to everyone. The main character is very different from other books, because he makes no apologies for his action or promises to do better. He is also very private, the reader might think that they know all about the lead, but there are so many surprises constantly being revealed. At the end, you want the book to continue, but are fearful for the characters self-destruction. I cannot rave more about this book, and if I had my way, I would require all to read this book. This book will forever be one of my favorite, and I dare anyone out there to find one in this genre that can ever out do this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I read this book last week after putting it off and loved it. A great read about 80's yuppie lifestyle of a guy who doesn't really enjoy it.

As far as one more book about self indulgent, self destructive, pseudo-intellectuals - it's ok, but enough is enough. I just didn't find the subject worthy of my or anyone's time. The writing is merely adequate. If you are stuck on a plane it's not a bad killer of time, but only worth a check out from the library, not a buy/keeper. What's the story with the rumor the ex-wife in the book is based on a real life model/actress?"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is the story of a guy who epitomizes what it was like to be at the beginning of your career in the mid-1980s, at least in the big cities. I lived in DC at the time that this book came out. I remember all the political parties I went too and the wild and crazy, and FUN (although self-destructive--healthwise) time it was to be in your 20s then.I adore Jay McInerney's accurate portrayal and hilarious sense of humor. In my opinion, his book is a novel based on real life.I loved the creativity and couldn't put it down. I have reread it so many times that I had to buy a new copy. Also, I give this book to anyone who aspires to be a novelist. Not all books must be as wild and crazy as this one. But J.M. got it right here; this is the most entertaining book I have read in my lifetime. (By the way I am a PAID and employed writer by occupation--a technical writer: computer manuals and all that boring stuff that pays really well). Of course, I hope to publish something creative before the end of this century, or at the very latest before die from old age.I am disappointed that his subsequent books seemed to be written by someone else. Gone was the magic of Bright Lights, Big City.I hope that college literature professors will put this on their reading list, but I doubt that will ever happen. Lots of sex and drugs in the novel. But I felt it was all done tastfully. I know it will offend some, but being a California native, I found it unoffensive and very true to life.I may write some novels or short stories about some of my experiences as a technical writer. And I can write a book about ferrets (there is one in Bright Lights). J.M. inspired me to write fun stuff, instead of the late 1990s trend towards morbid crime novels or accounts of gruesome violence. I am trying to use Bright Lights, Big City 14 years later to inspire me.Jay McInerney took a stylistic risk and it worked! I hope that anyone who wants to be entertained will read this fine book--as long you are NOT offended by graphic descriptions of promiscuity (random sex with strangers) and heavy drug use.The book is hilarious and interesting. I reread it occassionally and, and recomend it to any aspiring author. I never bothered to watch the movie because I enjoyed the book so immensely."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Even over 20 years later, the observations he makes and the social commentary ring true. Even the places he talks about are still around and are as vapid as they were in 1984. This novel is a glossy, yet gritty, snapshot of the bull-market hey-day when pop-culture was fun yet superficial, people wore designer jeans and cruised around town in limos doing coke. But ultimately the book leaves you feeling as empty as the characters described, which may or may not be the point. There's no real story here, only descriptions of the main character's state and observations about New York City that anyone who lives here more than a couple years develops. Ultimately it's like a typical 80s song-fun, sometimes witty, yet disposable."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This book is truly great. It moves along so quickly, and although it was written the year after I was born, I still feel like it does the best job of capturing a lot of the ideas and feelings of the current generation. The feeling of not knowing what you want, of not knowing what it is you're supposed to do with your life. Although, I have to admit that the ending is a bit weak, everything leading up to that is superb. The way the narrator (a 2nd person YOU) is constantly doing battle with what he wants to do and what his friends want him to do and what he needs to do. Overall, it's a great short novel, and I'd definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The first important social novel of the 80's.

You can identify with the character specially of you live in New York and if you are familiar with its nightife and its elements. The main character goes through highs and lows with his cocaine addiction, his job as a &quot;Fact verifier&quot; and his wild friends. If you like Glamorama you will love this book"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Similar to THE SUN ALSO RISES, McInerney draws readers into the lost generation of the 1980's when people were measured by money and material success. Tad Allagash is the definition of this shallowness as he leads Marty (you) through a life that promises non-stop thrills and gives little attention to the true responsibilities that must be addressed. But Marty is a victim of this generation. He doesn't fit with the stereotype of upward mobility. He is a simple man with simple tastes. He is a man struggling to discover his best self. He wants to find love again but can not if he can not discover himself. McInerney does a superb job of attaching readers to his characters. One way this is done is through the second person narrative that implies that the events of the novel could happen to anyone. A resemblance is cast between Marty and Salinger's Holden Caulfield because despite his sufferage, Marty refuses to acknowledge it. McInerney's ability to take us through the rock bottom soul searching that Marty does to resolve his conflicts is brutally descriptive and does exceptionally well to blur the class distinction of addiction being something that happens to poor people or criminals. Bright Lights shows how low a man is willing to fall before he realizes that he possesses the courage to continue. McInerney displays Marty's courage best at the end of the novel when he writes the brilliant scene, wrought with images, of Marty watching the man load the bread truck near the bakery. The aroma of the freshly baked rolls calls out to Marty's simplistic side and provides him with the reassurance that there is good still in the world, he just needs to rediscover it. So, he exchanges his sunglasses, all he has left, for a sack of rolls. Giving up the sunglasses, his shield or mask of his addiction, leads readers to understand that Marty is going to stop tailspinning and is going to rebuild his life one day at a time. This ending with the sun rising in the east is a direct contrast to the desperation felt in the opening scene at the after hours night club. This contrast allows us to see Marty's full journey. At times, the novel is darkly comic and cynical, yet it ends with a note of promise. It does an especially nice job analyzing the attitudes of the 80's. Not all people were mesmerized by the lure of the all mighty dollar, but those people had difficulty finding self-worth and satisfaction in light of their own personal struggles of family, self, and most of all love. McInerney synthesizes these struggles into the character of Marty and casts him against Tad, his alter ego, the poster child of peer pressure. The book is a good read that leaves you thinking about your own ambitions and feelings of loss. The ending is uplifting but it is realistic in that it implies nothing is solved immediately and that all good resolutions take some sacrifice and time."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"It takes about 30 seconds to stop being impressed by the second person narrative perspective, and it's all downhill from there.

It is as accurate to the rules of reality as something can get. This generation stuff is crap and this book captures the energy of young people in the 80's, the 90's or any other desperate age. It is hep without being annoying, funny, sad, and each word is placed like a gold filling. The scene where the narrator and Tad's cousin walk through the Village is more fetching than Winona Ryder. The end returns to the beginning and the smell of bread is the smell of loss. The Algonquin braves bring you to the Dutch settlers of The Great Gatsby, which is a book one day after some perspective it will be compared to. The third person telling (you) at first takes a little getting used to, and parts of the book, particuarly some of the scenes at the end, are a little bit too New Yorker, Raymond Carver, Columbia University between 53rd and 59th.

Maar ik kan dit geweldige boek iedereen aanbevelen"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"How did this book become so popular? How is it that all the reviewers either love it or hate it? There's nothing to it.First warning that you are reading a useless book - someone compares it to THe Catcher in the Rye. Immediately you know that it is going to be filled with disconnected scenes and a narrator with mental problems who reports on it all. However, none of these Catcher in the Rye ripoffs have a narrator as entertaining as Holden Caulfield.The main character in this book is a self-obsessed Yuppie who snorts coke, screws up in his job and eventually finds a little bit of peace. The second person narration works in defining just how self-obsessed this guy is in that all he's doing is talking to himself about himself. After 100 pages you wonder why he's so enamored.Anyhow, it's a short book. It reads quickly. A week at most if you are a slow reader will this book take to read. You'll read it. You'll forget about it. But it is ideal to read if you just finished a Dostoyevski book and you don't think you're ready to tackle anything too deep right away."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"You are intrigued by the second-person perspective for a chapter or so, but then, there are still many chapters to come. There are not excessively many of those chapters, which rates among the precious few good things to be said about this book. You quickly get to the point where you have to admit that you have, in fact, read more annoying books than &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; ... albeit, mercifully, not very often.So much for the facts, now to find out just what it is that makes you feel this way. The book attempts to ingratiate itself to you and to make you sympathize with the protagonist. But why should you? If anything, you sympathize with his supermodel bimbo wife. She would have required an angel's patience in addition to her angelic physique to stick with this loser. Not that his failings automatically make for a bad story, many great novels are about losers. But this one is so patently trying to make more of its hero than you or anyone else can conceivably see in him, even when cutting him some generous slack. This also goes for his oh-so-cool sidekick Allagash. Why McInerney is so visibly proud of this character, yet fails to develop it in any credible way, is anyone's guess, and definitely one at which you balked.As for the plot, the only surprising twist to its utter predictability is that his employer's highly commendable decision to fire him took so long.So that leaves you with the language, the elaborate facade of studied suaveness and supposedly with-it lingo behind which can be found .... well, nothing, really."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Trying to read a book in second person is extreamly hard. Expesially when you dont even know the main characters name. This book was not very well organized and seamed to be scrambled at times. Althought following the life of a Manhattan cocain adict is ammusing, reading in second person can be complicated at times."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is an iconic American novel? Seriously? In that case, fans of this book must be used to reading mediocre crap. \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is about depressed, shallow, pathetic yuppies embracing drugs and sex in New York City during the 1980s. The second person narrative is interesting, and the author does a good job of portraying the unnamed narrator's sense of desperation and hopelessness. However, that's all that the book really delivers. There's nothing groundbreaking here, and there's nothing likable about any of the characters in the book. The ending is very cliche, and for the life of me I just do not understand why so many people rave about this stupid book! It is no \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" that's for sure. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Believe it or not, my College Professor for English Composition 201 was the roommate of Jay McInerney, the author of this book, when they both lived in New York City! I was forced to read this for that class and in the course, found out a bit about the author and his life before the book. On page 109, the incident about releasing the ferret into Clara's office was about an incident that actually happened to my professor, in fact, I have seen the scars on his hand! He tells me that ferrets have VERY sharp, hard teeth. Both my professor (to protect his privacy he will remain nameless) and Jay McInerney worked for a magazine in the Department of Factual Verification.But to get to my review, I must say this was not one of my favorite books. Like my review of Saul Bellow's \\"Seize the Day\\", I found this book to be depressing. Also, both characters have drug addictions, are separated from their wives, have lost or are losing their jobs and have major issues with their parents.However, the interesting aspect of this book is that it is told from \\"second person perspective\\" meaning that the author never gives a name to the main character, his is simply known as \\"You\\". An example: \\"You are both in high spirits. You have decided that you are better off without that p***-ant job, that it is a good thing you got out when you did.\\" The book is almost as if it is about the reader, as if the book is talking to the reader. I like that it is an interesting new twist on story telling.The basic plot is that You is a fact checker for a magazine in New York City, he slacks off in his job and is about to be fired for submitting an article that he didn't check. You is a cocaine addict and is fueled on by his incidious friend Tad Allagash, an incurable player. You was married to Amanda, a midwest girl-turned model who went to Paris and never came back. You is struggling with his life in general, he once wanted to be a writer but all ambition is gone. You also has Mom issues, she died of cancer before he ever got to know her and he has regretted it ever since. You also feels trapped, his is at times overcome with the desire to escape his life, jump out a window and fly away. His apartment is unkempt, he parties too much, forgets too many things and cannot get over Amanda in order to have a healthy relationship. Also, there are references throughout the book to an article about a pregnant mother in a coma and speculation as to whether she will live long enough to extract the child alive. This is an allusion to You, he still feels as if he cannot cut the cord that ties him to his mother, he is caught between life and death, existence and nonexistence.To live, You must overcome his problem of settling for cheap imitations, his love for women who are never coming back, his reliance on drugs as an escape from life and surpass the shock of his mother's death. You also must find a way to trade his fast-paced, empty life for reality, we see allusions to this in the end. Altogether, this is not a bad book. But, it had a rather depressing effect on me and is full of the seediness of life in New York in the 1980's."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I really loved this book. It's not easy for a B.E.E. fan to rate four star a book from an other so called minimalist author, but i found the novel really awsome and funny: the plot is equilibrated and the characters well shaped.Much, much better than &quot;Brightness falls&quot;."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"An incredibly alive story of being beaten to death.

BLBC is often funny and never boring, and shows that second-person narration can be quite effective. The hero was dumped by his wife who pursued a modeling career, and his party habits (which include lots of cocaine) are preventing him from being competent at his job, which becomes less and less important to him. Reading this novel, I wish there would have been more of Tad Allagash, one of the hero's friends, who unfortunately is much more interesting than the hero himself. I thought too much time was spent on the hero obsessing over his ex-wife, time that could have been spent on the hero's and Tad's fast-living New York lifestyle. Even so, there is much to be admired. Anyone who has ever had a cocaine habit will identify with these characters, and the ending of the book is an emotional powerhouse, all the more amazing because of its simplicity. Even though it is far from perfect, reading &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; is time well spent."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"One of the most powerful and moving examinations of surrender and redemption I've ever read."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"It has been said that those flames that burn the brightest fade the most quickly. It has also been argued that an extension of this maxim to literature provides a quick dismissal of all topical, works of and in a moment. Bright Lights, Big City serves as an eloquent riposte to this critique of topicality; though it is very much a book about a moment within a subculture within a place (and it rejoices in its rootedness), more importantly it is about a person, and the details which seem to date it provide no more a detriment to its universality than those that Fitzgerald reveled in."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I was actually surprised that the 3rd person narration wasn't annoying. By the second chapter I forgot all about it--but it does little to put you in the shoes of the (anti)hero. I wish there was more about his family background at the start of the novel because the end is sad, but felt a little cheap as it wasn't pre-seeded. That was the only point that I felt he became likeable. Still, I didn't really feel empathy for him: not in regards for his wife or his job anyway.

Although most people think this is his most important book, I think &quot;Last of the Savages&quot; and &quot;Story of My Life&quot; are infinately more enjoyable, albeit VERY pedestrian (what I mean is: fast reads whith little education to draw from them. God forbid he should be put on a college reading list!)Despite my enjoyment of something &quot;new&quot; (or &quot;newwish&quot; as the case seems to be) reading novels in the second person can end up being more borring than Brett Easton Ellis's &quot;Glamorama&quot;.P.S. Easton Ellis is one of my favorite authors (along with Joan Didion [fiction AND nonficton ((except for &quot;Democracy&quot;)) and Flannery O'Connor.]"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This book is for me, nothing more than a young man dealing with the end of his relationship, confused about the circumstances surrounding that end, trying to find a way to cope. The fact that it takes place during the 80's has no real bearing. He does coke and drinks vodka simply because he needs something to dull the pain of this breakup, and since it is the 80's, these were the drugs of choice. If this book took place now, he might take ecstacy and go to a rave as a way to cope with his confusion. I don't see why people are so obsessed with talking about the historical setting, or the second person narrative, or the book being compared to Catcher in the Rye. It's about a man dealing with the end of his marriage. If you've ever been dumped for seemingly no reason, READ THIS BOOK. You'll feel better."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I know some people find the use of second person narrative to be a cheap gimmick, but I thought it really worked, with the proximity and intimacy of the first person half a step removed, giving the effect of the main character (who is never named) being alienated from his own life, a sort of out of body first person narrative. BTW, this is one of those cases where the book really is much better than the movie (despite a great cast, including Michael J. Fox and Swoosie Kurtz)."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I had not read any of Jay McInerney's books until this one. He has a new book published so I thought that I had better go back to the beginning and read some of his old ones before the new one. Wow! What a read - I could not put it down. He's a great writer with wonderful descriptions and makes your heart ache for his leading character - especially in the last pages. I'm on to Brightness Falls now and loving it. Why have I never found his books before? This book is a TOP read!!"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"McInerney was one of the most acclaimed literary bad boys of the 1980s, a star due to his debut novel, Bright Lights Big City. He spent the next 20 years (by his own account) partying more than focusing on serious writing (one favorite quote from Salon in 1996 calls him a \\"gin-soaked deer caught in the headlights.\\") In recent interviews for his 2006 novel, Jay reflects on his past and laments the years wasted as a partier. By all critical accounts, McInerney's latest novel, The Good Life, breaks him out of his 20-year slump.What better time than now to revisit the 1984 smash success of Bright Lights, Big City? First off--I wasn't old enough to read stuff like this in 1984. I have read the novels of McInerney's contemporary and fellow club-kid Bret Easton Ellis. Upon picking up Bright Lights, Big City a full two decades after its publication, I was absolutely floored by both the subject matter and by the writing style. I have _never_ read anything close to this masterpiece, which is told entirely in the second-person point-of-view. Is that even legal in modern creative writing?This novel is a brief (182-page) yet all-encompassing account of a man on the verge of a complete mental and physical breakdown. Our (unnamed) narrator has convinced himself that he is in control of his life, even was he uses cocaine to avoid his mundane fact-checking job, even as he admits that his supermodel wife of a mere year abandoned him, even as he discusses his failure at his dream of being a fiction writer. There's plenty of watching-the-train-wreck-syndrome to be had here, as our narrator uses drugs, screws up at work, screws up romantic prospects, denies his family history, parties until the wee hours of the night, and so on.The narrator finally gets a breakthrough (or two), in the form of the most unlikely people who take an interest and attempt to pull him out of his doldrums. As much as he thought he was all alone, people did care enough to shake him up and try to change his life.Don't miss out on this masterpiece of a book about drugs, families, depression, and careers. And when was the last time anyone managed to write a good book in the second-person? McInerney succeeds."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is an awesome little book! If you ever were new in a big city when young, you probably knew a Tad Allagash.Or waking up, feeling like dogmeat, after a night of partying hard, trying to avoid the dawning sunlight, walking past a milk company, knowing a full workday was ahead. Been there, done that.The best revenge is living well......"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"\\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is a deeply human and thoughtful story about the foibles of an unnamed narrator (referred to throughout as \\"you\\") -- a true everyman on a disillusioned crawl through the seedy Manhattan of the 1980s. He is fed up with the club scene, tired of endlessly prowling for meaningless hookups and his next fix, yet unable to face the empty apartment he calls home. His beautiful wife has left him suddenly. His night life has put his job in jeopardy. His brother keeps leaving him messages that go unanswered. Our narrator knows that he is screwing everything up but can't bring himself to fix any of his problems. Instead, he burrows deeper and deeper into a hell of his own making -- a hell born of profound grief, disillusionment and confusion. McInerney doesn't beat you over the head with over-the-top dramatics; instead, he mesmerizes his readers with a spectacular narrative that feels like a slow burn until the last layer of our narrator's depression has been exposed in a devastatingly sad flashback to something that happened to him a year earlier. What lies beneath his hardened front is heartbreaking and hopelessly real -- and it will not leave you after the last page."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The first thirty pages in Jay McInerney's novel Bright Lights, Big City are intense. It's six in the morning, the main character is wandering high on coke through a club and his only friend is no where in sight. When he finally leaves disorientated and without enough cab fare to get home, he is hit with the crippling morning sunlight and the painful realization that he left his shades at home. Picture a comic reel where a man stumbles towards the light at the end of a dark tunnel dodging bald women, men in drag and tiny Bolivian soldiers and you will get a sense of how this story begins. The writing style grabbed me from the first page. The novel is written in the second person so as the reader you are the main character, \\"all messed up with no place to go\\" (10) reacting to life with a smart mouth.I love the prose in this novel, especially in the sense that I find the main character's disheartened quips entertaining. My favorite passage so far is, \\"GRANNY CRUSHED BY NUT WHILE WIMPS WATCH\\" (13) where the main character furiously debates whether or not to help an old woman in distress. It intrigued me to realize that most of the scenes I was chuckling at were painfully unfunny. He laughs about his blow problem, the feelings he still has for his estranged wife and the job he hates; this seems like foreshadowing to me. I sympathize with the main character because I get the feeling that all the terrible things he jokes about will eventually happen and then life will hit him harder than he can imagine. I like that and I look forward to observing how he recovers, if he does at all. Either way, I'm hooked."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Twenty years later - this book still holds up - really worth a read especially if you like NYC settings"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The characters were a bit underdeveloped, and the story seemed to be on as much cocaine as the main character, but I couldn't put the book down. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"At first i thought this would be a very Brett Easton Ellis-eque book, which it seemed to be at the beginning. It starts with a seemingly shallow character which is yourself as this book is in second person. The character seems to live for drugs, trying to get laid, and just trying to find depth in a shallow pool. But then you grow to love him. Slowly little clues are revealed and you emphasize with him. It turned out to be a beautiful story, and even sad at times. It has real depth. And it isnt long at 200 pages, but it is full, very full."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Coach, as his friend Tad Allagash refers to him, is a mess. His wife has left him, his job in the Department of Factual Verification at an influential magazine is going down the toilet, and he has a bit of a coke habit. Having lost his direction in life, he takes to the nightlife of New York in an attempt to escape.As the novel progresses, Coach journeys through not only the superficial, unsatisfying nightlife of New York City but also the depths of his tortured and weary mind. The misery that seemed to be caused by the rejection of his wife turns out to be a much deeper and more terrible pain. While he may or may not be better off for his self-discoveries, he certainly isn't any happier. But then, another few lines of coke can take care of that. At least for a shorter and shorter amount of time before he is once again left with an emptiness that demands an explanation.This novel brings to mind the Socratic maxim that the unexamined life isn't worth living. But in Bright Lights, Big City we also find that this examination comes with a steep price.In my opinion, the most admirable part of this novel is the prose itself. McInerney deftly uses the 2nd person to narrate his novel and to detail the process of the protagonist's self-discovery. He weaves words like magic to create a poignant rendering of a life without an anchor in a way that is both dark and humorous."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Short book that goes by quickly.Well-crafted but curiously hollow story of a yuppie trying to make it in New York's tough publishing world. Characters ring true, but few were sympathetic.I liked it well enough, at about the same intellectual level that I enjoy reading Vanity Fair magazine. So if you are looking for an entertaining read that will not make you worry about important issues, I would say, &quot;go ahead and read it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I found this book to be so entertaining.

The book makes us question what we believe. And it makes us wonder how strong and durable these beliefs really are when faced with tragedy. From the very first page, we are active members of the story. McInerney writes in the second person so that we do not feel distanced from the main character. And in fact we never learn of the main character's name. The reader is the main character! That makes the reader a coke addict! But we should not be so quick to judge. As I stated earlier, this book puts good intentions and high moral standards on the line when matched with tragedy. Let the reader beware if he or she thinks such a fate is not possible. What would it take for you to sniff Brazilian Marching Powder? This book asks such a question. If you find an answer to the question, do not despair. Read this book for help and hope."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I've read all of the brat back authors, and I wouldn't jump in and say that any of their works are magnificent literary masterpieces. Bight lights, big city, however, is by far the best novel to come from this period. High Points: Excellent, unprecidented use of 2nd person narrative; witty, satiric, paraodic, and humanistic at heart; very accesible, nothing too over the top, and it avoids pointless refernces to the flat pop-culture of the 80's. I actually have no complaints about this book, but then I don't think many people are going to be talking much about it hereafter. It is more of an entertaining artifact of the 80's than a great work of literature."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I found this book to be frustrating and sad. At first, I thought the unnamed main character was your typical yuppie who is caught up in Manhattan's fast paced, drug induced night life because that is what young, unattached adults do. But then you find out all the bad things that have happened in his life. The drug induced night life made more sense. It was his way of coping with his loses. I thought the writing was clever. Maybe too clever. Some reader's found humor in it. There were some witty parts. \\"Tad's mission in life is to have more fun than anyone else in New York City, and this involves a lot of moving around, since there is always the likelihood that where you aren't is more fun than where you are.\\" I wouldn't classify this book as \\"funny\\" however.

McInerny may be talking about the eighties, but he impressively manages to tackle dated subjects with fresh humor and style. However, the jokes don't keep the story unemotional. The nameless lead character starts out cold and distant, but by the end of the book I felt as though I was him. &quot;Vicky&quot; may insist that one person cannot truly know what it is like to be another person, but McInerny brings us so close to his hero that he allows his readers to accomplish this feat. As for the style of the book-- just as I was getting annoyed with the use of the second-person narrative I began to love it; the text reaches out to us and becomes personal and immediate by the end of the first chapter. &quot;You&quot; is the most human character I've come across since Holden back in high school. I can't wait to read more by this talented writer. Sad, sensitive, and hopeful, grave and hilarious, Bright Lights Big City is proof that underneath the suits, sarcasm, and drugs, yuppies are people too."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"McInerney appears to have had one brilliantly written book in him about a jerk who is totally lacking in character.

But Bright Lights, Big City manages to produce the first \\"great\\" second person narrative that I can think of. From the very first pages where McInerney throws us into New York night life, we are confronted with a character who is both strange and familiar who is moving in a New York that is both strange and familiar. As a fact checker at a major publication who is getting over the fact his wife, who happens to be a model, has left him, the protagonist struggles with a dual desire to be isolated and comforted by others.What is most striking about this book is the prose. It is both clean and smooth and has a way of moving you back and forth between action and description. This book can be read in a single night and you find yourself so attached to this guy who is as messed up as can be, yet you feel so sorry for him as he confronts his brother, uses more drugs than you can imagine, and struggles to write a novel. He is the anti-hero spawned in a world after the Beats made names for themselves, and I can honestly day that this novel may be a stronger piece of fiction than On the Road or even Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.This is a gem and should be treated as such."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"The second person narrative of this book provides an appropriately disjointed look at addiction, not only to cocaine, but to the cocaine culture. In the beginning, this user is holding the coke spoon rather than the other way around. In the beginning, the city and all the promises that it holds is his friend. New York, like the drug itself, assures him that together, great things can be achieved.The shabby thrill of the book comes through witnessing his decline and destruction, but also of his realization that it is happening. In that way, it stands apart from many other treatments of addiction in literature. \\"Bright Lights\\" is not a novel written according to a worn formula where the protagonist rises, falls and then picks himself up a wiser man because of the experience. In this one, you are there with him along for the dopey ride. You delight in sniffing coke in a bathroom stall while huge breasted beauties wait in the club outside. You suffer when the job is gone, the friends prove shallow, and the armor of self-delusion has fallen away.An extremely captivating read. The movie adaptation was fair, but in no way a substitute for this all-to-real drug fest."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"It should be read, if only for the technical skill used in creating it.The fact that I found it tragically hilarious and reminiscent of certain friends was also a plus. A useful antidote to the &quot;Friends&quot; vision of New York City life."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"&quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, a brilliant product of the 80s era of superficiality and excess, is a portrayal of a yuppie news reporter living in near-total denial. Strangely, the second-person technique manages to effectively create a bond of sympathy between reader and hero, as we are drawn into the conflicts and misfortunes that beset the nameless reporter. The novel, which is idiosyncratically told in the second-person, relates the episodes that transpire in the bustling nighlife of Manhattan, from the nightclubs to the high-rise apartment blocks, as the oppressed protagonist recovers from one cocaine orgy to another, as he copes with the trauma of losing his prestiguous job out of negligence, to concealing the fact that his model wife has left him, to the death of his mother. Though the novel is inevitably tragic - an odyssey of escapism and frailty, - it is redeemed by its wit and sophistication. Very funny in places."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"I am aware McInerney has kind of gone out of fashion (so '80's, don't you know) but this book remains funny, wise, and endearingly satirical about the eternal vices. And that's what's supposed to last, isn't it? This first novel relies heavily for its tone on good old F. Scott Fitzgerald, but the second-person narration is a brilliant story-telling strategy--it sucks &quot;you&quot; right in to the narrator's world.

The current Vintage Contemporary edition features in its cover a drawing of a men entering the Odeon and the Twin Towers in the background - as if we all needed to remember this was a book written much before the loss of the innocence.The set is New York in the middle 1980s, when AIDS wasn't the issue and the city fuelled with cocaine and neon. That decade always seem to be something lost in time. And literature and cinema handles it this way. \\"Bight Lights, Big City\\" is sort of a lighter and smarter cousin of \\"American Psycho\\", which handles the same generation. But McInerney's prose is much well handed and his narrative more effective than Breat Easton Ellis'. The novel is entirely written in the second person, and it feels like \`you' is just one more character.Rarely did a writer capture the 1980s zeitgeist as McInerney. We see his nameless protagonist frantically crossing the city after drugs, women or something he lost in his life and doesn't know. The plot unfolds in a New York minute. The writer has the ear for capturing vivid and believable dialogues, while creating interesting characters.However fun it is to read \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\", it is impossible not to notice that it is above all a sad story. The main character is only going through the motions, just the course life takes. He never takes the plunge to change his destiny. Could he if he tried? Maybe so. We'll never know. But what we do know is that McInerney has written a novel that will last for ages. When people in the future wonders how the 1980s was like"},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Recently in an interview I read (I can't remember where -- online, hardcopy, it's too much work to try and remember sources anymore), Ann Magnuson discussed how New York City stopped being New York City around 1987/88 when the gentrification, yuppies and real estate all began changing the face of what had been artists lofts and low-rent housing, as well as the cultural scene. \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is set in the early 1980s, at the beginning of the end of the old New York Magnuson remembers.McInerney's first novel is an addictive read. It moves quickly and most surprisingly, the second person narration is in no way an obstacle; the novel reads smooth and easy. Perhaps the book's only true flaw is a dip into sentimentality and Hollywood romance toward the end of the book, but otherwise, it's a biting look at everything from the less than glamorous world of fact-checking at a prestigious magazine (a thinly veiled New Yorker), the club scene and feeling lost in your 20s. If you ever wonder what happened to Holden Caulfield, this book is one of the many directions his life could have taken after \\"Catcher in the Rye\\".In 2005, the book functions not only as a novel but a time capsule of the time when people could afford studio apartments downtown. The World Trade Center still stands, the corner drugstores has not yet been converted into Starbucks but life is not any simpler. But over twenty years later, through it all, \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" endures."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"you pick up this book, written in the 2nd person, and you read it. you're amused by some of the episodes and you hope that they all lead somewhere, but they don't. you reach the final chapter and suddenly realise that you've lived, so to speak, through a week of a life of a carciogenically boring person. you eke out a measure of revenge by writing this review for amazon dot com."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"First of all let me nail my flag to the mast - I'm a Jay McInerney (and Bret Easton Ellis) fan. I know a lot of people aren't - but then I'm cooler than a lot of people.Interesting from the opening line and written in the second person (\\"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning\\"), Brights Lights, Big City is a satirical portrait of a young lost soul trying to find meaning in an apprantly meaningless world. Set in New York City in the 1980s our hero walks zombie-like through clubs, self-indulgence, drugs and meaningless relationships. He hates his job and is basically a mess who is wasting his life. Just as we were beginning to think that our hero has an amazingly shallow existence - he is revealed as being more than a simple waster. He has, in fact, been abandoned by his new wife, is estranged from his family and has aspirations to be a writer of fiction. He is human after all and the question he faces is whether or not he can be bothered to get his life back. Will cynicism or optimism prevail?McInerney (like Ellis) is often dismissed as a writer of disposable \\"drug stories\\" with little literary ability. I disagree. If you are able to look a little deeper you will find plenty of interesting social commentary."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"This is a very sensitively and humanely written novel about a young New Yorker who must deal with several great losses: of his beautiful fashion model wife who abandons him when she moves to France, of his job as a magazine editor, and of his mother. At first I find him self-indulgent and silly, but as I get to know and understand him better, he turns out to be merely sad. Hence, his increased bar hopping and abuse of cocaine.He acts as if he does not care about the loss of his job through carelessness and indifference. He becomes increasingly depressed and comes close to developing a nervous breakdown. The search for his wife is sadly pathetic. I developed a real empathy for this young man and came to realize that under similar circumstances, he could be you, me--any of us. By the conclusion of the book, through meeting someone new and a cathartic experience, he finally confronts the painful memories of his mother's death. He sees that he \\"will have to go slowly...and learn everything all over again.\\" He is on his way to recovery."},{"Title":"Bright Lights, Big City","review":"Well, contrary to the stereotype, here's a pretty anti-Bright Lights review from a New Yorker. I found the book a mildly amusing, but very shallowly rendered, portrait of a very specific time, place, profession, and lifestyle. McInerey seems undecided about exactly what he is undertaking. At times the book is straight satire, at times real tragedy. And the genres blend like oil and water in BLBC, each undermining the other and leaving the book without foundation. Admittedly, there are very moving passages (very late in the book), where McInerey seems to have decided which direction he'd like to take, but by then the damage is done. His use of the second-person makes the story feel partially formed. While he doesn't use the POV poorly, it is inherently flawed in that the reader is invited to bring more of him or herself into the novel, only to find a clash with the story told. Because of this it feels more a novelty device than a means of rendering the protagonist an everyman.The final flaw of the book is the target of its criticism. One review claimed that the book was dead on satire of &quot;the MBA set&quot; (or something to this effect), missing the point entirely that it is not the MBA set being satirized. Rather, there are a hodge-podge of targets: Ivy League literati, ad men, models, designers, Rastas, Hasidim, Greek diner owners and Greek gigolos--all told about half of New York. Thus McInerey's barbs seem thrown wild as buckshot at a skeetshoot and come across as one-liners about 1980s stereotypes. For a much better, and better focused, work of 80s satire, see Ellis's American Psycho (which -is- aimed at the MBA set and which uses deliberate, stylized, shallow representation).Not a timeless book.Frankly, I'm a little surprised it outlived its decade of origin."},{"Title":"Optimization Techniques (Neural Network Systems Techniques and Applications) (Pt. 2)","review":"Neural networks have seen an explosion in interest and application in the last 10 to 15 years, when they evolved from research on artificial intelligence One can find books on diverse subjects such as finance, medicine, and any physical or theoretical science with significant sections devoted to the use of neural networks in that discipline. I conducted a non-scientific survey (in 1 minute or less) of the importance of the subject matter by asking Amazon.com how many books it listed on subjects I thought might be equal in timing and importance. The results (below) imply a significant interest in neural networks, from readers and authors alike. My list does not report on the number of books that contain chapters or significant sections on neural networks.Neural Networks=1021 books listed; DNA=948 books; Enzymes=779 books, Genome=232 books, and Human Genome=100 booksOptimization Techniques is the second in a seven (7) volume series from Academic Press on neural network systems techniques and applications. The series presents itself as the first all-inclusive treatment of the subject matter and is aimed at a wide array of potential readers: researchers, students and practitioners in industrial, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing and computer engineering. As such, one would expect the series to be appealing to a more select audience of research workers focused on creating and improving neural networks, and not so much to those of us who use the applications and interpret the output. This seems to be the case.This Volume in the series, claiming to be the first comprehensive treatment of optimization techniques including system structure and computational methods, presents the work of nineteen (19) contributors as a synthesis of what is known about neural networks and optimization techniques at the present time. The book is divided into ten (10) sections, each addressing different topic areas. I would not suspect that more than one or two sections would be of interest to the reader in an applied research field.I found the sections on the learning of nonstationary processes and neural techniques for data analysis to be informative and well written. I did not anticipate having a warm feeling of confidence in my level of understanding the first time I read these sections. I am confident, however, that I know which direction current and future research will take on neural networks."},{"Title":"Rabbits For Dummies","review":"This book is chock full of general useful information on caring for rabbits covering a variety of pertinent topics such as housing, medical treatment, breeding and pretty much any other topic pertaining to the care of rabbits, showing, and breeding. There are also sections on the subject of responsible pet ownership, what to consider before bringing home a rabbit, and information on rabbit rescue and volunteering. There is an extensive internet reference guide and resources appendix. This book is exactly what a newbie rabbit owner needs and ideally should be obtained before bringing a rabbit home. Our rabbit breeder recommended this book to us as a primary referral guide. There is just enough information offered in each section to get you started without going over and above a beginner's head. If you are looking for more information regarding any section, the book tells you exactly where to get it. As with all books in the dummy series, it is easy to navigate and find what you are looking for.

However, I am concerned that readers will take its title as a suggestion that it is actually OK to let a dummy have a rabbit. Well, it's not!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rabbits For Dummies","review":"Your investment in a how-to book should never save time, money or trouble in any way, because then the medical Gods might not make enough money.Books on how to care for pets shouldn't divulge any veterinary secrets you can do yourself, they should just tell you over & over to see a vet if you suspect anything, cuz we're all Bill Gates. There, I just saved you the trouble of buying and reading this waste of paper.This author lives in some kind of la la land where only ideal advertisement type people live - you know, the ones with unlimited time and resources to devote to any interest.This book will help fill up the animal shelters with pets that could have had homes, but won't because according to it, most people in the real world are not qualified for a pet. Better to kill them than not spend a fortune on them and a minimum of 3 hours a day on caring for them. Reminds me of the animal hater I got my last cat from, at the animal shelter, who grilled me on and off for 4 hours, on whether I could take \\"proper\\" care of the cat she was otherwise going to keep in a tiny cage for awhile, then kill. Give me a @#$% break.I guess the \\"Dummies\\" line is either beginning to fail, or cater to the other type of Dummy. We need a new line of books \\"for PITRWWLR\\" [people in the real world with limited resources].I'm really starting to loath this mentality that's creeping into our society, where nothing can be done by anyone but a \\"specialist\\". What's the point of a \\"how to\\" book if it's just going to point you to a \\"trained expert\\" to do everything you bought the book to find out? I can see the day coming when we'll need 'specialists' to wipe our butts. New definition of a \\"Reference book\\": One that refers you to anywhere or anyone but the book you're holding."},{"Title":"Rabbits For Dummies","review":"This is a good book and seems to have a great deal of information, but I felt there was a definite bias against people who raise rabbits as livestock and (shockingly) actually eat them. This is a book solely for pet owners, not for 4-H students, FFA students, homesteaders. I understand that rabbit fanciers probably don't want and shouldn't have to be confronted by instructions how to slaughter and dress \\"Fluffy\\", but I wish there had been something that stated that this was a \\"pet book\\" somewhere on the book's cover before I spent $17 on it. We have a loved pet rabbit, but we also have meat rabbits. If you want to learn about rabbits as pets, this is probably a good book for you. If you want a book about raising rabbits commercially or harvesting them for meat, you might look into Storey's Guide to Raising Rabbits by Bob Bennett. He has had 5 rabbitries and has raised rabbits for six decades."},{"Title":"Rabbits For Dummies","review":"FINALLY - someone who wrote the TRUTH about good rabbit care (for the most part).

It provides quick access to easy to understand tibits about common rabbit concerns. It's written in a manner that is able to keep most people's attention and interest.The only problem I have with the book is the fact that it doesn't emphasize that rabbits should not be kept in hutches. Rabbits, regardless of size, should be kept in a set-up that is more akin to that of a dog pen. An area that measures approximately four feet by four feet that is fenced off INSIDE your home will be a better set-up for your new lagomorph. They need space to run around and play while you are at work or school and the wire bottom of pet-store rabbit cages can be very harsh on their feet. They do not have foot-pads like dogs or cats. If you value the health of your new companion, please use a dog pen.I recommend looking into adopting a rabbit from your local House Rabbit Society chapter (http://www.rabbit.org/chapters/index.html). Rabbits from pet stores are often sick and not litterbox trained (yes, they are easily trained and very clean animals).That all said, please read this book before you purchase a bunny.

The book brings together both ARBA and the House Rabbit Society. It knocks neither and presents both sides; so its a safe pick-up for a believer of either spectrum.

I understand the need for the book to want certain things to stand out, but when these marks are used on every page it is hard to decipher which things truly are important as opposed to which things that might just otherwise be the point of a paragraph had the text been written in one.

When Albert dies, it seems that he's won after all, as a death in the family would postpone a wedding for at least 6 months. So Daphne decides to hide the body, aided unknowingly by the groom's son Graydon and the loyal butler.The good:The humor. It's reminiscent of the movie Arsenic and Old Lace, with the body disappearing, and some bumbling petty criminals.Daphne. She's a wonderful heroine--no shrinking violet, she's logical and resourcefulGraydon. Likewise a wonderful hero. He's protective, but when he discovers Daphne's involvement, he respects her and works with her.The bad:The emphasis is more on the comic adventure than the romance.The unusual:This is written in omniscient POV, which can be distancing, but it's very effective in this case.The verdict:This would make a fabulous movie. As it is, it's a rollicking fun read.AN ENCHANTED AFFAIRLisanne Neville can see fairies, which makes people think she's odd. Her parents die, leaving her an orphan heiress, and her greedy uncle takes over, alternately punishing her and ignoring her. She routinely escapes to the \\"haunted\\" woods, but this is threatened when the impoverished Duke of St. Sevrin who owns them decides to sell the timber. She proposes marriage to him as beneficial to both--saving her woods and getting her out from under her uncle's thumb, and paying off his debts.The good:Lisanne is a very strong heroine, and I liked how she took matters into her own hands and engineered her own rescue.The story doesn't end with the wedding. It shows Lisanne and St. Sevrin adjusting to marriage and working at making it a success.The bad:It's a bit darker than most Regencies, at least at the beginning, with the abuse Lisanne suffers at her uncle's hand.I wanted Lisanne to escape sooner, though I understand why she didn't.The verdict:Surprisingly complex for such a short book (228 p.). It's a Cinderella story, if Cinderella had played the part of her own fairy godmother."},{"Title":"Lady Whilton's Wedding and an Enchanted Affair (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Screw-ball comedy sums up Lady Whilton's Wedding.

I have always been interested in philosophy, yet never found the time to really delve into each individual work due to time constraints. This book suits my needs perfectly as it analyzes and summarizes about 100 major works of philosophy, beginning with The Analects of Confucius, covering the Bhagavad Gita, the Tao Te Ching, Saint Augustine's The City of God, Saint Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica, Niccolo Machiavelli's The Prince, Rene Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, Rousseau's The Social Contract,among others, and ending with John Rawls' Theory of Justice.Each philosophical work has an essay analyzing the principal ideas advanced (at the beginning the name of the author, type of work, and the time it was first transcribed is provided), pertinent literature (analyzing these works), and also a list of recommended titles for additional reading on each philosophical work. This is a handy resource for those seeking an introduction to the major works of literature."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of World Philosophy","review":"Gives main points to works, really helps you understand the philosophers so you can then think for yourself."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of World Philosophy","review":"Very well written summaries of the major philosophers up to the 1950's stopping at an excellent review of Ludwig Wittgensein's work. Great for history of philosophy but unfortunately few modern philosophers included in volume 2. For these the 1990 edition of Masterpieces is needed as a supplement. This volume has many philosophers which the 1990 volume has to omit because of space restrictions so I see these volumes as also needed to supplement the 1990 edition.Roland R.

There was nothing there to keep me interested. I thought the vampire story had some promise, but Calder and Maeve's relationship with him irritated me to the point I put the book down halfway through. No, this one is definitely going in the book exchange pile."},{"Title":"For All Eternity","review":"From the very first page, you are drawn into the story. Ms Millers writing had me completely connected with the characters, feeling their love, their loss, their pain and their glory. Having a very old print copy of Dracula by Bram Stoker did not make me want to read this, the back cover drew me in and the story held me completely. Devouring it in less than 5 hours, to the blissful discovery for Maeve and Calder left me overjoyed, but is also left a sadness within when I came to the end. I wanted to read on and on. It was nearly a year later that I discovered the first book and the final two. Or is there more to come?

Very creative and powerful characters. Linda Lael Miller did such a good job in describing her characters that I felt like I knew them so well. I loved Dathan's character with all his arrogance and sex appeal. Dimity was another character that I fell in love with and would like to get to know better. I would love to see Mrs. Miller come out with a book about that female vampire. Oooo, what a story that could be!My only disappointment with the book was the love story line between Maeve; the main character and a female vampire and Calder; a mortal man. I found Calder's character to be weak and quite boring actually. The love story really got in the way of the exciting vampire story line. I noticed myself skimming quickly over the love story parts involving Calder and Maeve just so that I could get back into the great vampire stuff. I must admit though; I LOVED the vampire sex passages...very erotic!This is a definite must read for all ! vampire fans."},{"Title":"For All Eternity","review":"This is the best vampire book ever! The love story that develops between Maeve and Calder pales in contrast to the gripping scope of the deadly struggle between the forces of good and evil. I especially liked the scenes between Nemesis &amp; Maeve--two very strong-willed characters. Ms. Miller has a beautiful way with words and a great imagination!"},{"Title":"For All Eternity","review":"Friends of Ms. Miller must be writing these reviews because I found nothing to enjoy about this book. I was looking in particular for a good vampire book and could not believe that this level of writing was considered excellent by all of you. I'm beginning to think we need some other way to catagorize this type of writing. I for one did not find the plot enthralling or even interesting because the writing level was too elementary. She gets 2 stars for getting published. That was truly an accomplishment. Sorry, just being honest to those who really want to know."},{"Title":"For All Eternity","review":"I can't believe the amazing reviews this book is getting here. I just looked it up on Amazon because a friend of mine wanted to know what the worst romance I ever read was. I read this when I was fifteen, and I didn't exactly have high standards.This book was AWFUL. The vampire is silly and angsty (to be fair, I'm not fond of the Anne Rice vampire angst, either), and the romance is lame. The whole plot is improbable, and I like weird fantasy/magic/etc. books."},{"Title":"For All Eternity","review":"The book was moving and powerful from beginning to end . Miller style is unique within all her novels and I have read all of her novels that I can get my hands on. For All Eternity was the one however that got me started in the first place. The protrayal of all the vampires throughout the books makes us step back and review our perceptions of the supposed creatures of the night whom all through history has been protrayed as evil but through Miller's books we see a different side, a romantic, protective and humane side . The book was just beautiful along with the sequal to it"},{"Title":"For All Eternity","review":"If you enjoy Vampire Romances, this book, along with the rest of the series, is a must!

I almost wish she didn't clog it up with the love-story side of it. I was more interested in the Vampires than i was in the happily-ever-after.(and i'm a romance fanatic!!)

I'm not sure how well it stands alone. The entire series is best appreciated in relation to the other novels (why, why, why doesn't the publisher put out a boxed set of paperbacks for the current genenration? )However, my children and I enjoyed it immensely, and we all hope against hope that Mrs. Langton will write more books in the series. They even inspired us to go to Concord for our spring break vacation last year!"},{"Title":"The time bike","review":"The Time Bike is the sixth book in Langton's loosely-connected Concord series for children. Although it does contain references to the prior novels, it can stand alone. Unfortunately, it can't stand too well, with or without its predecessors - The Time Bike is a disappointing entry in a series that contains wonderful books like The Astonishing Stereoscope and The Fledgling.Edward's new bike is stolen, but he recieves another one from Prince Krishna, the deus ex machina of this series. To Eddy's dismay, the replacement bike is old-fashioned. At first he's embarrassed to be seen with it, but he feels better about it after he discovers it can travel through time. He and his associates have a few disjointed temporal adventures and defeat the nefarious Prawn and Preek.The Time Bike lacks both the intelligence and the magic that made the first four books in this series so marvelous. The other books, too, benefitted from a sense of unforced depth and penetrating insights, while this book skims along the surface and very deliberately does not look too long or too hard at anything.Over all, a rather depressing book, with flaws I hope will be corrected in future entries in the series. Jane Langton's children's fiction is well worth reading - but please, start with The Diamond in the Window. Starting with The Time Bike is a disservice both to the series and to the author."},{"Title":"The time bike","review":"This book is about a boy who gets a bike for his birthday.

The boy makes some big mistakes while traveling through the past and future. He makes a really big mistake but you will have to read the book to find out what it is.I think you should read this book because it is a great fantasy book.

Do you like science fiction? I do not, but if you do, The Time Bike is the book for you. The book is about a boy named, Eddy, who gets a mysterious bike. He doesn't know what kind of bike it is until he sees a clock on it. When he figures that it is a time bike, he uses it many times. I gave this book two stars because I liked some of the adventures that Eddy went on, but not all of them. For example, on one of them, Eddy went back in time to learn about Henry David Thoreau. One of the adventures that I liked was when Elenor (Eddy's sister) had a turn on the bike. I wish that I could go to some of the places they went. I was disappointed that I didn't learn about Mr. Thoreau when Eddy went back in time.

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.The Adventures of K'tonton (1935) included 16 stories and was reprinted at least 10 times. (We own the tenth edition, from 1956). No wonder. Each tale includes important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor--and its own complex plot. A few tales from this volume--Ktonton's Sukkot Adventure and Ktonton's Yom Kippur Kitten--were reprinted later as individual books with new color illustrations.Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben--whose first name meant laughter--was called K'tonton, which in case you wondered, is Hebrew for very very little. He was a late-born miracle for whom his mother had prayed so hard one Sukkot that she promised to love even a child \\"no bigger than a thumb.\\" Sure enough, before a year had passed, she gave birth to a son. And sure enough, he was no bigger than her thumb. She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.It was also on the harvest festival of Sukkot that K'tonton made his first trip to the synagogue. As his father put his etrog carefully into its box to take to shul, K'tonton eagerly asked to join him. \\"Next year,\\" answered his father, \\"when you're a little bigger.\\" Like all over-eager boys, K'tonton did something he shouldn't, and climbed inside the etrog box to hide.Once in shul, he couldn't see, so he climbed onto the lulav--the palm branch that is pointed east, west, south and north, to the heavens and to earth as part of the celebration. As K'tonton's father rose with the congregation to chant Hodu l'Adonai ki tov--Praise the Lord for God is good--there was K'tonton singing from atop the lulav, in a high treble that rose above all the other voices.I can't tell all the myriad details, but here's a taste of K'tonton's adventures: He planned a palace for the Sabbath Queen, saved the birds on Shabbat Shirah, planted trees in Israel and sent them a Shanah Tovah (a Happy New Year). In one hilarious tale, a spinning Chanukah dreidel carried K'tonton off the table, down the stairs, out the door, into the street and into a gutter, where he found a small bit of Chanukah money known in Yiddish as gelt.K'tonton also turned up in a Purim cookie, a Hamentash, covered with poppy seeds. On the day before Passover, he helped (with a mouse) find and discard the last crumbs in the house to help celebrate the redemption of the Hebrew slaves. He had a picnic on Lag Ba'Omer, rode an arrow and a bird. The book also features stories for Shevuot, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur (when K'tonton tried to feed a hungry cat), Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah and a finale for Sukkot.Each one of these 16 special stories of a tiny boy will light children's eyes.

Let me say this; I finished reading this book and IMMEDIATELY flipped to the beginning and read it again. It is AMAZING. So dark and true and humorous and everything good literature should be."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"The meaning of \\"Wise Blood\\" is hard to discern, since O'Connor writes with such magnificent economy and simplicity. She etches out a dismal picture-full of gray and rain and pain and indifference. I'm not sure exactly what she had in mind, but this is how it struck me...I think Hazel Motes is already dead when the story begins, killed in the war after enduring great physical and emotional pain. He never talks about his combat experiences, and from his bitter silence we can infer his overwhelming sense of guilt and disillusion. He cannot reconcile the inhumanity he's experienced with a notion of Jesus that is just words to him. So when his train reaches Taulkinham, the scene of his cleansing, he preaches the Church Without Christ. He proclaims Jesus to be a liar. Man has not been redeemed. If we were redeemed, there would be some evidence somewhere-but there isn't. And indeed, the townsfolk make his case. Asa Hawks is a loathsome fraud. His daughter, Sabbath, luxuriates in her moral corruption. Enoch Emory-the outsider with \\"wise blood\\"-laments that nobody in town will shake his hand. People stare at the street in somber silence as they go through the motions of life. Taulkinham is all hate and crass self-interest, literally a town bereft of redemption. Taulkinham is a dirty reflection of Haze's own soul: his accusatory preaching bounces indifferently off his few pitiful listeners and back into him, driving him to greater exasperation and violence. The more he rails against judgment, the more surely he feels himself judged. The more he feels himself judged, the more he denies his judge. Finally, after a crowning act of defiance, he tries to leave town, but is rebuffed by a policeman who pushes his car off a cliff with the coolness of a man buttering toast. At this point Haze moves from defiance to acceptance, and undertakes to cleanse himself. He subjects himself to every form of pain and torment he can devise, and waits patiently for salvation. Eventually, his landlady, Mrs. Flood, attempts to ease his pain for mainly selfish motives. Haze sees through her easily despite his blindness. He suddenly knows it is time to go; his blood is now \\"wise\\"-it tells him what to do without him needing to think it. Go where?, Mrs. Flood asks. He goes off to escape his purgatory, of course, and after a few days wandering around in the freezing cold, he winds up near death, seemingly nowhere. But a policeman's billy club bashed upon his semi-conscious head punctuates his victory. Dead to the world at last, he can live. Jesus has taken him home."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This is an eerie and disturbing novel. Flannery O'Connor is brilliantly dark and mysterious, though the tone is light and airy."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This book never drew me. Perhaps I'm too removed from southern goth? I didn't find it funny like some. I certainly don't care for religious struggles and the various non sequiturs where he'd bark out churchy comments were only disharmonious to me. I understand that she was showing its magnetic, fatalistic allure to him but instead it just seemed disconnected and without an overarching plot."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Wise Blood and recommend it on account of its imaginative storyline and talented author. This book is worth reading and will not be forgotten.Flannery O'Connor's ingenious use of dark humor and twisted religion sets the tone in her novel, Wise Blood. With characters such as Hoover Shoats, Enoch Emery, and Sabbath Hawks, O'Connor paints a vivid picture of the South in the bleak post-World War II and pre-Civil Rights time period. Wise Blood examines the religious spectrum that was present in southern cities and the interaction of these ideals. While there are some disturbing events, and characters, this novel has a fascinating view of life in all of its absurdities."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"WISE BLOOD is one of the best books ever written in the English language. Flannery O'Connor pioneered the dark heart of the existential hero. The John Huston movie was excellent but dimmed in capturing the full impact of the novel (so what else is new?). This is a work of genius in American literature. The tragicomedy will burn itself into your mind and you will never forget the misadventures of O'Connor's hero, Hazel Motes, and his fruitless try at offering the world another kind of Jesus."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This review is for the Farrar, Straus and Giroux paperback edition, 1967. WISE BLOOD, first published in 1952, was Flannery O'Connor's debut novel.The story opens with Hazel Motes, recently discharged from the Army, on the train to the fictional town of Taulkinham, Tennessee, where he's \\"...going to do some things I never have done before.\\" Haze is not from Taulkinham, apparently has never been there. \\"But you might as well go one place as another,\\" he says to a talkative passenger, and then adds without provocation, \\"I reckon you think you been redeemed.\\"Haze has a problem with redemption. He is haunted by the \\"ragged figure\\" of Christ \\"who moves from tree to tree in the back of his mind.\\" On the street corners of Taulkinham, he preaches the Church of Christ without Christ, but attracts no followers other than Enoch Emery, an unlikely apostle and Onnie Jay Holy, a con man who usurps Haze's idea. Haze can't even convert himself. Instead, he relents to his compulsive interest in Asa Hawks, a competitive preacher who claims to have blinded himself, and Asa's fifteen year old daughter.The author considers her work a comic novel about a person whose belief in Christ is a matter of life and death. I found it a dark story about confused characters from someone else's nightmare."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"It was a very good book and I have enjoyed reading it. She is very vivid about her writing; it makes one feel he/she is here. I think it shows the &quot;unseen&quot; side of religion"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"three and a half stars...o'connor is probably the only religious writer i have ever liked as opposed to walker percy ( his stories come off too dry for my taste ) you can count on her for to find the macabre in the unlikeliest places...the characters make this story. she seems to be sending up hucksters and organnized religion. plus it's short, you can finish it in an evening...and it's wholly quotable...make me wonder if tarantino might've read this before filming pulp fiction. it's got that same weird quirky energy"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I found this book enteraining as well a deep insight into one person's interpretation of a person's struggle with God and Christ."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood delivers yokums to an alleged city where the main characters' lack of education makes them commit acts which most others would deem violative of common sense or Judeo-Christian ethic. They include: sex with a minor; self-injury; mutilation; murder; theft; assault; battery; stealing from the blind and more. Those committing these acts include preachers, policemen and other trusted persons.Basically, all of these simple characters \\". . . had had a hard life, without pain and without pleasure. . . \\" Their simple lives deprived of education had been their largest handicap. And, without enough education to know basic wrongs from rights, they do things onto others which assuredly one would not do unto others. Critics say that O'Connor's characters are \\"grotesques.\\" This book certainly includes grotesque people and personalities.Religion and blasphemy are the staples of the protagonist Hazel Motes - don't be fooled by the name, this is a man who is 22 and just finished stint as a soldier. Hazel, for whatever reasons, decides that proselytizing his message of truth meant to tell the followers that Jesus did not die for us, but because of us. His Church without walls was to be called Church Without Christ. This church \\". . . don't have a Jesus but it needs one! It needs a new jesus! It needs one that is all man, without blood to waste, and it needs one that don't look like any other man so you'll look at him.\\"Ultimately, the contradictions of this religion are merely formulaic of the book's core. There is another preacher whose pre-deacon days were so full of sin that he showed his devotion to God by blinding himself before a congregation of over 300 people. Later we discover that he scarred his face with lime, but had actually never touched his eyes with the volatile liquid and therefore never lost his sight. That man of the cloth lies, and so Hazel seeks to be of truth by preaching of a Church Without Christ.So many other contradictions exist, many embroiled with religion. For instance, a girl who is born a [...] is told that the Bible asserts her illegitimate birth denies her soul access to heaven. So she asks herself, why live a good Christian life if the ultimate reward can never be obtained. Like a life-sentenced convict in prison, does any sentence repress her from committing violative acts -- can an inhabitant in a penitentiary really be told to act obediently \\"or else?\\" No.Written in 1951 this book asks questions which probably would not be read by many Americans of that generation.Elmer Gantryreceived critical and public furor for reciting how clergy can be more common and hypocritical than their parishioners. And, making such twists of stereotype is exactly what Flannery O'Connor does so well."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wow. Reading O'Connor is like taking a punch in the gut, but what a punch. WISE BLOOD is an uncomprising tale where you get the impression that not one single word is misplaced, that the story states exactly what O'Connor wanted to say. Admittedly, it takes a while to get the mote out of one's eye to see what she is doing, but it is a journey well worth taking for she lays waste to the secular world and its esteemed treasures. Consequently, what is seen is inferior to what is not seen.Motes' redemption comes when he realizes this is the only truth.Jesus does win in the end."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I'm a huge fan of Flannery O'Connor so when someone asked me to name my favourite novel I picked a little bit-of-a-book and said \\"Wise Blood\\".Partly because the characters are, if not wholly understood, at least wholly familiar. Despite growing up around an assortment of Evangelicals and Foundation types I managed for the most part to maintain a pretty superficial view of them. Things like snake handling and female oppression were odd but ordinary and because of this ordinary I never spent too much time thinking about the misguided spirituality that a lot of it sat upon. Through a glass darkly, and all that.Mostly, I'm moved to recommend Wise Blood again and again because it's such a brilliantly layered and grotesque comedy with powerful and appealing themes of integrity, the disaffected young and redemption. It's just one of those books you never really walk away from. Not really.And that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This novel combines startling images and an inscrutable Old Testament sensibility with funny scenes that will make you laugh out loud. It is the novel that helped cement Flannery O'Connor's literary reputation. She's a writer who will be part of the canon in a hundred years -- people will still be reading and discussing her. \\"Wise Blood\\" is the story of Hazel Motes, a man determine to strip Christ out of his life and out of the world, but, who, paradoxically, is also obsessed with Him. A walk through a haunted yet still good world filled with men who are made into monkeys, workaday street preachers, broke down autos, this is a kaleidoscope of sense, doubts, guilt, and humor: a must read tour de force."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"In Wise Blood, O'Connor uses ghastly imagery, foreshadowing,and reoccurring symbolism, to facilitate her criticizing of: the self proclaimed prophets who preach solely for the financial gratification, the disintegration of a hopeless society infatuated with materialism, and those who foolishly run away from the only thing that can save them. O'Connor foreshadows Haze's clash with Christian theology when his early childhood is exposed. Not only born into a Christian family, Haze is expected to become a circuit preacher like his grandfather who&quot; traveled in a Ford automobile.&quot;(10) This foresight is evident when Hazel purchases the Essex and becomes the traveling minister of a &quot;Church Without Christ.&quot; Clearly stating that &quot;he knew by the time he was twelve years old he was going to be a preacher,&quot;(10) O'Connor foreshadows Hazel's quest for fulfilling the role administered to him. When he becomes the preacher of his self proclaimed church, Hazel attempts to refute any significance his dead ancestors had placed on Redemption. Another foreshadowing, this one of death can be presented through Hazel's early experiences with coffins. The first being when he had seen his dead grandfather in a casket, his \\"two younger brother; one died in infancy and was put in a small box. The other fell in front of a mowing machine when he was seven.\\" These horrific occurrences provide a more insightful view on Hazel's character and explain both his unappreciation for life and hostility towards afterlife. \\"For a second he thought it was a skinned animal and then he saw it was a woman. She was fat and she had a face like an ordinary woman except there was a mole on the corner of her lip, that moved when she grinned , and one on her side.\\"(32) is an example how foreshadowing and ghastly imagery are used to illustrate the perverse affliction of lust Hazel's father experiences and the instances where pure tragedy can leave the impressionable abandoned in an immature world. Wise Blood is an extrordinary example of great American literature, not only for its dynamics devices and messages, but for its entertainment value as well."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"In the 18th and 19th centuries C.E., landscape artists often used a convex mirror made of darkened glass to aid in their work. It was called a black mirror. Turning their back to the landscape, they would paint using the reflection in the dark mirror as a reference. The image they saw had a compression of details, and a muting or loss of tonality.Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood seems to have been crafted using a sort of literary black mirror to survey the human landscape. The characters, without exception, are darkly rendered, and many are physically deformed. Flannery reportedly gave little truck to psychology, saying that art wants to begin where psychology leaves off. Yet her main characters are tugged, yanked, and tumbled by deep and mysterious longings and compulsions that originate far beneath the crust of conscious thought.Wise Blood is filled with completely undisguised hatred for the hyper-religiosity of Southern Bible-based fundamentalism, and O'Connor's ferocious characterization (maybe caricaturization is a better word for what she does) is both brilliant and repellant. O'Connor described this work as a dark comedy, and it is interesting to note how many reviewers comment on how comical they felt this book was. If indeed it IS comedy, it is a mocking, sneering sort of comedy, with as much warmth in it as a sleet storm. One can only laugh AT the characters, never WITH them.When the landscape artist of the 18th and 19th centuries stared into their black mirrors, they saw a world deprived of color and somewhat distorted shape compared to the landscape that they had quite literally turned their backs on. In some sense, in Wise Blood, O'Conner turned her back on the fullness of human existence, and in this book painted a darkened and distorted human landscape. The full color of human behavior, including easy laughter, generosity, simple kindness, and love based on integrity and trust has been filtered out. There is, to be fair, a single act of kindness in the book: when a gentleman on a train is asked by a half-sane teenager to share his newspaper, he hands the youth the funny pages.O'Connor was a Catholic, as was I when I grew up. She, like I in my youth, liked to draw a sharp line between what she felt was nonsensical Protestant/fundamentalist excess, and the (perceived) rationality and depth of Catholicism. One evening in a college dorm party that was well-infused with different varieties of alcoholic spirits, an atheist classmate of mine asked, \\"So, how exactly is Catholicism different than a cult?\\". It took me a few decades to work out a consistent answer to that question, and the answer led to a change in convictions. Flannery O'Connor's loyalty to Catholicism would have lead her to a different answer than the one I eventually arrived on. Which leads me to a line of questioning about her attacks on the hyper-religious that will surely earn me a fusillade from O'Connor-philes. It's a question about vision.Self-blinding, both feigned for profit and real, is a theme in this dark novella. O'Connor relentlessly harpoons the hypocrisies and foolishness of overwrought Christianity (which many readers and critics have found of great comic value). Is her own Catholic Church any less subject to savage review (e.g. Christopher Hitchen's characterization of Catholicism as the church with the \\"No Child's Behind Left\\" policy)? Was the exceedingly well detailed history of the shallow spirituality and deep cruelty of the Inquisition known to her? Is O'Connor's distinction between her brand of faith and that of others no more than a highly literary and brilliantly conceived case of the blind leading the blind? Might those who laugh at the false prophets and shiny blue-suited preachers of O'Connor's novel, while taking comfort in their own safely distanced and advanced spirituality, be merely a case of the blind reading the blind? What might O'Connor have seen if she had eschewed the black mirror of her own religious convictions, and turned around to face humanity in all its richness rather than only the charcoal hues she so ably focuses on?Lastly, this novel was cobbled together from stories that O'Connor had previously written. No mistaking it, there is brilliant writing here. But the roughness of the needle work used to sew these disparate pieces together, in my mind, denies Wise Blood a legitimate claim to the title of \\"classic\\",or the more mundane five star rating."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Street Preaching: Wise Blood, Flannery O'Connor's first novel, was published in 1952. It introduced Flannery to the literary world, and quickly made her style one of the most recognized of all time. She writes of deep Southern towns, where one gets lost in musty streets and dark sinister alleys, encountering equally musty and sinister characters. This book set the path, on which her subsequent novels follow.Wise Blood begins by introducing the main character, a discharged service man named Hazel Motes, who finds a new home in a large city. Hazel discovers the wonderful world of street preaching and creates a church titled, the \`Church Without Christ.' His attitude toward life and those in it is cynical and almost absurdly opinionated. This demeanor shapes the story to the point where the reader believes his immoral actions and opinions are reasonable.During the first day of his new life in the city, Hazel meets new characters in similarly desolate states of being. Enoch Emery portrays a ravaged young man whose blood tells him what to do and often dominates him to a point where Enoch can no longer control his actions. Asa Hawks, a street preacher, accompanied by his daughter, Lily Sabbath Hawks, tries to change Haze's life for the better, but ends up only confusing him. Hoover Shoat becomes Haze's one and only prophet, but later turns against him and changes to his street-preaching competition. The characters weave a bizarre story, to which Flannery provides the necessary details to create dreadfully vivid scenes.Often, the theme in Flannery's books is not clear and one must dig deeper into the book to find its true meaning. In her short story books, like Everything that Rises Must Converge, I find it easier to discern a prominent theme, because I can compare the stories to find a common thread. However, the theme of Wise Blood hides within the more complex story line. Through looking into the characters' actions, I found this dominant theme: \`Do not plan too far into the future, until you know what lies ahead.' Too many of the characters in the book make plans for the morrow but cannot fulfill them and ultimately end up disappointed. Enoch Emery feels in his blood that he has a mission, but he is unsure of how he should react to the strange messages. Instead of being productive and continuing with job and other engagements, he spends all of his time worrying about what he must do. If he had been flexible from the beginning and pondered less about his \\"mission,\\" he could have avoided being caught up in theft of a museum artifact.Flannery's writing, especially in this short novel, is compelling, and makes it hard to put the book down. Her attention to detail makes one feel that the characters have been neighbors all one's life, even though they lived in such a different time and place. She has a way of writing that enfolds the reader into the story. I often was frustrated with the story line, because she made me realize that the characters' conflicts with their surroundings and each other result in doings that are morally wrong. This style characterizes Flannery's writing, in that her stories often end up with an unexpectedly tragic ending. Her tragic endings are just one more way that she portrays the grim life style of those less fortunate.The ending left me thirsty for more of the story. I did not feel Flannery completely told parts of the novel; she did not finish many of the sub-stories that she started. Despite this drawback, I found the book to be well thought out and written in the amazing way that only Flannery can write. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy in-depth but short novels that transport them into the hard life of those who struggled to get along in the city slums of the Fifties."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This is a unique story that is particularly hard to describe. It revolves around the story of a man who is revolting against Christ, perceiving that to be a revolt against everyone else, only to realize they are just as lost as him. It's the story of several madmen in a society that is Christian in name only. It's a unique story."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I love Flannery O'Connor for her use of dark humor, for her ingenious use of metaphor, but most of all for her strikingly visual prose!"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"It took me a while to settle into this book. I think I initially found O'Connor's organization a bit jarring and disconnected. I wasn't surprised to later learn that she initially published parts of it before publishing it as a whole.Once I got over the structure, I found this to be perhaps the most American fictional portrayal of religion since The Scarlet Letter. O'Connor does a masterful job of showing how and why we believe, how and why we fail to uphold said beliefs, and how we can recover (or not) throughout the process.Her writing is, of course, brilliant. What impressed me most is her ability to conjure a street, or a home, or an interaction using minimal words that seem perfectly placed every time. Her trademark eye for detail shows itself on almost every page throughout this work."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I borrowed these words from Robert Brinkmeyer, Jr who wrote the book, 'The Art &amp; Vision of Flannery O'Connor' which I read side by side with 'Wise Blood' and the Short stories that he refers to. I am a painter and a southerner, influenced by all the forces Flannery so brilliantly writes about.I am awestruck by her brilliance, her faith, her genius at challenging her reader as she challenged her own faith, her own prejudices. I am humbled to have even read her work. We suffered quite theloss when she died at 39. Ah, Flannery... 'Cheers' to you. You have given me the gift of new visual imagery and challenged me tonew realms of the spirit."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I've never read a piece of American literature as profound as WISE BLOOD. Even though it was first published in early '50s, the book will certainly shock you all the way through with its violent images and brutal characters. BUT this American masterpiece is still helplessly beautiful. And also amazingly funny. After reading WISE BLOOD, you will never be able to shake it out of your mind as long as you live - GUARANTEED!! Flannery O'Connor is god!"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"O'Connor's use of man's struggle with religion is strange in an etheral/religious way, but at the same time, it is universal; it's message, whether we choose to accept it or not, applies to all of humanity. Regardless if we are old or young or of middle age, we have at one point questioned God, embraced God or pushed that life force away. And that is what her stories and novels represent: salvation through something that is greater than ourselves. That greatness is either our inner spirit, the earth's spirit or something beyond our realm. But salvation for a singular belief often comes at a cost: death, etc.. That is the essence of Wise Blood, where we are introduced to Hazel Motes of Eastrod, TNN who founds The Church Without Christ.Hazel is different (religiously speaking) in that he chooses to live his life not according to the norms of society. When he finds that he has followers to his church, he discards them, does not appreciate them. When one founds a church or an organization, the sole purpose should be is to get followers. But that is not the case with Hazel Motes. He wants to be separate from humanity. Period! He will go to many extremes to live his life the way he sees fit. Flannery O' Connor's work goes beyond religion. She merely uses it as a catalyst for the expression of other ideas. It is for that sole reason that her work will stick out in American literature."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I used to think that Flannery O'Connor was a man. An Irishman who somehow was labeled one of the great souther writerss. But after I read the &quot;Correspondence of Walker Percy and Shelby Foote&quot; I see her peers considered this young Savannah Girl a literary giant. Her name was not an attempt to mask her identify as was the case with George Eliot, the female author of Middlemarch. Flannery, evidently, is female.Wise Blood is a novel more likely to have occured in the hilly piedmont or mountains than the coast of Georgia. For a dark religious novel set around Savannah or Beaufort would no doubt mention voodoo as it is and has been practiced by the Blacks there. (Dr. Buzzard of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; is only the most famous example.)Wise Blood starts off kind of boring as its characters slowly are unwound before us. The major characters are holy-roller type street preachers. The type you might find speaking in tongues at any of a thousand Pentacostal churches spread across the South. Higher up in the hills these same holly rollers would be sporting rattlesnakes. These snake handlers say their faith in god protects them from the serpant. That is the literal interpretation of the bible that define the fundamental Christain. These verbatim dogma are the same beliefs for the characters of Flannery O'Connor.Yet O'Connor's holy man is a Christain without Christ. He preaches at the street corner of a Chruch with no Jesus. Blasphemy is the way to salvation he says. The rivalry between this preacher and another preacher points to another Southern theme--the dangerous violence that lurks beneath so many seemingly pious Southern souls.The novel ends in a ghastly fashion that still haunts me today. I haven't felt the same horror about a book since I finished John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. (By the way, Steinbeck did not like the South and said so in &quot;Travels with Charlie&quot;.) But this is no horror story--rather it is a great work that disturbs the conscious. Isn't that the true definition of art?"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor is one of those authors I feel like I ought to like. Her name pops up from time to time among Christian writers I respect. She's supposedly this great Christian writer, loved by other writers, theologians, and teachers of college fiction classes, but she is simply not to my taste. Does that mean I'm less cultured and intelligent that people who like to read her work? I don't think so. Just a matter of taste, I'd say.Wise Blood, O'Connor's first novel, follows the travels of Hazel Motes as he tries to run from God. For reasons never made terribly clear, he's never been able to reconcile some dissatisfying or disturbing experiences of his youth with the truth of the gospel. Hypocritical or perverted expressions of Christianity aside, as he matures couldn't he have found what he was looking for: a genuine expression of Christ's love and grace? Instead of looking, he takes on the affectations of a preacher, preaching the Church Without Christ. In the meantime, he hooks up with a prostitute, beds an underaged girl, and ends up murdering a rival.The thing that bothers me most about this novel is not its attempt at satirizing and challenging complacent Christianity, but the poor story telling. The characters, terribly wooden and one-dimensional, behave in inexplicable ways that do not fit with their portrayal and certainly do not fit with the way real people act in real life. For instance, when a policeman pulls Motes over, Motes informs him that he doesn't have a driver's license, so of course the officer pushes Motes's car off a cliff then offers him a ride back to town. Huh? And the disconnected, rambling plot goes nowhere.One of my favorite stories about O'Connor, which I read years ago in the introduction to a collection of her stories, tells of her conversation with, as I recall, the director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. O'Connor, born, raised, and educated in Georgia, could not make herself understood. The midwesterner to whom she was speaking stopped her and said, \\"Young lady, you are going to have to stop and write down whatever it is you're saying, because I can't understand a word of it,\\" or something to that effect. Maybe if I lived in the deep South, I would have more appreciation for her gothic Southern tone, but for now it's falling on deaf ears.I won't quit her forever; I understand her short fiction is her best work. It's certainly what she's better known for, so maybe I'll pick some of that up. Like I said, I want to like her, but for now I'll be looking elsewhere for both good storytelling and faith-challenging literature."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood has sometimes been described as dark comedy, sometimes simply as satire. Whichever description I eventually decide suits it best, this grotesque 1952 first novel is so disturbing that its characters and their fates will stay with me for a long time.Haze Motes, recently released from the army after suffering a wound in Korea, returns to his home state of Tennessee where he finds himself, much to his irritation, taken for a preacher by many of the strangers whom he meets. This is an easy mistake to make since Motes has recently exchanged his uniform for the type of suit and hat commonly worn by preachers of the time and the fact that he carries himself like, and has many of the mannerisms and attitudes of, his grandfather, a onetime country preacher himself. But Motes is angered by the very idea of being mistaken for a preacher because he is repelled by the whole concept of Christianity.After encountering a street preacher, and being disgusted by what he saw and heard, Hazel Motes founds his Church Without Christ, a church based on realism, one in which the blind do not see, the deaf do not hear, the lame do not walk, and the dead remain dead. Not too surprisingly, Haze's message attracts to him the kind of people who either become obsessed with his message or want to turn the Church Without Christ into a vehicle to put easy money into their pockets. There are Enoch Emery, an 18-year old so lonely in the big city that he sees the new church and its preacher as essential to his survival, Sabbath Lily a 15-year old abandoned by her charlatan preacher father, Asa Hawkes, and who sets out to seduce Motes, Hoover Shoates who hires his own false prophet and starts a rival church, and the landlady who decides to marry Motes in order to share his monthly government check.Flannery O'Connor's writing seldom, if ever, provides the reader with anything like a \\"happy ending\\" and Wise Blood, her first novel, is no exception. It is filled with characters who focus exclusively on self-gratification and who are not the least concerned about what they have to say or do in order to get what they want from those who have it. Even the minor characters, in particular the police, are not to be trusted as Motes so painfully discovers near the end of the book. But along the way, O'Connor provides memorable scenes that reflect her sense of humor and irony. I won't soon forget the images of the small, newspaper-wrapped mummy being rapidly carried through the rainy streets after being stolen from a museum nor the man in the gorilla suit who terrified the couple in the woods with whom he only wanted to shake hands."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This is the story of Hazel Motes, who is desperately running from Jesus, running to cure himself of belief. He founds the Church of Christ Without Christ and preaches his message of non-redemption from the hood of his \\"rat-colored\\" car. In the course of his flight he meets a cynical \\"blind\\" preacher and his corrupted 15-year-old daughter, a grifter who wants to use him to make money, and Enoch Emory, a young man with \\"wise blood,\\" who provides him with a mummified child to serve as his new Jesus. His struggles end as he punishes himself for his failure to destroy his belief. (Anyway, that's how I interpreted it.)In an Author's Note at the beginning of the book, O'Connor describes the book as a \\"comic\\" novel, but it is certainly not comic in the generally accepted sense--the irrational and often seemingly meaningless actions of the characters have a grotesque quality that is disturbing, amusing only in the way that David Lynch and Quentin Tarentino, for example, are amusing. In this way O'Connor was, perhaps, ahead of her time.This is a profoundly religious book, though it would not seem so from the description. However, it is not the kind of feel-good literature of most religious fiction, but rather a more subtle examination of the nature of belief. Wise Blood will stay in my mind for a long time.Just a thought: This could be classified, along with most Faulkner novels, as Southern Gothic. Is it any wonder that many Northerners think of Southerners as deranged degenerates?"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"There was a lot of religious imagery in this book...well, obviously, as that is the whole point of the book.

I ,like others ,assumed Flannery was a man and Irish.Before reading this novel,I checked the Amazon customer reviews and was completely surprised . Then, with some research on the net, that Flannery was a young woman of only 27 when she wrote this book,and rather than being Irish,was from an Old Deep South Catholic family,born in Savannah,Georgia. She was born in 1925,surrounded by poor whites in a Protestant area,left home at 18,graduated from college,wrote mainly Southern Gothic short stories,only 2 novels.She had a great interest in domestic birds,peacocks,pheasants,swans,geese,chickens and Moscovy Ducks. After college she lived on a family farm with her mother,outside Millidville Georgia.She was also a good painter. She was quite frail,never married,like her father,she contacted Lupus and died very young at only 39,in 1964. Her mother outlived her for many years. It is still possible to visit the farm in Millidville,Ga.She had a deep and knowledgeable faith.As I read this book ,I was continually reminded of other writers such as James Joyce,Erskine Caldwell,Faulkner,Erskine Caldwell,Steinbeck and even some of those bible -thumping movies such as Elmer Gantry.This is all about having or not having faith. O'Connor understands the difference between Faith and Religion and shows what a difficult thing it can be when someone lacks real faith and attempts to develop one's own through rationalization.Flannery does not make any attempt to preach or conince the reader one way or the other about faith,but she does an admiral job of showing how difficult and all encompassing it can be for some people who have doubts and try to resolve them.While Flannery's life was all too short ;and we are all the poorer for that;she is remembered by words like these;\\"Everything that rises must converge.\\"\\"Grace changes us and change is painful.\\""},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"The &quot;official&quot;... review by Mary... has it all wrong. &quot;Flannery O'Connor has no truck with such newfangled notions as psychology.&quot; On the contrary: O'Connor was versed in psychology and expressed in her letters a preference for, of all people, Freud (over Jung)--she suggested that Freud had a good deal in common with St. Thomas Aquinas. Now, in terms of the novel, O'Connor (rightly) believed that the problem with the modern novel is that it's too psychological. Aristotle said that we see character through plot. And that's all we ever really know-the external. The psychological novel grows out of Manicheeism--or, more precisely, Cartesian Dualism--that separates the soul from the body. As a Catholic (and moreover a Thomist), O'Connor understood the direct connection between body and soul. Parks continues, &quot;her characters are as one-dimensional--and mysterious--as figures on a frieze. Hazel Motes, for instance, has the temperament of a martyr[. . .]&quot;Apparently Parks lacks an understanding of the Saints, a subject of which O'Connor had a deep understanding. Furthermore, O'Connor expressed a distaste for standard hagiography, preferring to see the real depth and personality in the Saints--a depth of understanding she reflects in her characters. The happy ending of _Wise Blood_ is Haze Motes' discovery of how the only way to true happiness is asceticism and self-mortification. &quot;Who else could offer an allegory about free will, redemption, and original sin right alongside the more elemental pleasure of witnessing Enoch Emery dress up in a gorilla suit?&quot; Besides being an &quot;elemental pleasure,&quot; Enoch Emery's descent into bestiality is the natural conclusion of his Manicheeism (in a letter, O'Connor dismisses him as a fool). The term allegory is vastly misapplied here. A novel cannot be an allegory. In an allegory, the characters _represent_ ideas. Of all Christian literature, Flannery O'Connor comes perhaps the farthest from allegory. One can't sit down and match up her characters to concepts. The lessons of the novels are learned through experiencing the story--not analyzing it. As T. S. Eliot said, the function of all art and literature is first and foremost to give us experiences (or, as he put it, &quot;feelings&quot;). &quot;Nobody else, that's who. And that's okay. More than one Flannery O'Connor in this world might show us more truth than we could bear.&quot; Speaking of Eliot, &quot;Humankind cannot bear much reality.&quot; Actually, Parks came closest to the truth about O'Connor here--her stories are about people who can't bear the Truth--the Truth of Christ--and who either know the implications of Christ (like Haze Motes) and try to escape Him; or their minds are clouded (like the grandmother in &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot;) and they need to be awakened to the truth."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor was a gifted writer, able to convey the hidden pulses inherent in human life, bringing to the forefront the controversies that exist in the battle between secularism and Christianity. \\"Wise Blood\\" is a difficult novel to read for several reasons; it is a disjointed mishmash of stories that O'Connor expanded upon, with characters who appear and disappear at random. But the main difficulty is its subject matter - at its core is Hazel Motes, an angry young man who has been discharged from the Army, who is desperately trying to escape the hold that Jesus has on him. It is a raw and sometimes scathing satirical look at society and the role that religion plays in our everyday lives.The story begins with Hazel Motes taking a train to the city of Taulkinham, where his attention is immediately captured by a blind preacher and his daughter. Hazel cannot get the pair out of his mind and follows them to their boarding house, taking a room so that he can be close to them. Hazel is insistent that he does not need religion, and to prove his point sets up his own church - the Church Without Christ - with a membership of one. Preaching of the \\"new jesus\\" who will come, Hazel increasingly finds himself in situations he doesn't want to be in. The visions he has for his life are failing to come to fruition until he takes a drastic, irreversible step to cement his strangling faith.O'Connor's creations are not likeable characters - they are fierce, ugly people who reflect the darkest sides of humanity. The disjointed structure makes for a frustrating read at times - sometimes too much happens, sometimes nothing seems to happen. When the end finally comes, it comes too quickly and out of the perspective of the main characters. While I am a huge fan of O'Connor's works, her brilliance shines brighter in her short stories."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Back in these days, books were published mainly for literary merit. They were published because they were good. And this is one of those books - a story that definitely stood the test of time and is deemed as a classic today. It mainly concerns a young man named Hazel Motes, a man questing for his own church - the church of christ without christ - and who blinds himself. I read it a few times and each time enjoyed it more and more, though I have yet to check out the movie. It is one of those books that stays with you for a really long time. I recommend it to anybody who wants to curl up for a few hours with a good, well-written story."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"If you're looking for religious literature in the hope and comfort vein, skip Wise Blood. I do, however, think that feel-good Christians on chummy terms with God might do well to remember that, according to a verse from Hebrews, &quot;it's a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&quot; This is what happens to Hazel Motes, about as unsympathetic a protagonist as you're ever likely to clap eyes onto (the rest of the characters, no-hopers all, won't warm your heart much, either). In a book that's both wildly funny and profoundly thought-provoking, O'Connor pries up the rock of conventional religious belief and examines what lies underneath it. Read it."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I was required to read this novel for my English class. I thought it was going to be another one of those boring books, but I was surprised to find it far from boring. At first, the characters seem excessively weird and there doesn't seem to be a point to the story. However, if you have proir knowlege to religion, you will probably enjoy this book. Among all the absurd characters of Haze, Enoch, Hawks, and Mrs. Flood there is a point that makes their stangeness make sense. I loved this novel because it was very different from other books that I have read before. Not only does it give you a challenge to discover what all the nonsense means, but it is hilarious at certain times too. I had to laugh the time that Enoch dressed up in a gorilla suit, the thought of him makes me laugh over and over. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in something out of the ordinary that is full of wit, humor, and radical characters."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor was 22 years old when she began writing this story in 1947. I've known that fact for years and have read the book multiple times, but still I cannot grasp how talented, hard-working and brilliant Flannery must have been to create a masterpiece this monumental and perfect at such a young age.Hazel Motes was already messed up in the head when he left for the War and even screwier when he returned four years later. His hometown dried up and blown away Haze travels to Taulkinham. Once there he visit's a disgusting woman then later stands on the hood of his raddletrap, which is parked outside of a movie theater, and begins preaching about the Church Without Christ. Only a few people pay him any mind, but that's enough to set in motion a series of strange events and bizarre behavior that makes me smile every time I think about it - which is quite often. \\"I see you,\\" she said in a playful voice.Not everybody will like this book, just the smart ones."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Since Flannery O'Connor is my second favorite author, I'm surprised that I have not included one of her books on either year of the 52 books assignment. I wanted to, but I often try to save her for special occasions, as she only has two novels, and I don't want to tire of them or her.Wise Blood tells the story of Hazel Motes, a young man returning disillusioned from the Army. Something happened to Motes that caused him to see the folly in believing in God or Jesus Christ. To rebel against this belief, he begins a new career as a street-corner preacher proclaiming the freedom in the gospel message of his church, the Church without Christ. No God. No Jesus. No guilt. In all his proselytizing, it seems that Motes is running from a God that he preaches against, as if the hound of heaven chases him.The cast of characters is a collection of misfits, hypocrites, and outcasts, all living in a world that they tell themselves is without God. Sometimes, as we run from God, we can run right into Him.This is not a Christian novel, and much of the content will cause some frowning from the Left Behind fans. It is a novel about a worldview that refuses to acknowledge God, but he will continue to pursue us anyway. God's chasing after Hazel Motes mirrors Hosea's chasing after his adulterous wife (which is itself a metaphor for God chasing after the unfaithful Israel).Flannery comments well on this novel that helps to explain the pursuit:\\"For (non-believers) Hazel Motes' integrity lies in his trying with such vigor to get rid of the ragged figure who moves from tree to tree in the back of his mind. For the author Hazel's integrity lies in his not being able to. Does one's integrity ever lie in what he is not able to do?\\"Even without this deeper meaning, Wise Blood is an excellent, strange, and funny story that most will enjoy. After reading, you may see how the \\"ragged figure\\" is moving from tree to tree in the forest of your life."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Set in the deepest parts of the rural South in the early 1950's, this highly exaggerated story, though definitely mesmerizing, portrays a South replete with grotesque, ignorant, and disturbed characters who can scarcely be comprehended. Religion literally suffuses the entire culture - all are always aware to what degree their thoughts and actions are consistent with the teachings of Jesus.The story is centrally concerned with the short, troubled life of twenty-something Hazel Motes, a veteran, who returns home to find it abandoned and uninhabitable and then sets forth on a journey of indeterminate destination and purpose. Hazel is in a constant battle with the influence of his deceased father and grandfather, who were preachers. His strategy of avoiding belief issues by simply not sinning gives way before a stronger desire to associate with sleazy women.Hazel is a man of few words, but has an inclination to ask others if they are redeemed, a question that seems to not be out of the ordinary in this culture. He purchases a rat-colored, dilapidated car from which he preaches the message of his Church without Christ. There are any number of immensely quirky characters who cross Hazel's path. For example, there is the blind preacher Asa Hawks and his aggressive 15-year-old daughter Lily Sabbath, both of whom Hazel is drawn to but cannot work out just what kind of relationship he wants to have. And there is the totally bizarre 18-year-old Enoch Emery, who is new in town, works at the zoo, has \\"wise blood,\\" and cannot be dissuaded from pestering Hazel. Ultimately, the conflicted Hazel sees all of these characters as hindrances to his unspoken mission.There is a certain terseness and incompleteness that pervades the entire story. Eccentric characters appear almost out of the woodwork with a predilection for weird behavior that is hard to totally grasp. The overall landscape is one of deprivation, if not devastation. There is a shortage of money, clothes, food, living space, etc, yet the characters are hardly aware of such.The writing both reflects and exposes this spare, strange environment. It is brusque, pithy, incisive, colloquial, and repetitive, reflective of these deformed characters. The story is, in a way, fascinating, despite the fact that it is difficult to fully digest. Part of the struggle to fully appreciate this book has to do with the era, which is so far removed from modern life as to be almost beyond understanding. Nonetheless, it is entirely obvious that the author has a tremendous facility with language to be able to create and capture an extraordinarily rich scenario."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"\\"Wise Blood,\\" by Flannery O'Conner, was required reading in the best college course I took - \\"The American Novel Since 1945\\", taught by the most accomplished teacher I had in college, Don Noble. We read 13 books in 13 weeks, many of them among the best books ever written, with Don pointing out the things that made these books these books pertinent and special. Don's unofficial description of the course was \\"A Survival Guide,\\" as he thought these books were especially instructive.So how does \\"Wise Blood\\" stand up after all these years? It's still laugh out loud funny in several passages, despite being consistently and austerely bleak throughout. On the down side, the major characters seem to be smitten with Asperger Syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, while the secondary characters all seem to be scheming rednecks. But O'Conner consistently hits the nail on the head in her observations of human behavior. Also, her portrayal of grace and faith as unpleasant, inescapable afflictions hit home, and are of a piece with verses from Jeremiah and Isaiah."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wise Blood is at once engaging, provocative, and wildly funny. The author's gift for describing people and events of dark comic outrageousness will cause the story to stick in your head for a long time.

READ IT!"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":". . .what a parade. There is one unpleasant character followed by another unpleasant character followed by one even less likable (and more unlikely). Yet this novel of the grotesque--of the pretend gorilla, of the \\"Christ without Christ\\" church, of the repentant Christian who doesn't believe in repentance or Christianity--makes one think and makes one laugh. I know I won't forget Hazel Motes, even if I prefer not to remember him."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Knowing the classical signicficance of this novel, I tried to like it...I really did. Then I figured out that I wasn't supposed to like it. Wise Blood is not one of those books that leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, and it's not supposed to.This novel follows the story of young Hazel Motes, the confused grandson of a southern preacher. Throughout his adventures, Motes forms the idea that only the bad know Jesus-and in order to avoid Jesus one must avoid sin. Hazel is doing the right things for the wrong reasons.Hazel's beliefs leads to the creation of a church without Christ. Motes preaches this religion from the street corners, and it is here that he meets Asa Hawks, a street preacher, and his 15 year old daughter Lily Sabbath. Naturally, the differing beliefs of Asa and Hazel lead to problems.Flannery O'Connor wrote a novel full of meaning but a little lacking in life. The one-dimensional characters eventually dulled me to the point of sleep and I had trouble getting into the book. The real mystery here is why O'Connor, who shows evidence of excellent writing in her other works, would take a subject that she felt so strongly about and bury her message in a dull story with incredibly bland characters."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I am very happy with this purchase.

I don't know what Hoover Shoats' problem was - jealousy? He reminds me quite a bit of some girl in school! In fact, the description of him is almost identical to her!!! I thought of her the whole time I read of him! (heh, heh!) These characters were freaks. They were extraordinary. They are almost too hard to understand to describe! What made Hazel tick?

What ranks her high on my list is the space she inhabits, her descriptions of death, and her humor and boredom. I get a high, godlike, reading her. And the boredom comes from an empty stomach, and trying to feed the soul on Christianity."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I read a lot of books and am fond of many Southern authors, including the late Ms. O'Connor. I really enjoyed her wonderfully titled \\"A Hard Man is a Good Find\\" (Note: A fine birthday gift for my grumbling gorilla of a wife; inscription: \\"I told you so!\\") and I like the author's ability to make the grotesque humorous.Unfortunately, this novel is a complete failure with very little to laugh about. It's a pretty meaningless story with virtually no plot: nutty war veteran returns to empty home town, goes to another town, preaches nonsense, acts like the nutjob he is, meets some other worthless characters, does nutty things in an effort to find redemption (an idiot's path, mind you), etc. This supposedly funny novel with a point (often my very favorite genre) fails to elicit more than a single laugh (the scene with the Gonga the Gorilla was pretty darn funny--pointless, but funny) and the point about redemptive suffering (if that was even the point) struck this reader as ridiculously rendered.All the characters are lunatics and there's absolutely nothing driving this book to conclusion, other than the turn of the page. This novel has been highly recommended by people who tend to be trustworthy. Unfortunately, I put it on the short list of books I've actually finished that I wish I'd never started. Not her best effort and one of the worst novels I've ever read. HHD>."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"It occurs to me that, in this short novel, Flannery O'Connor invented \\"white trash.\\" To say this book is about low-life rabble in the South in the 1940's is an understatement. In fact, she was accused in literary circles of writing about \\"grotesques.\\" Our main character, Hazel Motes, is so screwed up (although we never learn why) that he becomes an anti-preacher, teaching about the \\"Church of Christ without Christ.\\" He eventually blinds himself. A father tries to pass off his underage daughter to any available man to be rid of her. Every preacher is a charlatan; every cop is a brutal sadist; every character leads a life of loud and violent desperation. And yet, a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor, born and raised in the American South, is categorized as a Southern Gothic author. A Roman Catholic, her works dealt with religion, ethics and morality. She published over thirty short stories, numerous reviews and commentaries, and two novels. She passed away in 1964, at the age of 39, succumbing to lupus. And for many, her writings still resonate today.Wise Blood, originally published in 1952, is the first of her two novels. The book's protagonist, Hazel Motes, has just been discharged from the army after a four year stint. Finding both his home and hometown abandoned, he makes his way to the fictional southern town of Taulkinham.Once there he picks up with a quirky set of characters - Enoch Emery, an 18 year old loser; a \\"blind' preacher and his not so devout daughter; and a con-man, among others. Our hero Hazel - the grandson of a preacher - becomes a street preacher himself, founding his own \\"Church without Christ\\" - membership of one - himself. Hazel's \\"church\\" is the hood of his beat up Essex, which he parks on the street, haranguing the town's citizens as they exit movie-theaters.The book reads as a set of vignettes patched together, which I understand it is; the author modifying at least a few short stories to piece together this novel. And as interesting, intriguing and potentially humorous as the above outline sounds, for this reader both the characters and story were under-developed. Very possibly the subtlety of the writing eluded me, which wouldn't be the first time. There is some wonderful prose here, with poignant descriptions and spot-on dialogue - but personally - with these characters, their personal journeys and the setting - I could have used a little more substance to the story."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wise Blood is brutally honest, raw with emotion and energy, and hard for many people to read. The author, Flannery O'Connor, has a rare ability to convey the human nature in a terrifyingly honest way. Reading one of her stories is like peering into a dark mirror and seeing the horrible things about the fallen state of the world that still reside within one's own being.Each of the thirty-one short stories and two novels written by Flannery O'Connor hinge upon guilt, grace, and God. Wise Blood focuses on the young preacher Hazel Motes as he desperately seeks to avoid Christ at any cost. Having been raised to believe that God is little more than a set of strict rules and a guilty conscience, he wholly rejects Christianity. Motes' unbelief is evident in the conversation he has on a train, insisting that he would not believe in Christ \\"even if He did exist. \\" Motes' next thought sums up the direction of the novel beautifully . . .\\"There was already a deep black wordless conviction in him that the way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin.\\"Motes goes on to interact with colorful characters whose own sin is soon exposed, and he continues to draw deeper within himself. When he is starting his own church, The Church of God Without Christ, a prophetic call is issued for current believers. Written almost 60 years ago, this novel has an astonishing, heartbreaking grasp on that state of the modern church. Hearing a church advertised as a place where you \\"don't have to believe nothing you don't understand and approve of,\\" a place where people are encouraged to \\"sit at home and interpit your own Bible however you feel in your heart it ought to be interpited,\\" and finally, a place where \\"you can know that there's nothing or nobody ahead of you, nobody knows nothing you don't know.\\" This description of a church where mystery, community, and theology are disdained, this church without Christ, is shocking and, sadly, prophetic. Many people will not read this book because it is so raw and makes most people uneasy in their own skin - and that is exactly the reason most people should read it."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wise BloodEarly in \`Wise Blood', the boy Hazel Motes goes with his father to a cheap country carnival and sneaks into the nudey tent. He's revolted and runs away. I can share his revulsion; entering Flannery O'Connor's fiction is like peeking into a sleazy freak show. If I got on a bus full of O'Connor's characters, I'd hop off at the next stop. If I found myself sharing heaven with Hazel Motes, I'd ask for a transfer. Hieronymus Bosch never painted an uglier crew of imps in his altarpieces of the Last Judgment. What's the point of all this talk about redemption? If this book portrays the reality of O'Connor's world, she was already in H*ll. If there is to be a religious exegesis of this novel, it will have to be in the language of Zoroaster, of the uneradicable strain of Gnosticism in Christianity. The J*sus that Hazel Motes seeks to \`get rid of' is more the Malefactor-Creator of the Gnostic scriptures than the Redeemer of Catholicism, and if that's so, then Hazel is the True Prophet of his Church Without Christ and his self-destruction is sanctified.Wise Blood is the sort of book that, when you've read ten pages you begin to ask \`what's all this,' a question you keep asking until the last page, when you ask \`what the hey was that about?' Well, dear friends, I like books that make me ask what they were about. In fact, they're the only kind I like.With this text, we have two choices: to accept that Wise Blood is about precisely what its author thought it was about, or to assume that the author has no better claim on the meaning of her words than anyone else. Obviously the second choice - fashionable post-modernism - is more fun.O'Connor chose sides in her one-page preface to the second edition, ten years after the first publication in 1952. She wrote: \\"It is a comic novel about a Christian maulgr&eacute; lui.\\" Moi, I find that word \`comic' problematic. Despite scene after scene of absurdity, I swear I never laughed once while reading Wise Blood, so I assume that \`comic' doesn't mean \`funny'. A classical sense of \`comedy' would require a happy resolution, and that's hardly what the book delivers. If \`comic' means satirical, the term would fit, but to call this a \\"comic novel\\" has to be either snarky sarcasm or else a dark stain of sado-masochism in O'Connor's worldview. I'm pretty certain that O'Connor never encountered LSD or peyote -- if she had, it would explain much -- but her imagination came close to the ergot-poisoned fantasies of late Medieval witchcraft trials. I can think of one even better precendent for the sheer nastiness of Wise Blood -- The Satyricon of Petronius, the classic expression of PAGAN moral ambiguity.Honestly, while I regard this book as a loathsome treasure, I prefer Flannery O'Connor's short stories - those I've read - from the volume \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" Compression helps. Some of her best stories wring as much out of me in 15 pages as Wise Blood in 180. It's not an experience you'd want often, to ride an elevator down to H*ll with Hazel Motes, Enoch Emory, Asa Hawks, and Lily Sabbath, the grotesque cast of this Southern Gothic horror story."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"A strange and disconnected work full of apparent yet sometimes mysterious themes, Flannery O'Connor delivers less of a commentary on religion here than one on the human condition and its place within society and regarding itself. Hazel Motes, the protaonist, discovers his faith while attempting to shed it, while the enaging yet mysteriously motivated Enoch searches for his niche in less...appropriate manners. Altogether, Ms. O'Connor presents a work of extreme characters pressed together by distant circumstances and circularly obsessed with each others' lives. Each one's uest for their own meaning involves another, and even characters which do not emerge until the last chapter, such as Hazel's landlady, seem to take on a three-dimensional life-altering perspective as they encounter Hazel.The book raises as many questions as it seems to aspire to answer. Reading it the first time around will produce only puzzlement over the intended themes and coherency of the plot, but further analysis should produce the wonderful existential surprise Ms. O'Connor has hidden within this exteriorly nonsensical narrative."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wise Blood was one of the most thought provoking books that I have read. Everything seems inverted - even faith is presented negatively instead of positively. By that I do not mean that O'Conner is saying that faith is negative, what I mean is that the main character, Hazel Motes, tries to abandon his faith which only proves that his faith is real because he is totally unable to abandon it. I believe it was Miss O'Conner who said something to the effect &quot;Maybe a person's integrity consists of what they are not able to do, rather that what they are able to do&quot; ... an interesting perspective."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Though familiar with her name, I only just &quot;discovered&quot; the genius of Flannery O'Connor this year when I read &quot;The River&quot; for a literature class. I was so moved and disturbed and inspired that I decided to follow up with Wise Blood. I must say it is one of the finest pieces of American lit I've encountered. I have never read a voice like O'Connor's. Her slick ability to puppeteer my imagination is nothing short of genius. With themes of moral absolutes, sin and redemption, delicately interwoven in a rich tapestry of symbol, Wise Blood left me drunk, spent and aching for more."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor was, first and foremost, a Catholic. She made this plain in how she lived her life, and in her letters her deep commitment to the faith of her fathers becomes very evident. It is impossible to correctly understand her work from any other paradigm.In one letter she writes that she feels most people who read Wise Blood see her as a \\"hillbilly nihilist.\\" Rather, she would hope, they would see her as a \\"hillbilly Thomist.\\" Her references to the work of Jacques Maritain (combined with the fact that she read the Summa as a youngster) give proof to her mindset.With this backdrop in mind, reading O'Connor's work becomes an exercise in the best sort of exegesis. Her use of symbol, the grotesque, and even violence, as ways to talk about and analyze Grace and God's actions in our lives (usually soteriological) are profound.Wise Blood is no exception. Her brilliance is on full display here. Haze's commitment to nihilism as a philosophy, and the rejection of Christ that is at its core, is clear. Utilizing this rejection (and employing symbol and imagery) O'Connor shows Haze's denial of Christ, and Christ's constant outpouring of love and grace in pursuit of Haze. Ultimately, Haze is saved, although given O'Connor's brilliant writing, it is hardly sappy or obvious.The characters are rich, interesting, and yes, grotesque. These characters are classic O'Connor, and one does not struggle to find empathy for them, even in their brokenness. We find a \\"blind preacher\\" who is not blind, who had resolved to blind himself as a witness to Christ's passion and justification of his sins, but lost his nerve and his faith. Enoch Emory is a fascinating and sympathetic character. It is crushing what rejection by one's father can (but not necessarily will) to do a soul. Yet there is hope for him still.This is a book that I finished a week ago, but has been \\"with me\\" constantly since. The writing is absolutely amazing, deep and polished. O'Connor did not write quickly. She wrote, re-wrote, crafted, and re-crafted. Every word that is there is there for a reason, and one must read carefully to get at it all.O'Connor, in all her Scholastic brilliance, is on full display here. This is probably one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Coming to grips with Flannery O'Connor will enrich your life. Don't wait. Read this author now."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"In the author's note to this book, Flannery O'Connor describers it as \\"a comic novel.\\" And it is, but a very unusual novel filled with black comedy. In black comedy, topics and events that are usually regarded as taboo, such as death, disabilities, religion, child abuse, prostitution, and underage sex, are treated in an unusually humorous and satirical manner while retaining their seriousness. And that is what this book is chock full of. After finishing this very enjoyable read, I got the idea that the author first created the final tableau, and then built scenes with odd characters and situations to reach this conclusion. This may have been the fastest I have ever read a book. The pages zoomed by. If the object of black comedy is to provide the reader with an experience of both laughter and discomfort, O'Connor has hit the bull's-eye."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"O'Connor is one of my favorite authors and this novel is one of my favorite novels. O'Connor is simply brilliant; her stories are satirical portraits of a secular society that has blinded men and women from the truth and distanced them from God. O'Connor is known for her caustic tone, and this novel is no exception. Be prepared to laugh at the protagonist and to be shocked by his final action. Don't be quick to judge O'Connor's intentions and opinions. She's a tricky woman to understand, and I certainly do not pretend to understand her, but the more of her you read, the better you'll grasp her notions of faith, grace, country folk, and secularism."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Hazel Motes, discharged from the army, sets out to be a car-roof preacher of the Church Without Christ, preaching the fallacies of faith. He becomes obsessed with a blinded preacher, and garners the obsession of a the preacher's sultry daughter, a lost young man who abducts a shrunken mummy, and a widow. Hazel Motes literally and figuratively blinds himself to the truths of life while he navigates a dark world filled with O'Connor's trademark grotesque and bizarre images and characters. Though thought-provoking and oddly beautiful, turning the oddities of life into religious symbols, the novel does not seem to be O'Connor's form. Flannery O'Connor is a refreshing literary voice and one that requires the reader to wrestle with the characters and actions in order to find meaning. Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"One of only two novels by Flannery O'Connor, who died at the tender age of 39 from lupus, Wise Blood tells the story of Hazel Motes, a 22 year old veteran turned street preacher. Hazel makes it his mission, after encountering a blind preacher named Asa Hawks, to preach about a church of his own inventing: The Church of God Without Christ. Along the way he meets Enoch Emery and Sabbath Lily. Enoch is an 18 year old who vies for attention and companionship from Hazel. Sabbath Lily Hawks, the daughter of Asa Hawks, seduces Hazel, and similarly wants his attention. Despite his many sins committed throughout the novel, Hazel is consistently reminded of God's presence and he struggles with accepting the condemning words he speaks.O'Connor calls Wise Blood a \\"comic novel\\" and there are many instances of comedy throughout the novel. It is typical of O'Connor's fiction in the sense that she peoples it with unforgettable characters with unique tendencies and physical abnormalities, some of which are actually quite humorous. There is a distinct sense of tragic irony, also a hallmark of O'Connor, in the character of Hazel Motes. His suffering is quite justifiable, and he is rather unlikable as a character, but we can sympathize with him in many instances of misfortune. Enoch too is a tragic character because he is sadly neglected by Hazel, even though he cries out for attention and especially acceptance, something Enoch has never really had.Many issues are also addressed in Wise Blood that are typical of Southern Literature of the 1950s, specifically racism, police brutality and the overzealous religiosity of the South.A recurring motif in the novel is blindness. Hazel Motes' own name suggests blindness, itself being a Biblical reference: \\"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\\" (Matthew 7:5, KJV). No less than two characters in the novel suffer blindness by their own hands and Hazel himself seems to wander around blindly preaching his own gospel, perhaps only because his life lacks definition after returning from the war. So too are many of the characters blindsided by unforeseen circumstances that ruin their lives.In Wise Blood, O'Connor has drafted a modern Southern Gothic parable about faith and spiritual malaise. The novel is rich with characterization and deep symbolisms. Though it is a Christian novel, O'Connor herself being Roman Catholic, this is an enigmatic read for Christians and non-Christians alike."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wise Blood by Flannery O'Connor +This book is about the Bible, Jesus and Religion. But more than any of those things, it's about people. It's about how people react to someone that they don't understand. And no one seems to understand the protagonist of this story. He throws away money, when he doesn't need it. He doesn't have sex with a young girl, when she throws herself at him. He is hard for any of the other characters in the book to understand. He is hard for us the reader to understand. He has something inside him that is driving him to do the things he does. The young man who got off the buss to start the first, \\"Church without Christ.\\"The scary thing is the humanity of the protagonist's character. Unlike any of the other characters what he wants i.e., what he cares about the most is bigger than the desires of any of the other characters.The other characters live in a real world, and their concerns are primal e.g., love, sex and money. But the protagonist wants something else. He wants something that he can't articulate well. And even though most would agree that he goes about it in the wrong way, you have to respect Hazel Motes's drive. And what it suggest about free will and original sin."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood is a fascinating novel peering into the depths of one man's tortured soul, in his quest to find/run away from God. The novel is quite short and for me read smoothly. The story focuses on Hazel Motes, who after being discharged from the army is wondering around the fictional town of Taulkinham, trying to convert the local residents to his: \\"Church Without Christ\\". Mote's main doctrinal beliefs appear to be that the lame do not walk, the blind do not see, and so on. It's easy to view Motes as an absolute nihilist. And as the novel progresses, Motes becomes meaner and darker- to the point that it's nearly impossible to feel sorry for him. Another character, Enoch Emery, is an eighteen year old who is abandoned by his father and lives in Taulkingham. He has no friends and quickly attempts to bond with Motes. There is also a blind preacher, his wayward daughter, and a rival preacher named Hoover Shoats who founds: \\"The Holy Church Of Christ Without Christ\\" in an attempt to capitalize on the perception of Motes being a \\"prophet\\" in order to make a profit.This being my first experience with O'Connor's writing, I was really not sure what to expect. The novel ended up being much more depressing than I thought it would (I went into it without having read any reviews). As many of the other reviewers note, there is not much in the way of character development in the story; nearly the beginning, we get a little background on Motes, that casts him in a symphethic light, but shortly after he quickly loses it. Aside of Emory, many of the other characters drift in and out of the story, seemly just to affect Motes, without little character traits. For the most part, I think O'Connor was looking to argue/promote different philosophical and theological arguments, and just used the characters as vessels for that. All of the characters seem to identify with different aspects of protestant theology.One of the other noteworthy aspects of this novel is the Southern setting. O'Connor had a wonderful ear for dialogue, and is able to perfectly capture the southern dialects. I would say that Mark Twain easily as well writes O'Connor's dialogue as anything I've read.Overall, I highly recommend this book. It's not pretty and it will not leave you with a happy feeling at the end. But, the prose is beautiful. And, while not well \\"rounded\\" the characters depict Christianity in their own unique ways. This novel is defiantly worth checking out."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"SPOILERSA short but powerful read which demonstrates the importance of believing in something good and edifying. Haze, the main character, is truly living in a haze throughout the novel -- all he has been taught is a fervent and hateful brand of Christianity, and in his attempts to escape the unnecessary guilt this tradition has placed on him, he becomes a nihilist.But shunning all spirituality for dependence on material things, like the piece-of-junk car which ends up failing him, ultimately lead him unsatisfied. His ability to do whatever he wants, without the prospect of eternal consequences, brings him no more happiness than did his former Christian beliefs. All that does seem to remain is a guilt, which continues to creep around him, driving him back to the sect he hated enough to leave.Haze never considers, and never finds, another belief system which might propose hope instead of damnation, that might imbue his life with meaning without constantly filling him with self-loathing. He never finds the golden mean between the two extremes of zealous Christian fundamentalism and zealous Nihilism. What's more, the other characters never find anything constant to believe in, always putting their faith in untrustworthy people or in material facades.With all these unhappy endings, I think Wise Blood can be safely labeled a depressing book. I think its worth is as a cautionary tale for the reader to find that golden mean, between empty meaningless and vile meaningfulness. It definitely encourages a second read -- I think there's plenty of deeper of meaning I haven't managed to grasp."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This was one of the most soul pummeling books I've ever read. It's funny, dark, and infused with the heart of a writer grappling with notions of grace and humanity's place in the universe. Avoid Houston's film version -- he really didn't understand the gut of this book at all."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"A haunting book. Quasi-apologetic for Roman Catholicism, but it might be unrecognizable to most as such; like the characters in this book, many of us are haunted by Christ, but don't even really know who He is. Like Hazel Motes, we grow up in a society that does not understand Jesus, though we talk about Him all the time; like Motes, many of us claim to be above and beyond belief in Christ, yet our obsessions about Christianity and Jesus give the lie to incessant protestations that such things are for the ignorant, and not worth even talking about.This book leaves you to your own conclusions about Jesus and Christianity. But it shows many characters who lead joyless, drab existences, and perhaps we see ourselves in them; one cannot help but wonder what, or perhaps Who, is missing from all their lives. The answer is to be found on almost every page of the book."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Wise Blood is a work for everyone. However, it is by no means meant to please everyone. It is hilarious and dreadful, hopeless and redemptive. It is essentially about a young man's inability to lose Christ. He is saved as a child and \\"soul hungry\\" Jesus will never let him go.It is a simple read but also rewards a willingness to look into it's deeper themes and symbolism. Ms. O'Connor said that it was written and should be read with zest, but those looking for a light beach-read should maybe look elsewhere. She did not write to give her audience a warm, fuzzy feeling of satisfaction. In fact, she expected them to be turned off.It is a short book and one that will stay with you long after you've finished. The night I finished reading it, the wind was cold and strong and caused tree branches to tap against my window. My initial reaction to the sound was not to worry. It's just the shrunken new Jesus, I thought. Then I realized that exactly why we should all be worried."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"This first novel by Flannery O'Connor gives a dramatic, vivid etc picture of a young man entering strange territory. The author's vision of our society is violent, but not bleak. The novel is a Greek tragedy with a hilarious streak. All about entrapment, compulsion and religious obsession. It is impossible to remain exactly the same reader afterwards. It is not a really great novel, &quot;perhaps&quot;, but one that you will savour with a particular fondness."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Recently discharged from the army and without a family, a young man named Hazel Motes arrives in a strange city. He is so completely obsessed by the desire to reject Jesus that, taking inspiration from the actions of a wayward street preacher, he starts the &quot;Church Without Christ,&quot; promising no salvation and no kingdom of heaven. With this premise of idolatry turned upside down, O'Connor spins a vaguely abstract tale employing haunting Kafka-esque symbols and images to illustrate her narrative. Hazel thinks of his deceased family members while trying to sleep in the coffin-like berch in the train. He drives out to the country in his newly purchased car and sees a message of salvation, conflicting naggingly with his own beliefs, written on a roadside rock. His newfound acquaintance, Enoch Emery, shows him the object of his fascination, a mummified boy in a museum. The face of a grinning woman reflects eerily in the glass that encases the boy; later the face appears in the window of Hazel's car during a dream. Enoch, whose &quot;wise blood&quot; tells him what to do, finds dread in a picture of a moose that hangs on the wall in his room and donates what he has decided is the &quot;new jesus&quot; to Hazel so that he (Enoch) can return happily to a state of primitivism in a gorilla costume. For such a short novel, &quot;Wise Blood&quot; is incredibly complex and is one of the most inexplicably fascinating books I have read."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"&quot;Do you think it is possible to come to Christ through ordinary dislike before discovering the love of Christ? Can dislike be a sign?&quot; - Walker Percy in The Last GentlemanI've never really grasped what Walker Percy meant by that one until I read Wise Blood, but that's what happens. The opposite of love isn't hate. Rather, it's indifference, and hate is some form of love. In Wise Blood, Hazel does hate Christ, but that hate is emblematic of the belief (and unwanted love) he actually holds for Him. Wise Blood is Hazel's dark journey in a fallen world toward happening onto a bit of grace, painful but merciful at the same time.Wise Blood isn't a book to read if you want to end up with a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Its setting is a grim, fallen world, and the characters aren't exactly likeable. Nevertheless, the truth O'Connor has to present through her dark humor is powerful and insightful. This is a wonderful book for intellectual Christians and for anyone else searching for truth in this mess of a world."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"In May 1952, after Flannery O'Connor published \\"Wise Blood\\" to mixed notices, she wrote to her publisher, Robert Giroux, and demonstrated her ability to take even the bad reviews with aplomb: \\"I have a request for a complimentary copy of 'Wise Blood' from Captain W. of the Salvation Army for their reading room and would be much obliged if you would send them a copy.... I'm always pleased to oblige the Salvation Army. According to some of the reviews you have sent me, I ought to be in it.\\"Throughout 1950s America--and especially in her hometown-the few readers who came across O'Connor's novel were dismayed or shocked by the its violence and its seemingly amoral characters; even two years after publication, still receiving fan letters (\\"what happened to the guy in the ape suit?\\") from the scattering of readers who liked it, O'Connor was able to joke, \\"I have now reached the lunatic fringe and there is no place left for me to go.\\" A half century later, though, O'Connor has the last laugh, because the dark humor that pervades her \\"Southern Gothic\\" tale is more readily digested by modern audiences reared on films by the likes of David Lynch and Lars Von TrierA quick and easy read, \\"Wise Blood\\" portrays a series of unforgettably creepy losers in haunting, disturbing scenes. Hazel Motes, a soldier discharged from the army because of an injury, becomes a street-corner preacher for the nihilistic \\"Church Without Christ\\" (with a congregation of one). He meets, and can't shake off, a friendless and troubled adolescent, and the two of them subsequently encounter an alcoholic charlatan who pretends to be a blind preacher and who hopes somehow to take advantage of Hazel by getting him to marry his young daughter. Eventually, Hazel acquires a congregant for his atheistic church, but the first disciple rebels and sets up his own ministry. There's so much more that happens, and I certainly won't give away the finale, but those who have already read the book will be intrigued by the knowledge that O'Connor decided how to end the novel after reading Sophocles.There's no doubt that \\"Wise Blood\\" is an influential, memorable novel--just barely short of a classic. Even its fans agree that the book seems disjointed at times--and that's because it was cobbled together from several disparate stories. The first chapter is an expanded version of her Master's thesis, \\"The Train\\"; and other chapters are reworked versions of \\"The Peeler,\\" \\"The Heart of the Park,\\" and \\"Enoch and the Gorilla.\\" Sometimes an author can use this approach and jerry-rig previous works into a cohesive whole, but \\"Wise Blood\\"--while surely a work of genius--still feels like a patchwork quilt. Fortunately, O'Connor's portrayal of the eccentrics who populate her fictional town of Taulkingham saves the book from the distraction of its all-too-visible seams."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"If you're looking for religious literature in the hope and comfort vein, skip Wise Blood. I do, however, think that feel-good Christians on chummy terms with God might do well to remember that, according to a verse from Hebrews, &quot;it's a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&quot; This is what happens to Hazel Motes, about as unsympathetic a protagonist as you're ever likely to clap eyes onto (the rest of the characters, no-hopers all, won't warm your heart much, either). In a book that's both wildly funny and profoundly thought-provoking, O'Connor pries up the rock of conventional religious belief and examines what lies underneath it. Read it."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Hazel Motes, protagonist of &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; is an accidental prophet. Though the novel precedes the much better &quot;The Violent Bear It Away,&quot; it can be read as a sort of sequel to that novel - what might have happened to young Tarwater if we were allowed to see his adventures in the city.Motes goes around the city in the evenings, preaching the Church Without Christ, a church in which the individual is free from the 'bleeding stinking mad shadow of Jesus' - freed from tradition, from dogma, from traditional notions of salvation. Motes preaches the coming of a new Jesus - a contemporary that modern (or post-modern) people can relate to.In his quest, Motes is pursued by two individuals, Sabbath Hawks, the daughter of a blind false prophet, and Enoch Emery, a wannabe disciple. Emery wants very badly to find that new Jesus and receive a revelation from him.Full of strange and compelling, if somewhat distant characters, including a small mummy and a gorilla suit, &quot;Wise Blood&quot; does not have the plot flow of &quot;The Violent Bear It Away,&quot; and it is a little more haphazard, but it is a wonderful first glance into Flannery O'Connor's genius fictional mind, possessed with finding Christ in existentialism with or without Kierkegaard."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood contains many reoccuring and undermining religious themes. Her main theme includes the redemption of man by Christ. She also depicts the grotesques in society through her use of her subject matter. O'Connor bluntly uses this religious theme to prove that redemption is difficult for her characters because of the distorted sense of moral purpose in her characters. Throughout her novel, a major emphasis is placed on materialsim and money. Through her use of imagery, symbols, and details, O'Connor produces the unbalanced prosperity of the society, which leaves little assurance to blissfulness in life.Her protagonist, Hazel Motes, becomes a fated preacher or even prophet; however, Hazel rejects any form of Christ in his life including the image of himself. Even though it is rejected, his fate dominates him throughout the novel, and via his rejection of Christ, Hazel preaches the Church without Christ. Hazel finds that his reason for existence is to form the Church without Christ. Eventually, Hazel sacrifices everything in his life so as to not accept Christ which eventually destroys him. It would have been much better to sacrifice everything he had to begin with in order to accept Christ and let Christ take over from there. This would have prevented Hazel's destruction rooted from his rejection of Christ. This proves O'Connor's purpose of showing a society full of people who cannot accept Christ and who are, at most times, destroyed in some way in their attempt to reject their religious side.O'Connor mocks evangelism and the all too popular &quot;preachers for profits,&quot; who have no training in religion what so ever, in order to display her scorn for popularized anti-cerebral religion. Hazel, whose name is actually Hebrew for &quot;he who sees God,&quot; ironically but purposefully covers himself with a figurative veil. This veil covers his soul and his senses from seeing Christ as He should be seen. His nickname, Haze, also proves his inability to see clearly.Throughout this novel, Hazel runs into several people who perform mysterious acts of goodness for him trying to help Hazel find Grace. This is also ironic condiering that most of Hazel's acquaintances are profiteer preachers. Some of these acquaintances include: Asa Hawks, an ex-evangelist, who pretends to blind himself for sympathy and profit as he &quot;hawks&quot; for money around the city; Enoch Emery, the boy with &quot;wise blood,&quot; who cannot find his inner self and becomes Hazel's follower in the Church without Christ; and Hoover Shoats, another profiteer preacher, who pretends to agree with Hazel's beliefs just to gain profit from it.Haze's car is a major sumbol of the novel. This car becomes Hazel's &quot;church.&quot; Hazel lives in his car and preaches from his car. His car becomes the &quot;rock&quot; which Hazel builds his church upon. He and his car become &quot;one.&quot; After his car is destroyed, Hazel sees himself as destroyed. Hazel is weaned out of his fantasy/rejection world and into reality. He eventually forces himself to Christ as he sees he is &quot;not clean.&quot; He begins his stage of repentance by blinding himself, stuffing his shoes with glass and rocks, and wrapping barbed wire around his chest. Inevitably, his destruction came.This book was very revealing and well-written. O'Connor selects certain audences with the books she wrote. This book contains a majority of religion. A person who perfers not to read about religion probably ought to but will not want to. The way O'Connor incorporated her hidden themes into her novel provided the reader several ways to interpret her implied religious beliefs."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"What an insane book. It's really quite incredible. Flannery O'Connor found all the problems of society, injected them into absurdly weird yet decidedly realistic scenarios and made a book about it.This book deals with obsession, self worth, and generally a whole bunch of people trying to escape themselves, or at least what they think defines themselves. And to boot, it can be terribly funny in a twisted way. Flannery O' Connor rocks.It's about Hazel Motes and the various well defined characters that ram into his life, and he doesn't even notice them. There's the ... blind preacher's daughter, and the suburban washup teenager, and the blind preacher, who all play pivotal roles in Motes' existence, though again, he doesn't realize it. Hazel pretty much goes through the book living in his own world, even though he hates his head also. Motes, after all, is a strange character who is desperately seeking peace with himself, and as you'll see he never fails in punishing himself. He's obsessed with Christ and purity, yet he loathes Christianity and purity. So he creates the Church of Christ Without Christ, and as he tries to promote it, a series of terrifying and subtle events occur that will make you bugeyed with wonder and horror and disgust. He descends from what you would think is a good proper religious fanatic, to a degraded near maniacal individual, and that's what really captivates you, though O'Connor provides ample sideshows. And then, the end is as strange and satisfying as the rest of the book.This is a strange crazy incredibly captivating and overwhelmingly intense book that only lasts a hundred or so pages, but after you'll probably run to Jane Austen. But then in their own funny ways, both Pride and Prejudice and Wise Blood are full of that irony that makes us think about what a bunch of hypocrites we can be to ourselves sometimes."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Flannery O'Connor's first novel was this rather short book, _Wise Blood_. It is quite thoroughly strange, full of basically unattractive characters, acting in obsessive ways, coming to bad ends. Yet it is a remarkable, rather moving, strikingly written book that really sticks in the mind.Hazel Motes is a young man from rural Tennessee who has just got out of the Army. (The book, published in 1952, appears to be set immediately after the Second World War.) He's had no contact with his family, what's left of it, for 4 years, and when he comes home he finds his home abandoned and in decay, and everyone dead. We meet him on the train to the \\"city\\". He's an unpleasant man, baiting the black porter, pushing his lack of belief in Christ on all and sundry.In the city, he wanders somewhat aimlessly, encountering first a prostitute, then a blind preacher, Asa Hawks, and his \\"daughter\\" Sabbath, then another confused young man named Enoch Emery. Hazel (whose grandfather was a circuit-riding preacher) sets up as a preacher himself, preaching the \\"Church Without Christ\\", and advocating blasphemy and sin. He pursues and is pursued by Sabbath Hawks, and also Enoch Emery. Motes is continually unpleasant to all around him. After Hazel rebuffs a confidence man's attempt to cash in on his preaching, he finds himself confronted by a \\"twin\\", Solace Layfield, the false prophet, who preaches of \\"the Church of Christ Without Christ\\", and who wholly perverts Hazel's nihilistic \\"message\\". Meanwhile the pathetic Enoch is trying to steal a \\"new Jesus\\" for Hazel, while Sabbath, barely a teen, is successfully seducing Hazel. The end is grotesque and strange -- Hazel becomes a murderer, Enoch a thief, Sabbath is sent to a home, Asa runs off -- and the final two chapters show Hazel mortifying himself, apparently searching for redemption. Whether his redemption is real seems an open question to me, though O'Connor seemed to think it was.The novel is ostensibly a comedy, and I suppose it is, but a very black comedy. It's full of images and objects and actions heavily weighted with symbolism -- Hazel's decrepit Essex automobile, the gorilla suit Enoch steals, the mummy that is to be the \\"new Jesus\\", the blind preacher's eyes, and Hazel's eyes, and much more. The writing, as I said, is striking, with any number of quite memorable phrases, such as the woman whose hair looked like \\"ham gravy dripping down her head\\" -- descriptive, and accurate, and very Southern in feel to me. This is a strange and quite compelling novel."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Like Hazel Motes, the main character of this book, who in thoroughly seeking to deny Christ in every which way, only ends up affirming Christ in a resonant, disturbingly real and existential way, this book works the same for those who both like and dislike it. This book, as a whole work, speaks a WORD. Those who toss it aside as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;ingratiating&quot; only affirm this.When I first read it, I had the same &quot;ingratiating&quot; feeling for a while. One thought that definitely occured to me was that I had never read anything like it before. It doesn't seek to thrill, empower the emotions, or to bring any &quot;explorations&quot; of &quot;social issues&quot;. It is so grounded in the very unpleasant falleness of a southern town, that the movements that occur therein take on a kind of universal importance and impact; right down the most immature of dirty deeds there is an ATTENTION in the writing, for want of a better word; the &quot;town&quot; seems to fade away and a larger stage takes its place. Or it becomes like a small stage in the hands of larger one. No matter how much it turns to hell, no matter how much the characters go after their petty, selfish appetites, there is something there, hovering over and with, something that is not hell, but is felt as an absence, waiting. One thing that helps this notion in the book is the fact that the sins that take place do not have any staggering, overpowering decadence to them. They have a pathetic, last-minute meanness and rotten pettiness to them.This is not a nihilistic yarn. Neither is it merely obsessed with absurdity, though absurdity does abound. This is not Kafka.This book, as a creation, has such a homespun feeling, but completely devoid of flippancy. It is so thoroughly a piece of genuine craftmanship that it makes Evelyn Waugh look a little pale. It's hard to describe. Almost as though it were too simple for our conditioning and our complexities. It is really a novel apart from other novels. Reading this book is sort of like watching a long train sliding across a horizon. You look at the cargo, and there are brief flashes between the cars. And then something occurs that is like an understatement, but bigger than what you expected. The last car, the caboose, goes across your vision, and it underlines the horizon you now see in the absence of the train. In a word, the book, at least I think in part is about HOPE. Not superfical hope that gaurantees something with a complete picture. That would not be hope. But RADICAL hope. The hope that St. Paul speaks of. But the way this book gets this across is not in any way pushy. There are not very many books that are as undeniable as this one, yet without any definite words to explain why it is undeniable. Wiseblood is a novel alive unlike any other."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"All human nature vigorously resists grace because grace changes us and the change is painful. -Flannery O'ConnorWise Blood is Flannery O'Connor's grotesque picaresque tale of Hazel Motes of Eastrod, Tennessee; a young man who has come to the city of Taulkinham bringing with him an enormous resentment of Christianity and the clergy. He is in an open state of rebellion against the rigidity of his itinerant preacher grandfather and his strict mother. So when one of the first people he encounters is the blind street preacher Asa Hawks and Motes finds himself both attracted and repelled by Hawks' bewitching fifteen year old daughter Lily Sabbath, he reacts by establishing his own street ministry. He founds the &quot;Church without Christ&quot;:Listen you people, I'm going to take the truth with me wherever I go. I'm going to preach it to whoever'll listen at whatever place. I'm going to preach there was no Fall because there was nothing to fall from and no Redemption because there was no Fall and no Judgment because there wasn't the first two. Nothing matters but that Jesus was a liar.As you can guess the church is singularly unsuccessful, although he does attract a couple of other crackpots: Enoch Emery a young man who works at the zoo and longs for a kind word from anybody; and Onnie Jay Holy, yet another rival preacher who believes Motes when he says he's found a &quot;new jesus.&quot;While at first this cast of bizarre characters, ranging from merely repugnant to truly evil, and the scenes of physical, moral and spiritual degradation through which they pass all seem to be just a little too much, the reader is carried along by O'Connor's sure hand for dark comedy. The book is very funny. But as the story draws to a close, O'Connor's true mission is revealed; Motes loses his fight against faith and he achieves a kind of grace, becoming something like a Christian martyr to atone for his sins. O'Connor has something serious and important to say about the modern human condition and the emptiness of a life without faith. That she is able to disguise this message in such a ribald comic package is quite an achievement.Reading the book inevitably called to mind Carson McCullers' dreadful book The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1940), which made the Modern Library Top 100 Novels of the Twentieth Century list. It too is a Southern gothic, populated by dismal misanthropes. But it is devoid of humor and has nothing to say about the characters and the world they've created. Wise Blood is a superior novel in every sense and really deserves that spot on the list.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"In a letter to a friend, Flannery O' Connor noted that most Christian writers have the tendency to turn their writing into \\"apologetic fiction\\"--meaning, in short, that the majority of Catholic novelists feel an undue obligation toward the public to soften (or change entirely the actual doctrines of Original Sin, Redemption, etc for the average reader's benefit. Though this letter dates from May of 1963, O' Connor's prophetic remark has only been proven more legitimate with time. As a Roman Catholic I have more than once wanted to vomit reading the well-intentioned attempts of both priests and lay people who do not write books but smear frosting on the mysterious, quite serious matters of Christian spirituality. This phenomenon is the result of believers who feel the constant need to appease the mass of readers who instinctually reject Christianity, often for reasons unbeknownst to themselves.What makes \\"Wise Blood\\" so special is that within the scope of 131 terrifying (and drop dead hilarious) pages we learn that Miss O' Connor intends to make us familiar with a different company of Christians indeed. Haze Motes may be disturbed, but he is as uncompromising a believer/non believer as they come. A boy who once put rocks in his shoes as penance for sin, he is now as intent on getting that ragged, shadowy figure moving in the trees out of his mind and soul by any means necessary. O' Connor puts him in the town of Taulkinham--a Southern version of Dante's Inferno.Here he encounters every manner of depravity: prostition (\\"Momma don't care if you ain't a preacher!\\") false witness to God (Asa Hawks,a \\"blind\\" preacher with a news clipping that does not include his whole history) and Sabbath Lily Hawks, who is often misread as being a mere whore when in fact she is one of the more sympathetic and lovable characters in the story. Perhaps the most hopeless of this crew is Enoch Emery, a deranged adolescent who is disowned by his father and who wanders the streets merely to be around people. He is so desperately lonely that one point he steals a Gorilla suit from the local museum just to endear himself to the general population.Out of all the false prophets and madness, Haze is the most fiercely lucid and his anger is actually righteous, for all his talk about \\"The Church of Christ Without Christ\\". Each attempt he makes at becoming a horrible sinner fires him in the exact opposite direction. One might say he is an Albigensian of sorts, a Christian turned inside out, but apart from one appalling act he is never quite far enough from Christ to earn that title. His sin and blasphemy fuel his madness and vice versa, until...While to most his act of redemption will seem like nothing but madness, it is no less an authentic act of moral outrage than Sophocles' Oedipus. The difference is that Oedipus was acting on a principle of despair, whereas the hope Haze never could not leave behind broils to the breaking point and shows him exactly what he is.The point is that for Haze, Christ is all or nothing. There is no middle of the road, no middle class preening, no posing or falsehood. There is not one bit of falsehood in his being.This certainly ranks up there with the greatest literature produced by Faulkner as far as the climate of the South goes. This is one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, perhaps more relevant now than ever."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"Boldly weaves pathos and ethos into a compelling tangle!

Not that my feelings would have been any different if I had simply picked this up in a library and decided to give it a try.I'll start by being painfully blunt. I really, truly hated this book. And I'm not a person to say that I hate a book lightly. As a matter of fact, I think this is the only book I've ever felt that I really hated. When I finished the last page, I didn't just want to never see it again, I wanted to burn it.That said, I'll explain.I didn't understand the characters at all. Not even once, not even a little. Nothing that any of them ever did made sense to me. I couldn't fathom their motivations, or understand why they would choose the way they did.Not only that, but I really didn't like them either. Now, that's not enough to make me dislike a book. I can live with the fact that a book can be good with characters that I truly don't like. But in this case I think it was a failing of the author to make the character believable. They barely even seemed human.The plot was as much a mystery. All I'll say about it is, I didn't understand, and I'm fairly certain that I never will.And the ending! I can't stand a book that drops a character without so much as a 'see you soon'. Suddenly, it seemed that all the other people disappeared. And I suppose from Haze's perspective, they had, but that doesn't mean that we should suffer for it!I found the ending profoundly disturbing. The last few pages were horrid. I can't understand an author who could treat her characters with such callous disregard! Stories do not always have a happy ending, or an end that makes sense, but this book had neither for no apparent reason!And to put the end of a characters life that we've been (unwillingly, on my part) following for the whole book as almost an afterthought in the middle of a paragraph! I thought it was apalling. This person may not have been important in the big picture, but for some reason he was supposed to be important to us. To put an end to him like that was just disgusting.So, to sum up, I would not read this book again without a gun to my head, and I regret ever having picked it up. Has it changed me at all? Yes, I suppose it has. I will never blindly assume that all books have at least one good thing about them again. I will never assume that just because I love to read I will be able to understand at least one facet of a character.And if this sounds melodramatic, or shallow, that's fine. This book did affect me profoundly, but for what it lacked rather than what it had. And if that is what the author was going for . . . well, I think I'm much happier thinking that it was all some sort of terrible mistake."},{"Title":"Wise blood","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. After reading two-thirds I felt compelled to finish it simply in hopes of finding some redeeming value to the time I'd already invested. Upon finishing the book (unlike the insightful and eloquent analysis by the Reader in New England) I shut the book and said, &quot;This is the stupidest book I have ever read!&quot; After calming down a little I began to wonder if perhaps Wise Blood represented Flannery's life and emotions? One has to imagine being stricken with a debilitating disease that eventually robbed her of life at a young age must have tortured her to some degree. She must have wondered where is God in all this without being able to deny Him. Could Hazel represent Flannery? A life of seeming despair, allowed to waist away slowly in a drainage ditch only to be finally found yet treated with complete disregard and with utter contempt by the police sent to rescue and redeem Haze (Flannery) by thumping him (her) on the head with a death blow without any apparent feelings. Was Flannery making a statement about being treated thus by God? Is it possible Flannery used Wise Blood as a cathartic for her own emotions towards God for the cards she'd been dealt? I don't say that judgmentally in the least. It just makes sense now that I am calm enough to think about it. I'm hardly qualified to dish out such psycho-babble. Basically, I still agree with the New England reader in terms of regretting the read. Perhaps this story will have more meaning should I face personal suffering and loss like Flannery.

Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.Faulkner plumbed the humanity beneath the grotesque. Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge.

Hunted and hounded by an angry mob into the comparative safety of sanctuary within the House of God, a terrified young man, accused of robbery and murder, and closely followed by his accusers and would-be executioners, disturbs the midnight office of the good monks of Shrewsbury. And so starts the seventh Chronicle of Brother Cadfael, in which the mediaeval sleuth finds himself with yet another wrong to right, by once more putting his mind to the solving of one of Shrewsbury's small mysteries.In this particular case, the mystery is no greatly complex affair but it is, in any case, largely subsidiary to Ellis Peters' painting of a finely detailed picture of life in twelfth century England, and more especially here, within a moderately wealthy family household. There are some unexpected twists and developments along the way, though, and there is certainly nothing predictable about the way the story works itself out, although the ending is no particular surprise either.In some respects, this is one of the best of the Cadfael books. Its opening pages contain some of Ellis Peters' finest writing, with her descriptions of the running to ground of young Liliwin and the reactions of Abbot Radulfus being quite hair-raising in their potency. The tale unfolds at a sure and steady pace thereafter, too, ensuring that it is always difficult to put the book down, right up until the final exciting, and rather tear-jerking, denouement."},{"Title":"The Sanctuary Sparrow (The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael) (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Following a weddding feast where a young man has been entertaining the guests with songs and tumbling, the unconscious body of the host, a parsimonious goldsmith, is found, near his empty treasure chest.

The household of the goldsmith is not a very happy one with the ageing daughter of the house forced into the role of unpaid and unappreciated servant, without the chance of making a life of her own, and with the grandmother as mean as her son, carping and acid tongued. An extremely nosy neighbour of the goldsmith has determined who was responsible fot the theft and seeks to profit by this knowledge, but is murdered before he can tell anyone his suspicions. Cadfael, as usual, patiently sifts through all the tiny clues which would probably escape the attention of anyone else, and fights hard to clear the minstrel's name. It's another Brother Cadfael triumph of love and justice over the evil doers."},{"Title":"The Sanctuary Sparrow (The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael) (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"The brothers of the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul are about to leave the church for their beds following the day's final office when a fugitive bursts through the door and clasps the altar cloth to claim sanctuary. A mob follows him into the church, and the abbot stops them from dragging the young man (a very young man, poor and thin and terrified) back outside to face \\"justice\\" only by standing over him and invoking damnation on anyone who violates the law of sanctuary. Brother Cadfael quickly decides that the fugitive, a wandering juggler called Liliwin, did not rob and attempt to kill the goldsmith at whose house he was performing that evening. The goldsmith's only son had just been married, and the juggler was hired - because he would work cheaply - to entertain the guests. When boisterous guests interfered and caused the juggler to break a pitcher, the goldsmith's mother - a powerful old woman still more in control of the household than anyone else, although a spinster daughter has for many years held the keys - ordered him thrown out with his pay docked by two thirds. Later, when the goldsmith went to place the bride's dowry in his strong box, someone knocked him unconscious and emptied that strong box. The mob is certain Liliwin did this. Now Brother Cadfael has 40 days, the term of sanctuary, to prove otherwise.This absorbing medieval mystery has plenty of twists and turns, and the characters are beautifully drawn. Cadfael is at his best here, a monk fully committed to his religious life precisely because he spent many years \\"in the world\\" and knows what he has given up. He uses that knowledge of what life outside the cloister is like, and of what motivates ordinary people's behavior (both good and bad), to work with Liliwin and find the mystery's resolution.I particularly enjoy the vivid medieval details in this series. The politics of the era are usually important to the story, but the author makes them clear to the reader without putting them so much at center that the mystery itself - and the characters, always the key element in any good book (in my opinion, at least!) - get less attention than needed. Deftly written, and thoroughly enjoyable.--Reviewed by Nina M.

It is possibly the one I remember most. In the end I think you can see how it will play out, but until two thirds of the book, you still should be guessing. The thing about Cadfael and Ellis Peters is that the world that she crafts is detailed exquisitely. She uses prose, sometimes a great deal, but she gives you imagery in her mystery's that transcend them into historical fiction.Conan Doyle lived during his protagonists adventures. Peters uses her imagine to spark ours. The stories coupled with the Mystery Series go hand and hand, and with Derek Jacobi as the Cadfael, it is a winner all around.The Sanctuary Sparrow has enough clues, and the background of the give and take of the Abbey and the Shire make all the more sense as part of the story. Part of the great fun of the Cadfael stories is to see how the politics of the Abbey progresses through the various stories, and how well Cadfael's friends and enemies are succeeding in their own lives"},{"Title":"The Sanctuary Sparrow (The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael) (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"If you are a person that just wants to enjoy a fun book and likes historical mystery's, this book is for you.

The main topic of this book is how Jews were saved from the clutches of Gestapo in Norway during World War II. There were not many Jews in Norway when the country was occupied by the Germans. In fact it was less than 2000. Among those nearly 800 were sent to the death camps in Germany and Poland, while the rest were rescued.The Nazis enforced a law that said that anyone who sheltered or in any other way saved a Jew, would be executed. Since there were traitors working for the Gestapo, this was a very serious threat. And, a lot of good men were betrayed. Even so, many chose to help, and some had to pay with their own lives. The first chapter of the book focuses on those times when the rescue missions went wrong, while the rest of the book primarily is about all those rescue operations that were successful. The author let you get to know both the Jews and members of the Norwegian resistance.He writes that many Jews could not believe how bad things were to turn out, and many did not want to escape. Others tried to escape at once, but were told by the Swedish authorities that being a Jew; was not a good enough reason to be granted asylum. In the end the long border to Sweden was what saved most Jews: In 1945 the very majority of the Norwegian Jews who managed to survive, had found a sanctuary in just our neutral neighbouring country. For a smaller group, Great Britain meant refuge.There is also a chapter about Denmark and their great effort that saved 95 per cent of their Jews. The author also tell us the reasons that the Danes could save so many more than what the Norwegians were able to do. One thing in Denmark was that Germans in power were very unwilling to send the Jews to Germany.I found this book to be very informative, exciting and interesting."},{"Title":"Science and sanity;: An introduction to non-Aristotelian systems and general semantics (International non-Aristotelian library)","review":"An interesting view that is not to be overlooked.

Both feelings were dashed with the first chapter of this rather pedestrian tale peopled with stick characters and laboriously urged along by stilted dialogue.If readers are to accept the author's premise that protagonist/narrator, Jake Conason, is a golden boy with a brilliant, wealth laced future before him then one must also suppose that fraternity boys who spend much of their college years sauced will rise to the top of whatever profession they choose.Punctuated with all too frequent references to titles of what loud music happens to be playing our story opens with a party at the Kappa Omega house in St. Louis with Jake pushing his \\"way through the throng of over inebriated underclassmen to get to the keg.\\" He's also looking for his girlfriend, Jordan, who is, of course, the prettiest girl on campus. As it turns out, Jordan, usually a modest miss, has \\"decided to share a bit of her perfection with the world.

Why bludgeon her with a crowbar, of course. Murder is an elective course that gets Jake into more trouble than he can imagine, but he is determined that nothing will sully his reputation and keep him from getting into Harvard Law School. And therein hangs the tale as the body count mounts and Jake proves to be a master at devilish machinations.If readers should wonder how in the world he manages to pull off some of his improbable stunts, we can remember that he's dealing with characters known as \\"Kevie Poo\\" and the likes of Evan Grunier who loved to torture pledges.The scene shifts from St. Louis to New York in a night of utter madness, and a new girl enters the scene - Lindsay, the most \\"voracious woman\\" Jake's ever known.A plot lacking credibility and puppet-like characters seriously flaw this debut.

Everything is going right until one fateful night when he commits an indiscretion then a horrific crime. To keep his future prospects intact, Jake must do all he can to cover it up-- even if it takes murder.Cornell Woolrich wannabe, Andrew Lyons has managed to hit a home run his first time at bat. The plight of antihero Jake Conason is so compelling that the book is virtually impossible to put down. The well paced and clever plot lacks originality but makes up for it in pure fun. This is the type of suspenseful thriller that few debut novelists attempt to write. So many of these first time authors write amateur detective stories that they are difficult to distinguish from each other and most are quite forgettable. Perhaps this type of suspense tale is very difficult to construct. However, the ending lacked originality and any semblence of realism.

Perhaps we're supposed to believe he had this \\"darkness in him\\" all along, but we get no references of his history or prior antisocial behavior. Thus his sudden transformation is hard to take seriously, and his subsequent acts of murder, extortion, etc., are hard to swallow.In the end, the book reads like a shallow, vain, attempt to emulate Brett Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho\\".

He's pre-law and the two biggest things in his life are his relationship with Jordan --- whom he wants to marry --- and the results of his law school applications. His three first choices are Stanford, Harvard and Yale, which gives us some idea of the level at which he is working, complete with a grade point average near 4.0 and a pending summer internship at a prestigious New York law firm. Jake's father is a prominent lawyer in Texas.Jordan is an art student and they don't always see eye to eye on Jake's devotion to studying. Jordan is an appealing character and we understand Jake's attraction; the enigmatic Lindsay is equally appealing.In spite of his determination to keep his grades up, Jake doesn't let hitting the books distract him from partying. He's a member of a fraternity, a well-respected senior man and drinking is a huge part of everyone's life --- and death, as we come to learn eventually.DARKNESS IN HIM is a first-person view into what some would call the corruption of innocence while others would call it learning to live as a successful adult in our contemporary society. Granted, though, Jake takes the learning process to extremes. He finds himself in a situation that could ruin his future and he handles it in a way that seems to him the least damaging to his life plans. Jake is intelligent and attractive. Because we are always hearing his inner thoughts through the first person narration, his rationalizing makes sense and, as we read, we are both appalled and torn with sympathy. This tension is what makes the novel work.Andrew Lyons, the author, is apparently young enough to remember his own college days vividly and he is skilled enough as a writer to make the story move along in a page-turning sort of way. But what is most significant about this book and about Lyons's potential as a novelist is that his background in the television business shows. (The bio blurb says that he has worked in TV, most recently as a producer since he graduated from Washington University in St Louis.) The subject matter of DARKNESS IN HIM, as uncomfortable as it may be, is hugely significant in today's world. Lyons needs more skill and polish to his writing, which may come in time, but he already has the insight to choose a subject that beats close to the pulse of America's competitive, success-driven heart. If he continues to choose his subjects so unerringly and unflinchingly, his future looks bright.--- Reviewed by Ava Dianne Day"},{"Title":"Darkness in Him: A Novel","review":"While most of the reviews on this page have focused on the anti-hero Jake, the true hero of this story is Prof. Fred Millicent, who rose from humble beginnings to become \\"the foremost authority in the United States on death penalty precedent.\\"In his early days living in the basement of his mom's trailer home in Omaha, few would have believed Fred had the potential to climb the ranks of Ivy League academia.

When Jake falls under the influence of the devil himself, in the form of Professor Millicent, you know exactly where it's going. (Well, maybe not exactly, but the journey there is cannily familiar.)One of the few things that saves this novel from complete hackery is the rich use of Biblical symbolism. Early in the book, we see Jake as an everyman figure, explaining to his girlfriend why he began his journey down the dark path, and the parallels to the Fall of Man in Genesis 3 are unmistakeable. you can almost imaging Adam himself saying, like Jake, \\"I didn't lie. The situation changed. It was Fred Millicent.\\"Before long, stalking young boys by pretending to be teenage girls in internet chat rooms is the least of Jake's worries. Fred's early work as a fry cook is a foreboding to Jake's fate in the lake of fire that he soon enough learns about in time to escape his basement, but will it be enough to escape the abyss?

Not because of the story, not because of the pacing, but because of the horrible writing. There are countless typos and misprints [most common was switching who was doing what around and putting something like this (Murray said,\\" blah blah blah\\") with the first quotation mark facing the wrong direction.] Also, even though I agree with the fact that Halloween is an anti-Christ holiday (yes, that IS a fact) and that Santa has way too much limelight during Christmas, he does not instill fear into children. Also, demons are not hideous looking gators/moths and cannot take physical forms, neither of those are Biblical. I appreciated the TRUE Biblical representations of demons in the forms of Greed and Jealousy that plagued Pastor Grime. But, the demons are not supposed to be outside of him, they should have been residing within him. Only in the most extreme of circumstances will a demon ever posess a human, they are supposed to cohabitate. Also, demons cannot affect the weather, cut break lines, or any of the many other things I vaguely remember them doing. And, lastly, angels don't have wings.

Thank you, Swanee, for the reminder. Looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Tamarind","review":"If you are not a Fundamenalist Christian or a strong believer in religion, you may be more turned off by this book than enlightened by it. It has very strong religious overtones that may be a little far fetched for some people to believe(ie...casting out of demons). I feel it may be a huge leap of faith for some people to believe. It seems to take normal circumstances (ie...accidents, the weather) and places supernatural forces behind them. I believe in the power of prayer and miracles too, but the things that happened in this book were even a little too much for me. However, the book does show the importance of prayer and that people should pray more often, when ever and where ever they can. The author also writes about something that I also feel is true and that is, it seems that all things that are good and right seem to be oppressed and taken out of sight from the public. Meanwhile, things that demoralize and corrupt people remain in plain veiw and nothing ever seems to be done about it. It's all chalked up to freedom of speech. What an excuse. This was one item that I appreciated from her book. One important thing to remember is that there is a reason for seperation to church and state. As corrupt as the goverment appears to be, do we want these people telling us what to do or how to run our religions. They seem to get thier noses into everything the way it is. And if seperation of church and state means I can't pray in shool...so be it. I can still pray in school by myself without anyone knowing. Another thing I appreciated in this book is that it shows no matter who you are, you can just as easly be tempted by satan whether you're a pastor, priest, minister or lay person and not even know it.One can take what ever on wants from this book, but be warned that this book is written by some one who appears to have stong religious views which may seem silly to some. One thing was, Santa, based on a true Saint and someone who gives selflessly to others, does not instill fear into children (like the book says he does). Adults use santa as an instument of fear to encourage their childeren to be good. St. Nicholas would give any child a gift. Holloween is not evil and I find it hard to believe that people curse candy. (What does cursed candy do to a person anyway?) Again it's a time for kids to have fun and adults make of it what they want. Kids are good, but end up corrupt by the deeds of their elders. Focusing on God and involving God into all our lives could help stop the corruption of the world. I give this book 3 stars because of content. It does have spititual warfare which is a plus and if everyone lived as the christians in this book do, demons beware. It gives insight into another religion and while I respect the author for her views and beliefs I still find the story a little on the extreme side of religion and feel the average reader may be &quot;turned off&quot; from finishing it. Being Roman Catholic my views and beliefs will be different from others of other religions. And others will walk away with other views. All in all it was a good story, it does show the power of God, but I feel you should have a good knowledge of religion and to not take to heart everything that is written in the book. While God is omnipotent, don't underestimate or sell yourself or others short. People can do things without Gods help, (that's why we have eachother), but it's just nice to include God into what you are doing. By this we show respect and let God know we appriciate Him and want Him to be apart of our lives."},{"Title":"Tamarind","review":"WOW, what a book.

I recommend this book because it not only explains the physical and spiritual warfare we are under daily, but it gives us a ray of hope. It shows us that good will triumph over evil!Karla J.

This is good for the giveaway sponsors. They are assured that you have actually read the books and that you post reviews. But it's frustrating for reviewers who wish to widen the type of book that they read and review. I find myself reading and writing reviews for the same type of book, over and over again.Not so with the giveaways on GoodReads. They continually surprise me with their choices for me, starting with the very first book, \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\". I had no science fiction works in my \\"library\\". \\"They Rode for the Lone Star\\" is another surprise. I have no \\"westerns\\" in my library.I signed up for this book on a whim. I know very little about Texas and thought that the whole Texas Ranger \\"mystique\\" was one of those \\"everything is bigger and better in Texas\\". I am happy to report that I was wrong. The Texas Rangers are, and were, much more than a state police force.They have a long, proud history that dates back to the first settlement of Texas by colonists from the fledgling United States. Texas Rangers were initially a militia force, defending \\"Texians\\" from hostile Native Americans and Mexicans who also claimed Texas. Rangers fought in the battles for independence from Mexico, in the Mexican War after Texas achieved statehood and then in the Civil War, on both sides of the conflict. The author ends this, the first volume of his history, at the end of the Civil War.The history of Texas and the Rangers is covered in detail, sometimes too much detail, and includes discussions of uniforms, weapons, tactics and seemingly every move in every battle fought by every ranger. And yet, despite all of that detail, a lot of knowledge is assumed on the part of the reader. I found myself wanting more information on important events like the fall of the Alamo, which admittedly fall outside of the scope of this book.I was a little confused by the use of numerous watercolors by the artist Bruce Marshall. Since he is a contemporary artist and not someone living during the time period covered in this book, I was unsure why his imagined scenes of battles and equally imaginative depictions of Texas Rangers, their dress, weapons and horses were used in a serious historical work. Much better are the paintings, photos, daguerreotypes and woodcuts from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries portraying the actual persons and scenes as they appeared at the time.This is an excellent book for any student of Texas and Texas Ranger history. The narrative, which can be daunting, is broken up by sidebars with details on people, places, battles and weapons, mentioned in the text and by illustrations of same.Happily for me, the book I was sent was autographed by the author. I collect books signed by their authors and am pleased to add this one to my collection."},{"Title":"On the edge of destruction: Jews of Poland between the two World Wars","review":"Celia Heller combines a great deal of detail on Jewish life in prewar Poland with an over-reliance on selectively negative anecdotes, from individual Jews, archived in the YIVO Institute, and her complete avoidance of anecdotes from the Polish side. How about, for instance, some testimonies of Poles who had been driven out of business, and reduced to penury, by unfair Jewish competition?Heller gives only a partial account of the 1912 elections to the Duma (Russian parliament). The Jews of Russian-ruled Poland would not vote for National Democrat Jan Kucharzewski because he was \\"perhaps erroneously\\" thought an anti-Semite (pp. 43-44), and instead voted for left-winger Yagiello. Heller omits the fact that some Russian politicians had earlier sent a letter to the Jewish electoral committee urging the Jews not to vote for Kucharzewski because he would join the \\"Polish Circle\\" in the Duma. The election of Yagiello caused a tightening of Russian rule over Poland, and his election was seen by Poles as a direct Jewish affront to Polish national aspirations. From that time on, Dmowski saw the Jews as not merely an alien element but an anti-Polish one: Hence the boycotts. In any case, it appears that even an anti-Semitic Kucharzewski in the Duma would have done the Jews less harm than the Polish antagonism fomented by his defeat.Heller (p. 310) translates and cites philo-Semite Pilsudski's comments on Jewish behaviors during the 1920 Polish-Soviet War: \\"The Jews did not behave badly everywhere. In the [towns of] Lomza and Mazowiecki they bravely opposed the Bolsheviks...But strange, as many things in Poland are, in the neighborhood [of Lomza] in [the towns of] Lokow, Siedlce, Kaluszyn, Bialystok, Wlodawa, there were numerous, even massive betrayals on part of Jews.\\"Heller faults Poles for being unwilling to step aside and \\"privilegize\\" the Jews as a nation-within-nation. Yet the balkanization of Poland that this would have caused would have included a linguistic fragmentation, not only Poles from Jews, but also Jews from Jews. She notes: \\"However, one must also admit that had the Polish government followed a policy of implementing for Jews the [Minority] Treaty's provision of public schools in the minority's language, the task would have been far from easy. There was bitter strife among Jews over the language of instruction (Yiddish or Hebrew) and over the general orientation (traditional or secular). Each side tried to press on the Polish government its own conception of Jewish schools, after the Minorities Treaty was signed.\\" (p. 220).Heller's preoccupation with popular Polish prejudices against Jews is counterbalanced by her inadvertent admission of reciprocal ones: \\"It was considered repulsive and un-Jewish for a man to get drunk. Of anyone who did, it was said, \`He drinks like a gentile.'\\" (p. 150).In her efforts to paint Polish Jews as the inevitable victims of anti-Semitism no matter what they did, Heller bends over backwards to find anecdotal examples of assimilated Polish Jews experiencing prejudice. But, by her own admission, there were only, at most, 200,000 assimilated Jews (p. 188), which constituted a mere 6% of Poland's Jews. How could such a tiny fraction of Jews enjoy the full benefits of the Polish nation when they were, to begin with, conceptually attached to such a heavy ballast of unassimilated Jews? Heller does not help her case when she quotes Hartglas, an assimilated Jew (pp. 208-209) who recoiled at Polish injustices to Jews in general, while admitting: \\"I personally did not experience them.\\" Now, if injustices to Polish Jews were routine, even to assimilated Jews, as Heller would have her readers tacitly believe, how could this possibly be true?Heller also undermines her doom-and-gloom portrayal of Polish Jewry when she discusses Jews organizing defenses against violent attacks by Polish hoodlums and nationalist extremists in the 1930's (pp. 286-291). Small groups of Jewish men, usually armed with such meager things as clubs and perhaps a few firearms, were often successful in preventing or beating off such attacks. Now, were the attacks anything other than unorganized, uncommon, and small-scale, how could such defenses possibly enjoy success?Heller suggests that, instead of trying to force Jews to emigrate, Poles should have welcomed the Jews' predilection for commerce to help lift Poland out of poverty. But, even if successful, this would have relegated the Poles to permanent economic underclass status in their own nation. She disingenuously contrasts Polish boycotts of Jews with the favorable acceptance of Jews by Czechoslovakia and America. But, unlike in Poland, Jews were only a tiny percentage of these nations, and the latter, very unlike Poland, enjoyed a vast and rapidly-expanding economy. Furthermore, Heller falsely charges the Polish nationalists with wanting to force all Jews out of Poland. In fact, nationalists were willing to retain some 500,000 Polish Jews. Minorities, when small, posed no problems. For instance, there never was a significant body of Polish prejudices directed against endogenous Polish Muslims, the descendants of Tatars.Heller's disastrous portrayal of Poland's prewar Jewry contrasts with that of Polish-Jewish scholar Joseph Marcus and his book, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE JEWS in POLAND, 1919-1939. Contrary to Heller's focus on Jewish poverty, Marcus shows that Polish Jews remained, on average, wealthier than Poles. According to Marcus, the main factors hindering Poland's Jews were the poverty of Poland as a whole and the excessive numbers of Jews crowded into Poland, not Polish discriminatory policies designed to limit Jewish economic dominance.As for the German invasion, Heller (p. 293) recounts the widespread Jewish belief that, owing to the fact that \\"Every Pole has his Moses (favorite Jew)\\", the 20 million Poles would easily save 3 million Jews. Heller's extremely disingenuous attack on Poles ignores, among other things, the fact that most Jews were confined by the Germans into urban ghettos. This meant that the vast majority of Polish Jews never had access to Polish rescuers, and the vast majority of Poles never had access to a single Jew."},{"Title":"On the edge of destruction: Jews of Poland between the two World Wars","review":"This book presents a vividly written, detailed account of Jewish life in Poland between the two World Wars. It describes the increasing anti-Semitic policies of the Polish governments that restricted Jews from engaging in traditional occupations, limited access to education and provoked anti-Semitic behavior by the country's population. While some have criticized this book as depending too heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than statistical analysis, that evidence is compelling and the book presents life as it was and as it should be known by any one who is interested in the history of the Jews in 20th century Europe. I read this years ago and it has stayed in my memory; I decided to buy it as part of my collection of books on Jewish history."},{"Title":"On the edge of destruction: Jews of Poland between the two World Wars","review":"For those with sweet visions of a peaceful multi cultural Poland between the wars this book is a bitter truthful pill to swallow.Chapter after chapter, page by page, it pretty much puts an end to this revisionist image.Every mistreatment of Jews at Polish hands is covered with cool dispassionage detail and adds insight to the fact that this is the story of one minority's mistreatment at Polish hands.Though unintended, it also makes those Polish rescuers who did their best to protect Jews from the Nazis more admirable to me than those of other countries as clearly not only were they going against the occupiers of their country but also their own anti- semitic countrymen.A must read for those interested in this subject."},{"Title":"On the edge of destruction: Jews of Poland between the two World Wars","review":"Comprehensive view of the Polish Jews between the World Wars.

(Gold Medal #506)","review":"Hard Case Crime is a publisher that, to quote them, \\"brings you the best in hard-boiled crime fiction, from lost pulp classics to new work by today's most powerful writers.\\" Of late, however, only the former is true: every release this year has been an older work. Even the one \\"new\\" work, \\"The Dead Man's Brother\\" by Roger Zelazny, was really an old story that had been previously unpublished.Stop This Man! by Peter Rabe fits into this \\"lost pulp classic\\" category also. This short novel follows Tony Catell, a middle-aged heist man who has pulled off a perfect crime, stealing a 36-pound gold brick from a university. What he was unaware of at the time was that the gold was radioactive and dangerous to anyone near it.Even in 1950s terms (when this book was written), the $20,000 or so that the brick is worth may be a nice bit of change but hardly a big, retirement-worthy amount. Nonetheless, to Catell, it is the big score, or would be if he can cash it in. Unfortunately, the word has gotten out that this gold is lethal, forcing him to hit the road to find a buyer. This will take him on a journey in which he will meet all sorts of shady figures - including a sadistic sheriff - while he evades the FBI agents who are after him. And, though he is reluctant to face the fact, the gold is making him sick as well.Peter Rabe is almost unknown nowadays, and while this book is good, it lacks that standout excellence that could make an author immortal. Catell seems to be a precursor to such literary heist men as Richard Stark's Parker, with both the skill and emotional detachment that would be done to perfection in that latter character. As with most of these older Hard Case Crime books, Stop This Man! has a tough, lean feel to it; it may not be the best such novel, but it'll do nicely as a quick, entertaining story."},{"Title":"Stop This Man!

Each generation is studied, packaged, and shipped out with a name. What will this generation of the new millennium eventually be called? Will it be Generation Destruction, Generation Party, or Generation Privileged? To prove that teenagers in America aren't just a bunch of lazy couch potatoes, Elizabeth Rusch has put together a collection of stories about young people who have done something to change the world for the better. These stories vary--for example, one is about a young girl who gave an intelligent speech, while another is about a boy who managed to collect hundreds of cereal boxes for the hungry.After every story, there is a \\"What You Can Do\\" list and quotes from other young people with ideas. The common thing among all the stories (and the thing that makes each story so endearing) is that these kids did not start out wanting to change the world. They just saw something wrong and decided to fix it. After every story there is \\"Your Solution,\\" a blank page where you can write how you would or could change the world.What I found particularly inspiring about this book is that none of the kids even considered the possibility that their ideas would not work. They just knew it could be done. Some of these kids had intelligence on their side, others just plain courage. It doesn't matter, though, because in the end all of their dreams became a reality.

Mayerson's art swipes from a range of art and illustration, from symbolism to manga to advertising. The style changes as the story develops and Mayerson nimbly leaps from panel-based narratives to splash pages full of meandering, stream-of-conscious maps and montages. Some drawings are neat and tight, while others are scrawled, streaked, and scratched to abstraction - especially in the sex scenes, where bodies coupling (or tripling) become a manic mishmash of skulls, grotesque penises, and scattered ink blots. As seen in Spiegelman's Maus, Mayerson is clever in depicting some characters as animals or shapeshifting freaks. Dennis Cooper's story is a hilarious satire with some touching scenes and a sad ending, the tragedy of which is no match for the irony sculpted by Cooper. Trevor Machine goes into cult history as the sexually confused, angst-ridden teen of popular lore, in line with Holden Caulfield and Tommy Gnosis - and he has such a perfect ass."},{"Title":"Horror Hospital Unplugged: A Graphic Novel","review":"Dennis Cooper, Horror Hospital Unplugged (Juno, 1996)One has to wonder whether Cooper has the same morbid fascination for the movie Horror Hospital evidenced by others of my acquaintance. Why else would he name his wannabe-Nirvana characters after a relatively obscure (and not so relatively silly) British B movie from the seventies? This graphic-novel adaptation of a Cooper short story details the lives of four youths in a band called, not surprisingly, Horror Hospital. Their lead vocalist, Trevor Machine, seems to attract (...) men wherever he goes (and comes out with Cooper's favorite line, \\"But I'm not (...).\\", as many times as a number of his other characters, despite its ringing just as false; it would almost be refreshing to meet a single Cooper character who's secure in his sexuality), resulting in failed relationships that Machine mines for his self-obsessed lyrics. Things get even weirder when David Geffen takes note of the band, and Machine is visited by the ghost of River Phoenix. Folks, you can't make this stuff up. Except that Dennis Cooper, in fact, has.The book is drawn by usually-competent artist Keith Mayerson, and there are certain panels where his competence comes through; for the most part, though, it looks rather like Mayerson was drawing in control-freak-Ronald-Searle mode, but without Searle's particular eye for biting satire. Coupled with the usual Cooper ulta-postmodern disdain for plot linearity, the whole thing ends up coming off, more than anything else, as hard to read, and not in the good way other Cooper works (e.g., My Loose Thread) are hard to read."},{"Title":"A Man of God: Essential Priorities for Every Man's Life","review":"Jack Graham is pastor of the massive Prestonwood Baptist Church which boasts a membership of over 23,000 and is thus one of the world's largest churches. He has written several books, the latest of which is A Man of God (which releases today). To provide a clear idea of the target audience for this book, one does not need to look much farther than the list of endorsers. The list includes Roger Staubach, Gary Carter and Pat Summerall. Neil Clark Warren (founder of the online dating site eHarmony.com) is added for good measure. And Chuck Norris enters the fray to write the foreward. And if you still aren't sure, perhaps this quote will bring added clarity. \\"The Christian life is more important than the Super Bowl, the World Series, the NBA Finals, and the Stanley Cup all wrapped together\\" (page 12).This book is obviously intended for the American \\"everyman\\" - the average guy with average interests who attends the average church. Graham intends this book to be a wake-up call. He tells us early-on that he has always firmly believed that \\"if revival was to come to the church, and if the Good News of Jesus Christ was to spread to the nations, it would be because men became godly and began living their faith with passion and integrity\\" (page 13). He seeks to encourage men to step up to the challenges offered to the faith in the twenty-first century and accept responsibility for the church.The book is divided into four roughly-equal sections, each containing three chapters. The first, \\"A Man of God and His Master\\" challenges men to know, understand and commit to God. Graham teaches that men need to commit to maximum discipleship - discipleship that impacts the whole life. The second section, \\"A Man of God and His Integrity\\" challenges men to live upright lives marked by moral purity and free from captivity to temporal possessions. The third section, \\"A Man of God and His Family\\" speaks of the importance of prioritzing family relationships. The final section, \\"A Man of God and His Ministry\\" challenges men about in the areas of mentorship and evangelism.The book is written in a conversational tone and is simple both to read and understand. Stories and examples abound. Scripture examples and proof-texts are also in abundant supply.There were a couple of small theological issues I found with the book, but I can see that these arose because of my Reformed understanding of salvation. On page 201 Graham writes, \\"People are incredibly interested in something that will fill the void in their hearts.\\" While this may be true, in no way does this indicate, as he seems to indicate, that unbelievers are genuinelly and spiritually interested in the gospel. But beyond such minor concerns, I found the book quite Scriptural.I am not convinced that Graham says very much in this book that has not been said before by other authors. In fact, there are probably quite literally one hundred books that deal with this same topic in a similar way. However, judging by the churches of today it seems that plenty of men have still not accepted the challenge, so perhaps this book can serve to wake a few more from their spiritual slumber. If a man in your life is not a reader, and has not already read several similar titles, this may be the type of book that will challenge and motivate him. It is certainly more biblical and more challenging than Wild at Heart and so many others."},{"Title":"A Man of God: Essential Priorities for Every Man's Life","review":"This book is more than your average book.

But the heroine lacks the appeal of Fast Eddie Felson, and the conclusion is flat. In marked contrast to &quot;The Hustler,&quot; which teaches both Fast Eddie and the reader about the real meaning of winning and losing, the heroine in &quot;Queen's Gambit&quot; learns little except to play better chess.

In short, the story is compelling but not convincing. The author tried to write on a subject that he didn't really have a first hand feel for. In the book Word Freak, you could see the author changing his viewpoints and attitudes as he became more and more involved with top notch Scrabble players. If Walter Tevis had done the same thing, the book would have turned out much differently.For the non-chess playing reader, they have no alternative but to believe what Tevis writes and creates in their mind. For someone that knows and has seen the neurotic chess player, his depiction just don't work quite right. In the end, I don't believe that Tevis created the sudden rush of an overnight genius. His writing attempted a psychological treatment but ended up as entertainment instead of a truly \\"psychological thriller\\" as the back cover guarantees.All in all, if you want an interesting read, this is okay.

For chess players, just a couple of examples, 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d5?! is given as a common variation of the Sicilian. Tevis doesn't seem to understand that, in a Swiss System tournament, the only two undefeated players would have to meet in the last round, and much, much more.For non-players, if you think that this is just chess geek nitpicking, imagine the following. Suppose a book about football implied that it was okay to make passes beyond the line of scrimmage. Suppose a baseball novel had somebody running the bases clockwise. We're really talking that level of inaccuracy here. Tevis claimed that a well know chess master had reviewed his book for accuracy, but if so, he must have ignored his suggestions, or been overwhelmed by how much he would have had to change.A knowledge of chess is truly a barrier to enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Tevis says he's a Class C chess player, but his writing falls below patzer level. A slow mover, with many cliches of plot and style. Major disappointment!"},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"It was the spring of 1983. On a long plane trip, I started THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT by Walter Tevis, a just-published novel I'd bought on impulse. And I was gobsmacked. Tevis --- author of THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and THE HUSTLER (and, later, THE COLOR OF MONEY) --- had written a book that, very simply, could not be put down. The woman who would become my first wife tried to talk to me; I shushed her. A meal came; I pushed it aside. All I could do was read, straight to the end --- weeping, cheering, punching the air.Amazingly, this novel soon went out of print. And stayed out of print for two decades. Now, at last, it's available again.What's the fuss about? An eight-year-old orphan named Beth Harmon. Who turns out to be the Mozart of chess. Which brings her joy (she wins! people notice her!) and misery (she's alone and unloved and incapable of asking for help). So she gets addicted to pills. She drinks. She loses. And then, as 17-year-old Beth starts pulling herself together, she must face the biggest challenge of all --- a match with the world champion, a Russian of scary brilliance.You think: This is thrilling? You think: chess? You think: Must be an &quot;arty&quot; novel, full of interior scenes. Wrong. All wrong.I tell you: THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT is &quot;Rocky&quot; for smart people.I tell you: You will care about Beth Harmon more than any fictional character you've encountered in years and years.I tell you: You will grasp the wrench of loneliness --- and the power of love --- as if this book were happening to you.Do you need to know anything about chess? Nope. Nothing. Tevis was a storyteller whose genius was to tell great stories; there's nothing between you and the people.My bet: If you read five pages, you won't put it down. You too will weep. And cheer. And at the end, raise your fist like a fool for a little girl who never existed and a game only wimps play."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"I picked up a used copy of \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" not because I was fascinated by the subject matter, but because Walter Tevis was a writing professor at Ohio University, my alma mater. (I never had him for a class, though I did interview him for a university publication.) I had never read anything by Tevis--not even his bestsellers, \\"The Hustler\\" and \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\"--but \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" makes me want to rush out and find every Tevis book I can. In \\"The Queen's Gambit,\\" Tevis creates a singular, and singularly moving, lead character--Beth Harmon, an orphaned, alcoholic, drug-addicted teenage girl who also happens to be one of the greatest chess prodigies the world has ever seen. Left alone in the world at the age of eight, hooked on tranquilizers by the monsters who run her orphanage, Beth is buffeted on all sides by enemies and fools. She finds her only lasting solace in the black and white figures on the chessboard, living and reliving those strategies as if her life depends on it (which, in the end, it does). Beth is so real, and so heartrending, that she and her story will linger with you long after you've finished the book. The book contains a great deal of chess terminology and strategy--two things of which I am profoundly ignorant and profoundly uninterested. Yet Tevis made me feel the excitement Beth feels in playing the game, and involved me totally in her life-and-death struggle to master it. Even if you don't like chess, you will like \\"The Queen's Gambit.\\" My guess is that if you love the game, you will adore \\"The Queen's Gambit.\\""},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Even though the notion expressed on the title of this review has been disproven throughout the years, chess is still a game where males vastly outnumber female players. This was even more pronounced at the time this book was written. But at that same time, an educational experiment by Laszlo Polgar had started, with the idea that kids can achieve exceptional achievements if they were properly trained by a specialist, from an early age. Thus, his three girls became chess players and in 1983, when Tevis wrote this novel, Susan, the eldest, was already a forced to be reckoned with. It was not until years later that the youngest of the three sisters, Judith, really proved that women can compete with men in this sport at the highest level.I am fairly sure that the Polgar experiment is what Tevis used as the basic premise for writing this book, but then he complemented the idea with a really complex main character, which has to overcome the difficulties set to her by the cards she was dealt in life. This is a really uplifting and emotional story, and Tevis shows his skills as a writer by drawing us into the world of chess with great descriptions of the personalities that populate the royal game. And to tell you the truth, chess is just the vehicle chosen in this case, but the story could have been written with other competitive sports without losing any of its flair, since what is more important is the struggle Elizabeth Harmon undergoes during her childhood, teenage years and young adulthood.Some people may think I have lost my mind, but I believe that those that do not play or understand chess will have a better time reading this book than serious chess players. There are two reasons for this assertion. First, the author does a great job in describing the games without giving specifics, but using instead a more general approach to the position at hand. This allows him to infuse the situations with excitement for those that would not be able to follow the action otherwise. But the second, and most important, reason is that in some of the passages in which specifics are given, there are serious mistakes. This is going to annoy chess players, while other people will not notice. I was really surprised that Pandolfini proof-read this book and did not correct some of this errors. Just to give a few examples, Tevis talks about a Sicilian defense game that starts with white moving his queen pawn two steps forward, he talks about black going into the Levenfish variation, and even mentions how the Queen's Gambit creates a more complicated middlegame than the Sicilian.If there were no chess-related mistakes in this novel I would have given it the highest rating, since the story draws you in quickly and keeps you hooked until the end. Chess players will definitely enjoy this book, but my recommendation is to breathe deeply and try to ignore the mistakes, you will have a much better time. I was not completely successful at following my own advice, but the final result was very positive anyway."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This book wins the award for \\"richest portrayal of an inner life with least use of internal monologue or dialogue\\".Marvelously written, this is an uncommonly insightful and rich page turner with an unforgettable protagonist."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"An excellent addition to the authors resume.

The descriptions of Beth at her best and at her worst in competition are masterly.

I remember doing that with John Irving's The World According to Garp, and I did it with this phenomenal novel from Walter Tevis.For years I've been curious about Tevis, but for some reason I never picked up one of his books. I've seen all of the film adaptations of his novels and perhaps I thought I wouldn't discover anything new here ... I'm not sure. I finally read The Queen's Gambit and I'm amazed Tevis isn't more of a literary icon. This is as good as anything Bradbury or any of the other \\"classic\\" modern American writers have published over the last 50 years.I won't go into too many plot points, since a lot of reviewers have already gone there; but let me just say that this novel has all the depth and sophistication of great literature and the wire-taut tension of the best thrillers. It is smart AND exciting, and you don't have to be a chess grandmaster to appreciate the suspense of the gaming in the novel.If you're on the fence about this, because you think you might be disappointed about an over-hyped book, don't hesitate.

This isn't a book about chess, you don't have to know a thing about the game to enjoy the story. It's about Beth, a young orphan who discovers her chess genius by accident, nurtures it, uses it as a lifeline to pull herself into the real world after her adoption and painful adolescence. Without her, the book would be a magazine article about a chess prodigy. With her, it's a story of a young woman who doesn't really know how to live in the world, but finds a way through the pain of an incomplete childhood.

Read it."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Although Walter Tevis is perhaps better known for his two novels about pool, The Hustler and The Color Of Money, both of which are very good books, The Queen's Gambit outshines both of them.Tevis has a beautiful narrative style that manages to be both taut and fluid at once. That clear, sharp voice carries you right through the novel so easily it's less like reading than like gliding through the story in a boat, watching events unfold around you. What Tevis really is is a sports writer, someone who can convey to his readers the tension, the anticipation, and the joy in excellence a sportsman who truly lives for his sport feels every time he plays. It's why you can read this novel and love it even if you don't play chess well. So long as you know what it's like to play a game and play it well, to train long and hard so you can beat out your opponent in the most elegant possible way, you can understand what makes Beth Harmon want to win and keep winning, no matter what it costs her in the end, because all that really matters for her is the exhilaration of outmaneuvering her opponent, spotting the weakness in his attack, and finding a way to use that weakness to win the game. Every other high and every other emotion pales in comparison with the feeling of winning. And if you don't know what it is to feel that way about a game, you will by the end of this book.Pick up a copy if you can. It's been a long time out of print, and it's hard to find in libraries, but it's worth every dollar of the $12-14 you'll pay for it."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This is one of those rare sports stories that transcends the sport it discusses. It's the story of Beth Harmon, a child chess prodigy who was \\"discovered\\" by the janitor in her orphanage. She's a richly-drawn character, with a suite of personal problems including substance abuse. The result is a compelling story of a \\"heroine.\\"Tevis does a great job dealing with the central challenge - - how do you make chess exciting for readers who aren't international masters, and may not play chess at all? His solution is brilliant. He tells the story of chess games not in terms of moves but in terms of Harmon's feelings - - \\"that rook is annoying\\" or intentions - - \\"getting the bishop in the middle would wear him down.\\" This puts the emphasis on people and plot, without getting bogged down in grandmaster-level chess.That said, Tevis doesn't quite get the chess world right. Even child prodigies have to work their way up the ranks more - - think of, say, Yasser Serawan. Nor does he have the economics of the chess world right. Harmon depends on tournament prize money, but that's not where the real action is in professional chess. Exhibitions can be lucrative, as can other appearances as well as articles and books (as feature or as author). Obviously, prize money makes for a more dramatic story, but given Harmon's personality, making a slog of the more mundane part of the chess biz would have strengthened plot, characterization, and verisimilitude.Nonetheless, it's a quick-paced, impressive novel."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"It's hard to put this book down.If you have played chess you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"How does one find books that have fallen out of the mainstream consciousness? It's a good question to ask, because titles tend to sink like stones without a marketing machine behind them or a place in the canon. Every once in a while, though, someone will pipe up with unexpected praise for a forgotten book, and when that happens I sit up and take notice. So as fantasy author Daniel Abraham heaped kudos on Walter Tevis' chess-centric 1983 novel The Queen's Gambit during a recent installment of PodCastle, I added it my to-read list.No one has ever taken Beth Harmon very seriously. Orphaned at age eight and confined to the Methuen Home, she moves through her days in a narcotic haze, force-fed the tranquilizers the orphanage's matron uses to make her charges easy to manage. But one day something cuts through her drugged fog: She sees the orphanage's dumpy janitor mulling over a strange game in the basement, a game played with black and white pieces on a checkered board, a game called chess. Beth pesters him until he agrees to teach her how to play, and after a few matches she discovers the strange ability within herself to unfold strategies entirely within her mind. She has a gift, one that could take her all the way to Russia, the nation which holds chess almost in holy awe. But before that can happen, Beth will need to conquer all the naysayers without and her hidden demons within.You've got to hand it to Tevis. Though I find playing chess only slightly more pleasurable than a colonoscopy, he somehow manages to move it into the realm of thriller, transforming movements on the board into action every bit as enjoyable as the wildest car chase. It's an achievement. So why then has The Queen's Gambit fallen into obscurity? Much of it probably has to do with his protagonist. Not just unlikeable, Beth seems almost an embodiment of Samuel Johnson's \\"The Vanity of Human Wishes.\\" Every time she gets near to a grand achievement, she methodically sabotages it with drugs or drink or unenjoyable sex with near strangers. It's perplexing, maddening amd infuriating, and by the end of the book you want to shake her. It doesn't help that Tevis oddly reserves more criticism for religious types who oppose communism than for the oppressive Russian Bear itself. An engaging Gambit that doesn't quite pay off."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Every few years I reread this novel cover to cover in one day. From a pure pleasure standpoint it's my favorite novel.The protagonist, a drug-addled, brilliant orphan who discovers she has a talent for chess is, in my opinion, the most believable female protagonist produced by a male writer. Her emotional life and sexuality are not overemphasized but are always there, lurking below the action. Tevis stated in a radio interview that what he wanted to explore in this novel was \\"the operation of genius in a woman.\\"Tevis's writing is fast, rhythmic, and unsentimental. Like his pool books (The Hustler, The Color of Money), you don't have to understand or even particularly enjoy the game in question to love this book, as he does a wonderful job of narrating the drama of the match, and particularly the way in which each match is like a fight to the death between the two parties.I also recommend his wonderful sci-fi novel Mockingbird."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This is the book I reach for most often to relieve a sleepless night. I'm probably the world's most careful reader, least hard on my books, with 10 years old paperbacks that look brand new, but this book is falling apart. I finally tracked down a hardbound copy to replace my tattered paperback.I know enough of chess to follow the action, and in fact it deepened my interest in chess. But the main attraction is the main character, the young orphan girl who discovers chess and that this ancient game and her brain are made for each other. Perhaps partly I could identify with discovering a native talent (no, not chess) not usually associated with girls/women and/or the very young.But primarily this is a story of the triumph of a unique human spirit housed in the form of an ordinary looking young girl with an unusual number of strikes against her. Fascinating, inspiring, a great read."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This is a superb chess thriller, which may sound surprising. Tevis' descriptions of the rise to chess stardom of his heroine involve the reader in masterful chess battles which become totally engrossing -- even for the non-chess player. The characterizations are interesting, involving an orphan girl with a prodigy's gift for chess, but her coming of age as an adolescent away from the chess board is of less interest than her time spent moving the pieces. Tevis' genius in this book is to help the reader climb inside the head of a chess genius and see from her perspective the world of her sport. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"I love chess and I loved this story about chess. It is a beautifully written story about a chess prodigy. A girl.The story was written elegantly. No excess verbage here. Spare like Hemingway.The story showed how a prodigy can be gifted at an intellectual game, but not be mature. You would expect someone that plays chess well to be mature about life and the choices one makes in day-to-day living. Not so. Our protagonist Beth is a gifted chess player at 8, but at 19, when the book ends she is an immature 19. At 19 she is already one of the best players in the world -- about to be the best -- but knows precious little about life -- even as a 19 year old.To me that is the heart of the story.A telling section of the story for me was when Beth was playing in her first international tournament in Mexico. She played a young boy -- 13 -- who was quite good and gave her a hard time in a game. He stated he wanted to be world champion at 16. Beth asked what would he do with the rest of his life if he became world champion at 16. She asked him twice. He did not understand the question.When Beth was studying with Bennie Watts whom she had just defeated to become US champion, she asked him if he ever got bored with chess. He said, yes sometimes -- but what else is there.I thought Beth might have been patterned somewhat after Bobby Fischer, who single-handedly beat the mighty Russian chess establishment. That is what Beth does. Fischer was known to be not only gifted but the hardest of workers. Single-minded. Now he is mentally ill.That is what the story I thought was telling us. That the prodigy has not the maturity to see all of life, but uses the gift relentlessly like an addiction.But life goes on, all grow up and the gift deteriorates, leaving what . . ."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Walter Tevis is most famous for his three novels that were made into movies, namely, The Hustler, The Man Who Fell to Earth and The Color of Money. The Queen's Gambit is the only work of his that I've read, but I'm inclined now to think of him more as a good storyteller than an accomplished novelist.The Queen's Gambit *is* a good story, but it is not great fiction. Beth Harmon, a child prodigy from that hotbed of chess activity, Kentucky, overcomes her orphanage upbringing, addiction to sedatives, adoption into a dysfunctional marriage, the death of her adoptive mother, alcoholism, and male chauvinism, not to mention the entire world of chess in a mere 241 pages. It all sounds a little far-fetched, but Tevis actually pulls it off. The story is entertaining and fast-paced and does not get bogged down in a morose, internal dialogue by the protagonist to get at the deep-rooted causes of her addictions. The events simply happen -- Tevis and Beth leave it up to the reader to establish any Freudian reasons behind her behavior.Tevis is quite good at giving readers a sense of the feel of American chess in the '60s. His descriptions of the fictitious chess personalities that populate the book are absolutely spot on. Every tournament chess player will know somebody like the characters Tevis has created. I found myself saying that this fellow sounds like so-and-so and that guy like such-and-such. As Tevis is from Kentucky and I am originally from Ohio and played in the same era, perhaps I really do &quot;know&quot; some of these guys and that &quot;...any resemblance to real persons, living or dead...&quot; is simply a legal disclaimer! It's possible that this is the one aspect of the book that I found most enjoyable.The description of the chess is actually quite good though no actual games are given. Instead, Tevis provides a sort of vague play-by-play that will give chess players a reasonable idea of what is happening on the board while non-chess players will get a sense of the intellectual struggle in the game, even if they are unfamiliar with the implications of the chess chatter itself. For the purposes of telling a good story, it's an effective compromise.For folks like myself who take their chess very seriously, however, there were some niggling things that a good editor should've corrected (supposedly, Bruce Pandolfini read the manuscript and offered suggestions, but I think he dropped the ball on numerous occasions here). First, Tevis refers repeatedly to the &quot;Levenfish&quot; Variation of the Sicilian Defense. There is a sub-variation of the Sicilian Dragon called the Levenfish which is almost never played at the Grandmaster level anymore -- was that what he was getting at? In the climactic game between Harmon and Grandmaster &quot;Lugov&quot; at the end of the story, the Soviet World Champion trots out the Albin Counter-Gambit against Beth's Queen's Gambit. The Albin has a reputation as being unsound and even if it were marginally playable, would not have suited a player of Lugov's temperament as he was described (he sounded much like a younger Botvinnik), or such an important game between two players in position to win the tournament outright. Further, defeated players in the novel all seemed to have this habit of tipping over their Kings as a melodramatic gesture of resignation. In 30 years of playing I've probably had a half-dozen or less opponents resign in this manner. Most tournament players simply stop the clock and offer their hand in congratulation (sincere or not). Lastly, chess is a game where a draw is a common result. Even Garry Kasparov, more often than not, is held to a draw by players conducting the white pieces, even if he out-rates them by 200 points. There are precious few draws in The Queen's Gambit which detracts from the realism of the story.Many chess buffs might quibble with the fictitious names of top Grandmasters intermingled with real names like Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian and others. A note in the book by the publisher provided the explanation that the author's intention was not to change the historical record (Tal and Petrosian don't even play in this book), but surely having &quot;Lugov&quot; as World Champion must count as changing reality! I was more confounded by the logic of that statement than I was annoyed by the fake GMs -- I simply thought &quot;Botvinnik&quot; every time I read &quot;Lugov&quot; anyway.Overall, The Queen's Gambit is an entertaining story that can be enjoyed equally by the &quot;chess-curious&quot; and by chess afficionados. Good luck finding a copy, though. I think folks are hoarding them, though I'm not sure why -- this is a book to be read once and passed on rather than kept for rereading in the future.[Note: This book is not suitable for younger readers -- there are portions of the book that contain adult language and situations.]"},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"The term 'chess book' probably conjures up thoughts of studied openings or analyzing Capablanca's greatest games, but that's not what The Queen's Gambit is -- it's more a book with chess as a feature throughout.The Queen's Gambit is a bildungsroman[1] about chess follows Beth Harmon from childhood (where she battles an addiction to tranquilizers) to adulthood (where she battles an addiction to alcohol). She overcomes all these hardships to become a chess Grandmaster and winner of the U.S. Open Championship.Called \\"Rocky for smart people\\", it's not surprising that some could non-Chess players could be turned off reading this book because of the central role that Chess plays. What they don't realize is that this book would work just as well if Beth was working to become a checkers or dominoes Grandmaster. Tevis achieves this by never delving too deeply into the chess games, past a couple of moves.What singularly makes this book worth the reading is the originality of the protagonist and the unique way that the author writes her. While stereotypes are used in the cast of supporting characters, Beth is unlike anything I've come across.Tevis struggled with social isolationism and alcoholism prior to writing The Queen's Gambit and one could almost guess it in the way he writes, in the same way it's obvious that the man was a chess player. There's a fluidity that comes with naturally knowing something that it always present in the novel.There was nothing that I actively disliked in this book, but if I was pushed, there was a slight slump in the middle when Beth's alcoholism really takes hold. It's as if Tevis, devoid of chess to write about, is at a loss for words. This section doesn't last but it is long enough for the reader to consciously slog through it.***[1] bildungsroman -- a lovely German word I learnt recently describing a novel that follows the protagonist's moral or psychological growth from childhood to adulthood."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This is a book that I have read more than once and it never disappoints.

I loved the journey and wished it had a sequel...so I turned back to page 1 and re-read it a second time.. something I've done with great books.. 100 Years of Solitude, Narcissus and Goldmund, The Illiad, Tolkien's The Ring....Read the book, you'll enjoy it and Beth will be a person you think about long after you've finished the book.. she'll become part of you and your life... what more can you ask of a novel?Note: You don't have to be a chess player to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Tevis is probably the best author to ever write fiction on chess. His talents were tremendous. I read this book - had a tough time putting it down and enjoyed it very much. However, it was very dark and at times not realistic. The whole story revolves around a young girl that is blessed with chess genius and with it the drive to be the best in the world. Her personal life though is a wreck - drugs, anxiety and trouble. This is her adventure and it is quite an interesting and unique journey. If you play or like chess you will love this book. If you're not into chess at all - Tevis is a great writer and should hold your interest, but the story is dark. Other Chess Fiction that is very good is \\"The Luneberg Variation\\" by Maurensig, \\"Alekhine's Anguish\\" by Yaffe, \\"The Chess Team\\" by Sawaski and \\"The Royal Game\\" by Zweig."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Tevis can write a story. You're hooked from the start with this one and you'll read it all the way through. Though light on characterization his mastery of plot and pacing drive the story forward relentlessly.Particularly good are his visualisations of the powers of the elite in the chess world, demonstrating this by having young Beth play games at night on her ceiling by memory and their prodigious memory for the games and positions of chess theory.The character of Beth is sympathetically self-destructive, the supporting characters aren't really developed. Just as Beth is mono-maniacal about chess, the book is mono-maniacal about Beth. This is her story and her story alone. This is not a weakness, but perhaps there was another way the book could have gone with more of the supporting cast. Beth is likeable, and fallible enough to have the reader emotionally invested in her success.Highly recommended for anyone, knowing a bit about chess, the tournament scene, and the state of the game in the 60's will add to your appreciation of Tevis' craft but is not necessary to fully enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Enjoyed this book that is just as much about a young girl growing up than it is about chess. The girl is a little &#34;different&#34;, kind of a loner, and you can't help but want her to succeed at chess and at life."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This book was recommended by the author Jesse Kornbluth whose column I read on America Online. Then I read his review of this book right here on Amazon and knew I had to read this book. In the column Mr. Kornbluth writes, he touted this book which was originally published in the 80's, then was out of print and finally was published again. The story revolves around a young chess prodigy. At 8 and an orphan, Beth Harmon lives in an orphanage. One day she comes across a custodian playing chess by himself and becomes intrigued with the game. She begs him to teach her the game and he does. From these elementary lessons it becomes obvious that her skills at chess far out reach her age. But on her rise to fame she begins to drink and horde pills to calm her anxities and loneliness. Eventually she makes peace with her behavior, herself and chess. Her road to these make for an interesting read. I did enjoy this book and found the character of Beth to be really complex and at times reckless. But I don't play chess and since much of the book revolves around different strategies and plays, I was somewhat lost at her chess achievements. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to others especially chess players."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"I enjoyed the story tremendously. Would love to see it made into a film. I recall 20-25 years ago Jerry Weintraub was rumoured to have make plans to produce a then young Molly Ringwald in the proposed film. Still think a film is a great idea."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This elegant novel is more suspenseful than many many spy or crime stories. Maybe part of the suspense comes from the fact that she is an orphan, and I'm expecting some Dickensian melodrama to engulf her from damp alleyways, or the tension of the chess game (can she win; how can she win!?) creates more generalised tension and I subconsciously expect Swedish sadism to rush out of the next warehouse. But she lives in Kentucky and I don't think there have been any alleys or warehouses . . . so I don't know how it's so suspenseful, but I'm only half-way through, and I can only read it in little chunks. It's like dancing the quickstep -- you have to stop and breathe."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"This book is everything a good novel should be: interesting, readable, well written and unique. Tevis captures the setting and the era perfectly. Beth Harmon is an engaging, flawed heroine, easy to root for and understand.

(Really!) Tevis's best book."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"The girl chess whiz on a quest I would mainly recommend for chess players--superb research and high level game discussion. It's about as exciting as a thriller about a board game can possibly be.I didn't really mind the dramatic cliches since this is just entertaining genre stuff, but I'm shocked at the totally stupid and extraneous M rated affairs that almost ruin the story. Tevis probably got bad advice or orders from the publisher."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"Classic. Set in the 1950's this story of a female chess prodigy makes chess enthralling, even if you don't play it. I love the way Tevis introduces us to this world, where Beth Harmon, 8 years old and given daily tranquilizers by the orphanage, discovers chess in the basement by watching the janitor. The tone is dry but gripping, as we follow Beth and her discoveries of world and self via chess. I read this book when it first came out (early 80's?) and it hasn't dated a bit, it's still wryly riveting and well worth spending time with. It's a keeper, buy it you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","review":"I didn't know someone could write a book about someone obsessed with playing chess and that I could get interested in chess as a result.

Perhaps this one will become one of her most popular in the next 10 years as record numbers of baby boomers turn 50 every day. Although both women and men will find plenty that speaks to them, the book is very much in a woman's voice and will resonate more powerfully with many female readers.Each poem deserves its own comment, but I would exceed my word quota if I did that.Let me see if I can group them a bit for you. Some of the poems focus on how things have changed with age. &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is a good example, which lists a lot of things the author does when she's feeling wild -- like &quot;I didn't bother flossing before bedtime.&quot; &quot;Second Marriage&quot; is the tale of a widow and widower whose family situations keep them from following their hearts. &quot;To a Middle-Aged Friend Considering Adultery&quot; advises the woman in question to give up the idea of a young male lover. It won't last and it's not worth it.She also finds plenty to be pleased about in being 50. In &quot;Exercising Options,&quot; she skips all of the strenuous exercises in favor of floating on her back in a pool. In &quot;Happiness,&quot; many simple blessings like good health turn out to be the most enduring sources of happiness.Children are never far out of the picture. The brief joy of the empty nest quickly evaporates as they all return to stay (some with spouse or children in tow) in &quot;They're Back.&quot; &quot;How Can People Want to Bring Children into This Terrible World&quot; is a poetic discussion with a daughter-in-law about the author's desire to have a grandchild. There's always an edge of unsettled concern in these. For example, in &quot;You Say You Want to Know How the Children Are Doing&quot; is a litany of superficial updates on great numbers of children ending in the lament, &quot;But what does it mean?&quot; She has advice for her son in how to answer his wife's question about does he love her in &quot;Some Advice from a Mother to Her Married Son.&quot;Other poems are filled with hope and are forward looking. In &quot;Before I Go,&quot; she tells how she'd &quot;like to make things better.&quot; She aspires to be a &quot;Sexy Old Lady&quot; in the poem by that name at 80 with &quot;my sexy old husband nestled beside me in bed.&quot;The book's tone is perhaps best captured by &quot;Pleasures of an Ordinary Life&quot; in which she praises having &quot;a long history and connections&quot; with other people.Judith Viorst is as gentle a guide as you can find into the land of the 50s.

With Forever Fifty And Other Negotiations she explores with insight and humor the joys and fears of being in your fifties. The book contains 24 one-page poems that are accompanied by full page graphic illustrations in green ink on a rich cream paper. The 24 graphics are reproduced on the end papers. The attention to design makes this a wonderful gift for a quinquagenarian friend.The poems are funny and sentimental yet bittersweet. In some poems we see a person who is struggling to accept the limitations of middle age (where running wild is to go for a walk without sunscreen and memory can't be relied upon). In others she seeks the joys that come with the wisdom of years as when she says \\"We're quicker to laugh, and not so eager to blame.\\" In yet others, she makes affirmations to live life \\"as a sexy old lady\\" and lists the things she'd like to do before she goes.There are poems that take humorous looks at adult children, long-term marriage partners, and young doctors.Overall, a wonderful but light look at the aging process of the 50s.

The book is advertised as 'poetry' but if poetry we mean \\"the deepest expression of feeling in words\\" this is not poetry at all.These are mild thoughts grouped into little stanzas centering usually on a single theme. One most interesting one centers on ' what happened to the children' and simply states the very varied and idiosyncratic career and love choices made by what I suspect are not only her children but those of her friends and neighbors. Another , the opening poem focuses on the whole business of being asked how old one is, and the hidden intentions behind the question. Another poem is about the ' second marriage' and the calculations and considerations involved in it of a friend. The final poem which truly epitomizes the spirit of the whole book is called \\" The Pleasures of Ordinary Life\\" and focuses on the consolations of good health , and small pleasures when one reaches an age when the big violent passionate dramas of life are no longer there.These verses are often light and can be mildly amusing.

Then I'd be a millionaire. But if every book about Gypsies were as good as this one, I'd be broke. What a story! And apparently true (but who knows?). If you read the book, you meet a Gypsy-American named Thomas Nicholas, nicknamed \\"Samson\\", who is maybe descended from the legendary Prester John. Sampson's philosophy of life in a nutshell is that \\"when you plug into the system, the meters start turning,\\" so he never plugs in. He keeps on the move, or settles down from time to time and lives his secret life surrounded by non-Gypsies. Non-Gypsies--including police, university types and wannabes--are curious to know more about him for a ton of reasons, and they are a constant threat. This book is a blue-collar epic about Samson's life and times as a child and as an adult. He is born into a family immigrant coppersmiths. His talent is fixing restaurant pots and pans here and there across the United States, and he has also mastered the dangerous craft of refinishing bakery bowls by hand using fire, acid and tin. Samson tries to make ends meet as a bluecollar worker in America, and his life is full of ups and downs like everyone else. What makes his life especially different and interesting is that he is a Gypsy. Apparently the author, who says he is a non-Gypsy, is Samson's lucky rabbit's foot. He writes about this Gypsy-American's life from the inside out. There are also lots of photographs to back up his stories.

It is chatty in tone and is geared for use as life instructions for the modern reader, using Barclay's meditations on Acts as a starting point. That's fine in and of itself, as long as you know what you're ordering.Barclay's meditations, however, are extremely slanted. He makes no distinction between historical fact, traditional interpretation, and his own thoughts. He frequently includes quotations, but does not state who he is quoting; if there were ever any references, they have not been included in this edition. He provides imaginative interpretations of the thoughts and motivation of Paul, Peter and the other persons in the book of Acts. He puts forth disputed theology and history as if it were plain fact: for instance, stating that the Jews \\"failed\\" to uphold the Covenant and were discarded by God and supplanted by the Christians, and that Simon the Magician, in chapter 8, was a charlatan whose trickery was believed by the superstitious Jews.While these are both opinions with more than a few proponents, Barclay does poor service to the breadth of Christian scholarship when he ignores all other interpretations of the passages. The result is that the uninstructed audience for whom he is writing will come away misinformed."},{"Title":"The Acts of the Apostles (Daily Study Bible (Westminster Hardcover))","review":"As an overall summation of Luke's Acts, this is one of the best.

He is thorough in his treatment of Acts with interesting historical background and commentary. This is a slightly altered version of what he wrote in the 1970s, but the changes are somewhat cosmetic (gender inclusion), not tampering with content. If you like Barclay's other New Testament books in this series, you will also like this one.I have found this to be a very good study book for a group. I am in a men's Bible study that meets weekly. We read through the commentary in short chunks, then discuss. Not everyone always agrees with Barclay, but he still stimulates thought.I have to admit I have been a Barclay fan for many years. He takes Biblical scholarship out of the academic world and shares it with us lay people in an interesting fashion. He was one of a kind.

He also produced several books for a general audience, and this is one of them. It was written in 1936, with a postscript chapter that tries to bring things a bit more up to date (at least to 1951 when this Dover edition was first published). One of the most interesting features of this book is the inclusion of seven \\"flip books\\", which are included in the margins of most pages. By flipping the pages one can see the motion of atoms, operation of a Hertzian oscillator, the scattering of a particles, the motion of electrons in H atoms, and the rotation of orbital planes.The book begins with the kinetic theory of gases and uses this to develop the general concepts of Newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics. This treatment is devoid of mathematics and is a great introduction to physics, written for a general audiences, but with insights that physicists may also find interesting. It is suitable for high school students and non-science major college students. The book then proceeds to two chapters that cover electrons and ions, and waves and particles. These chapters cover the fundamentals of relativity theory and quantum mechanics. Again the treatment here is quite general and non-mathematical. These sections are still quite relevant even after 70 years, but after these chapters the book starts to show its age.The final two chapters of the book deal with the structure of the atom and nuclear physics (circa 1936). The structure of the atom chapter gives a very nice overview of the development of the Bohr atom, with the modifications made by Sommerfeld, Pauli and Dirac. It covers the development of quantum numbers, electron orbits, and how this explains the observed atomic spectra. This chapter is probably of more interest to physicists than for a general audience, but it is explained well and is not too complex, so someone without a physics background should not become completely lost. The final chapter covers nuclear physics, primarily isotopes. Nuclear physics has advanced so much since 1951 that this chapter is mostly only of historical interest. After the material covered in the original 1936 book there is a brief postscript chapter trying to bring things up to 1951. This chapter is very general, and while it briefly mentions some advances in quantum electro dynamics, these references are very general and are mostly of historical interest. The rest of this postscript is really just historical, dealing with topics such as the impact of science on WWII (mostly the atomic bomb, but since the author was not actually involved with this work it is extremely general and very superficial).This is a great book for a high school student interested in science. Those interested in the history of science and old science books will also like this book as it is a classic, written by a master."},{"Title":"The Restless Universe","review":"A classic Dover edition that uses page margins to create flip books of physical phenomena like kinetic theory of gases.After another classic (The Mechanical Universe) that used animations (by James Blinn of NASA), physics is much better understood. But Born did this back in 1936. Good show, Max!"},{"Title":"Essays in the public philosophy (A Mentor book)","review":"Walter Lippmann was an interesting political thinker in the United States during the 20th Century. This is one of his most interesting works. And his ruminations are quite relevant today. A key point at the outset of this work (Page 19): \\"If I am right in what I have been saying, there has developed in this century a functional derangement of the relationship between the mass of people and the government. The people have acquired power which they are incapable of exercising and the governments--they have lost power which they must recover if they are to govern.\\"He notes another disjunction--between \\"the people\\" and \\"THE PEOPLE\\" (my distinction in caps). As Edmund Burke, he does not believe that the people, as in government by the people, refers just to those living. In his view, THE PEOPLE is (Page 32) \\". . .a community of the entire living population, and their predecessors and successors.\\" Applicability? In today's toxic political atmosphere, the parties are only interested in their current base and those independents whom they can claim and, perhaps, scraping away some of the other party's supporters. In the process, the past and the future are neglected (again, Burke speaks to the same issue).Democracies need civility to function; they also need a \\"public philosophy,\\" based on core values, to bind the country together and to structure political discourse. I suspect that Lippmann would be most distressed to see the partisan divide today (although this is certainly nothing new in American political history). For instance, he argues that such things as an absolute right to property is not appropriate when one has a public philosophy. There is a greater good than the right to property. That gives a taste of his views with one specific example.It might be that many Americans would be richly rewarded by reading Lippmann's work. I surely have many questions about his argument, but the seemingly quaint arguments that he makes might lead to a more productive political process. The current \\"blood sport\\" does little good for the larger public's interest."},{"Title":"Essays in the public philosophy (A Mentor book)","review":"Walter Lippmann is one of my favorite non-fiction writers. He is a brilliant man, and his work has contributed greatly to the modern American political landscape. It's sad to see this book going out of print. Few tomes grant such insight into the fundamental weaknesses of democratic nations. In an age where the United States is the undisputed military power, some have confused democracy with god. It seems democracy is a word thrown around carelessly as a cure all for the world's ills. The Public Philosophy stays true to the Founding Father's fears that a democratic majority is capable of being as oppressive as a monarch. I highly recommend this book to any serious student of political science."},{"Title":"Essays in the public philosophy (A Mentor book)","review":"Walter Lippmann's The Public Philosophy is as relevant today as when it was written in 1955. His assertion that the traditions and customs of civility are in decline in both America and the West is only reinforced by the growing unreason and incivility of our age.Lippmann's belief that a role for political philosophy(ers) is of vital importance if our free and democratic institutions are to be preserved is right on the mark. The Socratic pursuit of the &quot;examined&quot; life is more rare today than ever. And yet, for that reason, it is all the more important.The Public Philosophy is a &quot;classic&quot; and serves as a reminder that the solutions to the problems of democracy are not found in further democratization.E. Robert Statham, Jr., Ph.D.University of Guam, U.S.A."},{"Title":"Essays in the public philosophy (A Mentor book)","review":"I feel that this book is as relevant now as it was when it was written over fifty years ago. Lippmann does a good job at looking at where American people fit into their democracy (which is more of a republic).One of the most compelling quotes in this book is: \\"The best education for democracy will be the one which trains, disciplines, and teaches the least.\\" Pg. 63Really think about what this quote is saying, then think about people ready to kill one and other about whether Democratic is right, Republican is right, Moderate is right or even if Wookie is right. Many times in this society people shoot their mouths off about elements they have no lucid or tangible ground beneath their feet to stand on, but have plenty of room to put their feet in their mouth.I was required to read this book in a graduate class, and I found it very interesting and thought provoking.

Second, Lippman is a snob who thinks that elitest jerks should control the country.Besides that, he is pretty good reading for anyone who wants to know how things are run in America. The book is full of boring BS passing for history, but when Lippman kicks in accusing the public of being ill informed and stupid, he's at his best, or worst depending on how you see things.He's pretty much in bed with Aristotle, so if you agree with that jerk, you'll love Lippman."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Fun read from Tucker Carlson about his start in the world of journalism.
