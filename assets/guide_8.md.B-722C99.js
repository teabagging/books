Just let that comment settle for a moment...There are many parts of this book that are laughable, however I will give you a couple of the high points.So as to get into the spirit of the book, you are asked to 'imagine'. Therefore, imagine, if you will you are a man struggling to save a failing relationship. Now, picture his partner, broken by all the things that weren't to be in her now unhappy and loveless relationship.Suggested Solutions:- Fill In the blank: write a love note with check boxes that ask \\"do you love me?\\". I always imagine the wife defiantly checking 'no' before moving to her mother's.- Report card: \\"your children understand how grades on a report card can impact one's self esteem...\\". Apart from being blatantly demeaning, I smile as I think of how a woman would feel being scored in her menial duties. Imagine the warm glow on her cheeks as her husband, whom she loathes, stands in judgment.- Say 'i love you' in a song: This suggests picking a song that you and your wife find meaning in, and then ad libbing and singing in between verses, and recording it on a cassette. Obviously ridiculous, but it is accompanied by a picture of crazed looking women with mismatched sized heads, laughing hysterically.- Queen for a day: The short version... 1. Hire a high school marching band 2. Have it march to your wife's place of work. 3. Have a friend read a declaration of your love. 4. Arrive in armor on a horse. 5. Have heralds trumpet your arrival. \\"When you dismount, approach your queen and kneel before her as you pledge your allegiance to her. Then let the music play on as you take your queen to the castle.\\" Imagine the mortified look on the wife's face as her friends, speechless with shock whisper \\"oh my god... is that John... Oh my god\\". Priceless.Well, that is the best part of the first 1/3 of the book. I suggest you buy it. It is HILARIOUS. 1 star though, because it is terrible. As a schadenfreude I adore it and revel in the thought of men thinking that this is a better solution than simply being nice to their wives."},{"Title":"Shining Your Armour: The Lost Art of Romance","review":"This book stinks. This author actually believes that the way to a woman's heart is to buy her trinkets, baubles, buttons and play pretties. Does he actually believe that women are so shallow? Having read his book, it's obvious who's shallow. The purpose of the book is not to help men woo their women, but to give men more creative ways to &quot;earn&quot; a night out with the fellas. As a woman, reading this book, I have never been so insulted. Did he ask any women to help him write his book? He would have benefited, and so would his audience, if he had simply asked women what a man can do to &quot;be more romantic.&quot; I can assure him that rather than shower her with presents and flowers, he could treat her with as much respect as he would his buddies. Rather than meeting her on a horse at her work, embarrassing her in front of her friends, he could just treat her as an equal. Rather than just assuming that women are so frivolous that baubles and bows are all it takes to satisfy, he could simply value their worth to the point of really ASKING women what they want from men.

Their ruling assumption is that the US state is innocent and benign.In Chapter Two, he compares the media handling of two similar events: Korean Air Lines 007, shot down by a Soviet jet in 1983, and Iran Air Flight 655, shot down by a US ship in 1988. The first was judged as a murderous attack, \`wanton, brutal and deliberate', proof of Soviet moral bankruptcy, portrayed with pictures of the dead and much empathy, outrage and generalisation. The second was seen as a tragic accident, \`understandable, mistaken and justified', a technical glitch, described in the passive voice, in abstract language, with no pictures, no generalisation and no blame.In Chapter Three, Entman looks at the media treatment of the US attacks on Grenada, Libya and Panama. The media presented coherently only the administration's view. Typically, CBS's anchor Dan Rather said they were \\"not sure exactly what was happening but knowing the teams. It was the US against Qaddafi\\". Entman concludes, \\"The analysis demonstrates how journalists served as more or less loyal conduits of U.S. government propaganda in wartime.\\" It seems that the first rule of the US state's news management is \`lie early and lie often'.In Chapter Four, Entman examines the media's \`great debate' about the war on Iraq, which, it appears, was between those who wanted war at once and those who wanted war later. 71% of the Americans who appeared on camera were pro-war, just 3% against.Entman shows how the state portrays the enemy as a threat, then uses a brief \`wave of patriotism' to rubbish dissent. The state pretends that it is responding to public opinion, and claims that the media reflect public opinion: both notions support the ruling pretence that the public governs. In Chapter Six, Entman disproves all these myths by showing how the US state, with media assistance, beat back the hugely popular movement for a nuclear freeze."},{"Title":"Projections of Power: Framing News, Public Opinion, and U.S. Foreign Policy (Studies in Communication, Media, and Public Opinion)","review":"\\"Projections of Power\\" by Robert M. Entman is a scholarly analysis of the media and U.S. foreign policy. Mr. Entman discusses the media's changing role as a critically important intermediator between power, politics and the public. Through a comparative examination of media reporting about several memorable events that occurred both during and after the Cold War, Mr. Entman offers both a penetrating critique of changing media practices and suggests a number of ways that the media might reform for the better.Mr. Entman proposes an original theory for understanding media power. The author's \\"cascading activation\\" model explains how issues are passed down from the White House to elites, news organizations, and the public, as well as how pushback can be activated from lower levels to the top. Mr. Entman explains the importance of framing issues but contends that promoting a particular political objective has become increasingly difficult with the demise of the Cold War. For example, Mr. Entman cites a paradigmatic case where the U.S. and USSR each mistakenly shot down passenger planes in the 1980s; as might be expected, Mr. Entman discovers that the media treated the U.S. incident as a tragic error whereas the USSR was overwhelmingly condemned for an apparent act of evil. Clearly, the media's reporting of events was shaped by the dominant Cold War cultural schema of a public that predominantly believed in a well-intentioned U.S. versus a systemically corrupt USSR. Today however, the author contends that the current Iraq War offers evidence that a more sophisticated Internet-enabled public and media can offer at least some critique of the administration's policies at least some of the time.However, Mr. Entman offers a sober assessment of the seemingly insignificant role that public opinion plays in influencing foreign policy. Mr. Entman discusses how the Reagan administration manipulated the media to influence public opinion in favor of increased defense spending but did not reduce these expenditures when opinion later swung towards increasing domestic programs. In fact, Mr. Entman shows that political leaders are more concerned about spinning news events to achieve the desired outcome than with fact, concluding that in practice democracy is all but limited to voting. Therefore, Mr. Entman believes that the media would do well to safeguard the public interest by creating \\"liaison editors\\" who might be able to better analyze news and construct challenges to administration spin, as well as to have \\"designated statesmen\\" available who could articulate opinion on policy matters. The author hopes that these kinds of mechanisms might help to activate resistance to poor policy choices by enlarging the scope of debate within the media.I highly recommend this interesting and highly readable book to everyone interested in media, politics and democracy."},{"Title":"Projections of Power: Framing News, Public Opinion, and U.S. Foreign Policy (Studies in Communication, Media, and Public Opinion)","review":"This treatise on the news will be essential to anyone who is starved for actual knowledgeable analysis of the way the media interacts with the public and with politicians, and who are tired of ignorant and whiny conspiracy theories about liberal (or for that matter, conservative) media. Here Entman builds upon existing theoretical work in mass communications and political science, and advances a reasonably convincingly new model called \\"cascading activation\\" to define the media's impact on foreign policy operations. In the process, Entman also supplies some enlightening historical research on rarely-considered events, like the Soviets shooting down a Korean passenger plane in 1983 and the completely different media response to a similar 1988 event in which the Americans shot down an Iranian passenger plane, plus in-depth research into how the American media presented small-scale 1980s military operations in Grenada, Libya, and Panama. Then, of course, there are the matters of 9/11 and the Iraq War, in which the behavior of the media has been far more complex, and less directionally skewed, than pundits would have you believe.Entman convincingly argues his emerging theory of an interactive, multi-directional relationship among presidential administrations, policy elites, the media, and the public. Important conclusions include how politicians who claim to be supporting public opinion rarely know what that public opinion really is, and that \\"public opinion\\" itself should be more accurately labeled \\"polling opinion\\" which is simplistic and inaccurate by definition. Ultimately, we find that it is impossible to delineate a one-way relationship among media, public opinion, and policymakers, and that the media are less likely to push an ideological agenda than they are to over-emphasize simplistic jingoism and underplay cases of nuance and ambiguity. So while the media are not completely innocent in affecting public opinion, and therefore policy, neither are they more guilty of bias than all the other parties in the equation. So if you care enough about these issues to seek knowledge on how media discourse really operates, don't listen to simple-minded and opinionated pundits. Unlike those clowns, Entman and his colleagues know what they're talking about.

It's almost like a frog magazine that has short articles on various species.If you're interested in owning a frog but don't yet know much about any species, you'll enjoy the brief explanations of the various types of frogs and their housing requirements. The profiles of species span nearly half of the book's length, offering many choices for future frog owners.Unfortunately, if you already have frogs or are already decided on what species you want to own, this book doesn't have the detailed care information you'll want and need in order to properly care for your pet(s). As the author states, \\"This slim volume is by no means the end-all . . . so you may want to locate and purchase additional . . . material on the frog or toad that you own\\" (p. 40). As an example, there were less than two dozen lines about both of the species of frogs I have, combined, and it was all basic. It's important for purchasers to realize this book is not all-inclusive, unlike the back cover copy above claims.While this book is an excellent, fun, and educational overview for those interested in frogs in general, it isn't a book suited to those who need species-specific care information. For that, you may have more luck by searching the Internet for fan sites and mailing lists.

It is a pity though that Virgil Hancock just doesn't manage to do the area justice. Of the fifty-two photos in the book so many of them seem to lack a focal point (or maybe they are just poorly cropped?) so that the book, I feel, is no more than a collection of ordinary photos.As the area is so kind to photographers there are some images here that are just super with good compositions, cropping and color, for example, two store fronts in Las Vegas, NM (plate four) a chained tree stump on a trailer (plate thirty-five) or the Jungle bar in Phoenix, AZ (plate forty-one) there are at least another five or so but I feel they were let down by their cropping.I can recommend these three photo books of the Southwest, Wim Wenders 'Written in the West' (ISBN 3823854690) Troy Paiva's 'Lost America' (ISBN 076031490X) with plenty of stunning night-time photos, presented unfortunately in a rather mediocre designed book and Gerd Kittel's 'Southwest USA' (ISBN 0500541213) eighty beautiful photos shown in a lovely classic photo-book format.One final point about 'Open Range and Parking Lots' concerns the production, none of the photos have their captions with the image, you have to constantly turn to the back caption page to read them and the page numbering is just plain silly. The first printed number that appears is four, sixteen pages from the start of the book, the five photos that are on these pages are referred on the back caption page as 'N.b. Plates 1-5 appear on pages iii-xvi', predictably there are no Roman numerals on any of these sixteen pages. As I said the numbering is just plain silly!"},{"Title":"Open Range and Parking Lots: Southwest Photographs (University of Arizona Southwest Center series)","review":"This is a great book, highly recommended.

A woman was the victim of an imbroglio in the past and abandoned her daughter. This woman comes back and the daughter ignores her relation to her. She is brought back into societry by the daughter's husband who knows the truth but does not want his wife to know it. But there is some kind of malediction that flies over the heads of these women. The daughter nearly does the same mistake as her mother but she is saved by her mother who accepts to be tainted in her daughter's place. Bus Oscar Wilde must think there is some kind of reward for a good deed and all is well that ends well, and this play has a happy ending. In spite of all the melodramatic sentimentalese atmosphere, Oscar Wilde definitely explores in this play the great disadvantage of a woman in society. Men can do nearly all they want. Women are extremely limited and have to walk a very straight and narrow line. Oscar Wilde seems to be ahead of his time as for the fate of women: he seems to aspire for real equality for them, though he shows in all possible ways that this is impossible in his society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","review":"My first experience reading Oscar Wilde... and certainly not my last.Wilde's sardonic wit and ineffable satire had me enchanted from page one.

It is said that he is one of the more oft-quoted authors in the English language, and I now understand why.In addition to axioms and aphorisms of pure genius, the plot both captivates and surprises the reader.

It's a comedy of society manners and morals with acerbic repartees and funny quips, in the great Oscar Wilde tradition.Now, more than 100 years later, it still has a thought provoking depth which is very much applicable to today's society as well, although we view such adventures with less criticism and more understanding.A wonderful comedy with all the wryness of Wilde."},{"Title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","review":"I just wanted to say that i really love this play and that i highly suggest that everyone should read this funny and witty masterpiece.

The text is black & white (no color) with many line drawings and charts, but few photographs.This is a career-capping book for Dr. Lymon Reese who has taught geotechnical engineering at the University of Texas for nearly half a century. This is the best current reference for laterally-loaded piles, and is therefore highly recommended to consulting geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists.[...]."},{"Title":"Single Piles and Pile Groups Under Lateral Loading","review":"This book is full of typos (even on the back cover) that make it hard to follow in places. This combined with its arrangement leaves the reader frustrated.I found myself extremely dissatisfied when using the methods outlined in this book to find the ultimate lateral capacity of a pile. If it wasn't for online papers and discussions this book would be too difficult to use in professional practice.It does cover a vast array of topics on this subject where no one else does. A supplement with examples would be all it would take to make this text gold."},{"Title":"The Schoolmaster and Other Stories (Tales of Chekhov)","review":"The Schoolmaster And Other Stories by Anton Chekhov. Published by MobileReference (mobi).There are no better short stories than those of Anton Chekov. He wrote characterizations that resonate across the years and across cultures. Chekov takes you deep into these people's lives and struggles so that the reader feels a very definite strong connection with these characters that populate pre-revolutionary Russia. Short on plot and yet each story is satisfying and memorable. Some are masterpieces of the short story form.Excellent translation and stories that you can read and enjoy again and again for years. You can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"Standing in line at the Lincoln Memorial, a book beckoned to me that I previously hadn't seen before. The face of Frederick Douglas grabbed my attention; a man that I've respected for many years, encountering him mainly through my study of Abraham Lincoln. On the spur of the moment, I snatched up a copy of &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot;, and within a few days, my admiration in Frederick Douglass was transformed from interest to awe.Frederick Douglass orginially penned his book as a response to people's accusations that someone as articulate and composed as he couldn't possibly be a former slave. With that goal in mind, Douglass wrote his memoirs, in a straight forward, powerful way. In the book, he painfully and honestly documents the path his early life took; the memories of being owned, how slaves coped during these times, and how he managed to pull himself out of it all.While Douglass' life in itself is amazing, (as he describes the amazing process he undertook to learn how to read), what amazed me even more are Douglass' discourses that he sprinkles through the book, discussing relevant issues during the time. In one instance, he addresses the concern about why slaves simply didn't run away from their oppressive situations. It's almost as if you can actually hear the people talking to Douglass and he responding to them.This book does not only tell the tale of a truly amazing American, but gives us a unique insight to the times. This book should be required reading in every high school in this country."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"Having read a biography of Douglass many years ago, I thought I knew his story. Hearing through his pen was an entirely different matter. What a master of the language and insighful set of observations on human nature.I am a man of many words, but words fail me in my endorsement of this book. The letter to his former master in the appendix is worth the price of the book by itself."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"My Bondage and My Freedom, one of Douglass' several autobiographies, a very important book that should be read by anyone interested in United States history generally, or the crucial and often tragic role race has played in that history. Douglass, a former slave, was one of the few African-Americans who achieved prominence in the largely white, new england abolition movement. Douglass was an eloquent writer and (by historical accounts) speaker. His recounting of his experience as a slave, and his reflections on his role as a black former slave in America, are powerful."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"Historians often call the Civil War the first modern war, a precursor to the great battlefield slaughterhouses of the twentieth century. Frederick Douglass shows that America was also first to invent the totalitarian police state. It's hard to believe Stalin didn't have MY BONDAGE AND MY FREEDOM prominently positioned on his bookshelf for frequent consultation because the Soviet system of oppression had so much in common with the system of oppression in the American South. The only significant difference was that, in the Soviet system, absolute power was vested in Stalin; in the American system, absolute power was vested in each slavemaster. Each slavemaster was, in essence, a little Stalin, with life and death power over his slave property.The slave system rigorously withheld news and information from slaves. A slave often would not know his father or even his own date of birth. He could not lawfully learn to read. He could not travel without written authorization. He could not associate freely with other slaves. He could not safely trust anyone or confide his private thoughts to anyone because planted informers were so numerous. Slaves had to avoid even certain thoughts for fear the slavemaster would see in their facial expressions what was in their minds.Disguised slave catchers would sometimes help and encourage a slave to escape, only to capture him for the reward. The slavemaster demanded and enforced absolute, immediate, and unquestioned subservience through fear, a liberal use of the lash and the constant threat of transferring a recalcitrant slave to an even harsher labor camp in the deep South.Yet MY BONDAGE AND MY FREEDOM is by no means a depressing book, thanks to Douglass' irrepressible courage, wit, spirit and good luck when he most needed it. There are even a few intentionally hilarious moments, which I won't give away in this review.To avoid capture after his escape to the North, Douglass used the fees from his speeches in Great Britain and royalties from his book sales to legally buy his own freedom from his Maryland owner.The book covers a period of American history I knew little about, the period between the War of 1812 and the Civil War. I didn't know, for example, that the abolition movement early in that period favored secession from the United States on the belief that the Constitution favored the South and backed to the hilt the slave system. An excellent recent book that supports that view is SLAVERY'S CONSTITUTION by David Waldstreicher.Even though Douglass was a religious, believing Christian, he leveled his most scathing criticism at the way Southerners used Christianity to justify and advance the slave system. He often noted that the cruelest slave masters were also credited as the most religious members of their communities. Some of the worst even had \\"Rev.\\" attached to their names. The only slavemaster Douglass credited with relative decency and kindness also happened to be an atheist."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"I have to be honest, I never knew that Frederick Douglass published another volume of his autobiography. I foolishly believed that A Narrative in the Life of Frederick Douglass was his only book regarding is life as a slave and his life as a free man. I was so wrong. Sometimes I wonder how many other people still believe as I once did...My Bondage and My Freedom is an exceptional example of auto-biographical writing. Douglass' mastery of the English language is superb! In reading his story and the way he's able to describe his past as a young boy, raised by his grandmother and then sent to begin working, with little knowledge beforehand that he was in fact a slave was so eye-opening. I had no idea that some children, raised during this time were actually allowed to be child for a few precious years before they were introduced to the vile world of slavery.This book give such a detailed account of a man's struggle to unleash the genius kept constrained by the world into which he was born and raised, is just amazing. I'm still astounded by him even though it's been some time since I finished the book. While a majority of the book describes his life as a young boy and slave (told in the My Bondage section), the rest of the book (My Freedom) tells of his life after he escaped from slavery, his experiences given lectures against slavery, his time abroad in other countries where he was treated as a human being and not as a piece of property and then of his struggles to create and manage his own newspaper once he returns to the United States.The appendix is also a treasure, as it reprints many of his speeches and lectures on the injustice against humanity that was the slavery system. A Narrative in the Life of Frederick Douglass is one of my all time favorite books and I find that My Bondage and My Freedom is definitely a worthy companion, especially if you are looking for a deeper understanding of the life of Frederick Douglass.One thing that was missing and that I would love to come across one day, is his writing on his actual escape from slavery, as it is never fully explained in this book. As a reader you only know that he planned it and obviously executed his daring escape with help from others. That would really be a treat..."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"Douglass's second, and lengthier, narrative fills in many of the gaps left in his first autobiography: we learn about his mother, his siblings, and more details about his psychological transformation from brute to man. It's quite insightful, as Douglass is careful to relate each of his personal experiences to the innate evil of the peculiar instituition, for both the slave and the slave holder."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"An amazing account by an incredible person. No need to elaborate on others' reviews of the book itself.However, the Kindle edition is missing hymns, poems, and songs that Douglass quoted (for example, see section [141] quoting the poet Whittier, and the \\"juba\\" song example after section [195]... compare with a paper edition or the e-book on Google books). I started noticing this half-way through the Kindle book, so I don't know what else is missing that I already passed over. I guess I can't complain too much given that the Kindle version is free, but readers should know that it is not a complete version of the book."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"I downloaded this to my kindle only because I knew the name from reading about Abraham Lincoln and thought it might be interesting.It went beyond interesting and into the realm of unforgetable.Why wasn't/isn't this book required reading in school?There's not a lot to say, it's a free download for your kindle.. Do it and you'll not regret it."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"THIS BOOK IS POWERFUL, ITS SHOCKING, AND IT IS ASPIRING. THERE IS NOTHING ON CHANNEL 11 THAT BRINGS THE HONEST, INSIGHTFUL, VERY REAL ACCOUNT THAT MR.DOUGLASS DOES IN HIS BOOK. FROM SLAVE TO FREE-MAN, THIS IS TRUELY AN AMERICAN SUCCESS. SKIP THE INTRO, AND JUMP INTO IT."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"After reading this book on my Kindle, I could not sleep. I felt uneasy as to know what my great, great, great, great grandmother, or grandfather lived through. The book was written by Fredrick Bailey, who changed his name to Fredrick Douglas. I saw everything through his eyes, felt everything he felt as if it was me, I could not put this book down. I felt anguish, disgust, hurt, and despair to know first hand what happen to a slave, then a free man, not a made up actor in a book. I also felt vindicated once he was free I felt free, I am glad that the pursuit of an education was his priority or else we could not have read this from his words to describe something that we can never imagine, see, or describe. The evil that existed, were inhumane, but the legacy Fredrick Douglas has left let us know that GOD, wisdom, and the pursuit of education can make us all free, I would give this book a thousand stars, for the clarity, and non-fiction in the book, and to give us insight to not what only took place in Maryland, but to also describe the deep Southern States. I celebrate Fredrick Douglas for his Knowlegde, because he knew one day we would read his story."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"What are your impressions of Frederick Douglass? What would you say about Douglass observation that &quot;conscience cannot stand much violence? Do you think it was possible to be a good slave owner?Why or why not? Why does Douglass view slaveholders as well as slaves as victims of slavery? Why is education incompatible with slavery? Why do you think the white children's attitude toward slavery is different from that of their parents? How would you describe Douglass attitude towards Mrs. Auld?"},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"I cannot convey how highly I regard this book. My only regret is that I hadn't discovered it earlier. It may sound strange, but this book reminds me of the Bible in that it is narrative with moral commentary. He describes his life as a slave and intersperses it with the thoughts he had at the time and the thoughts he had currently as an adult after an accumulation of knowledge.The narrative is often intense. You feel for him and for what he sees. When he is hurt, you feel hurt; when he's angry, you feel angry; when he is hopeful, you feel his hope. You share his longing to escape and are disappointed when his attempts are thwarted. I often got choked up in parts of this book. While some of his slave masters were better than others, there are really no decent white people in the first 21 chapters. When he meets the abolitionists and visits Europe, decent white people show up and you can feel his (and even your) estimation of white people go up.This book often epitomizes the struggle between good and evil. The white slave masters represent conniving and tyrannical evil and our protagonist represents the good man, highly ethical and faithful to his dreams of overcoming oppression. I often could see ideas that would later show up in Martin Luther Kings writings and speeches. His experience of white people in Europe reminded me of Malcolm X's experience of white Muslims; in both cases their opinion of white people were elevated. One of the biggest surprises of this book was Douglass' humor. Often when I saw pictures of him, he appeared very stoic; this was far from reality. He often indulges in humor and even poignant sarcasm. His sarcasm impressed me because it is so like my own. I laughed and smiled when he would attack racism sarcastically.One further thing I think is worth pointing out in this book is the portrayal of religion. I had often thought that people who wear their Christianity on their sleeve are usually the biggest frauds. I've been a Christian for 11 years and I have not changed that view. Frederick Douglass describes the slave owners that appeared to be the most religious as the most abusive. This did not surprise me. I have always been suspicious of Christians that go out of their way to make their faith apparent. This book proved what I have always thought about religious pretensions.This book was a blessing to read. I had a difficult time putting it down. I am now looking forward to reading a collection of his speeches."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"Frederick Douglass' life story deserves to be read by every person on this earth - but NOT in this edition unless you are comparing editions. Oddly enough, when I access the info on my Kindle, the info page says \\"not currently available.\\" Yet here it is for free on my computer Amazon...go figure. But this better edition is free as well!Beginning of the 1845 edition, titled Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, also available on Kindle:\\"I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot County, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it...I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday.\\"Beginning of this 1855 edition, titled My Bondage and My Freedom\\"In Talbot county, Eastern Shore, Maryland, near Easton, the county town of that county, there is a small district of country, thinly populated, and remarkable for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out, sandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general dilapidation of its farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless character of its inhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever.\\"In Garrison's introduction to the 1845 edition, several autobiographical writings by Douglass are mentioned. This one's not awful, but Douglass obviously changed his style significantly in this ten-year period and his approach to telling his life story, unless the editor has required changes...perhaps he tailored them to a changing readership as the conflict over slavery and possible secession grew more intense.I much prefer the directness of the 1845 edition - right into the story.You be the judge.Why doesn't Amazon separate reviews according to edition so that you can tell what edition is being reviewed? At least the titles here are different - but often that's not the case and you have to paw through lots of reviews to find one that actually reviews the edition, in addition to reviewing the work itself."},{"Title":"My Bondage and My Freedom (Dodo Press)","review":"Frederick Douglass' command of the English language and his emotional appeal to reason are at the highest levels in My Bondage and My Freedom. Frederick Douglass' account of his life as a slave is chilling and shocking. To think that such a cruel, dark and evil slave system could have existed in the land of the free is laughable if it were not so very true.

To you I warn that you should have a high level of concentration on reading and understanding his speech because it was written a long time ago when peoples speech was filled with what we would call grammatical errors(I.E. persons instead of people), which I find completely unnerving and losing my concentration on reading his great and insighful words that played a factor in interracial mingling."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"There are so many different aspects of cultural differences between America and the UK that one does not know where to start, however if you want to read one of the funniest collections of them, read this book.

An American married to a Brit herself, Walmsley has experienced first hand all the dichotomous behaviors seperating us from our former landlords. My favorite chapter focuses on our respective perceptions and reactions to Death. In this particular chapter, Walmsley hits her target like a SAS (or SEAL) sniper.This is not great literature, it is just simply plain fun as well as required reading for any true card carrying Anglophilic American patriot like myself.

Nor was it going to be a guide on how to help me live and work in Britain, as is my current goal. But, what is was was a very informative look on how people are perceived by Each other, and that in and of itself was valuable. Though I have a few good English friends in the states, and one of my very best friends is English, there is still a gulf between us on how we see the world. This book really illuminates how Americans see things, as opposed to how the English see things. I would have never have been aware of the fascination Americans have with cheating death, if I didn't read on how The English just accept it as a part of being human (as it should be). This book also made me realize that I am not so \\"American\\" in thought as I am in English thought, which is good news for me since I won't have to work so hard to bridge the gap between our cultures once I arrive in the UK.Overall, I think that if you want to know about how these two cultures clash and mingle, this is a very humorous and enlightening book that does the job.

One (USA) is a country of No Limits, No Rules, No Boundaries, and the other (Britain) is a country limited by unspoken rules, invisible lines and serpentine boundaries. Jane Walmsley skewers the two, with warmth and humor. If you're an American overseas, you'll see yourself AND you'll recognize your UK colleagues. And if you are an American planning to travel or do business in the UK, this book is an invaluable guide to exactly what IS and IS NOT going to interfere with getting the job done. This book is real, it's authentic, and it's a truly fun read. BUY NOW."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"GREAT book--I have bought copies for friends. It is a MUST for anyone visiting Britain. And for all my British friends too. Laughed literally until I cried and had to stop."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"This is a wonderful perspective of both Brits and Yanks and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"I cannot believe this book was actually published. This is THE MOST racist (if not entirely xenophobic) book I have EVER had the misfortune to read. I am so thankful that I myself didn't buy this book (it was bought as a present, and has since been swiftly returned to the store, good riddance) and therefore give money to this revolting, despicable American woman who obviously has serious issues with her British husband - of whom has probably divorced her since she wrote the book. Or maybe whom divorced her prior to her writing, hence why it is so morbidly bitter about the British.The book compares Americans in the 21st century with a view of the British in the 1950's. An entirely unfare account of the UK and all whom live in it.Brash, defamatory lies are spewn across the pages depicting Brits to be living in a repressed, behind-the-times, ugly nation of second-bests and losers. However, Americans are shown to be the most amazing creations in existence (how surprising that an American should have the utter audacity to believe such propaganda) with every page explaining their \\"magnificence\\" and how they are FAR superior to the British.When there ARE the very occasional compliments to the British way of life, these are then very quickly slapped around the face with a scandalous, condescending dig, and then noted how America is an APPARENTLY far more exceptional country...I cannot believe I actually wasted a few hours of my life reading this book. Please, for the sake of your time, money and humanity, do not buy or bother to read this book.I really think this print should be discontinued and a full apology written by the author to all readers on how misguided she was on both the supposedly backwards Brits and godsent Americans who can do no wrong....I would give this book 0 stars out of 5 if I could."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"This book by an American born woman who has been transplanted to Britain is a very enjoyable read. Her anecdotal style makes the information fun and fascinating, and her insights invaluable, though one must have a sense of humor about both cultures as she is very tongue-in-cheek. As opposed to most other books I've read on the subject that are almost strictly technical, Walmsley tells the readers in a very conversational style about many differences that wouldn't occur to most travelers - differences in attitude (about sex, gender issues, finance, etc.), values, customs, etiquette and habits; and she may sometimes touch a little on why the discrepencies exist.Because this is in no way a dictionary style book, she does not offer alternate words, phrases or technical info. Thus, as a supplement, I highly recommend &quot;Divided by a Common Language&quot; by Christopher Davies, who (as opposed to Walmsley) is a Brit who now lives in Florida.All in all - a humorous, anecdotal insight into two very different cultures. Even though this may not be as technical as some travelers would prefer, the information is crucial for developing a truer understanding than is offered in any travel guide, so do not pass it over for the latter; buy it as well."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"This book creases me up. As an angry young man growing up in England, it was fashionable to rage against the cultural imperialism of the folks with whom we share something of a common language but actually surprisingly little culture across the water. Now I thoroughly enjoy visiting the US and doing most of my business with Americans - and I put some of the fun and success I've had doing that down to this book. It was bought for me by an all-american gal with the words 'Hugh, read this if you want us get along!&quot; (by the way that's 'get along' not 'get on' - just one example of a potential pitfall for the unwary!). Thank you Marly - and I hereby pass on your commendation to anyone else who's trying to have business or personal relationship across the atlantic divide!"},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"As a Brit married to a Yank, I had to laugh at a few of the customer reviews below. Some people seemed to be very seriously expecting a guide about how to avoid horrible breaches of business etiquette. Just because it has 'Survival Guide' in the title..... lighten up!Admittedly, it probably is a little dated. I was given my treasured, tattered copy a number of years ago by an Anglophile Yank, and laughed my head off at the very accurate observations. I suddenly understood why my American friends thought I had a 'poor self-image' - they take all that self-depracating humor seriously!"},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"I've worked for a British-based company for fifteen years and was introduced to this book by my British colleague a number of years ago. We were working on a three year project involving Brits and Americans. We started each of our workshops by reading a chapter from this book. What a great ice-breaker and afterwards, we convened with a better understanding of our cultural differences. Since then, I own three copies of this book (always on loan and quite frayed around the edges)!"},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"This book has been updated and now reflects many modern cultural traits for comparison as well as new words to compare. It also compares attitudes to war and the Brit perception of the Amis' politics and vice versa.The section on the differences in British/American humor is particularly funny but the entire book is humorous. Tongue-in-cheek but all from those 'grains of truth' we often fail to see in our own cultures.I highly recommend it as a light read that'll make you smile in recognition and give you a few of those 'aha!' moments."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"This book is a humorous and mostly accurate comparison and contrast of the British and American cultures. It explores a wide array of the facets of our cultures, showing that George Bernard Shaw was right on the money when he said that the British and the Americans were two peoples divided by a common language.The major problem with this book is that it is dated. A lot of references to the politics and pop culture of the Eighties, including Margaret Thatcher, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the television shows &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot; and their characters and stars.Other than this, a good book to have if you are interested in the cultural differences one finds across the Atlantic, but I'm not sure how reliable a cultural guide it would be if you were to travel today."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"I was absolutely hooked by page 4. Working for a British controlled company in the southern United States, and also having a British boss, I was &quot;keen&quot; to have a better understanding of why there were so many disconnects in our communication.Between chortles and tears of laughter, I discovered the true understanding of why we are separated by a common language. Highly recommended - particularly for those who deal with the Yank / Brit equation on a regular basis. Thanks to this book I have a true appreciation (and now understanding) of those puzzled looks I receive on a daily basis!My boss needs to read it next!"},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"I'm an American living in the North West of England, and I happened upon this book in my local Barnes and Noble the night before my return flight to England. As I'm never very happy about having to return, I thought this book might be just the ticket for a quick, light and entertaining read to pass the time on the flight. This book turned out to be the perfect choice! I think people around me must have thought I was deranged, as I would burst out laughing every few minutes. Her take on Brits and Americans is right on target. The thing that made me laugh the most was the chapter on British home decorating taste, which more times than not is an oxymoron. Also the bit about Americans thinking that death is optional, while the Brits think it's inevitable, so why do anything to fight it? I highly recommend this to Americans living in the U.K., and Brits living in the U.S. What a great read!"},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"I recently moved to the UK and bought this book to &quot;prepare&quot; myself for the differences I knew I would experience. I found the book to be extremely out of date. For example, the book referenced the old American show Dynasty about 5 times. I showed it to a few of my British friends and we had a good laugh. Instead of sharing a laugh about our differences, we were laughing at the book. I'm sure it was good in the 80s."},{"Title":"Brit-Think, Ameri-Think: A Transatlantic Survival Guide","review":"I spent 2 years in England and of all the books and articles I read, Brit-Think, Ameri-Think was the most insightful about both American and British culture. Rather than just list a catalogue of different words and customs, the authors lay out 7 fundamental differences between the cultures that form and inform all the details that we notice. Now that I'm back in America I still think about what they had to say about American culture, and I chuckle."},{"Title":"Seduced: Two Celebrated Erotic Novels","review":"This book was horrible. It was long, drawn out and not at all entertaining. Don't buy it[...]!"},{"Title":"Seduced: Two Celebrated Erotic Novels","review":"There are two completely disparate novels contained in this publication. They are so different in both style and content that it is tough to believe that they were both written by the same person.The first novel is the story of a viriginal young woman that is forced to hire a detective to track down her errant younger sister. With only the missing girl's diary as a clue, the hardened detective leads the innocent young woman into an underground world of hedonists, ready to devour the naive girl. This book is passably written, the scenes are interesting but the characters are stock and hard to believe. The heroine sucumbs too quickly and begins performing unbelievably hard core feats with little encouragement or time to adjust. The book would have been more interesting if the author had spent more time on her &quot;fall from grace&quot;.The second book is the tale of Roman's senators wife and the debauchery that takes place when you through soliders, gladiators, vestal virgins and little conflict together. There are fewer sex scenes and very little description given in this book. Some of the sex scenes feel like they were gratuitously thrown in and almost disrupt the flow of the novel. I had trouble finishing the second half of the book.Overall, the first book was worth reading but the second is somewhat boring."},{"Title":"Seduced: Two Celebrated Erotic Novels","review":"A Book extremely erotic ans well scripted.

The story takes place in more or less modern day California and develops as Clara and Garnett read Ritas' secret diary....'Roman Orgy' is an almost 200 page book of Spartacus and Clodia, the wife of one of Romes' senators, Crassus. Yes we have slaves, gladiators, virgins, rape and deception. The seduction of Spartacus by Clodia must be one of the MOST erotic scenes EVER written!"},{"Title":"The Hay Day Country Market Cookbook","review":"The best thing about this cookbook is that the recipes are simple yet elegant. The fresher the ingredients, the better the turnout, of course. The book is divided by an introduction explaining the Hay Day story, breakfast or brunch items, appetizers, soups and breads, salads, main dish entrees, vegetable and grain dishes and desserts. One day this past summer, I made the green beans, tomatoes and pine nuts and I can't stop making them because they are so good. Our other favorites are the honey-mustard ham, BLT Pasta Salad, Peppered Tuna with Port and Pears and the Maryland Crabcakes (being from Baltimore, I can attest that these crabcakes are pretty authentic to what a crabcake is intended to be). The Belgian Chocolate Brownies are to die for. The recipes are not complicated and the ingredients are not hard to find.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hay Day Country Market Cookbook","review":"I heartily agree with all the reviews. This cookbook is wonderful.

Clearly, Hay Day was way ahead of their time! These recipes are still of-the-moment with lots of emphasis on fresh and lesser-used (although not at all uncommon) ingredients, seasonal cooking, vegetarian options, and healthful eating. And when you do want decadent, it's really good.I am an above average home cook with at least 30 cookbooks on my shelves, and I was delighted to find very useful tips in here that I hadn't read elsewhere. The authors write for a person interested in good, healthy food and home cooking, not restaurant-style extravaganzas or food as entertainment.I got the book out of our local library looking for a specific recipe and found so many things that tempted my palate that I devised the entire menu for a fall party from this book. Everything was delicious and relatively easy. I was delighted to have found a copy of this out-of-print edition at Amazon. You will find a lot of similar recipes elsewhere from Ina Garton, Martha Stewart, Silver Palate and the like, but I feel these are really solid and all compliment each other."},{"Title":"The Hay Day Country Market Cookbook","review":"One of the best I've used and I have a lot.

The book appears very unassuming, no high gloss pictures of finished entrees here. But there are some really creative recipes in this book (I never would have thought of encrusting beef with ground kona coffee!), and they all turn out amazing!

I had been very disappointed. Disorganised, lack of focus, bad writing skill, were phrases that regularly jumped out of my mind when I tried very hard to read it on. Content wise it is no different than the many trading books in the market that covers FA, TA, trading psychology...except the inclusion of Chapter 4 \\"The Trading Environment\\" and Chapter 5 \\"The Electronic Trading System\\" from page 57 to page 140 of this 205 page content book covering extensively about IT hardware and software, which to me, was simply a waste of time and paper that gave little or no value to readers/traders at all.In short, dont waste your hard earned money and valuable time on it. In case you want a compleat trading book, read \\"High Probability Trading\\" by Marcel Link and \\"Trend Following\\" by Michael Covel. In case you simply want to learn focusedly on trading psychology, \\"Beyond Greed and Fear: Understanding Behavioral Finance and the Psychology of Investing\\" by Hersh Shefrin and \\"The psychology of Finance by Lars Tvede\\" are much better choices."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"I have purchased a number of film guides over the years and the Time Out Film Guide is probably the best one that I have run across. As another reviewer has pointed out, the subject index alone makes the Guide worthwhile. Looking for films about UFOs or films about eunuchs? Check the subject index!In these days of digital cable, independent film channels, and the availability of less popular and foreign films for purchase over the internet,the Time Out Film Guide should prove to be a valuable tool. The Guide should satisfy those who like Hollywood blockbusters as well as those who enjoy &quot;obscure, third-world flicks&quot; (as another online reviewer of this book sneeringly refered to foreign films). A good film guide should review as many films as possible, both domestic and foreign, and direct you to other films that you might also enjoy. The reviews should both inform and, hopefully, entertain. The Time Out Film Guide fulfills these functions better than any other guide that I have encountered. Whether you like &quot;East of Eden&quot; or &quot;East Palace, West Palace&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; or &quot;Gonin&quot;, this is the one film guide to own."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"This book, released in 1993, lists a huge number of films with descriptions. Though the reviews could contain more information and less of the reviewers' personal opinions, they're still informative enough and give you a pretty good idea of what the films are about.The authors claim the book lists all the films available on the (UK) market at that time. It might well be true. I have found only one film that is not listed.What's not so great are the registers at the end of the book. Their really inefficient. Still, even as it is, the keyword register enabled me to find a few films which's titles I didn't know. However, the film databases on the Web possibly enable one to get same results with much less effort.I have really no idea how good this book is when compared to other film guides. But I have every reason to believe that the later issues of the same guide are better than this particular one. I haven't bought any, however, because this one is good enough for me.The book would definitely deserve five stars, if there weren't things like the Internet Movie Database.

For starters, I've been looking up favorite movies that I know extremely well. It seems like every 3rd or 4th review in this guide flat-out gives away either the film's ending or a crucial plot twist! Very strange, and completely bogus IMO. It leaves me confused and disgruntled.I thought I understood the English national character pretty well, but what's up with these London reviewers? Do their British readers really tolerate, much less appreciate, having the thrill of mystery and discovery just stolen away?As we all know, here in the US it's taboo to ruin the narrative surprise in any kind of review, unless one explicitly puts a \\"warning-- spoilers below!\\" comment in first. Obviously, I support this taboo, and for whatever reason, the Time Out film guide editors have decided to flout it. Their bizarre lack of sympathy for the reader's feelings is simply inappropriate IMO for a film guide, so I rate this work only 2 stars."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"This book was purchased to replace an older (different) movie review guide. It was highly recommended, and that was the reason I purchased it. Over time, there has been occasion to look up movies for background, obscure actors, etc. This book is a poor guide for movies. Many of the movies I looked up (Waterhole # 3 Comes to mind) was not even listed. The actor (James Colburn - star of Waterhole # 3) was not listed either. One of my favorite movies was \\"trashed\\" (The Sound of Music). This book reeks of elitism. This appears to make judgements on the reader based on a belittlement of their likes and dislikes.

It has an overall tone of snotty, over-intellectualized condescension that grates on the nerves. Plus, it delights in reviewing obscure, third-world flicks no-one's heard of, nor would want to see. It doesn't have a rating system, doesn't show availability in any format, doesn't show MPAA ratings, nor does it tell you where films are available for purchase or rent. In contrast, Maltin supplies all of these.

What this book is NOT. This book is NOT one of those volumes filled with 1-4 stars which rate each movie and let us know which is available on DVD. It is also NOT one of those volumes written by a cheesy, so-called critic who, simply because he's got good hair, is allowed to put thumbs up or down on movies and plays for your local tv station.What IS it? It is the 9th edition of a 1500+ page, soft-covered film guide written by more than 200 British film critics.&quot;Time Out,&quot; itself, is the best guide to what's playing and what's happening in London (and, more recently, New York City). This weekly magazine includes film reviews and the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; is the latest collection of those reviews.The movies are listed alphabetically, but at the end of the book we are treated to a list of &quot;Time Out's&quot; readers' top 100 favorites, obituaries for the year 1999-2000, and a section on how to find movies on the web. There are also 15 appendices grouping films by type. i.e. horror movies, musicals, swashbucklers, etc. And then, along with several other indexes, one that I've not seen in any other periodical or bound collection: it is a general subject index. Interested in finding a film that was adapted from the works of Bertolt Brecht or movies that feature the British Museum, a list of Israeli, Iranian or Indian films, or perhaps you need to find movies about child prodigies---this is your source.In all, 13,300 movies are reviewed, with very strong coverage of independents and international films. And it weighs less than my cat. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"This film guide is packed with witty, engaging and wonderfully analytical writing by some of London's most capable film critics. Each film is presented with a short, terse description (larger than those given by Halliwell/Walker and Maltin, but shorter than Ebert's for instance) written by one of over 200 contributors -- the good thing about having so many disparate voices is that readers are bound to find one or two with whom they really connect, those critics that share their preferences in more ways than not. My own favorite, for instance, is Geoff Andrew, one of the few critics I've seen that admires Malick's &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; for the masterpiece that it is.One thing that may put off some readers is the lack of star ratings given to certain films. This is not necessarily a bad thing since it forces readers to read the passages instead of relying on the short-hand rating that can't capture subtle nuances about a critic's opinion of a film.The book also has comprehensive indices where films are listed by actors, directors, genres, etc. Another bonus is the Critics and Readers poll results which lists the favorite 100 films of all time from both groups.There's no denying that this is a terffic book for casual flipping as well as serious research. It's surely a keeper!"},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"I don't want to criticize Leonard Maltin, who's a bright guy with good taste by and large; but this is the film book to buy if you have to buy only one. The English critics for Time Out cover a huge range, including work that has barely made it out of the festival circuit but which richly repays attention--Hou Hsiao Hsien's films, for example, the new Korean cinema, American indies like &quot;George Washington&quot; and the lesser-known Iranian offerings. There were odd omissions in the ninth edition--lots of mediocre Disney, usually overpraised, and nothing at all from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli; Hollywood treasures like &quot;The Good Fairy&quot; left out; but that's to be expected in any reference book. And the comments are sometimes a bit boosterish and sometimes a little churlish, but generally they're on the money. Compulsively readable, and essential next to the DVD player or digital cable."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"The market is awash with film guides but Time Out excels in bringing us concise, informative and often amusing reviews, in a dry British tone and from a fantastic range of films.

I would not recommend it for someone just looking for one all-purpose guide because it's fairly quirky. It spotlights fairly obscure actors or films (and not always good ones either--they feel obligated to highlight interesting weak films as well as strong ones), and its biases can take some getting used to, especially if you're not from the UK. (The editors' marked prejudices and beliefs about Americans are often hilarious, and only sometimes intentionally.) But the reviews are written with intelligence and care, and are never bland, and the series of lists at the back of the book (filmographies for various important directors and actors, and lists of films grouped around key themes) are very handy."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"Head and shoulders above all the other guides in the market containing informed reviewing in classic Time Out fashion.

Beware, not for the faint hearted as this book takes to task those weaned on quick reference film guides using dog bones/stars etc as rating systems."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"What sets this guide apart from the pack? The reviews are the reason. If you're not the type that needs some sort of rating system, such as stars, you should consider this guide. I recently replaced an ageing Maltin guide with this one -- I examined quite a number of guides before settling on the Time Out. Although Halliwell's is not bad, they sacrifice review space to lists of blurbs. The Time Out Guide provides the essential info, such as major credits and running time, and then you get a review that summarizes the plot and then provides criticism. Review lengths are based on the film's importance, so some reviews may be twice or even three times as long as others. The 10,000+ films that other guides will include won't be here for the simple reason that they are most likely not worth placing in a general film guide. So if you must have that sort of completeness, I would augment this guide with another (take your pick). Some reviewers think that this guide is snobbish -- well, no. It is clearly written by people who know film, and a glowing endorsement only accompanies a film that is well directed, written, photographed, and acted. They strive to point out each film's strong or weak points along those criteria; they may not always be successful, but they have hundreds of contributors. Others have found this guide Anglocentric; I have not, although I do believe it is much more complete than most guides in its inclusion of British film. Whether you agree with their assessment of a film or not, they are generally not far off the mark, and I would contend that most opinions they venture are the stuff of a lively discussion of film. All in all, a job well done. I reserve the fifth star to the guide that could outdo this one, once it is available. I could grouse about their unkind review of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, or their overkind review of &quot;The English Patient&quot;, but this is the sort of thing that comes with the turf. By the way, the print is tiny, so be forewarned."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"Of the various phonebook-sized film-review databases this is the one I prefer. The plusses are:1) the reviews are brief but usually actually say something useful & entertaining--for single-paragraph essays they pack a punch. There's a healthy leavening of wit (one reviewer refers to _The Good Earth_ as \\"The Lychees of Wrath\\"; another remarks that _Labyrinth_ is notably for \\"David Bowie's saddest ever haircut (no mean achievement)\\") but also some serious commentary, & the summaries are almost always accurate & don't reveal too much of the plot. Some of the pans are hilarious (I particularly appreciated the skilful demolition job on _Sammy and Rosie Get Laid_--I've seen it & everything they say is true)2) there are thoughtful one-page feature essays about various films, some of them reappraisals of famous films but others appreciations of undeservedly little-known ones.3) the credits are relatively full, listing (among other things) all major cast members & even the composer of the score.4) while its coverage is inevitably incomplete (especially of films before the 1970s) for the most part it's pretty thorough, with a fair bit of space devoted to foreign films & (inevitably) a lot of reviews of British films (though the coverage of these is by no means boosterish--there's no-one harder on British films than British film critics!).There are a few flaws, admittedly. The worst is that while the index of directors is pretty complete, the index of actors is woefully inadequate, as it only covers a very limited range of (star) actors. If you want to track down, say, films with Thelma Ritter or Esther Williams or William Bendix, you'll need a biographically-organized referencebook like Katz or Thomson. There are inevitable inconsistencies resulting from the book's being compiled by countless critics over many years: films may be referred to positively in one spot while panned in another, & sometimes it's pretty obvious the entry hasn't been updated since the film was reviewed upon its first release. Still, the inconsistencies are actually surprisingly rare--it's generally fairly reliable. Some of the omissions are a bit arbitrary--on a recent flipthrough I noted the absence of _My Neighbor Totoro_, _Pride of the Yankees_, a raft of Shirley Temple films, any version of _Treasure Island_ prior to the 1970s, &c.--but;, well, that's always going to happen with omnibus film guides."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"Combines a critical eye with a genuine love for movies. More typos than you can shake a stick at, plus some inexplicable omissions, but overall, far better than most of the nonsense review guides out there."},{"Title":"\\"Time Out\\" Film Guide","review":"When it comes to film guides, Time Out can't be beat. It is by far the most comprehensive guide on the shelves and has been handsomely repackaged to include &quot;cinefiles&quot; on landmark movies down through the years. It covers not only anglo but many foreign language films as well. While other guides tend to focus on American, Canadian and British productions, Time Out will help you find a broad range of Russian, Indian, French, German, Italian, and Japanese films as well. You will even find such esoteric titles as Freedom (Laisve) by Sarunas Bartas. Imagine that! It breaks the films down in the appendices by categories, making it easier to track down movies whose titles have eluded you. In addition, it has extensive actors and directors indices to further narrow your search. It not only includes past Oscar winners, but those of the British Academy, Cannes, Berlin and Venice as well. The short reviews are well written with an extensive list of contributors. There is even a guide to help you build the ultimate DVD collection.

The dialog is first-rate, funny patter. But along with the lighthearted moments are the fascinating vignettes of the people that they meet along the way. Like Peter and his friend, Phil, we are drawn into the lives of these brief aquaintances for a few hours, perhaps only minutes, and must continue the journey, never knowing what the rest of their life story will be.For this re-release, Mr. Beagle has added an afterward, telling what happened after he and Phil reached their destination, how their lives changed and how those changes affected their friendship. This addendum was particularly poignant since Mr. Beagle reflects on some unsettling post-journey developments with the insight and wisdom acquired in the succeeding 39 years."},{"Title":"I See by My Outfit: Cross-Country by Scooter, an Adventure","review":"I read this book back when it was new and I was very young, long before I knew Beagle by way of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;.

Yes, and it was done in the 1960s. Very literate reading. Smart articulate author. A bit deep at times, well beyond a travel narrative. A bit dated now, but never out of date completely. The challenge is still there and so are the small towns and the people who live in them day to day. This is the adventure. The people we meet."},{"Title":"I See by My Outfit: Cross-Country by Scooter, an Adventure","review":"This was a very good read. I love motorcycle riding and camping along the way and that's just what these guys did. Set in the mid 1960s on small Vespa style scooters, the author takes short, 50 to 150 mile, daily scoots from small town to small town meeting a lot of interesting people along the way. Today a trip from coast to coast might take 5 days but they spend weeks getting from New York City to Menlo Park in California. Any adventure rider should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"I See by My Outfit: Cross-Country by Scooter, an Adventure","review":"Great little autobiography of crosscountry trek on scooter BI [Before Interstates] Droll, charming, unforgettabale"},{"Title":"I See by My Outfit: Cross-Country by Scooter, an Adventure","review":"I first read the original version when I was in high school in the early 1970's. It was a memorable book for me then. It remains an extremely well-written story about touring America. It a story about adventuring, discovering the country, opening yourself up to real adventure and the kindness of strangers, and the love of motor scooters as a means of transport. The author and his friend rode the classic Heinkel Tourist scooters. It inspired my own dream of doing a cross country motor scooter tour. A few years after I read it, I hitched alone across the 2/3 of the nation; it was a similar positive and challenging experience. Otherwise that dream stayed dormant for decades. Fast forward to a few years ago - I bought an early edition of the book on Amazon and reread it. Wonderful - the story hadn't lost anything with time; a classic story about the optimism of youth and the 1960's. Now at 52, I purchased a 2007 Vespa GTS three months ago and I'm learning how to ride as a total beginner (with much more caution that I would have had at 18!). The dream is still alive...the back roads of America await.For a much more serious but equally interesting book about two-wheeled touring, I also recommend the 1970's classic \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\"."},{"Title":"I See by My Outfit: Cross-Country by Scooter, an Adventure","review":"Known mainly for his wonderful fantasy fiction, Peter Beagle here shows that he is simply a wonderful writer, period. Reading Beagle's grocery list would probably be more entertaining than reading most other writer's fictions. This book is hard to find, but is well worth tracking down.As with Beagle's best fiction work, this book is full of humanity and intimacy, as Beagle is never afraid to show the people underneath the bluster (himself included). Their hopes and fears are revealed for us as the trip progresses, quietly, in Beagle's simple but elegant prose. It's a road story, a travelogue, but more explicitly than most such books it's a story of the people making the trip and the brief but memorable touches they have on the lives of the people met during the journey.That's not to say the journey gets short shrift; indeed, travelling inexpensively by scooter gives Beagle and his friend a greater awareness of the scenery than enjoyed by the typical traveler, from the wide-open views offered by the scooters to sleeping on the ground. By the end of the story the scooters have emerged as characters in their own right -- at times difficult and reluctant and at times boon companions. Just like the travellers themselves."},{"Title":"I See by My Outfit: Cross-Country by Scooter, an Adventure","review":"\\"I see by my outfit that I am a cowboy;If you had an outfit, you could be a cowboy, too.\\" was the theme from \\"Laredo\\" which the two young men used as they set out on a real-life adventure of riding motor scooters from New York to San Francisco. Peter and his friend, Phil, in their early twenties decided it was time to spread their wings and see some of the American countryside, and how better to do it than to play \\"cowboy\\" on a scooters called Jenny and Couchette.They traveled that April through Scranton, Pennsylvania where they huddled in the cold in sleeping bags. They had a route planned out to take them through Cleveland, Ohio, Ann Arbor, Michigan; then, Indianapolis, St. Louis on to Kansas City. The street signs along the way help to keep the reader located on the layout of the land. They met strangers when they took rest stops who became friends, like the elderly couple in Boulder City.They were awed by the Rockies and the Grand Canyon, overcome a bit by the vast Mojave Desert stretching silently and mysterious as they rode in the dead of night -- to a small-scale diner. There they met Mary A. and Bryan who no doubt used them on their web site to make fun of them, as they do other un-knowing people; they are the original internet bullies. This was the trip they had been planning since they were four years old, and along the way the found the cowboy hats they would have worn back then.The adventures these young men had reminds you of John Steinbeck's TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY. From the desert, they moved on to Fresno and Menlo Park in San Francisco. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh, Peter lived in Paris and traveled in Italy, England and France. His first novel was A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE. He had a trio about his favorite animal: IMMORTAL UNICORN, THE LAST UNICORN and THE UNICORN SONATA. As a young writer, Peter was described as a 'genuine nonconformist brave enough to venture where others might fear to tread.\\" Apparently, even in his imagination, he had always been adventurous, to his detriment, if he by chance encountered that old hag in Dallas/Fort Worth whose hobby is to slander others."},{"Title":"Are You Somebody? The Life and Times of Nuala O'Faolain","review":"This is an interesting memoir. In part it's the story of how a wonderfully bright woman finds herself. It's also an overview of how Ireland came to grips with the modern world through such artists and writers as Ms. O'Faolin and others like her. There are some portions that seem unfulfilled. For instance, her home life was horrible, but she wasn't there for the brunt of it. Her peregrinations through alcohol and ill fated romances are painful, yet she keeps them distant. Nuala O'Faolin is an honest woman who lets us know clearly where she stands as an Irish woman, but the journey isn't so well lit. However, clear writing and commitment to truth make it worth reading."},{"Title":"Are You Somebody? The Life and Times of Nuala O'Faolain","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Nuola O'Faolain's memoir. My family is Irish. Many of her recollections regarding her family, her childhood, and her Catholic boarding school are similar to those of my mother's. Anyone who loves modern Irish literature and culture should read this book. She is brutally honest about her life. This book is not a sweet Irish memoir, nor is it Angela's Ashes."},{"Title":"Oscar and Jeannie","review":"This skinny volume takes place in one evening in Oscar's life, where he is just about to tear away from his old job and city into the fresh air and mountains of Colorado to be part of one of the world's most prestigious think tanks. His recent divorce and bachelorhood that leads him to a filthy apartment, no food in the fridge (or if there is it went rancid weeks ago). He has a 7-year-old daughter who wants to come and see him, sensing that he is leaving and is not going to say good bye to her. The first full chapter in the book is about a dreadful and very unusual climb up the stairs to his door. This climb is monumental throughout the rest of the story, but only in Oscar's head because the daughter is too young to even hint at what is really going on inside of him.The turn of phrase employed by Douglas Ord is very good, and one can tell that he is a writer verging upon greatness, but the book is very claustrophobic. To say much more about it would be to give the whole story away, but I absolutely hate it when a book is tied up in a beautiful ribbon with all of the problems solved and people discover that after 30 years of hating each other they are suddenly the best of friends. I think a lot of people like that sort of closure, but I prefer my endings to be a bit more ambiguous so that I can draw my own conclusions. And, in finishing Oscar and Jeanie, I have found myself wondering what happened after the last page was finished?As I stated before, it is a short book, one that could easily be finished in an afternoon and I do recommend it to people who can live with sparse action and who appreciate fine writing just for the art of it and don't need espionage, car wrecks or bombs happening every third page (maybe read some Dan Brown for that) and I am looking forward to reading Tommy's Farm, Mr. Ord's other book (which I believe was written before Oscar and Jeannie). You will have to hunt for it, but it is possible to find copies of both books with a little looking (neither will be in you local Barnes and Nobels). I found copies of both books on Amazon's MarketPlace (which isn't my favorite place to buy books, but sometimes, they have what you need!)

The novel then proceeds to fail its own hackneyed plot device, botching its attempt at conventional detective intrigue. The sense about half way through that the author has no clue where he's going is confirmed by the ludicrous events of the clumsily appended finale. Fortunately for Amidon, the book redeems itself with a precisely evoked desert atmosphere, a sensitive portrayal of human relationships fractured by alcohol abuse and some memorably surreal set pieces, including one involving a drunken widow and a killer cactus!

It traces Southeast Asia's environmental challenges through a treasure of engaging stories. In the narrative we meet all kinds of people - farmers, fishermen, indigenous leaders, eco tourism operators, loggers, government foresters, journalists, oil riggers. Woven tightly together with journalistic skill, their stories tell us much about the environmental crisis setting upon Southeast Asia.Thailand is a country I have lived in and know well. From the first page to the last, Fahn shows a profound understanding of the country, a respect for its special qualities, and a passion for preserving its environmental heritage."},{"Title":"A Land on Fire: The Environmental Consequences of the Southeast Asian Boom","review":"Fahn's personal anecdotes add color to his solid research about a country, its people and a culture he got to know well over many years. Personally, I thought it was refreshing to get information from someone who's actually been on the ground and seen a situation -- rather than from someone who draws their conclusions from someone else's study results. He includes info from a variety of sources, but not at the expense of first-hand knowledge. Also liked the way that he explained how he got some of his stories -- what a reporter has to do in a developing country, where corporate interests sometimes make it dangerous just to report on a problem."},{"Title":"A Land on Fire: The Environmental Consequences of the Southeast Asian Boom","review":"First of all, the title is misleading - this book is almost exclusively about Thailand (and its impact on neighbors). It does not cover insular Southeast Asia as well. Other than that, this is a great account of environmental politics in Thailand during the 1990s.

I was hooked from the first page. It is obvious that Mary Blue did her research not only into the many pantheons of mythology but also into the subtle nuances of the dieties. She played upon them brilliantly. When one reads the acknowledgements it becomes clear that the suffering endured by the heroine Hope has been Ms. Blue's suffering as well. The adventures are authentic and fun. I've never been to Sturgis but I can really imagine what it must be like. The book begins in another realm but comes to earth and covers the country from east to west with gorgeous detail all the way. The characters are people I am sure I know! Her artistry at exposing the fractured mundane aspects of the seemingly deified and then shining a light on the divinty in all of us is touching. I hope she is planning a sequel."},{"Title":"The Sleeping Stranger","review":"I was impressed enough with this book to use one of it's characters as my psuedonym. In this age of computerized living, that speaks volumes. The one thing I have heard time and again in regard to this book is that the reader was sorry it came to an end and I whole-heartedly agree. I lead a busy and often stress filled life and I found this book to be an oasis of adventure, a sacred space as well as a place to ponder deeply some of the truths that are 'hidden' in the text. I think it stands as a touchstone to modern spiritual thinking and I am quite certain that much of what Mary Blue has written about the after life will prove surprisingly true.

Some of his early work is both stiff and/or dated. His later work is very divisive due to some of his themes and opinions.

It is solid science fiction, telling the story of a group of extended families endowed with unusually long life. They find themselves persecuted by the rest of the population who mistakenly believe they hold the secret of immortality. Threatened with extinction, they take to the stars to find a new home. From that point we see some of why Heinlein is such a lauded writer. His descriptions of alien cultures are both plausible and intriguing while the aliens are thoroughly alien in nature and appearance. Also, this novel introduces one of the most interesting of all Heinlein's characters, Lazarus Long, who makes a stronger appearance in Time Enough For Love, and to a lesser degree in some of Heinlein's later novels. If you are interested in the works of the master, Methuselah's Children is a great starting point with a small investment, as it is a short book."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"\\"Methuselah's Children\\" by Robert Heinlein is a short early novel.

The result was a long term experiment to increase the human life span. Within a hundred years the experient had resulted in over 100,000 individuals who could reasonably expect to live two to three times as long as the average human.This group, known as the Howard Families, in honor of their benefactor, had long kept their existence secret. Now many of the group felt that the rest of humanity was ready to learn of their existence. They were wrong.As the Howards were being rounded up the eldest of the Families, Lazarus Long managed to escape.

Not only does it culminate the Future History series of stories, it also points the way toward a better understanding of Heinlein's later writings. Perhaps most importantly, this novel introduces us to Lazarus Long and other prominent members of the Howard family of long-timers. This story opens well after the fall of the First Prophet theocracy described in Revolt in 2100; democracy, liberty, and freedom once again mean something in America-at least until the populace learns of the existence of a large group of men and women with lifespans more than double the norm. Believing that the Howard families possess the secret of eternal life, the government takes action to seize all long-timers using any means necessary, including the abhorrent torture treatments made famous by the hated former theocracy. The embattled administrator of the country believes the Family trustee and representative Zach Barstow when he tells him that there is no secret to be had, that the lifespans of the family are determined by heredity. To the great fortune of all 100,000 long-lifers, the remarkable Lazarus Long decides to return to the Family fold he once left behind out of sheer boredom. His leadership results in the Family escaping earth and making their way out into space in search of a new home planet. Their travels are extensive, and their contact with other intelligent beings is as fascinating as it is intriguing-both culturally and scientifically. Heinlein puts a lot of science into his description of the ship's interstellar voyage and the means by which the people plan to survive for a journey of many light years. The colonists' interaction with the alien cultures they encounter is also delightfully original and compelling. The ending did not display a final blast of power, but it serves as a more than acceptable conclusion to events.I was most impressed by Heinlein's success at tying this novel in to the series of past Former History stories, going all the way back to Life-line and the genesis of the whole saga. A few characters who seemed unimportant earlier in the stories quickly became important actors in the drama, such as astronavigator Libby from the story \\"Misfit.\\" I have a much better appreciation of the earlier Future History stories after reading Methuselah's Children; things I saw as unimportant in earlier stories are now revealed in a whole new light and made inherently interesting. Lazarus Long, with his fierce independence, refusal to go around without his kilt (with his blaster concealed underneath), youthful old age, free spirit, and lust for activity or adventure is a singular character one cannot soon forget. His story is only begun in this novel, but it is something to behold from the very start.This novel is intriguing and entertaining on its own merits, but I would encourage you to read the preceding Future History stories first (which can be found in The Man Who Sold the Moon, The Green Hills of Earth, and Revolt in 2100). Without this background, you will miss completely some of the subtleties and references that make this novel extra special. Likewise, if you are going to read Heinlein's later novels such as Time For Love this book serves as necessary background reading. I see Methuselah's Children as the crucial intersection separating Heinlein's early stories and later novels, so it is incredibly important whichever way you look at it. The science is well told, oftentimes prophetic, and perfectly believable and the sociological speculation is thought-provoking, but this novel is first and foremost an engaging, thrilling read that no Heinlein or vintage science fiction fan should miss."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"Selective breeding and carefully planned marriages with subtle financial encouragement from a secretive group called the Howard Foundation carried out over the last 150 years have resulted in a group of humans that have the extraordinary trait of extreme longevity - Lazarus Long, the patriarch of the Family, born Woodrow Wilson Smith, carries his two hundred plus years quite well! When pressed for his true age, he's either not telling or he won't admit that he truly doesn't know himself! In 2125, a series of events result in the global administration and the remainder of earth's population discovering the Family's existence. A frenzy of enraged jealousy erupts as a maddened, frustrated world seeks to discover the secret fountain of youth they are convinced the Family is guarding for their own use. Hounded by the threat of murder, torture, brainwashing and ultimate extinction by their shorter lived neighbours, the Family flees earth on an untested starship. The discovery of two planets and alien races that pose threats and challenges even more imposing than those from which they fled plus an overwhelming loneliness for the way of life they left so far behind lead them back to earth for a second try.In Methuselah's Children, Heinlein has crafted an exciting novel, a message, a screenplay and the movie script all at once. Descriptive passages, while compelling and very cleverly written are sparse and infrequent and the plot is almost exclusively driven by razor-sharp dialogue. Heinlein's method of conveying the story through his characters' mouths has got wit; it's got dialect; it's got humour and intelligence; it's got sensible science; it's got humanity and it's got credibility. Their expressions and manner of speaking firmly place the origins of the story in the 1940s USA but somehow Heinlein has managed to inject enough charm to leave it timeless.For those like me that frequently read for the thrill, the entertainment and the pure joy of a story without looking for any subliminal message or morality tale, Methuselah's Children succeeds in spades. Hard sci-fi runs rampant through every page and fleshes out a superb story line - \\"refreshers\\" (think Star Trek's sonic showers), private space yachts, hydroponics used for mass food production, psychometrics (no doubt, first cousin to Asimov's famous \\"psycho-history\\"), extreme enhancement of longevity through selective breeding, elimination of national boundaries and the implementation of a global administration, inter-stellar travel at relativistic speeds, super-luminal warp travel \\"in the dark\\" reached with instantaneous acceleration, cryogenics and suspended animation for long-term space faring, lunar and Venerean colonies, orbital construction of spaceships, blasters, aliens, communication in an alien language, telepathy, high speed bio-engineering, and lots more. Although Heinlein didn't use the word \\"replicator\\", he may well have been sitting on the script team for a Star Trek episode when he had Lazarus order up a customized kilt:\\"He sat down in a sales booth and dialed the code for kilts. He let cloth designs flicker past in the screen while he ignored the persuasive voice of the catalogue until a pattern showed up which was distinctly unmilitary and not blue, whereupon he stopped the display and punched an order for his size. Ten minutes later he stuffed the proctor's kilt into the refuse hopper of the sales booth and left, nattily and loudly attired.\\"For those that wish to dig a little more deeply - don't despair - Heinlein has got much to say that will keep many a party conversation going on a variety of topics: the psychology and, oftentimes, fear of aging and death; mob psychology; prejudice and the abnormal fear of something that is different than we are; the importance of work, activity and a feeling of contributing as a part of the human condition.This book was more than exciting - it was fun and entertaining in the bargain!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"For those of you who already love Heinlein, this is the book that first introduces his engaging character, Lazarus Long.

Lazarus, who wears a kilt (but there's guns strapped to his thighs!) and can't remember how old he is, is descended from one of several families who, long ago, were bred for their health and longevity. Lazarus and his extended clan live very long lives -- so long that they must eventually fake their own deaths and take new identities so that others don't get suspicious about their supernatural abilities. This has become a problem, however, as technology in the United States has reached the point where people are identified by their DNA and it will soon be impossible to hide. So some of the family members are experimenting with a new plan; they're outing themselves -- telling their friends and neighbors about their longevity and hoping for a good response.Unfortunately, this has backfired. The government doesn't believe that genetics is the cause of their longevity; they think the families are hiding information and techniques that anyone could use to delay death, and they see this as treason. The families are now on the run. They plan to hijack a spaceship and escape the planet before they're all rounded up for examination. Then they'll cruise the universe, looking for some other world where they can live happily ever after.Methuselah's Children is short (7 hours on audio) and mildly entertaining. The book, originally published in 1941, has aged fairly well and deals with the topics of class warfare, civil liberties, personal property, privacy, freedom, and the need for meaningful work. Further features include some dull meetings, some aliens who remind us that humans are pretty weird, and a trite resolution to the whole affair. At the end I was left wanting to see more of Lazarus Long, and wondering if Heinlein has written any books for adults that don't include incest.Brilliance Audio's version was narrated by MacLeod Andrews. He has a really nice voice and, judging by his photo on the back of the audiobook (which I enjoyed looking at much more than I liked looking at the cheesy cover art for Methuselah's Children) I thought he looked too young to pull off a convincing 200 year old Lazarus Long. Wrong! He was really good.Originally posted at FanLit."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"Just started reading Heinlein recently - cannot get enough. This book elicits so many different emotions. Great read. And very pleased with digital version."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"Finally a \\"CLASSIC\\" that live up to the billing.I had grown weary of the same old trite - \\"You HAVE to read\\"s - that just didnt live up to the billing.Having read a lot of Larry Niven, and now starting on the Heinlein series', I think it is safe to guess Niven grew up on Heinlein, as I see some pretty serious similarities between Lazarus and Louis Wu, but since I have loved the Niven, it follows I loved the Heinlein.I may have been aided in this by expecting to be let down after slogging thru the endlessly repetitive Fantasy of David Eddings that folks seem to eat up like crazy - dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the Belgariad, but everything after that just seemed to be a remake of the same story.But Methuselah's Children was what I expect good old fashioned hard Sci-FI to be. Men of Earth head out to the stars - without all the mind-numbing complications and needless enumeration of every potentially adverse event taking place over the course of the story (Sorry Ben Bova - but you are the worst at this)The almost scary part of this is that he wrote it in the 1940's (www.fantastic fiction.co.uk credits this at 1941) making it so ridiculously ahead of its time as to be either laughable or scary.At any rate - if you like hard sci-fi that doesnt get all bogged down in its own clever attempts to beat you to death with boring science, but still rings true enough to buy into, AND still maintains a level of human involvement - give this one a spin. It isnt perfect, but it is just what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"The first appearance of this story dates back to 1941 as a serial in Astounding Science Fiction, and as such places this as one of Heinlein's very early works, and the first novel-length work that was part of his Future History. He revised and expanded the original considerably for the book publication that appeared in 1958, though without any basic change to the story structure. Like most of Heinlein's \`early period' works, the focus of this work is far more on action rather than long philosophical polemics, though there are certainly some comments and opinions expressed about prejudice, morality, mob psychology, and basic human nature and its incompatibility with being a \`kept pet' or eternal idlers.It also marks the first appearance of Woodrow Wilson Smith, better known as Lazarus Long, who at the start of this book is a mere 213 years old, a product of the Howard Family trust which sought to lengthen human life-spans through simple breeding choices. Lazarus is only a product of the third generation of this project, but through chance apparently has just the right genetic code to keep him young and healthy far longer than \`normal' people. The book starts in the year 2125, after the overthrow of the Prophet, and with a healthy 70 years of rule under the Covenant that has helped guarantee basic rights for everyone that was adopted after that overthrow, the Howard families feel that they can reveal just who they are and what their life expectancy is. This is a bad mistake, and the Howards quickly find themselves on the run from all those out to force the \`secret' of their long lives from them.The major portion of the first half of this novel is just what the Howards, Lazarus, and the head of the world government do about this situation, ending up in a \`con' job that effectively manages to swindle everyone in the world - a setup that is tailor made for Lazarus, the world's ultimate pragmatist, and he shines here as both hero and someone you wouldn't let in your front door - a characterization that continues to be fleshed out in several later books, most especially Time Enough for Love. The second half deals with a rather amazing jaunt to a couple of other stars, and what is found there just might cause you to end up with a few nightmares and with a need to curl up and think about just what the ultimate purpose of man is.This work is not as polished as his later material, with some dated slang (rare, but also something Heinlein almost totally eschewed in his later works), and characterization for anyone other than Lazarus is not as full bodied as would later be customary for him. The second half of the book doesn't have the same action quota as the first half, and there is a quite noticeable change in tone between the two halves. There's a lack of cohesion in theme between the two halves, almost as if Heinlein couldn't quite figure out where he was going with this book.However, this is fine example of just what Heinlein was capable of even this early in his career. The constant action helps hide some of its weaknesses, his science, as usual for him, was as accurate as possible given what was known at the time of writing, his predictions for scientific advances are solidly grounded and plausible (some of which have come true, some may still happen, and a few are way off the mark - but Heinlein's batting average in this area is far higher than almost any other sf author).For those new to Heinlein, this book would not be a bad place to start, though doing so without having read the prior books in the Future History (The Green Hills of Earth, The Man Who Sold the Moon, Revolt in 2100) will mean you'll miss a few of the references here. It's great advantage is its introduction to Lazarus, possibly the finest scoundrel to ever course the worlds of science fiction. Trust me, you'll like him (but hold on to your wallet).---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"Methuselah's Children (1958) is the fourth SF work in the Future History series. It was originally published as a serial within Astounding in 1941. It was later expanded to a full length novel.The Howard Foundation was established in the 1870s to lengthen the span of human life. Using well established breeding principles, young men and women with living grandparents were encouraged to marry each other. In 1875, the first child of the Howard Families was born.At first, they were just a bunch of people trying to improve the lifespan of the members. After a century or so, however, they were forced to start the Masquerade. Many members had grown too old, so ways were found to allow them seemingly to die and then to take on other identities.In this novel, Lazarus Long is a member of the Howard Families. He was born 1n 1912 with the name Woodrow Wilson Smith. Now he is 213 years old and the Eldest living member of the Families.Mary Sperling is also a member of the Howard Families. She was the Eldest until Lazarus reappeared.Zaccur Barstow is a member of the Howard Families. Zack is also the Speaker for the Howard Trustees.Andrew Jackson Libby is a member of the Howard Families. Andy was last seen in \\"Misfit\\" as the intuitive mathematician.Slayton Ford is the Federation Administer. He has the problem of the Howard Families dumped into his lap by the Council.In this story, Mary is leading an emergency meeting of the Family heads and things are looking bleak. When Lazarus complains about the long and wellknown review of facts before presenting new information, Mary gets him to admit his age. As the Eldest, Lazarus is now expected to moderate the meeting.Others point out the improbability of maintaining the Masquerade. Some members -- about ten percent of the group -- had voluntarily admitted their extended lifespan. Although the initial impact on the public was small, a sense of anger and disbelief has been growing exponentially.All present are impressed by the facts and calculations, but their voiced opinions are not very helpful. The members are undecided and unable to agree on any approach to the problem. Lazarus has them break up into like minded groups to work out better solutions and then adjourns the general meeting until the next morning. As he later admits to Mary, they are probably not going to agree on any workable approach.Mary is being pursued by Bork Vanning, the Minority Leader of the Federation Council. The next morning, Bork comes to press his suit. He mentions the Howard Families and states that the secret of longevity is close at hand for important officials and their wives. Mary then tells him that she is one of the victims of this witchhunt.Bork refuses to believe her until Lazarus steps into the conversation. Although his knife convinces Bork to leave, both Lazarus and Mary know he will send proctors to arrest Lazarus. They get out barely in time and take Mary's car out to kill time until dark.After some evasion, they reach the Families' Seat and Mary hurries to the sanctuary to send a message through the telepathic sensitives. She sends a recall to all sites run by the Howard Families. Then they hold another emergency meeting.During the meeting, many options are discussed. Leaving the planet is brought up, but dismissed since the only really habitable planet in the Solar System is Earth. Then Lazarus remembers the ship being built in orbit for the Second Centauri Expedition.Lazarus proposes that the New Frontiers be used to leave the System. He learns that Andy had not been involved in the design of the New Frontiers, so there are probably ways to increase the boast. But this proposal is tabled while other options are discussed.The meeting is interrupted by a call for Zack from the Federation Administrator. Ford now knows a lot about the Howard Families from captured members, including the location of the Families' Seat. But he doesn't think that the Families have a hidden secret of longevity.This tale takes the Howard Families into custody and then onto the New Frontiers and into interstellar space. Most of the group are very disgruntled by the whole affair. Yet there are few adventurous souls who are looking forward to the voyage.Lazarus Long is an anomaly. He was a third generation child in the longevity experiment called the Howard Families. Even so, his genes must have been exceptionally good. Few from that time would have lived more than a century.The New Frontiers is the second spaceship sent to the stars. The next installment in this series tells the story of the first starship -- the Vanguard -- inOrphans of the Sky.

That's the position I was in when I picked it up not a week ago. For people who like Lazarus Long, this is another novel full of his derring-do, with all of the usual trimmings. Unfortunately, the story didn't expand too much beyond those lines. There seems to be an indifference in the treating of the characters, especially in the case of Mary Sperling. While it still has that Heinlein touch, overall there seemed to be something lacking, an incompleteness. Still, the recognizable Heinlein touches are there, and it kept me interested throughout."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"Before you judge my review purely by the low rating please read my defense and reasons. First of all, if I was still a 13 year old boy this would have been very good, however, even then I would have been slightly disappointed by how much Heinlein has to offer and how little he actually develops in Methuselah's Children. I understand how important this novel is in the Future History works of Heinlein but sadly, as a stand-alone story, it falls woefully short of greatness.Summary (contains spoilers): Heinlein first wrote the story in 1941 before expanding it into a full-length novel in 1958. It traces the Howard Families, the product of a very old eugenics program to extend life, through the persona of Lazarus Long (a beloved character of Heinlein fans - whose life is explored in detail and length in the 1973 novel Time Enough for Love). The Howard families are persecuted on Earth since they are believed to possess a secret to longevity although its just selective breeding which results in living so long. They highjack a space ship and head for a distant planet. The creatures they meet are domestic animals to higher intelligences that want to make the new colonists subservient as well. They continue on to another planet of group mind creatures which can change plants and animals forms and tastes etc... So, they have a large meeting and with Lazarus Long's prodding they decide to go back to earth, now an easy three-month long task because of technological advances learned from the aliens.Pros: Heinlein fills this novel with fascinating ideas. The concept of domestic aliens (in some aspects more intelligent than humans) subservient to a greater intelligence - that's enough for an entire novel. The technology for a massive space ship that can hold a 100,000 people and the social ramifications that might follow, again, that's enough for an entire novel. A group mind alien civilization etc... The resolution of the novel, that humanity is somehow drawn to earth, is a powerful concept that many later writers explore in detail. Considering the time Heinlein wrote this story, the concepts are fresh, and fascinating. Lazarus Long is a great character as well: funny, likable, rakish, and morally upright. All this should make a great novel but -Cons: The bane of so many writers is that they think they can take twenty brilliant ideas and meld them flawlessly together into a coherent novel. Heinlein fails at this, essentially Methuselah's Children is multiple short stories pasted together with little connection besides \\"seven years went by.\\" What is worse is that when he comes to something interesting instead of having the characters discover it themselves, he writes a detached essay on the topic of group creatures, or seven years of space ship life etc... The characters are thus not actively involved in the action - this is a massive flaw, which halts forward movement and excitement. Most of this is due to the fact that Heinlein had a page limit but he could have easily just written more than one connected novels. Heinlein soon learns from this mistake with his next work, Starship Troopers, which is focused and crisp. Besides Lazarus Long, the characters are one dimensional and wimpy. Again, this is a feature of the time so it can be partially forgiven except that Heinlein DID succeed in making Lazarus's character. Why did he not put that skill to Mary Sperling? Or Captain King?Heinlein simply falls short. He offers so many interesting concepts that they overload and ultimately, make no deep impression on the reader. Many juvenile novels from the time explore a single technology, or social idea and make a story, I wish Heinlein had kept this in his original short story form."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"This book shows some of Heinlein's old brilliance but, like many of his books written in his older years, gets hung up on sex.

I read this book when I was young, and fell hard for Heinlein and his character, Lazarus Long. Although a shorter story than other LL stories, it doesn't take away the appeal of the story. A group of persecuted humans leave earth to find a better life, and eventually find their way home. Coming back and rereading the story after years is just that for me...finding my way home!"},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"I almost finished my third Heinlein book and it is quite satisfactory. I am bit curious how much different is this 'expanded' verion from the original published in 1941. It is always faxcinating to compare the fiction of these sf writers with reality decades later. Clark is usually credited with the concept of utilization of geosynchronous satellites but Heinlein mentions it in this book. Most likely it was added 1958, years after Clark mentioned it.Some reviewers provide a synapsis of the book - a useful thing but not necessarily a review. Does a real literature require evolving characters? I do not think so, Heinlein characters are surely exactly the same at the beignning of the book as at the conclusion.The scientific mumbo jumbo seems to me bit more realistic than what Mr. Spock used to say in the original Star Trek. I always admired the actors to keep their faces straight when they uttered the nonsensical lines. It is easier in the books, of course.I read somewhere about the three founding fathers of science fiction: Asimov, Clark and Heinlein. The first two seem to have a great tendency to get mystical and supernatural while Heinlein tries not too. Most positive characters are 'engineers' working with real stuff, sometimes impossible to describe in words.I really liked the concept of inadequacy of words to convey meaning of real phenomena. General theory of relativity is not too difficult to talk about, quantum mechanics is much more so (and rejected thus by Einstein). The current string theory is just not sutiable for verbal interpretation at all.Did Heinlein realized that in 1948? Even in 1958 it would have been a bit of accomplishment, I think.It is useful to read more than one review - it is impossible for me to rank them in the terms of 'usefullness'."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"I would like to review any KINDLE books by author Robert A.

They kept their existence secret. In the hope that society would be ready to accepts them, they started a limited exposure of themselves. Society refuses to believe that the Howard Families simply 'chose their ancestors wisely', instead insisting that they have developed a method to extend life. When the Howard Families fail to produce any such techniques, the Families are persecuted and interned. The Society's prosecutor, Prime Minister Slayton Ford, can visualize only two horrific solutions: mass execution or mass sterilization. A genocide in either case. Slayton Ford turns his wheels and assist the families in hijacking the colony star ship New Frontiers. To survive, the Howard Families must embark on an exodus to the stars. They invent light-hugging stardrive and land on two planets. In the first the meet humanoids, who are merely domestic animals belonging to the planet's true masters. In the second they find group mind race who are masters of genetic engineering. One of the Howard family members transposes herself to group in order to become immortal. But this horrifies the families because humans are what they are because they are individuals.

The events in \\"Methuselah's Children\\" take place after that war was over. The problem with Heinlein's early works is not lack of imagination, but too much of it in one story. This 1958 published book had 144 pages where all these events are packed in. The early juvenile Heinlein books all share common trait where the books try to mimic comic book action scenes. This leaves character development at the stage of 12 year old.Two (2) stars. The only character that is somewhat developed here, is Lazarus Long, the 200+ year old person, who takes the lead of the Howard family. But there are many, many interesting persons that we would have liked to know more about. Sadly, the speed of action is no substitute for lack of good characters."},{"Title":"Methuselah's Children","review":"I've heard a lot of good things about Heinlein, so I finally decided to read one of his novels. As someone approaching this novel with no prior experience with his works, I suspect that my review will be different to those by people already familiar with this author. And what I thought was that this was nothing special. To be honest, I found it quite boring. It was a struggle to read, especially during the middle.My copy of the book tells me this story was first published in 1958, and it definitely shows. I expect it would have been a good read for its time, but to me it seemed horribly outdated. I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief throughout the whole book. Major events in the plot rely on the assumption that certain technologies we have today don't exist 200 years from now. Reading this, I couldn't believe that Heinlein could conceive of a society in which aliens existed and spaceships could fly faster than the speed of light, and yet not even have genetic testing. The United Nations (or any) agreement on human rights seems to have been completely ignored as well. The existence of either of these things would have gone a long way to resolving the main plot, which sees long-lived humans persecuted in a Nazi-like fashion by the government for withholding the secret of longevity. Partly because of this, I found the main plot to be very frustrating, because it seemed so outlandish and unrealistic, particularly for a futuristic society which should have learnt its lesson from past events such as WWII. Instead, the book seems like it's set back in the 1940s or earlier, even earlier than it was actually published! I also don't see the logic at all in the government killing off the people they want to learn secrets from. Experimentation would make so much more sense!Another issue I found, reading this, was that the characters seemed to have very little individual personality. Here the plot was clearly first priority, and characterisation seemed to be sacrificed for its sake - a poor choice, in my opinion. Every character in the book used the same sort of dialogue - dry, serious, explanatory. I felt like I was reading a book about the lives of a group of physics teachers in lecture mode rather than diverse human beings. I found it a very dull read. Everyone was very polite, even in the most extreme situations. Again, I expect this was probably influenced by the era, since social norms have changed drastically since 1958, but I still found it to be a significant obstacle to my enjoyment of this book.In short, this wasn't for me. I'm hesitant to give Heinlein's books another try after this, despite the good comments I've heard. If all his books are this dry and unemotional, then I think I'll stick to more modern fare."},{"Title":"Christ and Apollo: The Dimensions of the Literary Imagination","review":"Originally published in 1960, Christ and Apollo: The Dimensions of Literary Imagination is a classic examination of the works of Greek dramatists, Dante, Shakespeare, Proust, Camus, Graham Greene, and other great writers in light of their gravitation toward two opposing tendencies. One aspect, symbolized by Apollo, is the tendency to desire escape from the finite real world and the human condition of embodiment. The other tendency is symbolized by Christ, and offers a glimpse of the infinite world. Christ and Apollo evaluates these traits with articulate philosophical reasoning, and educated author and literary critic William F. Lynch explains why he feels limitation and finitude is the great human good. An erudite and deeply thought out compendium, intended especially for advanced literature and philosophy students."},{"Title":"Japanese Just for Business/Study Guide/Reference Cards (Japanese Edition)","review":"Berlitz Essentials are comprehensive, self-teaching guides which provide beginning language students with a quick, practical, and simple approach to learning language for everyday situations.Traditional in approach, each guide includes a wide range of exercises and activities that utilize interesting dialogues and entertaining illustrations to provide a thorough introduction to the language within its cultural context."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"This short, sentimental composite portrait tugs at my heart with each reread, even though it was never my privilege to have a teacher like Chips. An instant &quot;classic&quot; when it first appeared in book form in America in 1934 (after serialization in the Atlantic Monthly), this unpretentious tale about a mild-mannered teacher charms us by its very simplicity of style and honesty of emotion. We snatch glimpses into the unremarkable life and becalmed career of a Master at a gracefully moldering English boys' school--and even into his more distinguished retirement.We celebrate Mr. Chipping's gradual metamorphosis from indifferent disciplinarian, average teacher, gentle eccentric, confirmed bachelor, glowing husband, fusty Acting Head--ultimately to achieve social distinction and honor: becoming a beloved institution in his own right. For despite decades of academic obscurity, Chips emerges as the representative of what is right and good about Brookfield. He becomes a living symbol of harmony between ancient ritual and &quot;modern&quot; methods and ideals.World events beyond the hallowed walls seek to touch and reshape the lives in this secluded school, which witnesses the ceaseless stream of future new boys, waring Masters and Heads. Yet all their strivings take back seat to the gentle dodderings of a witty, childless graybeard in a shabby robe, who prides himself on being the father of thousands of boys. This book is a light-hearted tale which will bring both tears and joy to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"James Hilton's work sometimes shows its age from the vantage point of sixty five years later. In the case of Lost Horizon, the story becomes a set piece, lost in its 1930s era assumptions. Random Harvest is rarely read, as its voice also seems better suited to BBC makeover dramas than poignant reading. Hilton's simple, sentimental story about an English school teacher, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, remains as unabashedly accessible as it must have been when it was written.The story recaps the professional life of a devoted teacher. But Mr. Chipping is not the &quot;to the ramparts&quot; crusader we see in our current movies of the week. Unlike Hard Times or the sloganeering of our current political debates, Goodbye, Mr. Chips is not a call for wholesale reform of an educational system. Instead, Hilton uses the Chipping character as a metaphor for the value of education in giving the student that most elusive of the commodities of civilization, a sense of proportion.The novel's style is magazine fiction in the best sense of the phrase. The story is propelled jauntily along, through flashbacks and ironic anecdote. Although the author's approach may be said to be sentimental, the construction of the plot and the direct yet subtle way in which the themes are driven home are quite appealing. Hilton wrote at the time that &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was written in a single burst, with little need for revision (a work of &quot;inspiration&quot;). The book does indeed read as though the author understood the potential in his story from the opening paragraph onward.Mr. Chips' schoolbound world is not a &quot;real world&quot; in many ways, and yet the novel retains a sense of warmth and reality that many schoolboy days books cannot sustain. Hilton squeezes into a brief novella gentle wit, a mild love story, and shrewd observations about the importance of a sense of permanence. In some ways, Mr. Chipping is a metaphor for the survival of English middle-class life in the wake of the first world war. We might also view Hilton's creation of Mr. Chipping in the late 1930s as an attempt to preserve the English middle-class sense of proportion and the rightness of things for a generation under the shadow of the impending war against fascism. Whether we take Goodbye, Mr. Chips as an extended metaphor, or merely as a crackling good read, we are drawn again and again to its quiet, direct story and simple message. In a time when we are rediscovering the virtues of simplicity, perhaps it is time we rediscovered the value of educators who pass our values through the generations. This English novel retains its relevance to contemporary people worldwide. Hilton's simplest novel may well be considered his best one. I highly recommend this slim volume."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"Goodbye Mr. Chips is a fun and easy book to read. The story is about old man who was a teacher for his whole life. He taught to three different generations of students, and made a long-lasting impression on his them and on his fellow teachers. Mr. Chips was not a remarkable teacher with new ideas or a special way of teaching. He had a great memory, and remembered names, faces and stories from his many years of teaching at Brookfield. His stories and the experiences he shared with his students made him popular and well liked. What makes the story particularly interesting is that it gives the reader the image of a person who had a full and successful life. It was a life with no regrets that most of us would want for ourselves. It is easy to read because there are no long and difficult words to look up in the dictionary, and the story flows with interesting events and stories. Not everything that happens in the story is happy, but that makes it more real and more believable. It is very easy to relate to Mr. Chips because he was popular for who he was and what he knew, and not for what he did. If he were famous or special, he would be harder to relate to. It shows that you can lead a fulfilling and successful life without needing to achieve something remarkable or special. This book is a book that can be enjoyed by children, young-adults, and adults."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"I marveled at this book, which passed my tests with flying colors. Mr. Chips was a delightful and subtle balance of a lovable, caring teacher and a mildly pathetic person...so real...so true to life. It's the story of an unfulfilled man who falls into his place in the world and grows to accept it as best he can, and becomes loved by others in the process.I found myself increasingly awed by the writer's style as the book proceeded. There was an extreme comfort in his flow, like he knew exactly what he wanted to say and how to say it. He was brief yet descriptive, sometimes so perfectly and marvelously descriptive that it really brought me hook, line and sinker into the world of his story - rare in a book, and especially in one so gentle and tender. It was no surprise for me to find he wrote the book in four days - this book was no hard labor of creation...this book flowed from his essence. I don't think a book can get much better than this. This is what writing is all about. I wish libraries were full of books of this quality."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"I read this book when I was in fifth or sixth grade when my mom recommended it to me, and now it's my turn to recommend this book to anyone.Goodbye, Mr. Chips outlines the bittersweet life of Mr. Chips, an ancient professor at an English school, Brookfield, from his first year as a schoolmaster to his dying day. As an old-fashioned, eccentric, British gentleman, his views are sometimes obsolete, but his gentle and kidding nature brings happiness and sadness into his life. An important figure in Brookfield, once a person gets to know Mr. Chips, he/she will never forget him. I know I never will."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"This is one of those books which immediately fall under the head of &quot;literary classics&quot;. Mind, dont go here looking for an amazing plot et al. You would not find it here - rather enter Hilton's world for the literature and its beauty. James Hilton, to my mind, presents a picture of a typical British author - laidback and rather understatemental. The pre-2nd W war years of British literature were good years - and there was a continuance of the literary traditions from Hardy and Eliot. The tale explores Mr Chips' life as a teacher in a typical British country setting. His romance - short but so very sweet - has been captured quite brilliantly. The changes in hin due to his married life have also been put forward - quite unobtrusively. I would put it down as an amzing book - provided you are attuned to such slow and engrossing books. This is a must-read for all literature lovers."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"This short little novel, which spawned two films, one with Robert Donat and the other with Peter O'Toole, was originally a story Hilton wrote in November of 1933 for the Christmas issue of the British Weekly. It found its way across the pond to the U.S. and the Atlantic Monthly and became a smash hit. It was repackaged as a novel and went on to great reviews and big sales. The story revolves around an 80-ish man, Charles Edward Chipping or Mr. Chips, nearing the end of his life and his recollections of his times, tribulations and triumphs at the Brookfield all boys prep school in England, from before the turn of the century to the 1930s. It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI. Sweet, charming, inoffensive and ultimately slight and forgettable. If you want something meatier and more substantive from Hilton, try \\"Lost Horizon,\\" a terrific tale of Shangri-La. This one is fine if you have an hour and a half to kill."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"The novel Goodbye Mr. Chips is a sweet and poignant tale about the life of a gentle, humorous teacher who loyally dedicated his lifetime and heart to the school that he loved, as well as the thousands of boys whose lives he influenced. It is a novel that speaks tenderly of old age without any mockery. This book causes one to stop and ponder all the good things in their own life."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"This story is understated yet full of heart. I love the original black and white Robert Donat (sp?) movie of this -- I saw it as a boy and was unusually touched by it; it has stuck vividly in my mind these last 30 years. I recently saw the much newer Peter O'Toole version, which was also good -- but the original movie was sublime and altogether more sophisticated. The author apparently wrote the story quickly and easily basing it to some degree on his own father. It was clearly written from the heart, the prose is simple and direct yet sensitive and thoroughly charming. A delight to read.The story contrasts the quiet, simplicity and order of an old English public school in the decades around the turn of the centuary (~1900). It touches on the Great War with typical British understatement. It describes the life of a school master until his death in old age...a lovely, but necessarily sad story. Quite beautiful.Another book, longer and a little more challenging from the same period and with a similar feel is \\"Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man\\" by Sigfried Sasson. Do not be put off by the title."},{"Title":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips (Bantam pathfinder editions)","review":"A small book when measured by words, but a great book when measured by impact.

He begins to warm up to his students, after falling in love and marrying Katherine, who brings him out of his shell.

I liked that it was easy to read and the story was nice, but there wasn't a whole lot to it. The main character lived his life mainly alone, except for the wife he had for a few years. He was old enough to be her father and they didn't seem compatible. She died during childbirth and after that he went back to being alone. He loved his job but towards the end of his career, he was almost forced to resign because his teaching style was old-fashioned. That is easy to understand since he had taught for over thirty years and he hadn't changed his style since his first year at Brookfield. He dies at an old age surrounded by his friends, and he thinks his life was for the most part fulfilled. Overall, it was an easy read but there wasn't a whole lot to it.

I loved the movie as a kid but the 1933 novelette was less impressive. \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\" is a sweet story based on a Victorian gentleman's childhood and a life spent teaching at an English public school through the First World War. The plot mirrors the times and traditions of such institutions both of which were based largely on class and its privileges. It's also about how one individual, Mr. Chips, changes with maturity and life experiences. In Mr. Chips' case his unlikely marriage to Katherine changes quite a bit about him. Katherine is a much younger, more intelligent, and compassionate person than Chips. She opens his view of the world. He begins to appreciate the boys' individuality, he allows his humor to show, and becomes more aware of the big picture. He becomes more human. Like I said it's a lovely and touching story, a pleasant way to while away a few hours.

I love boarding school stories, so I was interested in reading one from a teacher's point of view, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a short but powerful book, though I found it almost painfully sad at times. Mr. Chips is an average, even mediocre, teacher, and it was difficult to be faced with the combination of his mediocrity and personal tragedy. Of course, this also makes it very real. I'm just glad that he could reflect with satisfaction on his achievements in the end, and remember happy times without focusing on what was lost.

The effect is inspiring.Rereading the book after so many years I found it fresh and moving. Chips is the much beloved and in time legendary prep- school teacher. His story is told with grace and fluency. It is just a pleasure to read it. Perhaps one reason for this is the sympathetic attitude which the author creates towards the main character.Modest and somewhat distracted Chips whose beloved wife has died in childbirth and who spends most of his life on his own has at the end of the book recollection of the faces of hundreds of the students he has , who have as it were been his own 'children'.His devotion to his teaching and to his students is the central 'value' taught throughout the work.

The main character, Mr. Chipsevolves into a personable old man who gains substantialsympathy from the readership. This book is assigned in earlyhigh school because of its excellent presentation andinnocent themes. The main character represents an instructorwho teaches generations of boys in a local middle or high school. The setting is in Brookfield, England. There is aquaintness about the town, as well as the characters in thebook. The portal of time preceeded the 20th century whenteachers stayed in the same job and the same locale formultiple generations. With each passing generation, thegraduating students would reminisce about teachers withineach others' common domain of experience. Mr. Chips was acharacter not likely to be forgotten due to his longstandingpresence as a pedagogue to the many young students in Brookfield.Students would critique his memory and style of teachingyear after year. The main character suffered through adversitiesand celebrated better times. The work is memorable due to itsshear ordinariness. At times, the author shifts from thepresent tense verbal structures to the past tense withoutadequately preparing the reader. The general grammaticalthrust of the book is appropriate for the readership; namely,young people. The work foretells a time past; however,it's important for students to read literature from differentcenturies in order to gain an overall perspective on worldhistory and comparative styles of writing in the Englishlanguage and other languages. Contrast the character ofMr. Chips to that of Ebeneezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;by Charles Dickens. The character of Scrooge is far moresophisticated and worldly. The story is more involved witha complete evolution of the main character from a stingypennypincher to a generous patron of the local community.The authors are similar in that the storylines are centeredon a single character throughout a lifetime. These Englishauthors were marvelous storytellers. They escorted the readersthrough decades of experiences in the lives of the involvedcharacters.

The story is such a wonderful one (Old school teacher reminiscing about loves ones and events that influenced and changed his life), and I really do wish that more younger people (usually those under 20) could stop for a moment and enjoy the history of an ordinary life, without rejecting the whole concept as 'boring'. Disturbingly enough, I've heard the same word (boring) used to describe, \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" (the actual diaries of a Jewish girl hiding from the Nazis).

The story line overuses improbable happenstances to move the plot forward, but sub-genre fans will not care because the cast is solid especially the lead males whose friendship bonds starting with the birth of a newborn and solidified by their beliefs in God. Judith Miller in her solo debut (see Lights of Lowell series co-written with Tracie Peterson) opens her Freedom's Path series with an entertaining Americana saga.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"I am more a fan of contemporary fiction than historical fiction, simply because historical tends to cover the same subjects over and over again. First Dawn was refreshingly different. I had never heard anything on this topic covered in fiction before. There's no need to go into extensive character and plotting study since you can read that in the other reviews listed here. Suffice it to say, this book was an interesting read. It took a few chapters for me to get entrenched into the story, but once I did, I couldn't turn pages fast enough. I am anticipating more on this series and from this author."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"This is the first book in Judith Miller's Fredom Path series, set in Kansas, July 1877. After the Civil War ended, life was hard for the freed slaves. When William R. Hill, a white land purveyor, tells the members of the First Baptist Church about the wonders of the great Solomon Valley, the former slaves are excited at the prospects of being landowners. They purschase their land, sight unseen, load up what they can take with them, and set out for Nicodemus Kanss. Jarena Harban never believed the glowing description of the land given by Mr. Hill, but her father, Ezekiel, longs to be a landowner. Since her mother died, Jarena has helped raise her twin sisters, Grace and Truth. She can't refuse to go with them. Thomas Grayson, a man with a price on ihs head is traveling with the group, and Jarena is attracted to him, although her heart belongs to the man she left behind. When they reach Nicodemus, the weary travelers are shocked to find no town, no trees, no water. Nothing but scrubby brush, dry buffalo grass, miles of flat prairie, and winter is coming on.Dr. Samuel Bolyle, has never liked living in Kentucky. A transported northerner, he is disgusted by the way some of the whites treat their sharecroppers. He too falls for Mr. Hill's description and uproots his family, moving them to Hill City, which is close to Nicodemus, but reserved for whites. He finds a tiny ramshackled town and house waiting for them, not at all what he was led to expect.First Dawn is the story of a desperate group of people and their trust in a merciful God. I truly enjoyed this story of the Harban and Boyle families. Looking for more from this talented writer."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"Jarena Harban didn't want to leave Georgetown, Kentucky. The lure of owning land grasped her father's sense of hope, after many years as a slave, then sharecropper after the war. So Jarena and her two younger twin sisters, Truth and Grace, followed their father, Ezekiel, to a new town named Nicodemus in Kansas, along with other colored families in the community. Her beau, Charles Francis, stayed behind with a promise to reunite with her in Nicodemus.Mr. Hill sold them the land in Nicodemus, a community for colored people. He told them this land was abundant with dark rich soil, timber, wildlife...a paradise where they could get a new start in farming.He was also starting another town called Hill City, which was mainly for the whites. What the Harbans and other families found when they reached Nicodemus was shocking.Dr. Samuel Boyle also wanted to leave Georgetown and start anew in Hill City. He hated slavery and often spoke against it, which was a differing opinion than most of his neighbors.Dr. Boyle's family hated the thought of leaving the luxury and friends they enjoyed in Georgetown. Margaret, his wife, was born and raised in Georgetown. His son, Harvey, depended on the easy life he lived there. Macia, his daughter, loved her home, and her beau, Jackson Kincaid, whose family were slave owners who didn't relish the idea of colored people being equal.Thomas Grayson joined the community of Nicodemus. His past was a mystery to the people...especially Jarena. His living with the Harbans in Nicodemus, was very helpful to the family; however, when Charles arrives, a competition arises between the two for Jarena's heart.The lives of the Harbans and the Boyles become intertwined, as life is a struggle in different ways for the families. Both families through these struggles experience personal growth that changes their lives forever.The first book of the Freedom's Path series, First Dawn is a story of love, heartbreak, racial struggles, compassion, survival and murder. Judith Miller writes memorable characters that touch the heart of the reader."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"Eighteen-year-old Jarena Harban didn't want to leave Kentucky. Her father was a sharecropper, and by moving to Kansas, he saw an opportunity to own land and give his family a real future, but for Jarena, this was moving from the monster you knew to one you didn't know. When the Harbans and the other black settlers arrive in Kansas, the land is not as promised. There is no town, no settlement, only barren land. Winter is quickly approaching, and the settlers have no choice but to make do. With next to no money, no shelter, and no idea what to do next, Jarena and the others must fight to survive in their promised land.Thomas Grayson is on the run when he falls in with the Harbans. As he works with the Harbans to ready for the winter, Jarena catches his eye, but she has eyes for someone else. By the time Jarena notices Thomas, the men searching for him arrive in the neighboring town.My main complaint with many historical novels is that they sound and feel much like a contemporary novel in a historical setting. This was not an issue with FIRST DAWN. As I read FIRST DAWN, I was warped back in time to 1877 Kansas. Ms. Miller captured the dialect, culture, sights, smells and sounds of the time period expertly. The plot rolled smoothly and characters became real. I even found myself wanting to shake Jarena occasionally to get her to see Thomas. This is the first book by Judith Miller I have read, and definitely not my last.Reviewed by Deatri King-Beyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"Janette Oke was perhaps one of the first popular authors who brought the pioneers to the forefront of Christian fiction. Her characters were called to give up all security and to travel miles on uncomfortable, canvas-covered buckboard wagons with no hope of air-cushioned shocks; endure the roughest of climactic conditions with no thought of the comfort of micro-fleece; and stave off death with a fierce stubbornness.Judith Miller follows in this tradition with First Dawn, yet with a twist. The first book in the Freedom's Path series from Bethany House Publishers contrasts the life of two families who choose to pursue land settlement in Kansas: a doctor and his family who live a life of privilege in Georgetown, Kentucky, and the Harbans, a family of former slaves who dream of farming their own land.In the late 1800s, after the end of the Civil War and the freeing of the slaves, parts of the frontier states began courting former slaves to buy land and settle it for five dollars per homestead. The entrepreneurial dream of working for themselves coaxed many to travel hundreds of miles away from everything they'd ever known to help settle the west. Ezekiel Harban is such a man. Father to three daughters, he uproots the family and moves them from Kentucky to a new town being settled by Negroes: Nicodemus, Kansas, named for an African prince brought to America in chains and reportedly the first slave ever to buy his freedom.Contrast this with Yankee doctor Samuel Boyle who married a Southern belle and moved to Kentucky. Yet with his staunch convictions about black men being treated as equals, he's never found his niche in the South and decides to start a new practice in Hill City, Kansas, the white settlement in the Solomon Valley. And so this storyteller begins to weave her storytelling magic.Armchair Interviews says: Miller is a wonderful storyteller who unravels a fascinating part of history artfully and tastefully. The suspense is mild, but the story is a good one."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"There really IS a town called Nicodemus in Kansas, and Judith chose her solo series to begin that town's life and her people. The Haban family were some of the \\"Coloreds\\" who believed the lies of an infamous Mr. Hill and headed for their first taste of actually owning land. The group of freed slaves had been told the town already existed. It did not. They faced incredible hardships staying alive, let alone trying to start a town.Just a ways up the road, the town of Hill City was being settled by \\"White Folks\\" who had been lied to by the same Mr. Hill. A kind doctor brought his frail wife and family to this town to try to make a difference, he just thought there was more town and progress than actually existed.Based upon the location of the two towns and the interaction of the inhabitants of each, many side stories are starting to come to life. Jarena endears herself to the reader as does Dr. Boyle. Hardships cause real people to emerge from the shallowness of their former life. Some for better, many for worse.I finished book one yesterday and bought book 2 today. Thank you Judith."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"It was well written, the story flowed extremely well, and the historical aspects of the novel were interesting. I definitely recommend this author that is now writing her own novels."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"Through FIRST DAWN, you will gain a hint at what it was like to settle the plains of Kansas. The story has two predominate threads: you learn about the African American family Ezekiel Harban who travel to Nicodemus, Kansas full of hope and expectation. These former slaves have purchased land to begin a new life. They arrive and learn their expectations have been too high because there is nothing there. They are forced to rebuild their lives in a harsh situation.The second main story centers on Dr. Samuel Boyle who has uprooted his family from a comfortable life in Kentucky and moved them to the sister town of Hill City, Kansas. Dr. Boyle and his family become connected to the Harban family in this well-drawn historical.I fell in love with the characters and the historical setting because of the rich storytelling from Judith Miller. I highly recommend this first book in the Freedom's Path series."},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"Ms. Miller has woven a very descriptive tapestry of words that will place the reader directly into 1877's Kansas. As a result the reader is in for a treat as they follow the ups and downs of families trying to settle in the unforgiving plains with little to no experience, supplies, and at times, faith.This is actully the story of two families. One an African American family who is setting out to finally settle on their own after the end of slavery. This family of three daughters and one father are not the only ones that are trusting the words of one man leaving all that they know behind in order to settle a new town. Ezekiel and his daughters Jarena, Faith, and Truth are disappointed and dismayed when they arrive with the other families only to find open spaces, and no town plan, structures, or help. Jarena is having a serious problem with her faith in God and this will be a test of not only the settlers, but one of Faith as well.Doctor Samuel Boyle is a successful doctor in Kentucky but he wants more for his family. He decides to head west in order to be the doctor of the new settlement of Nicodemus, Kansas. His family is not in the beginning sharing his outlook or his plans but trust in God, that things will work out. This family though will soon see that there is more to life than wearing pretty dresses, and having beau's coming to call. Soon their lives will entwine with those who call Nicodemus home, their lives will never be the same again.Ms. Miller is truly a gifted storyteller as she manages thru words to bring to life the hardships of those early settlers. Her characters are \\"real\\" in the fact that they react as you would think a person would react in such strained circumstances. still the belief in faith is a strong portion of this story without being overbearing. Ms Hattie is a wonderful character and her faith is amazing! This is the first in \\"Freedoms Path\\" series and if this read is any indication, it's off to a great start.Official Reviewer for Romance Desings"},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"In the opening pages of FIRST DAWN, readers meet Jarena Harban, who, along with her family, is taking the adventure of a lifetime. A few years after the end of the Civil War, life in Georgetown, Kentucky wasn't easy but was familiar to the Harban family. As a former slave turned sharecropper, Ezekiel Harban meets William R. Hill and purchases a plot of land in Kansas. The simple purchase changes everything for this family. Ezekiel and his three daughters --- Jarena, Grace and Truth --- pack their belongings and move to the town of Nicodemus, Kansas.As this small group of travelers rides the train toward their new home, they have high expectations about the promised town and their plots of land. Then a guide takes the group in some wagons with their possessions to reach the town. Imagine the surprise on their faces when they arrive on the plains of Kansas full of hope yet find nothing. The buildings are \\"forthcoming\\" and any shops and supplies are miles from their land. The expectations of these African Americans are replaced with a determination to make a new life of freedom.As Judith Miller writes in one of the opening chapters:And Jarena's father drank up the information like a man dying of thirst. Her father was one of the first in line to hand over his life savings in exchange for four train tickets and a piece of paper. The paper was a deed declaring that he owned a piece of land in what he constantly reminded her was the freest and friendliest state for coloreds to settle: John Brown's former stomping grounds --- Kansas.Jarena gave her father a sidelong glance. \\"What are you going to do if Nicodemus isn't everything you expect?\\"\\"You gotta have faith, gal. You's too young to always be lookin' fer the worst in things. Trust the good Lord. We's on the right path.\\"\\"We'll see, Pappy. We'll see.\\"As you can see from the dialogue, it's told in the dialect of these former sharecroppers from Kentucky. Almost like reading Mark Twain's HUCKLEBERRY FINN, the experience is jarring at first until readers hook into the cadence and rhythm. But in the blink of an eye, that feeling soon disappears.During the story, Jarena becomes more than a caretaker for her family and discovers a romantic attraction to a young man named Thomas Grayson, who has joined the community. When Jarena's boyfriend from Kentucky, Charles Frances, arrives in Nicodemus, the story has some built-in tension between the characters.Beyond this story of the settlers of Nicodemus, Judith Miller starts a second strand in the storytelling involving the family of Dr. Samuel Boyle. Also living in Georgetown, Kentucky, Dr. Boyle is fed up with the racial prejudice in the south. When he meets William R. Hill, he also purchases land in Hill City, Kansas, or the sister city for Nicodemus. With unhappy feelings from his wife, high society daughter and rebellious son, Dr. Boyle uproots his family and moves them west.For a majority of the story, the lives of these two families intersect. Dr. Boyle hires Truth Harban to help with the domestic chores in their household as a live-in maid. Periodically Dr. Boyle goes to Nicodemus and treats the medical needs of this nearby community.Part of the elegance and beauty of historical fiction is how it transports the reader to another time period. Judith Miller has done a masterful job of capturing the mood, dialogue and setting of this period of history on the plains of Kansas. The rich characterizations and moving dialogue combine with a fascinating story of changed lives with a constant reliance on faith and trust in God. This combination provides the reader with a remarkable reading experience and something highly recommended.[...]"},{"Title":"First Dawn (Freedom's Path Series #1)","review":"If you like good writing, fully-drawn characters, nuanced story-telling, you won't like this book. Miller takes a premise that has the potential for being compelling and reduces it to platitudes. We never really learn how the pioneers in Nicodemus survived the winter, how the harshness and stress affected the families and communities. Dr. Boyle's bratty daughter and wastrel son are transformed into compassionate human beings simply by turning the page from one chapter to the next. I literally looked back to see if my book was missing a chapter! Where did these new personas come from? The air of Kansas? This book is too self-righteous for it's own good. The writing is simplistic at best. If you like GOOD books, don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters at Snowflake Camp (The Happy Hollisters, No. 6)","review":"It is increasingly difficult to find the Happy Hollisters series of books. There were 33 books in this series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970. This particular edition is the sixth book in the series, and was written in 1954.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens. Mr. Hollister runs a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. This time the mystery involves their teacher Miss Nelson and her brother Traver Nelson. When the Hollister children's school starts a pet club, the children notice that each time huskies or sled dogs are mentioned that Miss Nelson become sad. Eventually the children learn that Miss Nelson's brother is missing.The children also watch a television show where they glimpse their grandparents. In the same show they see a beautiful dog named Fluff fall during a sled race. Much later the children learn that Fluff belonged to Miss Nelson's brother. The children also learn that Fluff fell because someone deliberately caused Fluff to fall.After watching the show the children ask if they can travel to Canada to visit their grandparents at Snowflake Camp, which their grandparents operate. As happens so often in this series, events happen that allow the children to leave school during a big dog sled race near Thanksgiving. The Hollister family is able to stay at Snowflake Camp because of a last minute cancellation, which makes their trip more enjoyable since they are able to be close to their grandparents.While at Snowflake Camp the children learn that Traver Nelson's disappearance is a big mystery, and the same dog sled race in which Fluff fell is about to be held again. The puppies of the winning dog are highly valued by the Mounties, so winning the race is very important. But where is Traver? Two men are also looking for Traver, and the men appear to be untrustworthy.How will this mystery end? Will Traver be found? Will Fluff have a chance to redeem herself in the next dog sled race? What about the two sinister-looking men? Will they be thwarted in their attempts to steal Fluff? Will the Hollisters be able to overcome the difficulties thrown in their path and change these adversities to advantages? You will have to read this book to find out!While portions of this book were even more coincidental than usual, I enjoyed this book. There was a good mystery and I enjoyed the trip to Canada. Dog sled races are still held in Canada and the puppies of winning dogs are highly valued. Places like Snowflake Camp still exist. One portion of this story also features a one-room school house heated by coal. I believe that most or all one-room school houses are now gone, but there could still some in very isolated locations. With the interesting story and the continued relevance of the background in this story, this Happy Hollister book is a good read, particularly for younger children.One last word of caution. These books are becoming very difficult to find, and thus their price varies substantially. If you are interested in reading this series you may find editions without covers that sell for less than editions with covers.I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age."},{"Title":"The Modern Use of the Bible","review":"As a seminary student, I bought this book on recommendation from Peter Gomes--a brilliant theologian.

In short it details the history and philosophy of the National Park System. The book is not a coffee table book. It does have a lot of nice pictures and illustrations - mostly from photographers or painters who were among the first to visit Yellowstone, Yosemite, or the Grand Canyon with expeditions. Don't expect nice color photos from modern photographers. Instead you get lots of early black &amp; white photos along with paintings.The text covers the idea of national parks starting with lands reserved for the King of England. It traces American Transcendentalists who helped popularize the idea of nature. It also details some of the early expeditions into the West to explore areas that became U.S. National Parks. The book also summarizes Teddy Roosevelt's importance in setting aside lands. It should be noted that Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon make up the bulk of the material. There is very little on any of the other parks here. In addition the book ends in the early 20th century so there is little on how the Park Service evolved or conservation fights later.The book is a very good summary of how National Parks came to be for a general audience. If you are looking for a more meaty treatment of the subject look to &quot;National Parks: The American Experience&quot; by Alfred Runte. If you are looking for a general treatment with a lot of illustrations then this book may be what you are seeking.

Lee, who also coauthored the classic &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot; &quot;Night&quot; is inspired by the life and writings of Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), naturalist, political radical, and seminal American intellectual figure. The play was first performed in 1970.&quot;Night&quot; takes place during a night when Thoreau was jailed for an act of civil disobedience: he refused to pay a tax in defiance of the Polk administration's Mexican War. The action of the play consists of a series of interconnected, dreamlike scenes that explore Thoreau's life, ideals, and relationships. We see his theory of education, his strong opposition to slavery, his family ties, and, quite strikingly, his problematic yet enduring relationship with fellow American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. Particularly moving is Thoreau's encounter with an escaped slave.&quot;Night&quot; is a moving, even inspiring, play. Thoreau is celebrated as not merely a crucial thinker and a great man, but as a truly transcendent figure: a prophet whose voice continues to resound. Highly recommended for literature classes, reading groups, and individual readers."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"Henry David Thoreau may be experiencing a sort of revival as of late. His treatise on civil disobidience is a hallmark of progressive action today. Upset that his government declared an unjust war, Thoreau refuses to pay taxes to show his digust, which lands him one lauded night in jail. Thus is the basis for this extremely inventive, timely play \\"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail\\".Not just a night in jail, but a brave overview Thoreau's life ensues, showing snippets of his events, meetings, and philosophies that were so critical to the development of his transcendentalism. This isn't a dry biography, however. The authors weave a Thoreau that is a rich tapestry of thought and action. He is both endearing and complex, wise and unaware.We enter the play with Henry in his cell, and begins to relive some important moments in his life. We meet Emerson and his wife, Henry's mother, and favorite brother John, as they inact with his memories and become alive themselves. The ebullience of John is obvious, which makes his passing much more severe. This play helps to maginify the brilliance of a brilliant man, while making him more human, more real.The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail is a great read, and will springboard your interests to study this amazing thinker."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"THE NIGHT THOREAU SPENT IN JAIL describes thinker Henry David Thoreau short experience in jail after not paying his taxes. Employing flashbacks within flashbacks, playwrights Lawrence and Lee take on the task of describing Thoreau's life so far. Filled with witty remarks and humorous dialogue, this book transcends what I can say about it.After having been assigned to read this book for my AP 11 English class, I started out first assignment: Read to page 50. To my surprise, once I got to page 50, I couldn't put it down. My teacher had warned us about this scenario. She said the book was cleverly hilarious and enjoyable. Naturally--it being an ASSIGNED book--I doubted her words.When I got into the play, within the first few words of dialogue, I was laughing out loud. The writers, whose research was obviously accurate and concise, tickled me when Ralph Waldo Emerson asked \\"who\\" his umbrella was, making a reference to his supposed contraction of Alzheimer's disease. Thoreau's teachings of God and fields and notetaking were pleasing and enriching.Not only was I thrilled by his paradoxical dialogue,[In a nutshell...Thoreau to a student: Why are you taking notes?Student: So I can remember what you say.Thoreau: But then it's the notebook that does the remembering, not you.(She puts away her notebook)Thoreau: Why have you stopped taking notes?Student: Because you said to.Thoreau: Why would you do what I say?]but I also took away something from it, which is a common moral you would see in books and movies today: Do things for yourself, and pay no attention to what others say or think. Though the moral is a bit overused, Lee and Lawrence refresh it and make the lesson new placing it in the midst of witticism and transcendentalist teachings.Now, the only thing left for me to do is write a thank you card to my teacher for treating us with this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"While Thoreau was living at Walden, then President James K. Polk declared war on Mexico without Congressional approval. To protest this and the government, Thoreau refused to pay his taxes and was sent to jail. This play fantasizes on what might have been going through Thoreau's mind as he spent the night in jail: reflecting on his childhood, the life and death of his brother, his idol Ralph Waldo Emerson, what lead him to his solitary life at Walden and the impetus for his refusal to pay the taxes. I enjoyed reading this very much as it gave some insight into the great thinker who influenced the likes of Gandhi with his non-violent form of protesting the government."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"this book speaks for itself...there is nothing more I can add to it...a simplification of Thoreau, for sure...if you want something weighty, get A Plea For Captain Brown or one of his other essays (usually included with Walden anyway)But this play shows that you don't have to be weighty to be deep, and it doesn't have to be overly long to be profound.This book will change your life."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"I read this book a year ago in philosophy class when we were studying Thoreau. I must say, of all philosophers, Thoreau is one of my favorites. This play examines feilds such as family life, relationships, government, policy, and my favorite - education. After I read this play I had marvelous thoughts about how wonderful the education system would be if only Thoreau's ideas could be played upon! I strongly recomend this book to anyone who is sometimes accused of being an &quot;idealist&quot; or a &quot;dreamer&quot; - but also to those who hold a strict perspective on government and education. Keep an open mind and enjoy the thoughts that flow through Thoreau's mind!"},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"This play examines Henry David Thoreau, his philosophies, and some of the events in his life. During the Mexican American War, Thoreau refused at one point to pay his taxes. He felt that the war was unjust, and he didn't want his money supporting a government that he believed was doing unjust things. (He also believed that the war was not the will of the people, as President Polk had declared war without the support of Congress.)The play, which takes place on a simple set that emphasizes the imagination of the audience (and the performers) for props/surroundings, also delves into Thoreau's love for nature and his views on sprituality. (The fact that the set is simple reflects another way that form follows content, as Thoreau encouraged people to turn away from materialism and simplify their lives.) The chief journey in the play is Thoreau's decision to return to the world, rather than remove himself from it.Themes include individuality, the nature of spirituality, marching to one's own drummer (regardless of consequence), the belief that one person can make a difference, the idea of standing on principle/what's right, and the manifestation of the divine in nature and humanity (Transcendentalism).It's a somewhat academic play, about ideas more than about plot (of which there is virtually none), but it reminds us that theatre can inform and instruct us as well as entertain us. Additionally, the subject matter of the play is very topical (public funds for stem cell research? or the war in Iraq?) and is sure to stimulate thought and discussion.The authors of this play (two college professors) demanded that it not be produced on Broadway and, to my knowledge, it never has been.

The play, &iexcl;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,&iexcl; written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is based on his spending one night in jail. The circumstance, a cell in the prison, allowed him to recall his past and discover himself as a pencil-maker, a school teacher, an author, a handy man, etc. Each scene implies his various talents as showing him not just as a great philosopher or a writer, but as a human being.Thoreau had been inspired by the humanism speech of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was the Sage of Concord. In order to follow Waldo&iexcl;s lecture, he declared himself free, and he tried not to yield another&iexcl;s will. He practiced his philosophy by teaching the nature to the students, trying to distinguish himself from others, surveying living things in the meadow, and refusing the taxes to the unfair government. He was so called, a &iexcl;transcendentalist&iexcl;, and he kept emphasizing &iexcl;BE YOUR OWN MAN!&iexcl; His saying, &iexcl;The freest man in the world! And you, out there, are chained to what you have to do tomorrow morning!&iexcl; in jail showed his position against the civilization and the world. After spending one night in jail, Thoreau eventually decided to face the real lives instead of avoiding them.Thoreau met another prisoner, Bailey, who had waited for the chance to prove his guiltlessness and had never spoken up for himself to avoid trouble. Bailey barely understood what happened in the world or what were right things to be done. He stands for the victims, who can&iexcl;t get along with others and be protected by the authorities, like Henry Williams, an escapee and slave trying to get to Canada. On the other hand, Deacon Nehemiah ball, the chairman of the Concord School Committee, stuck to insisting on having an obedient attitude, taking the strict policy. He is the symbol of the power and violence.Thoreau&iexcl;s brother, John, understood, supported, and ran the meadow school with Thoreau, but he died young from lockjaw. Besides John, the young lady Ellen Sewell also understood Thoreau&iexcl;s transcendentalism. She attended his lectures and attracted his attention. However, she didn&iexcl;t dare to stand up to the authority. One more woman is there, Lydian Emerson, who is Dr. Emerson&iexcl;s obedient wife. She, who is warm-hearted, tries to make Thoreau get in the mainstream. Despite her sympathy toward Thoreau, she maintains her position, observing the majority. Sam Stapler, the constable in Concord, has difficulties because he persuades Thoreau to pay his dues. Finally, he carries out the law and arrests Thoreau.This play is not just for those who started to know new spirits, which are the transcendental movement and the abolition movement in the late 1800&iexcl;s, but for all of us who are educated, rationalized, and law-abiding in the societies, so that we can justify their own determinations. We always assimilate social conditions to be alike. We often forget thinking about what we are doing as keeping pace with others. This play is insightful enough to extend their point of view about the world and think over our attitudes toward societies. It deserves the best compliment and is recommended to read. Why don&iexcl;t you stop wandering around in your cage to see your outside world?"},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"...The authors state clearly in their introduction that in presenting this play one should forget Thoreau the philosopher...and play Thoreau the man. Thoreau is in this play a humanistic figure and not a historical one, thus it should come as no suprise that there are historical inaccuracies involved in the work. Transcend them, and appreciate the character as a man, rather than as the Thoreau you may have read and analyzed in class.The actions depicted in the play are supposed to represent a melange of the activities in Thoreau's life. They are not supposed to be happening in a chronologically correct order. Unlike a play, such as 1776, which purports to be an accurate depiction of a specific period of time, TNTSIJ makes no such representations. The brilliance of the play is that he can take such a wide range of non-contemporary items and tie them together in a work which manages to stand together on its own. There are any number of biographies of Thoreau which can draw conclusions on the actual cause-and-effect relationships of these occurances.The classical unities which state that the action of a play should take place over a given (brief) period of time have long since been done away with in contemporary drama. Thus a play which has years between its scenes should be neither new to the reader nor automatically discarded because of it. Even so, TNTSIJ is not really that problematic in this regard. Yes, there are flashbacks and flash-forwards but they by no means occur &quot;each scene.&quot; And they may take a few re-readings before you get the feel of how they operate, but this is merely confusing - not an example of poor writing.Finally, as is the case with much good drama, this play should be seen, and not read. You should be commended for taking an at times difficult piece and presenting it in such a way that it is more approachable to the audience. That is, after all, the job of the ar!"},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"I performed this play with a company a few months ago, and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had! The play is beautifully written and has a great representation of Thoreau and what he stood for-- and in my opinion, one of most quotable things since Mean Girls. I'd highly recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"Like Thoreau himself, this play remains relevant to the current day. Obviously a response to the 1960s, its themes of individual integrity, personal meaning, openness to & humility before both Nature & the human soul, are all valid & even more pressing now. If anything, contemporary America has become even more materialistic, grasping, and ultimately empty than it was some 40+ years ago, when a significant percentage of the public actually stopped & considered such questions. I've no doubt that everyone knows people living those lives of quiet desperation.All the more reason for this thoughtful play. Not that it's so solemn & serious that there's no humor in it -- far from it! As it jumps back & forth in time, just as memory & reflection do, it has plenty to say about the many foibles & sheer ridiculousness of everyday life, and the things we believe are so very important. Except that if we stop to really consider them, we realize that most of them aren't important at all -- we've just been taught to think that, and to respond accordingly & as unthinkingly as Pavlov's dogs. Which is what the powers that be would prefer, of course. After all, there's money to be made, status to be sought, power to be amassed & wielded ... but to what purpose? To what end? What does any of that matter in the long run?Authors Lawrence & Lee present those questions through the words, choices & actions of Thoreau. They don't ask us to blindly imitate him & accept his every word. They want us to learn from his example, so that we think more critically & for ourselves, rather than simply following whatever script we were given at birth. In short, to be as much the true authors of our own lives as Thoreau was of his. For anyone who's begun to question the rules of his or her world, and wonder how many of them are for someone else's benefit, this play is most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"On time and a good read.

Thoreau was jailed for civil disobedience when he refused to pay taxes because he thought that President Polk was engaging in an unjust and unwarranted war with Mexico to gain California. The play revolves around a series of flashback scenes that Thoreau experiences or remembers while in jail. These small snapshot scenes reveal some significant events in his life, his relationships - including the influence of philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, and his unique moral grounding and perspective. The play covers a lot of territory; including political, philosophical, and personal. This makes for an interesting reading experience for the dialogue is witty and razor sharp. Yet Thoreau's form of civil disobedience is not for everyone and if everyone practiced it, society would have a difficult time functioning. However, Thoreau comes across as a highly likable brilliant human being and this certain encouraged me to learn more about him and his writings."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"While the American war against Mexico that has gone down in history as the Mexican war was widely praised by the people of the United States when it was launched, there were a few who strongly opposed it on principle. Two of those people were Abraham Lincoln and Henry David Thoreau. When Thoreau refused to pay his taxes that he believed were going to pay for a war of aggression, he was put in jail. As an act of civil disobedience, it was a small act, but the repercussions were historically significant as the leaders of future movements were influenced by Thoreau's actions.This play is a fictionalized account of Thoreau's time in jail where he speaks a great deal about his philosophy of simplicity in a world that is already growing complicated. He meets with a fellow inmate; an illiterate man named Bailey and with a runaway slave named Williams. As he interacts with these two men and the other players, Thoreau explains his beliefs and tries to impress upon them how fundamental they are. He is furious when others offer to pay his tax bill so that he can leave the jail. Like nearly all people who refuse to conform, Thoreau finds that the people around him do not understand his principles and work hard to correct his problems with the rest of the world. This is a good story about courage, conviction and the belief in standing up for what is right."},{"Title":"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail: A Play","review":"This is a great play to read before reading anything by Thoreau himself--it will help you to get a better understanding of him.

These playwrights are of no great literary caliber, and civil disobedience is possibly the most overrated type of civic action I can think of. Honestly, I don't care if you don't pay taxes. You will just get thrown in jail and get what you deserve, like Thoreau did. The only reason it worked with Gandhi was because the British were so far flung and a declining empire anyways. Also Walden is so autobiographical that you hardly need all of this. I recommend reading Walden instead.

A good outline can greatly enhance one's understanding of a biblical book, so such outlines are important. Rarely, though, do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived.This book, which is based on Professor Lee's doctoral dissertation, describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text. This method, called \\"conceptual analysis\\", is a modern version of form criticism developed by Lee's advisor, Rolf Knierim.Lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process, where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes. One then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text. Finally, the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed.Lee demonstrates the method on Num. 10:11-36:13, a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways.He divides this section into 36 units, discussing with each one the rationale for his choices. He then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is Num. 13:1-14:45, the account of the exploration of the Promised Land by 12 scouts, the largely negative report the scouts present to the people, and Israel's subsequent rejection of God's plan to bring them into the Promised Land. The pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section.Conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a \\"scientific\\" process, with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text. There is no way to completely mechanize such a process, however. Some subjectivity is inevitable, and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others.In my opinion, one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text. By this criterion, I believe that Lee's outline of Num. 10:11-36:13 earns high marks. His outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text, as he explains in the latter stages of the book.It is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists. This book is a notable exception, and I enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of Numbers."},{"Title":"Clyde Bedell's Concordex of The Urantia book","review":"Though this arrived much later than the promised date, I was happy when it did arrive as it allows one to quickly find passages in The Urantia Book for quick reference.

Sheeana is a intriguing character and so is Murbella and Odrade, as well as the nth incarnation of Duncan Idaho.Frank Herbert died before he could write Dune 7, so this book was not supposed to be the end of the Dune series. Unfortunately it is, for we have been denied Herbert's genius after his untimely death.We can assume that with Leto's Golden Path, Siona's 'no-gene' and the Scattering that humans have spread across many galaxies and this would eventually give rise to myriad races and civilizations, which in itself is a more than intriguing thought.Thank you for sharing this fantastic story with us, Frank Herbert, and may your legacy be always cherished (even if not from Brian and Kevin) We love you."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"In Chapterhouse Dune, the usual players are back with the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilaxu coupled with the Honored Matres, who are hell-bent on destroying everything in their path coming back from Leto the Second's Great Scattering. Previously, the reader briefly meets the Honored Matres, the corrupt offspring of the Bene Gesserit sent out into the Scattering and Heretics of Dune ends with the capture of a valuable Honored Matre in Murbella. Fast forward to the present and Murbella is becoming more and more heavily influenced by the Bene Gesserit and starts to give up her Honored Matre roots to become a full Reverend Mother. In Chapterhouse Dune, Murbella becomes a valuable tool for the Bene Gesserit, both in giving them invaluable insight into the ways and ideas of the Honored Matres but also as a valuable advisor to the Sisterhood itself. In addition, the Bene Tleilaxu are being wiped out in incredible numbers from both the Honored Matres from the Scattering and their own corrupt Tleilaxu that came back from the Scattering.As indicated earlier, the Honored Matres are back from the Scattering and hell-bent on not only destroying every planet in Leto's Old Empire, but intently seek the Bene Gesserit's home planet of Chapterhouse Dune so that they may have a firm rule on the galaxy once and for all. Yet, there are some questions surrounding the Honored Matres that the Bene Gesserit begin to ask. Why are the Honored Matres back from the Scattering? Is it strictly their hatred of the Bene Gesserit and all it represents? Or were they driven back from the Scattering by someone or something? These questions are answered in Chapterhouse and the answers are fairly surprising.In come the Bene Gesserit and their quest to save the known empire. Odrade is now a full Mother Superior stepping in for the deceased Mother Superior Taraza. A lot of the issues that faced Taraza are on Odrade's plate now. A lot of the book revolves around Odrade's \\"mysterious plan\\" that she lets others in on in bits and pieces. However, Odrade throughout a lot of the book goes against the typical Bene Gesserit grain and she must balance maintaining order within the Bene Gesserit and it's few factions with battling the Honored Matres against the slaughtering of all of the planets they've worked so hard to populate. There are a few new cogs in her plan as Murbella comes to their side, as Sheeana gradually begins her training for the Bene Gesserit, and a new ghola of an old friend from Heretics of Dune are all part of Odrade's new plan.What I liked a lot about this book was the fact that the Bene Gesserit finally SEEM to be human. For the past 5 books or so, all the reader saw was a very manipulative religious sect that did whatever it could as long as it benefited the Bene Gesserit line. If it didn't benefit humanity too then that was just too bad. Chapterhouse Dune gives the Sisterhood a very human side as their new Mother Superior in Odrade struggles against time honored traditions and rules of the Bene Gesserit in her attempt to adapt the Bene Gesserit into the modern world and for once, saving humanity as well.The main reason I give this book only 4 stars, is the fact that the final battle between the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres was a disappointment overall. I expected a little bit more of an epic battle/struggle/etc that what transpired in the last 40 pages or so. In addition, an improbable solution between the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres seems a little ridiculous after their vicious hatred for each other and especially their histories throughout the last 2 books or so. Then the Tleilaxu getting very little face time in Chapterhouse and being passively slaughtered without a big fight really was a little disappointing. They were such an intriguing group in the whole plot against Paul, Leto II, and the Bene Gesserit.Yet, despite my few complaints towards the end, I still absolutely loved Chapterhouse Dune. I haven't enjoyed a series this much since I read Stephen King's Dark Tower Series and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series. As others have said, Herbert spent 6 years just researching the concepts that would make the Dune Series alone and in a great portion of the books, you can tell it's very well-researched and thought out. Couple that with the fact that a lot of these books are going for bargain prices on Amazon Marketplace makes the series an even more attractive one to any potential Dune readers. I almost gave up on the Dune Series 3 years ago when I couldn't understand the first book in Dune. The terminology sometimes is difficult, but my best advice would be just to read through it. Particularly do a lot of your glossary reading in the first book and even though there aren't any glossaries in the rest of the books, you can deduce a lot of terms just from the first book alone. Above all, Thank you Frank Herbert for some of the best science fiction I've read.-Travis"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"The problem with this book isn't so much about the book. It is pretty much standard sci-fi fare, with a bit of intrigue thrown in for good measure. The problem is, it gets progressively worse, page by page. The break where the children finished the book is stunningly obvious; it is fairly clear that they didn't inherit their fathers talent. If it were on its own, it would be decent, hence the third star. However, when placed at the end of a line of excellent books, it is at best overshadowed, at worst an insult to its predecessors.Starts good, gets bad, has a kiddy break somewhere after that and goes downhill fast. Simply put, if you have never read a Dune book, or if you are a hardcore fan who simply has to know how it ends, then this is a maybe.

I am a bit hesitant to believe it was indeed a direct sequel to Chapterhouse: Dune, and let me give you my reason why. The two characters at the end of the book (Marty and Daniel) are analogous for Frank Herbert and his wife Beverly! Read the last chapter again and maybe you will get it. They are saying goodbye to the universe they created, a universe which has now gotten so ingrained in the public mind that it is no longer \\"owned\\" by the author.

They left the sisterhood(who at that point were the only controlling force in the universe), to do what the BG couldn't: choose self over society.

It has a huge (and I do mean HUGE) build upfrom the beginning of the novel until about fifty pages from the endwhen Herbert dumps the proverbial soup into our laps. But there aremany questions left unanswered at the end (not that all questionsSHOULD be answered but I felt that a sequel was sure to come had FrankHerbert not passed away before he could finish the series). I'veheard that Brian Herbert, Frank's son, discovered a seventh Dunemanuscript in a safety deposit box after his father died. If this istrue, I can't wait to see it in print. If it's not true, then we maynever know what the 'master' had in mind.But enough ofthat...onto the book itself!The story is that of the Bene Geseritsisterhood and their war against the wicked 'Honored Matres' who'vereturned from the scattering and has threatened to wipe out all of theBG sisterhood. Meanwhile, the BG's are turning Chapterhouse --- theirlast sisterhood stronghold planet --- into a desert planet andbringing back the worms of Dune to this planet in hopes of starting anew cycle of sandtrout/worm/spice/sandtrout, again. Strong in thisstory is that of Duncan Idaho and Murbella, the captured Honored Matrefrom the fifth Dune book. They are [multiplying] like rabbits still intheir no-ship prison and the BG sisterhood takes away the babieshoping to find genetic markers that they haven't seen before(continuing on in their quest for a perfect human). Also at theforefront is that of Odrade, the Mother Superior of the BG, who seeswhere their paths with the Honored Matres must lead. It is a giantmelting pot that began with Leto II's rule (the God Emperor or theTyrant if you prefer). The BG and the Honored Matres must become onesisterhood for them both to survive. Odrade sees this and passes hersisterhoods internal lifetimes on to Murbella after completing hertraining and watching her go through the spice agony.In the end,the melting pot is achieved thanks to Odrade's manipulations andMurbella's Honored Matre's training. But there's a lot left out toindicate that more would have been forthcoming had Herbert not died.Duncan, Sheeana, Scytale, the Rabbi, and a wild-reverend mother,escape in the no-ship and head off into the unknown; even they don'tknow exactly where they end up. And, it appears, the gods don't knowwhy this was done or where they will end up.Questions: Who waschasing the Honored Matre's? Who were the handlers of the Futars andwhere did Futars originate from? Will Chapterhouse become anotherDune world? Did Duncan and his runaway band in the no-ship take aworm? If so, what will they do with it?

When Chapterhouse Dune came out, totally dedicated to them, it was terrific. As other reviewers have said, &quot;If you like the Bene Gesserit, their mystery, their centuries- long dedication, you'll love Chapterhouse. If you don't, you won't.&quot; Makes onewonder if a Bene Gesserit type group is really &quot;behind things&quot; in our world, too. Maybe. Maybe not. Hmmmmmmm?"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I have begun re-reading the entire series after 6 years. After all of the intense, and intricate pages that precede the final chapter of the final book, the ending although (seemingly) simple on the surface actually shows us the utterly complicated nature of the universe, and that is, although layered and complicated, the truth of things IS simplicity, and that endings are never just endings, read between the lines, you'll understand."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This was an excellent end to an excellent epic. Herbert carried on the story started in \\"Heretics of Dune\\" into even more compelling complexity. We get to the bottom of who the Honored Matres really are, the relationship between Duncan Idaho and Murbella is fleshed out in a complex series of twists and turns typical of relationships that start out with sex, but move into emotional hard times, and of course, there's an astonishing twist near the end that I did not see coming.One of the most fascinating aspects of the Dune Chronicles, but especially this book, is how relativism as a world-view is portrayed. Herbert expounds in story fashion exactly the benefits and high costs of a worldview with no concept of transcendant truth. In this long story the characters portrayed as most enlightened are those most skeptical of \\"truth\\" and of those who claim it exists. I have a completely different view of reality from the characters portrayed here, and, I suspect, Mr. Herbert. I have often had a hard time understanding the suspicion such people have of people like me who think there is a God who established reality and that He is the absolute standard for truth. I am profoundly grateful for the insight into the mind of the post-modern relativist I've gained from this book.For the interested reader there is also a brief tribute to Herbert's wife, Bev, at the end of the book. Quite touching.And so, the Golden Path (or should we say paths?) winds on into eternity, and I am sad that we cannot follow Frank Herbert to its end."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Chapterhouse Dune is the last in the Dune series by Frank Herbert. The story continues closely after the end of Heretics of Dune. The Bene Gesserit are slowly transforming there home planet to replicate Dune in order to monoploize the Spice. But it is a race against time, their enemies the Honored Matres are closing in. And there may be even greater powers than either lurking in the Galaxy.This was a disappointing end to the series. It is never clear why the Bene Gesserit are so inferior militarily to the Honored Matres when they are superior in every other way. The final showdown between the two was anti-climactic (what was the Honored Matres ultimate weapon? it was never explained) and the ending was little bit puzzling. Herbert ends this book pretty much as he ended the previous one, a small group flying away with a sandworm to start a new Dune somewhere else in the galaxy. And why did Herbert throw in those god-like beings in the story? That whole subplot didn't make much sense.The series as whole was enjoyable for its scope, politics, religion and ecology, but it was never clearly written, leading to frustration at times."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Frank Herbert set the stage for rebirth in Chapterhouse Dune. Though it was probably not his intention, if no other books had been written, it created what could be described as a circle of life, that could begin again with the original Dune novel. It certainly offers no conclusion exactly, and you should not expect any sort of epic ending that satisfies all your questions. Insted, you can conintue to live in the universe of Frank Herbert, and should you read never read any other Dune books (aside from the previous five by Herbert himself), you'll be able to sleep at night an begin to finally envision Herbert's universe as he saw it."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"There is a severe formatting problem with the Kindle edition of this title: two blank lines appear after every paragraph break. This causes the text to use far more screen space than it should. Long sections of dialogue -- one of Herbert's most distinctive characteristics -- often display as disjointed individual sentences; it's easy to lose track of who is speaking to whom. The Kindle editions of other titles in the Dune series, such as Heretics of Dune and Paul of Dune, display correctly.The premise behind the Kindle is that it's a book in another form. Or, as the promo promises,\\"The most elegant feature of a physical book is that it disappears while you're reading. Immersed in the author's world and ideas, you don't notice a book's glue, the stitching, or ink. Our top design objective is to make Kindle disappear -- just like a physical book -- so you can get lost in your reading, not the technology.\\"Not so with this Kindle title. The formatting error detracts from the reading experience rather than enhances it. The problem lies with the text, not with the Kindle. Oh, some of the \\"usual\\" Kindle quirks are present as well: seemingly random hyphens, italics turning on and off in mid-word (especially noticeable in the \\"excerpts\\" that begin each chapter), etc. Those I've learned to live with. It's a shame that the physical appearance of this title doesn't match the others in the series."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"It appears at God Emperor Leto II's Golden Path has brought the destruction of not only Dune, but humanity itself. The Bene Gesserit are, slowly, turning their beloved planet Chapterhouse into a haven for sandworms, but the whorish Honored Matre's are breathing down their neck and the ax is raised. The last of the Atredies must find a way to escape into the Scattering or be trapped forever beneath the thumb of a chaos worse than any that has come before...This book is slow, tedious, confusing, and utterly captivating. From someone who finishes 2 or 3 books a day if they're good enough, this one took me 2 weeks to finish and, circa page 275, helped me towards a nice hour-long nap. The last chapter only adds to the confusion, one in which I've yet to decide the old couple the most recent ghola-Idaho sees throughout this novel are emancipated Face Dancers, the elderly couple from American Gothic, aliens from the Scattering, or what-not.Still, if you're a fan of the series, you'll want to read this last work of F. Herbert's before his death."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This book is perhaps the best in the entire series. Although starkly different from the original, Chapterhouse:Dune is rich in philosophy, religious commentary, and novel science fiction concepts. Darwi Odrade is perhaps the best-drawn character in the entire Dune universe; although Duncan and Sheeana can also be considered the main characters, it is Darwi that gives true force to this book.The ending, although considered a cliffhanger, can in fact serve as a concrete conclusion. (Note: Spoilers ahead.) This is the last book Frank Herbert wrote before his death, and some people have said that Daniel and Marty are actually Frank and his wife Beverly in disguise waving goodbye. This being said, I could have done without Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's awful 'Hunters of Dune.' It did not feel like a continuation of the Dune saga at all; I felt that the whole 'omg Omnius is back' twist completely betrayed the original Herbert's vision.Chapterhouse is fascinating at every turn; the looming confrontation between Odrade and the Honored Matre Spider Queen was more than enough to hold my interest. Dune fans (if they've read the first five books) will not be disappointed with Chapterhouse."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"....although I enjoyed the characters and plot twists, particularly the military reversal toward the end, can someone help me out with what &quot;the bitter medicine of a Sheeana future&quot; is?

Absolutely breathtaking in it's thoughts and conclusions."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Frank Herbert wrote three good Dune novels: \\"Dune,\\" \\"Dune Messiah,\\" and \\"Heretics of Dune.\\"He also wrote three poor ones: \\"Children of Dune,\\" \\"God Emperor of Dune,\\" and \\"Chapterhouse: Dune.\\"\\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\" is a closely connected sequel to \\"Heretics of Dune.\\" The old interstellar empire of humanity, once subjugated to the peaceful autocracy of the God Emperor, is now threatened by newly established human realms of the Scattering. Familiar factions like Ix, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Tleilax, and the Bene Gesserit, all face liquidation or slavery. Life on Dune has been wiped out. \\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\" focuses on the Bene Gesserit, who are trying to make a new Dune by terraforming their secret-headquarters planet, Chapterhouse (thus the title of the book). They must also struggle versus their analogs from the Scattering: chaotically evil women known as \\"Honored Matres.\\"But if you are looking for science fiction that is exciting, or at least interesting, from beginning to end, look elsewhere. Though some of what I got here was exciting, or at least interesting, I also got pages and pages of boring talk and boring thought. I mean talk and thought about subjects like government, law, and religion. This is something I might expect from a social studies teacher who has delivered his lesson plan but needs to fill in leftover time. This is not something I expect from a science fiction adventure.Of course the final judge as to what is interesting, boring, or exciting is the reader. Do not, however, say you were not warned.To corroborate my feelings of boredom, I've included some quotes from other reviewers:From the two-star review by H. COTA \\"fizzman\\":\\"Chapterhouse: Dune is, in a word, tedious. This book has 20 pages of boring, meaningless pages for every page that actually contributes to the plot.\\"From the two-star review by A Customer:\\"The last three books are merely a pedestal for Herbert's personal philosophy. While there were kernels of truth to all of the endless philosophical one-liners that everyone spouted, the rest of the novel (an actually well-devised story) was totally ruined by all of this rambling. The books could have been a lot shorter, or those pages could have been better spent developing characters further.\\"From the two-star review by C. Purvis:\\"While I liked the plot of Chapterhouse, the execution was severly lacking. %75 of this book is boring, cryptic dialogue--absolutely nothing happens until the very end....\\"From the one-star review by Arnold Agraviador \\"Arnold\\":\\"There's just so much ... wasted on people's thoughts, musings, endless talking, etc.\\"From the one-star review by Mr. Tammany Hall:\\"Reverend Mother Odrade wanders around the titular \\"Chapterhouse\\" planet, fretting, musing, wondering, and talking to an incredibly boring assortment of inner ancestors, going on and on about gardening and the love-hate relationship the Bene Gesserit have with bureaucracy, all for hundreds upon hundreds of pages.\\" (This quote is inaccurate, but it's right about the \\"musing, wondering...talking...boring.\\" And it is highly exaggerative regarding \\"hundreds upon hundreds of pages,\\" but the exaggeration is indicative of the feelings of boredom sustained while reading this book.)From the one-star review by Bonecrkr:\\"...boring, tedious and, quite frankly, poorly written....\\""},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Almost didn't want to get to this book as it is the end of Herbert's orginal works...but if you like original Dune books, you will love Chapterhouse Dune..."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I enjoyed the entire Dune series.They were longer and more detailed than I needed, but I had to finish the series!

However, the one flaw is that it leaves too many questions unanswered. While it caps the series, it does not wrap up all of the loose ends, and the reader will feel a sense of incompleteness at the not-so-grand finale.

After being initially disappointed with the first book, I recently started reading up on the later books. From Dune Messiah to ChapterHouse, I was held to my seat. Each novel getting better. I felt Herberts style became more pronounced, character development was much more a focus then plot. The mulit layer politics kept the pages turning. Just when you thought it would slow down, he throws another teaser at you. Riviting from begining to end. No there wasn't much action, but I think there was more to the story to keep things going. The unnknowns kept you guessing on how it was going to end. I would recommend this series to anyone, but becareful, you will seldom find a plot as drawn out with as many twists. You may find the rest of the world too boring:)"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I've read and re-read the DUNE series including books done by Brian Herbert. I've read Frank's original DUNE series up to Heretics about 3 times or more. I've always wondered why I can't remember anything abpit Chapterhouse Dune until I started reading it again. It is booooooriiing - that's why. I don't think I ever finished it and I probably made 2 attempts. I finally found the audiobook for it just to force myself to listen to the book while driving - big mistake. The book was putting me to sleep. I have since been listening to the audiobook only when I take public transport - or sometimes when I want to fall asleep at bedtime. God Emperor of Dune was a tedious read for me the first time but I found myself able to read it again and enjoy it now. This book though just doesn't get me excited or interested. I'm only listening to it now so I can read Brian H's sequel - Sandworms and Hunters of Dune. I just wish I could find an abridged version of this book. I think it can be summed up in 2 or 3 chapters. There's just so much pages wasted on people's thoughts, musings, endless talking, etc. that doesn't capture my attention after the first paragraph of a page. I'm still plodding through this book and hopefully will be done with it. I would like to google and see if I can find a really really short version of this book someone hopefully posted online and save myself the misery."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"The writing is great and we wanted to round out our FH collection, but this poor book has been overly loved.

And in Chapterhouse, the Bene Gesserit are going back as well. They've rescued worms from the now destroyed Arrakis, and have moved them to Chapterhouse. Even as they try to move back, they're forced to confront the future and deal with the Honored Matres. A great read, set in a world that feels like coming home to me."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Just finished this a couple days ago and I'm still stunned at the scope of the series. In a mere six books, Herbert fleshes out an epic tale that stretched my mind far beyond any sci-fi I'd read before. Several characters from past books still live on in my imagination!Chapterhouse closes the series. Sort of. Taken as a novel it's outstanding. Here are a couple things that really stood out for me:1. The description of Murbella's experience with the Agony and her resultant loyalty to the Bene Gesserit is wholly believable and we gain a better understanding of why the \\"witches\\" behave the way they do.2. Outstanding descriptions of the transformation of a lush world into a desert planet: \\"anti-terraforming\\".3. If you've read Book 4, it totally makes sense when you discover where the Honored Matres come from!4. Quite a dramatic shock when the Matres use their secret weapon!As an ending to a series Chapterhouse is generally satisfying but doesn't really serve as a substitute for the sequel Herbert would surely have written if he hadn't passed away the following year. Clearly the book can't be rated lower for circumstances beyond Herbert's control. A few obvious loose ends to be cleared up that a sequel may have taken care of:1. Scytale and the Bene Tleilax2. consequences of the new generation of worms3. destination of Leto II's Golden Path?4. What's chasing the Honored Matres?Chapterhouse is a fantastic read and I recommend it highly! The ending of the book kind of baffles me and I'm not sure what to make of it. Very unexpected!"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I don't know how long after Leto II died, Chapterhouse deals with the Bene Gesserit and their many machinations throughout the uncountable universes now occupied by mankind. The main focus however is their struggle with a powerful new enemy, the Honored Matres; a group of women who study and train all of their lives in the arts of sexual manipulation and deadly combat skills who have taken over nearly everything and burned Arrakis into slag. Intricate and bizarre in the coolest way."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Frank Herbert ends the series with a bang. If you thought the climax of Heretics left you drained, think again! Chapterhouse will throw so many delicious curves that...well, if you've read the series this far, you're an addict like me, so you don't need my advice.

But now the Honoured Matres, instead of simply holding a slight distaste for the Bene Gesserit, are head-hunting, searching out the original sisterhood's home planet: Chapter House Planet.Already the Honoured Matres have laid bloody waste to dozens of Bene Gesserit planets, and the new Mother Superior (an Atreides with wild talent) can sense that the hunters are getting closer. So she hatches a radical plan that puts the entire sisterhood at risk, in the hope of finally punishing the Honoured Matres.And brilliant it all is too. This is easily my second-favourite from the whole series (after Dune). After an initially slow lead up (one of Herbert's defining features, it seems) we get violently thrown into action, watching in breathless silence as the final conflict hits us.As is always the way, you'll never know what is going to happen, never know who next will feel the chill of death, and you'll wow at one shock after another.Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, this last book suddenly made me stop seing the Dune series as a set of six books. The second-to-last chapter oh-so suddenly made me see the whole series as one story, made me see the pattern, told a story beyond the ending of Chapterhouse Dune. And I enjoyed it all very much.As for the last chapter. Well. I've still no idea what to make of it. It's such an intriguing and unexpected last two pages. If anyone knows what it's about, what the hidden message is, I'd love to know.It's worth reading the whole series just to get to this book. Read it all.

The numerical superiority of the Matres is causing the Bene Gesserit to fight what seems to be a losing battle. The novel concludes with a desparate ploy to save the Bene Gesserit and will determine the future of the Old Empire.This is Frank Herbert's last novel prior to his passing. This is a comprehensive work that is worthy of the remainder of the Dune series (though ironically Dune was destroyed in the fifth book.) Herbert's writing is detailed and compelling, as always. If you have read the first five books in this series, you must read this one. One question I have that will never be answered is this: did he intend this to be the end considering this was finished about the time his wife passed away, or was he intending on continuing the series. The book definately concludes with an opening for continuation of the series. However, while Herbert's son has written various \\"prequel\\" books, I hope he does NOT continue this series. It would seem to show grave disrespect to the man who must certainly be considered one of the two greatest science fiction writers (along with Isaac Asimov) of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This appears to be the time that the \\"tyrant\\" Leto II saw for the need of the Golden Path. Unfortunately, Frank Herbert passed away after the writing of this book. However, his son (Brian Herbert along with Kevin J. Anderson) has announced that he has found the notes for the remaining book(s) and am currently writing two more books to finish off the Dune series. Therefore, while this book does end in a bit of a cliffhanger, this may be resolved within the next couple of years.This book resumes a few years after Heretics of Dune and the death of Miles Teg and destruction of Dune. The main focus on this book is the Bene Geseret as they attempt to turn their home planet into a replacement for the Dune Sandworms and also to battle the Honored Matres.It all leads to a wonderful ending that is actually quite the cliff-hanger with many unanswered questions. The biggest question concerns the Honored Matres. While the Honored Matres are wiping out the Bene Geseret, they appear to be fleeing from another enemy themselves. The enemy is not revealed by the end of this book, but I believe that this is the underlying purpose of Leto II's Golden Path.So, that begs the question. Should this book be read knowing that this ends in a huge cliffhanger? Because the conclusion to the book is in the works I would say whole-heartedly \\"Yes!\\" Because Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are writing from the notes of Frank Herbert, the final books should contain the original story that Frank wanted to portray.Also, if you have read the other five books and are debating whether to read this one, well, you would be nuts to stop at the end of the fifth book and should not hesitate to continue on to this book.I did find this an enjoyable read, though difficult and slow. I have no regrets reading this book, even if it wasn't being concluded."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"In a nutshell- My favorite novel of all time. I'm aware that this is herecy to those who worship the first novel, but I have never been so completely enthralled with a single book, indeed, a set of characters in my whole life.The novel starts where Heretics left off. Without revealing too much, I have to say that Lucilla is probably the finest example of character illumination I've ever seen. Herbert brings her supreme, and doomed, intellect to life before the Honored Matres in a way that made me wish I could truely meet her. Dar's command of the Situation and her helming the Bene Gezerit into the fire of war with the HMs is phenominal.If it wasn't for them being words on a page I'd have fallen in love.

Although set in a sci-fi, distant future backdrop, this series is really an exploration of politics, mind altering drugs, power and most importantly, philosophy.Chapterhouse Dune focuses on the most interesting of the various groups from the series - the Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit are a group of women who are astoungingly disciplined; both mentally and physically. They view goals in terms of millenia, not months or years. Although I love the entire Dune series (I've probably read each book at least 10 times in the last 15 years) for me, Chapterhouse Dune is the best.

I finished reading this book while I was stationed in South Korea in 2001, and after I was done reading it, all I could do was stare at the wall and ponder what had just happened. In three short pages he had changed the dynamic of the entire Dune universe. I have never seen 3 pages of one book be so hotly contested as to what the reader was trying to convey. Even though, the ending left me yearning for more and changed the way I thought about the previous stories. In the earlier books, we are make to believe that humans were the center of the universe and it was there's for the taking, but after the last two chaper of Chapter House, we see a more dynamic universe of infinite possibilities. I am desperately looking forward to Dune 7, even though it will be writen by Frank's son. I don't care much for him as writer, being that I've read all 4 prequels that he has writen, but he does have a talent for peaking the readers intrest. As long as Dune 7 can give us even a modest idea of what was going through Franks mind when he wrote Chapter House, it will be a book worth waiting for.Everyone should read all of the Dune books, there insites into politics and religion will change the way you see thing around you, thank you Frank for opening my mind to new possibilities"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"The inner workings of the Bene Gesserit have never really been ignored in the previous Dune Books, but their prominence in this Novel was genius.ONE OF THE TOP 2 BOOKS IN THE DUNE SERIESI was absolutely riveted by the plot twist involving the Honored Matres, and the Bene Tleilax.The ability of Frank Herbert to essentially start over and reinvent a whole new context for the plot to take place in was fantastic. I'm amazed simultaneously by his skill and his daring.It would be so easy to rest on your laurels and extend a successful franchise -- the most successful in history. The fact that he stretched himself spoke volumes about his confidence and creativity.Saying thank you to him just doesn't seem like enough.Mr. Herbert, Thanks (a whole whole lot)."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"An alert reader may well ask, if I thought the last four books in this series were that bad, why did I read them all?That's a darn good question.Well, I read the original \\"Dune\\" in high school some 30 years ago, and I have re-read it a couple of times since, considering it to be a true masterpiece. The sequel, \\"Dune Messiah,\\" is every bit as good, and I agree with some interpretations that this novel should be considered a companion novel or extension of the original \\"Dune,\\" since it basically picks up soon after the conclusion of the first, and completes the story of the rise and fall of Paul Atreides. In other words, the first two books could be combined into one novel, and we would have one of the truly great works of science fiction on our hands.Still, the seeds of stupidity had already been sown in the original \\"Dune,\\" and brought out further in \\"Messiah\\" with the plot twists involving the Alia character. These came to the fore in \\"Children of Dune,\\" which is Part III of the series. Basically, as anyone who hated the Wesley Crusher character in \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\\" or the Anakin Skywalker kid in \\"Star Wars: the Phantom Menace\\" can tell you - NEVER portray little kids with superhuman powers that exceed the capabilities of the adults around them because no matter how you try to spin it, it will not be credible. It violates the rules of \\"internal consistency\\" or some such thing that every created fictional universe must follow. But Herbert didn't follow that rule and gave these little kids super powers and it was kind of like \\"Mighty Mouse in Outer Space,\\" only sillier. Especially when one of the kids starts morphing into a baby sandworm. I am not making this up. So basically, after reading \\"Children of Dune\\" in the early 1980s, I gave up on the series for awhile and forgot about it.Around 1990 I came across \\"God Emperor of Dune\\" in a bargain bin in a bookstore and decided just for the heck of it that I would give it a shot. I actually read the whole thing. It was weird, consisting basically of three hundred pages about the 3000 year old kid from \\"Children of Dune\\" who had turned into a mutant boy-worm with no testicles suddenly discovering, after seeing a particularly hot space chick, that he can't get laid and maybe regretting he had set the universe on a course that he called \\"the Golden Path.\\" I never figured out what the \\"Golden Path\\" was supposed to be, he never got laid, and in the end he fell into a river and bad things happened to him, or maybe they weren't so bad because this is what he had planned all along for the past 3000 years, because, you know, he had prescient powers and all...So Book IV was a let-down, which probably has anyone who is still with me here wondering why I kept going. Okay. Fast forward about ten years to the year 2000 or so. I am in the airport in Moscow, getting ready to fly back to the United States with nothing to read and a ten hour flight staring me in the face, and there, in front of me, next to the giant rack of porno mags, is a copy of \\"Heretics of Dune. This would be Part V of the series, for those of you keeping track. I would summarize this by saying that if I had bought a copy of this in Russian it would have made about as much sense. (Or maybe I should have gone with one of the porno mags.) It is now about 8000 (or maybe 10,000?) years beyond the events of the original Dune, as if that matters, but there are still all these Bene Gesserit women around. Only they seem to be warring for control of the galaxy with another group of women with super powers called Honored Matres or some such thing. The Honored Matres appear to really good in bed and can somehow control men if they have sex with them. Must have good kegel muscles or something. Did I mention that the incidental Duncan Idaho character who was killed about halfway through the first \\"Dune\\" novel keeps showing up as some sort of resurrected zombie guy through all these novels, because some group of bio-engineering geniuses with an unpronounceable name like Bene Tleilaxu or something can clone him from a single surviving cell? Anyway, it turns out that the climactic moment of this novel, no pun intended, is when this zombie Idaho guy has sex with an Honored Matre and he is so good at it that SHE falls under HIS control. And somehow his ability to be the greatest lover in the galaxy since Wilt Chamberlain becomes the key to the future of the universe, although after reading this I still have no idea what the hell the Golden Path is supposed to be or if all this sex has anything to do with it. And the worst part of it is that Herbert can't even write a decent sex scene, considering how much sex seems to be a factor to the plots of these stories. Where is Ken Follett when you need him?Okay, so finally it is 2008. I know that Frank Herbert has passed away, and while his son is apparently busily and simultaneously writing several hundred sequels and prequels and sequels to prequels to the Dune series, all supposedly based on his father's notes, I know that this copy of Chapterhouse Dune I'm looking at on the library shelf in front of me represents the last thing Frank himself ever wrote. So I say to myself - okay - how bad could it be? And I've read all the other ones - maybe I should see how it all turns out.Well - it was as silly as I imagined, and then some. The Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres are still at war. Another one of the Duncan Idaho zombie guys (or maybe it's the same one) is still having lots of sex. There are Jews running around, and apparently these are actual, bona-fide Jews, although Herbert never discloses whether they are still conducting bris ceremonies on their eight day old male infants, so maybe they're not so Jewish after all, oy vey. In the end, one of the Honored Matres turns into a Bene Gesserit of sorts, uses her martial arts skills like some futuroid version of Jacqueline Chan to dispatch some of the uber-bitch servants of the head Honored Matre, who is cleverly named \\"THE Honored Matre,\\" and presumably peace breaks out all across the universe. And that is how it all turns out, 10,000 years later, and man I wish I could have had some of what this guy was smoking...Now if any of you think I gave away any spoilers here, well I didn't, because NONE of this makes any sense. Though I suppose there is at least one fan boy out there somewhere who could probably explain all of this to me, but then this would likely be the same guy who would argue that there is actually some deep meaning to the Matrix movies or the Lost series on TV.My advice to you is let me serve as a warning to you all. Stop reading Dune books after number two. No - they don't get any better. Just like Rocky movies or Alien movies they just get progressively dumber and dumber, in a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 kind of way, which is why I give this book two stars instead of one. It was so bad it was almost good, if only Saturday Night Live or MST3K could get a hold of it...."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This is the last volume of the saga. The Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit are confronted to the Honored Matres. The twist is the capture of one Honored Matre, in the previous volume, and her training as a Reverend Mother, so that she can join the physical capabilities of the Horored Matres and the psychological and mental capabilities of the Reverend Mothers. So the two hostile orders, after a swift war, with the victory of the Bene Gesserit first, immediately reversed into the victory of the Honored Matres, are joined into one by this ex-captive Honored Matre become Reverend Mother. She hence becomes the leader of both orders and she can fulfill the plan of her predecessors, in the Bene Gesserit as well as of the Honored Matres, in joining the two by teaching diplomacy to the Bene Gesserit and by educating the barbaric Honored Matres. A new phase in the development of both orders will be reached by the synthesis of both, through symbiosis. But we also have the explanation of the origin of the Honored Matres. They are the descendants, in the Scattering, of the Fish Speakers who were the guards of the Tyrant Leto II issued from the religion of the sister of Muabdib, the father of Leto II. This religion, dominated by a woman, was an administrative democracy turned dictotarial, and in the Great Scattering that followed the death of the Tyrant Leto II, these Fish Speakers that Leto II had recuperated from his aunt join forces with wild Reverend Mothers and Scattered Reverend Mothers. They joined the physical power of the Fish Speakers and the sexual obsession of the Abomination who created the religion from which they originated. They, on the other side, neglected the mental element of the Reverend Mothers, the Bene Gesserit, by being cut from this Bene Gesserit. So they are mentally underdeveloped and they are only aiming at controling the world through violence, that they had brought to an unrivaled level, and sex. They turned criminal and conquering when they were pushed back, into the Old Empire, from the Scattering by new beings probably created by some genetic manipulation devised by the Bene Tleilaxu, the famous Futars (half cats and half men) that can only behave, have a coherent action if they have their Handlers behind, these Handlers being the humans who are programed to control them. This plan succeeds, but four people refuse it and decide to escape : the last Tleilaxu Master who was the prisoner of the Bene Gesserit and never submitted (he carries a whole bank of ghola cells that he managed to keep secret from the Bene Gesserit) ; the last Ghola of Idaho Duncan who had always refused to submit to the Bene Gesserit and willfully take part in their plans, though he helped them but always as a prisoner and because of his love for the ex-Honored Matre turned Reverend Mother ; the last descendant of Leto II, the Tyrant, who has the power to dominate the sandworms, who saved one from Dune when Dune was destroyed, and who started reviving the worm civilization on Chapter House, with the benediction of the Bene Gesserit, but also as a well-hidden challenge to that Bene Gesserit, and she takes a few of those baby worms to the Scattering with her ; and finally the ghola of Teg Miles, the Bashar of the Bene Gesserit who managed their final attack and victory turned defeat and then turned victory back again. In other words the last remnants of the Atreides family escape from the new order of the alliance between the Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres. When the mental powers of the Bene Gesserit are joined to the physical and sexual powers of the Honored Matres, leading to an enlightened dictatorship, the only sensible attitude is to escape and fly away, and there are always some accomplices in such a situation. So they succeed. We will never know the following phase, that is to say the foreseeable confrontation of the new Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres order on one hand and the new civilization the escapees are going to produce in the Scattering. But well, a saga is never finished.

It's still a good read and much better than most of the science fiction that gets turned out nowadays by the publishing companies. The storyline this time focuses on the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. A more appropriate title for this novel could have been \\"The adventures of Dar and Tar,\\" but I guess Chapterhouse will do.

But after reading Dune I devoured everything Frank Herbert wrote.This book is about life on the desert plant Arakkis. While you read this book you will think about every drop of water you drink and every bead of sweat you prespire. The plot never is straight forward or predictable. Frank Herbert is willing to spend time on the characters that he is willing to destroy early in the book. This is intresting because you don't have a clue who is going to survive the intruge of this book because any character no matter how well developed may be destroyed or corrupted. Sounds like life doesn't it.I do not believe a world like Dune will ever happen but if you are looking to read a book just for the pleasure of reading than this is a great book.

Why does Sheanna have these powers. What happened to Waff? What was he talking about in Heretics about a Tleilaxu savior coming and conquering all thier enemies. Why the hell are those wierd face dancers at the end of the book. As for the Futars he never explained, rather he just threw them in there and said &quot;they kill honored matres&quot;. WHo was the enemy The honored matres were fleeing? Why did Sheanna,idaho and teg leave at the end? If it was Odrades plan why would Sheanna be against it. And most important what the hell weapon did the Honored matres use to be victorious over the Bene Gesserit even though thier armies had been crushed. Also to think that the from 1500 years of scattering, that the universe would become infintely populated by humans is farfetched. Humans would never just leave thier homes and then severe all contact with it. Even if there was amss famine. I would Like to see a series of books dealing with what actually happened right After Leto II died. Like how many people died in the famine. WHich people left the empire and why.

I'm a big fan of the Dune series (despite Herbert's tendency to covertly glorify islamofascism), but this final volume was HORRIBLE. Not only was it boring, tedious and, quite frankly, poorly written, but none of the protagonists had any shred of decency or redeeming qualities whatsoever. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but Herbert holds these characters up as if they were paragons of virtue.....as if this type of person was the logical and appropriate evolution of the human species. In a word...ick. Toward the end of the book, I started hoping that humanity (his version of humanity) would be wiped out by some cataclysm. Herbert's final book dehumanizes people to the point where life isn't worth living. The whole book goes out of its way to portray wickedness and inhumanity as the way of the superior person, ignoring any attempt to be interesting, entertaining, or even have a plot that makes sense.F-"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Chapterhouse: Dune is, in a word, tedious.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"The book gives us a better glimpse into the inner sanctums of Bene Gesserits, but I agree with those who felt that the ending wasn't quite satisfactory.

Also, it was alluded that Sheeana would play a crucial role in the future but never articulated. Same thing goes for Teg, Duncan Idaho, and the last remaining Tleilax Master. I don't think Herbert intended this to be the last of the series."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Some have said that this book ended with another book intended to follow it. While I tend to agree, those who say the ending isn't satisfying obviously don't appreciate Frank Herbert or his visions. This review is mainly for experienced Dune fans: those who know what the \\"Scattering\\" was, well, this is like the final Scattering. The characters branch out in different directions, with different destinations and unknown fates ahead of them. Rather than complain about this, and ask for a typical happy ending where you know exactly what happens, why not appreciate the genius of a final Scattering? Let your imagination run wild. The characters are thrust into unknown futures.. end of story. A whole world of possibilities exists, considering the people who depart and the intentions they have. I won't add any plot spoilers here for those who haven't read it yet, but let me just say this is a wonderful book. Maybe it was hard to appreciate the ending the first time I read it, but on the second, and especially the third read I was fully content with it. Unfortunately, I am deathly afraid that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson will now attempt to write a Dune \\"conclusion\\" even more horribly bastardized than their Dune \\"prequels\\". The only problem I had with this novel was Frank Herbert's introduction of the Jews into it, once he did that, he laid a foundation for his son to introduce all of these \\"Terran\\" (ancient earth) ideas into all of his crappy books.

I look forward to rereading the whole series again next year!"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I love Frank Hebert's real novels, but don't think you are getting the final chapter of his otherwise impeccable Dune series in reading this awful book! It's so obvious to me that it has been written by a completely different author who shared none of the novel crafting skills of Frank Herbert nor his vision of where Dune as a series was supposed to end up. The style of writing is completely different - obnoxiously amature. There is no strong central plot, let alone Frank's usual flair for multilayers. The parade of minor and forgettable characters dialogue in manic, circular and pointless ways for most of the book, before anything really happens.Since frank's son, Brian Herbert wrote a follow-on book which he freely admitted was developed from Frank's notes, I look no further for the obvious explanation - Brian wrote this one too, while his father was sick and dying and inaccessible to lend any help to the process. Yes, there was probably an outline already, but it's very clear to me that the real author did not share Frank's understanding or even appreciation of the subject. Brian should have been more honest about it, but then money was at stake, and that seems to be the major motivation of the real author of Chapterhouse Dune. And when does Frank ever leave you hanging at the end? It was a setup to sell Brian's follow-on novel plain and simple.It's amazing how many Dune enthusiasts miss the obvious and gush about this monstrosity! Don't bother is my advice. There are no answers in it to the burning questions Frank left us with from his previous Dune books."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Who loses? The reader. This is a surprisingly weak book to follow the brave and bold Heretics of Dune, a novel in which Frank took his ideas further than any reader might have imagined. Only one year elapsed between the release of Heretics and Chapterhouse. Frank may have been trying to capitalize on the success of his Dune franchise by getting another book on the shelf quickly. This reads as though the author had run out of ideas and was playing for time. Very little occurs in the first three-quarters of the novel. Almost all of the action takes place in the final hundred pages of the book, ending in that tantalizing cliffhanger. I think this could have been a much better novel had Frank waited and allowed his ideas sufficient time to germinate, but then again, if he had waited too much longer, Heretics would have been the end of the series. Given the strength of that novel, that may not have been a bad outcome."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I've read the softcover version of this book, and have now re-read it on Kindle.

The planet Chapterhouse under their leadership is being transformed into another desert world - and the Sisterhood has wide-ranging plans in this fine absorbing conclusion to the saga."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"It may not have been his intent, but fate has made Chapterhouse Dune the last book in Frank Herbert's Dune series. There may be others, and they may even be good (I haven't yet read them), but this book represents Herbert's final words on the subject. Although not perfect, and definitely leaving things open for another book, this is, overall, a worthy addition to the series.In this book - a direct sequel to Heretics of Dune with many of the same characters - the Bene Gesserit sisterhood is under siege, threatened by the Honored Matres, a somewhat darker version of their own organization, that is sweeping viciously across the galaxy like a barbarian horde. With the original Dune lifeless after a Matres attack, the Bene Gesserit are trying to create a similar world out of their headquarters. Although they don't think of it in those terms, they are really trying to create a planetary ghola, a clone similar to that of recurring character Duncan Idaho. The book focuses on the war between the two sisterhoods.The book does have its flaws. The rather open-ended conclusion may be forgiven if we believe that Herbert had another book intended. The characters are, as usual, overly serious and everything they do is filled with hidden meanings. Also, there is a feeling that Herbert was making up parts of this story as he goes along, with new movements suddenly appearing (such as the futuristic Jews who have never been previously mentioned although they have supposedly always been around).In the end, what is the central point or character of this series? Is it a history of the Bene Gesserit, the House Atreides, Duncan Idaho or some combination of all these. My feeling that the center of this saga is the Tyrant Leto, with the first trilogy (Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune) a story of his origin, the central book (God Emperor) the tale of his emperorship, and the final trilogy (Heretics, Chapterhouse and an intended final book) to be the story of Leto's Golden Path.That is my theory. Whatever your own ideas, if you have enjoyed the previous books, you should enjoy this one also and when you conclude it, you will have read one of the most significant series in science fiction."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Frank Herbert dedicates this, his last novel, to the memory of his beloved wife Bev who while he was writing the book. Not long after finishing Chapterhouse Dune, we lost Frank Herbert as well. His death ended one of science fiction's best series of novels. His son Brian has created several prequels based on Herbert's notes, but no one really can replace the wonderful writing style that made the Dune series so unique.Chapterhouse Dune is the final, apocalyptic battle between the Bene Gesserit and their bastard offspring, the Honored Matres. In Heretics of Dune, the previous novel, we meet the Honored Matres for the first time. One of them is captured and converted (but how thoroughly) to a Bene Gesserit. Meanwhile, Darwi Odrade, Mother Superior, fights to save what little is left of the Bene Gesserit planets.We get a much closer look at Bene Gesserit training from the inside, life on their secret Chapterhouse Planet and a hint of greater forces at work behind the scenes. The ending is equivocal; either Herbert intended another novel to answer these questions, or he deliberately left it open for us to fill in the blanks.Either way, this is an exciting conclusion to the Dune Series and along with Heretics, one of the best novels in the series. If you are curious which books can be read in what order, you can read God Emperor, Heretics and Chapterhouse as a single trilogy, or just Heretics and Chapterhouse. Of course, if you are impressed by Herbert's Dune series, you will want to read them all in order: Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse Dune. In addition, Brian Herbert has added Dune: House Atreides and Dune: House Harkonnen, which are &quot;prequels.&quot;"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"I read the first of Dune series 14 years ago, and had no conception of the breathtaking distances that the author would take towards the &quot;last&quot; book of the Dune Chronicles. While it is conceivable that someone with sufficient patience can read Chapterhouse Dune and fully appreciate it with no other Dune Chronicles exposure, it would seem criminal to recommend this book to someone without ensuring they had read the first five beforehand. Or, for something of a treat, read Chapterhouse, and then jump to the first five as &quot;prequels&quot;! I recently did something similar when I read the second and third Dune Chronicle books for the first times in 14 years, having reread the last two books in the last few months: quite an enthralling effect! The hardest part of reading this book was coming to the ending, and feeling selfishly deprived regarding the prospect of finding out What Will Happen Next as a result of the author's death, which in turn came shortly after the death of his wife following a long fight with cancer. Herbert created an astonishing world of breathtakingly evolved characters and contexts to appreciate them in. I have reread this book and others of the series numerous times. As is the case for meeting interesting characters in real life, it is poignant getting to know these characters only to lose the ability to anticipate being in touch with them later on, to find out how they're doing... The formidable detail and richness of perspectives is such that while reading it I was at times fearful of discovering a gimmick or a cliche to undo the trance worked by the book. This never happened. The publishing of the Dune Prequels is quite exciting in itself, and I hope that somewhere in the late elder Herbert's notes, are some detailed indications of SEQUELS, future Atreides audacities, Bene Gesserit contemplations and plotting, and passionately drawn characters to fall in love with and be fascinated by all over again."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"this book details the seeming hopeless struggle of the Bene Gesserit against the Honored Matres, who have destroyed Arrakis and driven the Bene Gesserit into hiding on the hidden planet Chapterhouse. there, the Bene Gesserit are creating a new Dune and attempting to breed a new population of the great sandworms.as usual, Herbert has severely altered his focus between books, although this time not quite as drastically. still, it is wise while reading Herbert to not become attached to characters, alliances or situations as they are subject to drastic change, indeed even complete obliteration, at any given moment- heros become villains, villains become heros, main characters become mere pawns. perhaps most frustrating this time around is the virtual imprisonment of Duncan Idaho within a no-ship to hide his presence from the Matres. still, he is vitally important to the main thrust of the novel and to the conclusion, which is perhaps the most brilliant and perplexing twist Herbert has ever thrown at us. after much head-scratching and pondering, it seems to me the perfect end to the greatest sci-fi epic ever."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This was the last DUNE book that Frank Herbert would ever get to write, and it's a good thing that he even got to finish it, because he died shortly after. The title of the book was given by his wife, Bev, who died before Frank did. I've read all the books in the series, some of them more than once. Although I liked this book, I wouldn't say it's Dune's equal. But it is definitely worth reading and is one of the best endings to a series that I've read. What I mean is that I found the ending very appropriate. THE FOLLOWING MAY BE SPOILING MATERIAL IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ALL OF BOOK FIVE--HERETICS OF DUNE. As you know, at the end of book 5, Dune is destroyed completely. In book six, another planet is being transformed into Dune. Forests and jungles are being stripped away in favor of the desert. At least one sandworm was salvaged from Dune and is being placed on this &quot;new&quot; Dune. But the primary focus of book six is on a new threat known as the HONORED MATRES. These are powerful females, very much like the Bene Gesserit. As in most of the Dune books, the battles aren't so much physical as they are verbal and psychological. Some old characters make reappearances in this book and some new characters are introduced. I'm not sure if Herbert intended this to be his last Dune book, but from what I've read, it's a very fitting ending to a fantastic series!"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"[Nota Bene: As Frank Herbert's last two published novels in the Dune series, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune, along with the unwritten Dune 7, in fact comprise a single story that happened to be divided into three parts, I'll post the same review for both of the two published volumes. This review contains no spoilers.]During the first half of his literary career, Frank Herbert focused most on coming to terms with what it meant to be conscious. The evolution of his thinking on the subject can be traced from real-world events which happened to him in his youth, through his earliest published science fiction stories, crude as they were, and on into novels like The Dragon in the Sea and the stories that would coalesce into The Godmakers, and certainly The Santaroga Barrier and Destination: Void. This line of thinking reached its fruition in the novels Dune and Dune Messiah.Having expanded his understanding of the full spectrum of consciousness about as far as it could go (although admittedly he never stopped tinkering with the subject), in the second half of his career Herbert refocused his attention on how the limitations imposed upon individual consciousness - or perhaps it might be better to say the limited perspective encompassing a single human lifetime - leaves humanity ill-equipped to confront an infinite and ever-changing universe. In effect we end up in a continuous crisis mode, always vainly insisting that the world of tomorrow conform to the expectations of yesterday. We're persistently and comically always shocked to discover our assumptions are wrong. Elsewhere I have described this aspect of Herbert's thinking, the human failure to deal with, or even to recognize, the implications of an unbounded universe, as an absolute-infinity breach. This theme begins to emerge in Children of Dune and is especially prominent in God Emperor of Dune, for a final surmounting of the absolute-infinity breach is the primary target of Leto II's Golden Path. But we also encounter the concern in Herbert's final trilogy: Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse: Dune, and (by implication) in the unwritten Dune 7.It is a hallmark of Herbert's imagination that he pursues an ever-elaborating expanse of concerns, always tracing a spectral pathway across a continuum of broadening bandwidth, chasing after considerations of widening implications across grander and grander scales of magnitude. An original interest in a fleeting moment of hyperconsciousness ultimately led Herbert into defining consciousness, hyperconsciousness and subconsciousness in all their aspects and dramatizing what he had learned and concluded in his stories; likewise his contemplations of the diverse implications of the absolute-infinity breach. And it might be added that he pushed his spectral analytical approach through time as well, so the Dune saga becomes probably the most temporally discontinuous series ever written. The first three novels take place roughly around the year 21,200 AD. The drama of God Emperor of Dune unfolds 3,500 years later, and that of the last three books (Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune are difficult novels, and attempting to distinguish them as separate novels, or independent from the unwritten Dune 7, is an artificial and arbitrary exercise) takes place an additional 1,500 years after that, placing us circa 26,200 AD.As the primary goal of Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune was to shatter the innate mythmaking in humanity that compels us to conservative convergence, these last three books are intended to unveil the consequences of living in a multiverse that has become irreparably divergent. This divergence followed in the wake of the downfall of the God Emperor and the subsequent Scattering of humanity not throughout multiple star systems or galaxies, but across multiple universes which are discontinuous with one another. Any threat can now come upon our heroes and heroines from any direction, but with all the eggs no longer in one basket, no matter what catastrophe might befall locally, the whole story can never come to a final end.In Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), the Bene Gesserit has recovered substantially from the tribulation of the era of the God Emperor, and now we're allowed a far more intensive view of the inner workings of the Sisterhood than ever before. But the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of the old Imperium, as ever, are confronted by a host of power-hungry enemies, new and old, in the usual style of Herbert's Machiavellian plotting. It is these plots-within-plots that seemingly all other reviewers have focused on, and I'll forego doing the same here.Herbert said it wasn't until he was writing Children of Dune that he came to understand that an important role of an author was to entertain his readership. That will come as surprising news to some of you who like Herbert, and not to some of you who don't. But it's important to note that the word \\"entertainment\\" carries different connotations for readers than it does for hacks or more seriously-aspiring authors. Entertainment is something that is doled out to the action-adventure-thriller crowd, to those who love reading or going to the movies in no small part for the sheer escapism of the thing. Now I'm not overly bigoted about this. There's nothing more boring than a book that's, well, boring. But I think what Herbert was getting at was that as he matured as a writer he came to see, as many writers do, that plot per se is less interesting than character, no matter how many car chases or lasgun exchanges are involved.I for one can't separate a reading of the last books of the Dune series from knowledge of what was going on in Herbert's life as he wrote them, which he did, by that way, at an absolutely furious pace. This happened to be during the most stressful part of his entire life. His wife, Beverly, had been dying for ten years, and the last two years of her life were especially painful for her and for her husband, both physically and emotionally. I believe that, had he lived, Frank Herbert would have easily written the Dune 7 novel to complete the series. I am less sanguine that he could ever have written another coherent novel after that one.By the time God Emperor of Dune was published in 1981, and with the signed contracts for the later Dune novels in hand, Herbert was financially secure but, as I've suggested, he was suffering from increasing emotional instability. Furthermore, I can't help believing he was struck by a supreme irony, which is that, like Paul Maud'Dib, he now found himself hemmed in by the conservative mythology of his own image which he himself had created. To this day you can still see this in reviews of his later books, wherein readers who were born after Herbert's death still bemoan the fact that his later books are not like Dune in style. Everyone wanted, and continues to want, Frank Herbert to write books that seem like quote-unquote Frank Herbert books: everyone wanted, and wants, Herbert to remain frozen unchanging in 1965. But in his later years Herbert, with his financial security, felt free to try to break out of that myth regardless of the demands and expectations of his fans, and for this I applaud him. I'm sure he did have basic plot elements in mind for the last three books of the series - call this the \\"entertainment\\" necessary to bring the masses along - but it's quite obvious that he had already grown more interested in character development than in weaving such masterful webs of palace intrigue anymore.Herbert wanted to change course, but he had not yet found a new direction. I see hints of this in Children of Dune, in which Duncan Idaho tells Alia about the practice of setting out blocks of marble in the desert to be etched by the blowing sand of a Coriolis storm. Idaho argues that the sculpted pieces produced are beautiful but they are not art, as they are not carved according to human volition. But in the latter books it is Sheeana who creates an abstract sculpture she calls \\"The Void,\\" which is art. How might these two kinds of sculpture compare? What is the symbolic significance of Sheeana's abstract work? The question is particularly relevant, it seems to me, when Sheeana's piece is recognized as a symbol set in tension with a Van Gogh which, at the end of Chapterhouse: Dune is carted off into a new, uncharted universe. Clearly, I think, the matter can be read as a form of self-psychoanalysis undertaken by the author. \\"The Void\\" is the primitive and unformed new expression welling up inside him; the old and familiar, even conventional Van Gogh has been let slip away with a fond farewell.A kind of quantum uncertainty pervades Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune which are, after all, a single story occupying multiple volumes. We do not have enough pieces to interpret this story, which must therefore remain finally unadjudicated and unjudgeable. This is because the unwritten Dune 7 was also to have comprised a full third of the complete tale. We can see that Herbert was bending writing to a new direction, and we can hazard some educated guesses about (entertaining) plot elements that would have informed the third book, but we can never know. The best we can do is ponder any written records or notes that Herbert may have left behind as poles in the sand to mark the path he intended to follow. Anyone who possesses any such notes, it seems to me, can be a good steward to the memory of Frank Herbert only by publishing them in unexpurgated form: lacking that, Herbert's career accomplishments can never be properly assessed. And that is an injustice to an important 20th century American writer.Bob R BogleAuthor of Frank Herbert: The Works"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"An alternative title to this novel may have been: Darwi Odrade, a portrait.Maybe a little melodramatic, but I think it might explain why many people find themselves not liking this novel. This is a landscape painting of Chapterhouse, and all of those connected to it. The planet is personified by Odrade herself. Changing course slowly, secretly, making plans inside of plans. One so devious and intricate that no one sees the true purpose or goals until after they had been attained. Willing participation in the golden path.While there are two more novels written by different authors, honestly though Chapterhouse Dune stands in its own unique way as a fitting conclusion to Herbert's portion of the golden path. Its continuation being your own responsibility.Reading the novel is like watching a painter, stroke by stroke, creating a piece of art. Paralleling the Van Gogh painting in Odrade's possession. While the thing is being made you can appreciate the technique and the form and skeleton of the composition, and only after it had been admired and examined from a distance can it be truly finished and appraised.What may have seemed a frivolous dialogue about clam soup in the novel is finally seen as something integral as the piece is finished - it becomes a singular brushstroke that is a part of the whole - which can never be complete without that brush stroke.The novel barks at form of metaphysics throughout that is explaining, brushstroke by brushstroke, how to decipher the piece as a whole by constantly reminding you how the masterpiece could be made up of seemingly frivolous parts strung along threads of poetry, binding together the multifaceted galaxy shaking events casually referred to, smashing into a momentary denouement that immediately splinters into a new series of threads leading off into the unknown."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Let's get this straight; Frankie boy was a genius, plain and simple. He would think nothing of writing a book for the sake of building a series and it shows itself in this effort, the sixth Dune novel. While a fantastic story (deep into politics and the nature of survival), you still get the feeling that he was building up to a climax with this book being the penultimate one. Well, in 1999 (I think), Brian Herbert discovered Frank's notes for the unreleased 'Dune 7', which included a complete outline and story for what was to be the final book in the series.Yes! I hear you say...well...we'll have to wait a bit longer I'm afraid because Brian and Kevin Anderson are doing their Butlerian Jihad series first (3 books), which won't be over until about 2004. Well we got used to waiting for Frank's books I suppose...I found this story to be the most sinister one. In every chapter there is a revelation or some indication of what is to happen next: characters like the Face Dancers and Honoured Matres shrouded in mystery, the Handlers and Futars (who bred them?), the (still) unknown qualities of the Reverand Mothers. Herbert liked to tease, and the by now infamous last chapter is still pondered over to this day. I've seen literally hundreds of different analytical studies of this chapter alone, nevermind the book or the series. Because of the open ending, the book, more than any other, has taken on a cult feel; I've seen people even try to finish the story off themselves on many different websites and forums.Addictive in the extreme, I've always got one of Frank's books (usually Dune ones) on the go at any time. I may take a week to read them, I may take a month or two...but each and every one is a sci-fi classic in its own right. My personal favourite was 'Heretics' (so well plotted and action packed and, dare I say it, even more readable than 'Dune'!).If you like Star Wars, you must get these books. In fact, you will be laughing at how primitive Star Wars is in the face of these masterpieces. Star Wars always borrowed heavily from this anyway :P"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"For almost half a year I read Frank Herbert's six DUNE books.

Anderson DUNE books, but they're nothing compared to the brilliance of Frank Herbert. Don't get me wrong, they're good in their own respect, but they lack the depth &amp; meaning that the original six had.I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel, as one of my favorite DUNE characters Miles Teg had been killed, and Dune itself destroyed.But thankfully, Frank Herbert's magic is readily apparent. Not only do you get to read an incredible story, but you get to amass a wealth of knowledge about humanity that no Humanities class could ever teach.I would've loved so much to find out more about those people Duncan see in his visions, but I probably never will. It's too bad, that would've made a great book.Many people have talked about how unfinished the DUNE legacy is because Frank Herbert died before he could write another book, but I think it better this way.Frank Herbert's imagination gave us the DUNE universe, and by not finishing it, I think he gave us a doorway into that universe, to interpet as we see fit.

This book proves it.First, though, a warning. Don't read this book if you don't like seeing what makes things tick. Remember in The Wizard of Oz when our heroes discover that the Wizard is a sham? That his effects are all put-ons? Remember how the next time you saw the movie the effects were still scary? Even though you knew now what was really going on? The moral is: knowing how powerful effects are achieved is not the death of their power. Knowing that the Dune Series was created within the imaginations of an otherwise-unremarkable couple in northwestern Washington State does NOT reduce the power of the books. If anything it enhances it. And THAT is, believe it or not, what this book is about. That's why there can never be another sequel-- why Herbert's son has produced only prequels-- why so many of my fellow reviewers have been bewildered by the ending of this, the sixth and forever-last book of the series. Herbert is saying-- &quot;Look, these were all puppets. Here are the strings. See? Nothing here was ever real-- the effects were created in my, and now YOUR, the reader's, imagination.&quot; And yet, of course, you as the reader, and he as the author, both know that it can never be that simple. Like the title character in Stravinsky's Petrouchka, the sawdust-filled puppet can move us by its 'death' as much as by its antics.And yet, while it's the perfect ending to a wonderful series, that very message is the weak point of this book as an independent book-- the plot can have no consistent resolution of its own, in order that the series as a whole CAN have one. Which is why I can give it only four stars. If I rated the series as a whole, I'd of course award the full five. But the more powerful ending that would have fulfilled the plot of this book AND the whole series TOO was not provided, so that we could be given the truer ending that brings the series to an even more emotionally resonant close. Within itself, with no reference to the previous five books, this one ends in disappointment, but the Dune series as a whole ends masterfully, as only a true puppet-master could end it. The Dune series considered as a whole is certainly the most remarkable achievement in the history of science fiction. It heads my 'top six science fiction works of all time' picks.Goodbye, Frank. May you rest in something even greater than peace. May you go to a place that may be truer and possibly even more interesting than this one. May you go to Dune!"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"In re-reading the entire series of Dune novels (most for the first time in 30 years), I have come from them with a renewed sense of their depth, flawless writing, and wonderful action. In this 6th book in the series, a direct follow-on to Heretics, the Bene Gesserit are in danger of annihilation by the Honored Matres, the savage empire run by females with new powers of seduction and sex. By far the best part of the book is the continued explication of the BG: what they really want, how they are changing their philosophy and tactics, how they do what they do. It is one of the most complete imaginative constructions in scifi, fascinating from the first page to the end. In addition to their thoughts, there are wonderfully enigmatic epigrams throughout; the density of ideas and concepts is rivaled only by Octavia Butler in my view. It is akin to reading ancient literature from an alien culture, say, the classical greeks with their polytheistic universe.The plot - how to save the sisterhood and perhaps even the Golden Path - is packed with action and surprises. The Bene Tleilax and all other original powers are either destroyed or hopelessly co-opted. Odrade, confirmed in her role as mother superior, is hatching a plan to deal with the deluge of the Matres, who are ruthlessly violent and utterly devoid of morals. The captured young Matre, Murbella, has been trained in the BG way as a new kind of hybrid, though her loyalty to the BG is indisputed. Meanwhile, Odrade is working on a diplomatic mission, to get into the heart of the barbarian empire to hatch her plan, very possibly at the cost of her life. It is a terrible, desperate gamble that remains deliciously difficult to discern right to the very end.I don't want to reveal what happens, of course. At any rate, the results are splendidly ambiguous. On the one hand, the sisterhood appears poised to survive, but at great cost that may transform them fundamentally. That being said, a cohort escapes, which includes Duncan and Teg (gholas both) as well as the original cast as clonable cells within the last surviving Tleilaxu master. There are also the mysterious Face Dancers who continually appear to Duncan, a development that is completely unexplained.Clearly, Herbert intended to write another volume or two but passed away before he could. Nonetheless, I believe that this book offers so many clues as to what it all means - the search to diversify mankind to such an extent that no one will ever rule them all again - that it is indeed complete. That being said, it is impossible that the follow-on volumes by his son and the inferior hack, Kevin Anderson, can match the intellectual and dramatic density of the original series. Only Frank Herbert could have continued it, so their knock-offs will fall way short of the mark.Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"In the past twelve years (since the HERETICS OF DUNE), the Honoured Matres have devastated the Bene Gesserit to the point their adversaries are nearing extinction; their last enclave is a slowly changing Chapterhouse into the desert realm like they once had on Dune. The desperate Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Darwi Odrade knows her Sisterhood is in deep trouble. Their only hope resides with technology taken from the now almost extinct Bene Tleilax whose last survivor Scytale is in captivity.The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood creates a ghola of Miles Teg, but no one knows how to use it against the enemy only that they must train the ghola to be their counter weapon as he has been used in many lifetimes before. Meanwhile the Sisterhood also mentors with training the application of the Coda ex Honoured Matre Murbella and her lover Duncan Idaho in hopes that they prove useful. However a tribe of Jews offer to help the Bene Gesserit as they know what the final solution means to them if the Honoured Matres win as seems likely.This is a reprint of the 1985 final book written by Frank Herbert in the Dune Chronicles with the concentration about 90 plus percent on Odrade and her efforts to save her group by correcting a major defect in all of the Bene Gesserit that leaves them vulnerable to the enemy. This is a fascinating well written tale; however that focus also means minimal appearance by the Honoured Matres so the big theme never moves forward much. The completion of that overarching saga was done in collaboration by the late great author's son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson based on notes left behind. Fans should read previous Dune books before Chapterhouse and the collaboration of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson starting with HUNTERS OF DUNE to obtain the full flavor as this entry is a betweener tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Of the Dune Chronicles, this was the hardest to read enthusiastically. I enjoyed Heretics, because I really liked Teg and Sheanna a lot. The only saving grace this novel has for the first half is Duncan, leaving the Great Honored Matres, Scytale, and Odrade to make the story happen. The new characters in this story provide very little of interest, and the characters surfacing from diaspora are even more lame. The second half of the book gets much more interesting, but barely saves this story. The last 100 pages are pretty good, and unpredictable. I'm actually looking forward to reading Hunters of Dune, although after reading this one, I don't understand why the first 300 pages of this were even necessary, because it was just a lot of political and religious philosophy.

For once it is not a book with simplistic and overused plots. It also provokes a variety of raw, primal emotions throughtout that cotradicts the intellectuality of the work, but however when thse two are combined a surprising compound is prodced (as proved).We cry at the Sea Child's death, and with joyous uproar greet Rebecca's arrival and existence.

I looked forward to the dialogue in the other Dune books, but this was hardly bearable.For all it's focus on the Bene Gesserit, we only get a more superficial view of them. We get meaningless details like what Mother Superior's favorite meal is. In fact, the Bene Gesserits come off more as caddy, self-absorbed witches than anything else. As the mystical overtures of Dune fade into a life and death match, we learn that the Bene Gesserit really aren't that great.While overall this is a far superior series to anything I've ever read before, all the things I felt were flaws with the series come to a head in Chapterhouse. Herbert has this habit of skipping wonderful oppurtunities to develop a part of the universe in exchange for focusing on one aspect that wasn't really all that interesting to begin with. He also likes to skip the parts where anything important actually happens--prefering instead to describe the results of those parts. Herbert's mastery of dialogue slips in this book. The characters are one dimensional and just spout out philoshophical one-liners.I don't think this book takes the series anywhere new. Everything it deals with was already introduced in Heretics. I admit, it does goes into a lot of political philosophy--but I didn't feel like this had any weight behind it. I was the most dissapointed after I realized that the series didn't really have an end goal in mind. After God Emporer, the series meanders and looses it's direction.

This stands in stark contrast to the earlier Dune books which focuses on the role of the environment in shaping people.In some ways I feel that Herbert is like Leto II of the earlier books in this series, he is trying to break away from the narrative he established earlier and finding it very difficult. Also like Leto II, he cannot seem to rid himself of Duncan Idaho.The Chapterhouse Dune has all the philosophical and political discussions of his earlier works, but many of the arguments are familiar by this point.This is still a great book, and well worth reading but simply doesn't measure up to the earlier texts."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This is the last Dune book written by Frank Herbert.

Reading the view of the Great Honored Matre and the Mother Superior, respective leaders of their schools, gives great insight into the differences and similarities between the two.I get the impression another book was to follow this one since several strong characters weren't utilized to their full potential and questions left unanswered. Duncan Idaho's regulated actions by the Bene Gesserit fearing he might be a Kwisatz Haderach limit the use of his Weapons Master abilities. Also Scytale and two mysterious characters in Duncan's visions become a non-factor. The series has evolved with spice addiction falling into the background, although the sandworm is not as common as millennium past. No appendixes conclude the novel but still a glossary would have sufficed. A detailed map of the significant terrains, especially with the climate transformation, would have been useful.I highly recommend the series to any fan of the science fiction genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This is a wonderful story filled with just as much intrigue as the previous 5. You sense something new and different in Herbert's writting style and while it's difficult to place you know you like it. While the ending of this book isn't quite how Herbert intended to end the serious I like it. And I pray Brian Herbert doesn't make a horrible attempt at completing the serious he has already proved he never understood his fathers vision. I would buy this book if only to read the dedication at the end to Frank Herberts wife, it will bring tears to your eyes...it did mine."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Chapter House showed the folly of believing that you may effect change on others without changing yourself.

I loved all the other books and it started out promising. However, Herbert was obviously rushed and seemed to forget whole plots and characters as he raced to the ending. As I writer I would guess he was under publishing pressure? And what about adding the Jewish contingent? It comes out of nowhere in this series and doesn't seem to mesh. The \\"wild\\" sister is an interesting element but her rabbi is merely annoying. The Tleilaxu is completely forgotton and Ghola Miles Teg (literally) cast aside at the climax. What of Duncan Idaho? He seems more and more a simple keyboard jockey in the last book and a half of the series. He should be the coolest character and is also left adrift blasting off into space with the character that should have been the heroine of the last two books, Sheeana of Dune (Rakis). Sheeana was akin to the Fremen and had a much more interesting background and possible future than Darwi Odrade, the sentimental, bureaucratic heroine of the last two books (until also murdered and cast aside at the last moment). I found the final book even cloying. What was Herbert thinking? The epilogue by the author with the dedication to his recently deceased wife was far more compelling than the whole book! It just shows that the farther you go from the planet Dune the weaker the series ....Please don't tell me to read the continuing series written by others. What did George Lucas say about those who wrote or created other STAR WARS stories? To paraphrase: \\"STAR WARS is the gospel, the rest is gossip.\\" What a publisher does to meet the bottom line does not interest me, even if they hire the original writer's son.Still, we have the first four books which are SF masterpieces and the first, DUNE, will go down in history as a monumental achievement, so we have the elder Herbert to thank for hours of enjoyment in the DUNE universe.Long live the fighters!"},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This book, and the series that precede it are masterful.

I can't say anymore."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Herbert gives all the necessary clues to the sequel. The goal is for each next phase of humanity to become an unidentifiable living mirror of the universe. Leave no tracks for any to follow. Heighten all the important human abilities: consciousness, sex, speed, emotion. Maintain resistance to the lures of these enhancements. Sheeana undergoes the Shai-hulud metamorphosis on a new Dune-like world. She weeds the future populations for better mimesis. Scytale recreates the entire Tleitaxu population as well as the original Dune characters. Teg's abilities for speed and to see the no-ships spread quickly to succeeding generations. Sheeana breeds a biological mimic that can hide from Teg's descendents and from the Face Dancer/Handlers of the Scattering. Better No-ships are invented, restoring invisibility, by having navigational abilities held within the consciousness, not on circuits. The descendents return to Murbella's universe and wrest control from the Handlers. Scytale and Duncan Idaho create more serial gholas with extraordinary abilities, they become a parallel development to the Handlers of the old universe. The Golden Path continues, more stasis and weeding followed by explosive scattering. Sheeana's dance of propitiation is converted to biological reflexive mirroring of the universe, the predators go hungry."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"This book was the culmination of many years of anticipation for me.

Never before have I read books that I truly did not fully comprehend. Yet I still abosolutely adored the series.I think one thing that Chapterhouse proves is that endings are ALWAYS unexpected in some way. I think it also proves that, while 'life is a b1tch,'(or Honored Matre in Dune's case), there is ALWAYS some contentment to be found. Another thing Herbert stresses is that questions beget questions; answers beget more questions.I'm not going to trouble you good readers with more sayings and aphorisms, but instead will fill you in on some things. For one, Brian Herbert plans to write 'DUNE 7' after he finishes his other prequels--including The Battle of Corrin and (I think) the last book in the 'Houses' series.I personnally hope that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson take a large dose of melange and UP THE BAR for DUNE 7 if they plan on doing a satisfactory, (by that I mean extraordinary) job. I don't want to have to read that silly 'wheels within wheels' dribble all over again. Even I, a mere 14-year-old, could come up with more original material. :PAnd if by some chance, Herbert and Anderson DO create something sub-par, do not ridicule them, or fear reading their culminations, for &quot;Fear is the mind-killer...."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"A wonderous closer to Frank Herbert's work, and while it doesn't complete the saga, at least we have his son and Keven J Anderson to finish it and clear everything up."},{"Title":"Chapterhouse: Dune","review":"Good conclusion, Frank herbert really delivered on the hole series, i do hope that his son finishes the books and doesn't mess them up.

There is no rule in the universe when it comes to be or not to be?4. Even your enemy can rule you if you teach her/him the reason of your existence?5.

Nothing else seems to matter as much as the beautiful universe created by Frank Herbert and his wife.Perhaps the most gut-wrenching and emotional moments in all of the books is the end of this one.

Providing one keeps sound understanding of what language is made up of and what sound language teaching sonsists of. The Clear Speech book is extememly useful, fun, and interesting to both the learner and the teacher. Informed language teachers realise that language is not infact just about discreet points of aspects about language i.e. it is about successful communication and involves all the skills including socio-linguisitic as well as purely linguistic features. We know these days that language needs to be approched with an ecclectic perspective and the learners' needs foremost as part of the program. Part of any program should include pronunciation, so long as it is in balance. This book focuses on the wider influences surrounding pronunciation which affect overall fluency and language proficiency, for example, stress, intonation, timimg, rythum, syllable-length, patterning, listening. Most importantly, I would argue that it is a very soundly designed book usefull for serious language teachers which will help develop a monitoring system into the learners' language useage, thus influencing significantly their fluency. In this context, the exercises are very beneficial. They are not so focused as to ignore or take the place of the wider needs and other macro skills that need more attention overall such as general conversation etc, but offers a user friendly and relative set of exercises in a format that has continuity if desired or can be utilised in a selective supplimentary tool.

It is not in the same level of any other textbook in any sense."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Teacher's resource book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"I got this book to help one of my advanced level students with her pronunciation. I was surprised at what the book really focuses on, and I have found it to be quite helpful. THE GOOD: 1) This book is different from other pronunciation books in that it only spends part of the time focusing on the sounds of English letters. Rather, it is organized into chapters based on other features of English, such as rhythm, linking, syllable length, stress, intonation and reduction. This is a wonderful &quot;next step&quot; for students who have had adequate practice with the sounds of English letters, but still have an accent. 2) It provides practice exercises that allow the student to practice more than one thing at a time. For example, one exercise allows the student to practice linking words while practicing the &quot;sh&quot; sound. 3) I think that the most valuable part of this book is the Clear Listening and Clear Speaking test at the beginning of the book. These allow teachers to get very specific responses from students, and then focus on the problem areas. THE BAD: While the book is great at helping students practice consonant sounds, it doesn't give much practice or help with vowel sounds. This is really my only complaint with this otherwise wonderful book. OVERALL: A great book that will help students fine tune their English speech. I recommend it for high-intermediate or advanced students. If students are looking for a good way to reduce their accents, or make themselves more understood by Americans, or even understand North American English better themselves then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Teacher's resource book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"Clear Speech is a well-conceived pronunciation text that, in my experience, students have found very pleasant to use. It covers individual sounds, as well as speech rhythm and intonation, in a very fluid way. It can help instructors teach ESL students to pronounce well not only word by word, but also to arrive at more natural-sounding sentence flow. I have found that the exercises in the book benefit students beyond their own pronunciation, and actually help them to understand native English speakers better. The third edition is a vast improvement over the previous one, because it guides students in deciphering English spelling and provides more practice in specific, troublesome sounds. The new edition also includes a practice CD, which is something many students using the second edition often wished for. The graphic simplicity of the book is a huge advantage over other pronunciation texts available. All in all, I think Clear Speech is one of the best - if not THE best - choice for teaching pronunciation."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Teacher's resource book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"I split this book to create a 2-level pronunciation course for lower intermediate and higher students in Japan. The courses were extremely well received time and time again. The book is an excellent guide for such classes.I rated the book at 5-stars on its own merit. However, together with the audio cassettes I would have given it four and a half stars, as I believe the audio component needs to be available on CD for cueing purposes and ease of use.Teachers who have training in teaching pronunciation will probably be delighted with the book. Instructors trying to use the book without the benefit of training in teaching pronunciation may not have the background to utilize it fully.Rather than use the tapes an instructor can easily use their own pronunciation to model the lesson targets. This allows for easy adjustments of the speed, timing and rhythm of the exercises for different class groups.Students can practice the targets as a group, and then individually during the listen and repeat sections. The students generally loved the excellent pair work that followed, which allowed them to further practice and master to some degree what they had covered.As much as it is a pronunciation course, listening skills are an equally strong component. Again, the pair work was excellent in ensuring each student strove to achieve the listening and production targets.This book allowed mixed levels of students to work together harmoniously, challenge themselves in a very enjoyable and insightful way, and achieve real gains in their struggles to produce and understand spoken English.

I used the first edition with far more student successes because each chapter was built on the preceeding ones and stuck to the basics. In contrast, the second edition is TOO full of the many intonation elements all jammed and crammed into each chapter. Frankly, I was hoping that the second edition would give us more practice examples to solidify the the basic intonation elements people need and most can absorb. Instead,by comparison to the first edition, the book is overfilled with way too much &quot;stuff&quot;. Still, it's the best book on the market in it's class and I would highly recommend it to the trainers. I believe most students will have difficulty sorting out and dealing with the &quot;details&quot; in each chapter on their own.

While it is quite dense in facts, and while parts of it might have to be reread in order to digest the incredible amount of material you are given, it is possibly the best introduction to Western thought available.

He does this withthe elegance of epic poetry and the high seriousness of philosophy,presented in an even, accessible style that will appeal to both theinterested layperson and the professional scholar. There is a\\"fascinating lucidity\\" in this writing. It has been called ahumanities education in one volume, a masterpiece, and the finesttreatment ever written on the grand lines of Western culture. Tarnasmatches a deep, sustaining vision with impeccable scholarship,balance, and the sheer effort required to create something ofworld-changing quality.The Passion covers the long, bittersweetjourney of the Western mind from the end of the goddess-worshippingera to the present global crisis. The ancient Greeks, Hellenism,Judao-Christianity, the medieval era, the development and then massivedeconstruction of the modern world view, are all impartiallyapproached on their own terms. Tarnas says that the history of acivilization is like a kind of great unconscious. Just as individualsmust rediscover their roots, the shaping forces of their past, inorder to become more fully free and conscious, so too must acivilization. Tarnas was deeply influenced by the depth psychology ofC.G. Jung, Joseph Campbell, and Stanislav Grof, and he complements aHarvard academic background with a very credible exploration of hisown unconscious. Living for ten years at the Esalen Institute wherehe was director of programs, these insights were cross-fertilized bymany of the most innovative currents of thought in the world.Thedeconstruction of &quot;patriarchal, Eurocentric, and anthropocentricassumptions and values,&quot; accompanied with the rise and return offeminist, ecological, multicultural, archaic, aboriginal,psychological, and Eastern perspectives have a prominent role inTarnas' writing. But he seeks also to redeem the heroic-tragicWestern history as not merely an &quot;imperialist-chauvinistplot,&quot; but as a necessary part of larger evolutionary process.Tarnas is suggesting that the long Western trajectory--from anoriginal &quot;participation mystique&quot; with nature and the GreatMother Goddess, through the rise of patriarchy and science, to theincreasing and finally intolerable alienation of modern humanity--mayreflect the ordered contractions of a universe struggling to givebirth to a new consciousness on this planet. Like the loss of thewomb paradise that the infant must suffer through in order to be bornas a human and ecstatically reunited with the mother, thedisintegration of old structures may be a necessary prelude to anenormous collective rebirth, coming home again to nature, psyche, andthe feminine.The Passion of the Western Mind is already widely usedin graduate faculties across North America and has been met withalmost universal admiration, as a major cultural watershed. Theimplications of this writing, and a second volume nearing completion,challenge the old modern and postmodern world views to their verycores, and offer a new and sustaining cosmology, consistent with theholistic vision emerging to us from all sides. Tarnas has bridgedbetween the old world and the new.

It is, however, disappointing that his summation of such an important work becomes the &quot;archetypical&quot; embodiment of Tarnas' own proposition that, &quot;Scientists, like everyone else, are attached to their beliefs.&quot; His epilogue expresses a narrow psychodynamic perspective on the post-modern philosophical quest. Although Tarnas' conclusion could have been less myopic and psychodynamically dogmatic, his ability to articulate the overall development of Western thought is to be commended."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The epilogue in Richard Tarnas' book is bold, inventive and exciting. This is the part I read first while browsing in the bookstore. It prompted me to buy the book. The balance between the development of Christian thought and secular philosophy is masterfully interwoven in lucid style. When I finished the book and studied the epilogue I realized that the excitement I felt when I first read abstracts of the the epilogue was based on the scientific side of the concepts presented. As a physician and scientist, I have marveled at the speed of technological discovery in the twentieth century. Most of the biological advances were made possible by the Newtonian-Cartesian revolution. While the human genome will soon be completely sequenced, neuroscience still has not revealed the nature of memory and consciousness. Western thought is dependent on our awareness and it is appropriate to incorporate Grof's observations of the transpersonal realm of human understanding in looking to the future development of philosophy. Thirty years of careful research in the psyche produced information of a perinatal consciousness which promises to advance our understanding of the world around us. The other major theme in the epilogue is the narrowing of the gender identity, which also influences our understanding of consciousness. I gained new insights from this book. It should adorn the shelves of every college freshman and every thinking person."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"If you are thinking of buying this book, please pay no attention to thoughtless reviews written by people who either have an axe to grind or do not have the power to understand that which they are &quot;reviewing.&quot; The one-star review on this page brings to my mind the quote: &quot;It takes a carpenter to build a barn, but any jackass can knock it down.&quot; Richard Tarnas has written a masterful book that makes &quot;the ideas that have shaped our world view&quot; highly accessible. The epilogue is a brilliant piece of thinking, and a lovely piece of writing."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"After reading this impressive work I come away with mixed feelings. Tarnas covers the major and many minor figures in the canon of Western Philosophical thought. At times his synthesis and intepretation of some rather difficult philosophical concepts was truly brilliant. The book does suffer from being a translation from a Spanish work. Tarnas seems to be actively trying to demonstrate the importance of Spain's 20th century philosophers. However, what I feel seriously detracts from the book are phrases and whole lines of spanish, latin, french and german which are used repeatedly and never translated. I feel that I missed many points because my latin is not up to snuff. In one particularly egregious incident a french passage is translated into spanish but not into english. With the polyglot requirement aside this is an excellent text and Tarnas is clearly a gifted thinker if not a gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The author makes no claims of being unbiased. Critics should examine their own reference frame. The book is more a philosophical perspective of history, than a historical perspective of philosophy. It represents not group think of the masses but the thinking put forth by the intellectual elite of every age--those individuals who make ideas their business, and ride the crest of the evolutionary wave of meme development. The book is clearly (to me) influenced by the human potential movement. After all, Tarnas was director of programs at Esalen Institute. Had I not read extensively in theology (BA in Religion), philosphy, psychology, and physical science (MD), I would have perhaps had a different reaction to this book. For me, it was the right book at the right time (right in the midst of writing my own critique of my profession of medicine and psychiatry). Just as some have walked out on Eckart Tolle muttering, \\"What a load of rubbish!\\", while others have found a soul-resonating truth, we all bring our own biases and perspectives to every experience. For me, \\"The Passion of the Western Mind\\" is perhaps the most enlightening book I have ever read from the perspective of \\"putting it all together\\" in a grand synthesis. I disagree with several of the 1 and 2 star criticisms. I read Groff's work years ago and personally dialogued with him in person. I didn't appreciate his insights at the time. Anyone familiar with the work of Margaret Mahler on the Psychological Birth of the Human Infant will immediately see the extension of those concepts into the gestational and perinatal periods. Tarnas's perspective is not the retro-mythological regression called \\"New Age.\\" Anyone who thinks that, missed the whole point. Tarnas attempts to move beyond the existential alienation of a completely objectified, meaningless, mechanized world, to a higher synthesis--an integration, where the split between subject and object is ultimately overcome, as revealed in statements such as, \\"Nature becomes intelligible to itself through the human mind,\\" and \\"The evolution of human knowledge is the evolution of the world's self-revelation.\\" Similar statements are made by contemporary physicists, biologists, and other scientists, who have gone beyond the reductionist program that has ruled modern science since its inception, and embraced a systems perspective that includes the observer as part of the data to be analyzed. Tarnas insightfully exposes the myth of the unbiased, objective mind so idealized in modern science: \\"The great irony...is that it is just when the modern mind believes it has most fully purified itself from any anthropomorphic projections, when it actively construes the world as unconscious, mechanistic, and impersonal, it is just then that the world is most completely a selective construct of the human mind...From this perspective, it is the modern mind's own impersonal soullessness that has been projected from within onto the world--or, to be more precise, that has been projectively elicited from the world.\\" (Page 432). My sense is that Tarnas has suggested a viable solution to the dilemma facing post-modern man. It seems to be a psychologically and spiritually adaptive way to embrace uncertainty and ambiguity as opposed to the rise of regressive and militant fundamentalism/tribalism that seems to be ensnaring our planet. I cast my vote for \\"The Passion of the Western Mind\\" for our next book club selection."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Richard Tarnas, The Passion of the Western Mind (1991, pocket edition 1993) is an admirable survey, characterized by stringency and verbal intuition, Tarnas narrates the history of the Western mind up to our days, and in this way shows how our world view originated - the world view where Man monopolized conscious intelligence, while cosmos is turned blind and mechanistic, and God is dead. Man has become a stranger in his own world. This, however, has generated a longing for the communion that was lost. The deepest passion of the Western mind, Tarnas means, is to transcend this worldview by a reunion with Nature, from which Man once emerged. \\"The telos, the inner direction and goal of the Western mind has been to reconnect with the cosmos in a mature participation mystique, to surrender itself freely and consciously in the embrace of a larger unity that preserves human autonomy while also transcending human alienation\\" (p. 443 f). This, one might say, is the same idea and feeling that is found in Selma Lagerl&ouml;f's compositions on Man and Nature, and in Prigogine's demonstration that the whole world - Man included - functions as self-organizing systems."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I am very happy to give my comments regarding Tarnas' book. The detail and research that went into this book is staggerring. It is a tour de force and a must read for anybody who wants to gain a greater understanding of who we are, where we've been and where we're going. Because of his educated analysis, the reader is treated with an invaluable perspective moving into the new millenium."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"super tight it's tight i like tight stuff it's real tight yeah that's tight you know what's tight? this is tight."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The comment on the jacket is right, the author has made quite a story of what could be pretty dry material. As an introduction to the history of Western thought on the level of, say, Joseph Campbell's work (one of those quoted as praising it), I'd recommend it. In fact I got so interested in the the implications of what looked like a quote from Justin Martyr that I went looking for the original.Fortunately, what we have of Justin Martyr's work is on the web, and it does not take very long to read it all. Unfortunately, the quoted phrase was not present in that work. Instead of unreservedly praising Plato as a \\"Christian before Christ\\", Justin Martyr actually spent a lot of time saying unkind things about him and the harmfulness of his philosophy. He did in one place suggest that a virtuous man like Socrates should indeed be regarded as a christian, following the spirit of Christ before his appearance, but Plato was not mentioned in that connection. I saw nothing that would really support the point that Tarnas seemed to want to make. And then in the last chapter Tarnas went off on a tangent that seemed to me of minor significance and doubtful validity.So a good read, and worth the time as a first introduction or as a source of interesting ideas, but not entirely trustworthy. Anything you are going to rely on from it should be checked."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"If one ignores the epilogue, this is an excellent book. Tarnas has performed a magnificent task with his historical review of western philosophical thought and development - from Socrates to Camu and Jung with fascinating chapters reviewing the tremondous role of Christian theology (good and bad) in our &quot;western&quot; philosophical development. Portions of the book are a bit dense - but to be fair such is the nature of the material.The epilogue however is another story. During my career as a physician, I have found that the worst lectures and presentations are given by those who are discussing their own research as opposed to analyzing and synthesizing other people's works. Tarnas falls victim to this hubris. The notion that Grof/Jungian psychodelic regression therapy in which one relive's his or her birthing trauma is an effective therapy for one's current psycho-social maladies is truly comical. On one hand science is experiencing an epistemological crisis, yet LSD tripping confabulations about the traumatic birthing expulsion from the &quot;mother ship&quot; is rigorous psychology? Gimme a break. I will stick with science for now."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"While the author gives an engaging summary of the twists and turns of Western thought, I often felt as one listening to an explanation of a great art exhibit, but never allowed to see the pictures. The book suffers from a lack of direct exposure to the original material"},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The language used by Tarnas is delicious. The message poignant. The text meaningful. wow."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The early parts of the text provide some helpful summary writing. However, this is the cheese used to lure the reader in the mousetrap of politically correct nonsense with which the volume verbosely ends. The book starts as a river, and ends in a scattered and unrelated drain of tributaries. Feminist critique of science (and other fashionable but superficial faddish &quot;thinking&quot;) is actually taken seriously, while having been rejected by women and men alike who work in the sciences. The author's psychologizing is silly, and is never applied to his own motivations for writing his own text. Like the prisoners in Plato's cave, the author nevers ultimately ascends from the shadow of philosophical prejudice, which covers his work like a shroud."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Tarnis's treatment of part III & IV are commendable, for the accuracy of historical facts, and for the scope of subjects covered. The last part, Epilogue, is something else entirely, full of subjective arguments for unsupported ideas.( mainly depth psychology studied on drug-induced subjects) The last time I found something about him on the internet, he was talking about aligning of planets as the cause of 9-11 tragedy. It is mind-boggling even to think of someone, of his intellectual capacity, being lured into astrology."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I won't write much here as many have done a great job of summation, however I did just want to voice my disappointment with the epilogue. Much of the book seems to have the intellectual and reasearch rigour I like to see in such books, but the new age nonsense really leads me to question his credibility and so doubt I read till I reached it. Though its obviously not as up to date or the same in its attempted scope I would personally recommend Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy\\" for a more insightful look at Western thought or even Watson's \\"Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud\\"."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"A great account of Western history, but with too many unnecessary words and too many complex sentences. The wording of the book makes it a lot less enjoyable than it should be. I wish I could find a similar book without Tarnas' annoying writing style."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This is one of the most important and valuable books I have ever read. I had the feeling throughout that I was being given a great gift, namely: the lucid unravelling--strand by strand--of a whole complex of issues that are so deeply intertwined in the Western psyche that many have become lost in the maze. Remarkably, this book somehow unravelled the puzzle, and left a spacious clarity in my mind--about how we got here, and where we're headed--that has remained with me ever since.I feel especially compelled to comment on the book's masterful treatment of science. The &quot;Crisis of Science&quot; chapter beautifully summarizes the profound epistemological crisis facing science today. As one physicist put it (Ravi Ravinda), &quot;the greatest discovery of modern science is the discovery of its own limitations.&quot; Having myself been raised in a scientific community and employed for much of my professional life as a research physicist and mathematician, I am deeply familiar with the complex issues that Tarnas addresses here. And I was very impressed with the non-polemic accuracy of his interpretations. For example, in his summary of quantum mechanics, Tarnas avoids the often facile and sensationalist interpretations that have become familiar in the popular press, and instead he summarizes in clear conceptual terms the major scientific findings, and their consequent philosophical and ontological implications. Indeed, it was Tarnas' careful and precise treatment of subtle scientific issues--with which I was intimately familiar--that increased my confidence in the scholarly integrity of the book as a whole--which covered many areas with which I am much less familiar."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I once heard a story that Tarnas would fire up a doobie before sitting down to write material for this book, and the rumor seems true in light of Tarnas' regular use of extended turns of nuanced phrase. That prose style is at once the major strength and weakness of this work. The fact that each paragraph comprises several precisely written (if overlong) sentences each containing at least one exhaustive list of examples makes for cumbersome reading, as I often have to reread the same sentence three or more times for the whole import to sink in. At the same time, this style does a fine job of articulating the manifold, complex, and often contradictory ways in which the seminal themes of Western thought have interacted. (For example, Tarnas does a brilliant job of showing how many of the ideas of the Protestant Reformation ironically contributed to the later undermining of Christian certitude and the rise of scientific materialism.)I have other issues with the book, most of which have been described elsewhere on this site. Tarnas' lack of citations and primary sources (i.e., where he is getting his information?) make this a less-than scholarly review of Western thought, his repeated emphasis on astrology left me cold (which is odd, considering that I am a Leo-Virgo), his chapters on the late modern period and postmodernity need to be expanded upon, and his epilogue is a bit flakier than even I like.That said, I will re-read this book and will recommend it to any reading about Western philosophy. It is a lively introduction to Western thought that does a darn fine job of pointing out the complex inter-relatedness of disparate elements and how they've played out over the last 2500 years."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This is a misleading book. It could have been longer and deeper, but most of the final 100 pages (nearly 25% of the text) could have been substantially rewritten. It starts out well enough with the Greeks, goes through Christianity (without much discussion of Judaism), tries to revive itself with discussions of science (mainly astronomy and evolutionary biology) and the Renaissance, slogs through the Enlightenment, and then gets lost in the void brought up by Romanticism, never to escape. It finally bogs down in an epilogue using such terms as \\"psychodynamic theory,\\" \\"perinatal experience,\\" the \\"Great Mother Goddess,\\" and \\"ego death,\\" while outlining the problems the author has with eurocentrism and masculinity.Let's just say I found myself growing more and more disillusioned as I went on. Dozens of thinkers and concepts are mentioned, often in the same sentence. Lists (cloaked as long sentences) are passed off as analysis. The index makes this seem like a comprehensive work but many of the entries mainly refer to the inclusion of many thinkers in a long timeline at the end of the book.The book emphasizes doubts surrounding modern physics and cosmology but then does not even question the existence of such things as the Oedipus complex, archetypes, or a collective unconscious. Late 19th and 20th century thought gets short shrift. Shouldn't the development of sociology or the discovery of the double helix count for something? In fact, it appears that the book leans heavily from the period from Kant on towards discussing \\"deep\\" psychology and the \\"mind\\" rather than western thought as a whole. Reading backwards it is possible to see this bias from the very beginning.The author makes the valid and obvious point that women largely have been excluded from the development of the modern world view but himself excludes, for example, any mention of Mary Shelley in his discussion of Romanticism and the crisis of modern science. It is almost as if women were deliberately excluded from discussions of the modern era in order to make the argument in the epilogue seem more powerful. Especially since that argument calls mostly on men to create a new world view by \\"heroically\\" casting aside their one-sided perspectives. The final line? \\"Man is something that must be overcome - and fulfilled, in the embrace of the feminine.\\" But doesn't this just perpetuate the same distinctions? Here again men are put in the position to act, while women, it would seem, need only sit around and stay \\"feminine.\\" Are we to believe that only men face spiritual emptiness in the modern era? And that women should be passive? And that masculinity and femininity are in a sense static and essential categories that cannot be changed but only submerged, overcome, or destroyed?If you buy this book, get it because its historical summary part - admittedly the most substantial part of the work - is adequate enough (I guess) and then skim the last 30 pages. Sadly enough, there really aren't any other one volume chronological introductions to western thought. Just beware - I felt ripped-off at the end when I realized this book is more of a history of the ideas that inspired the author's own world view rather than of those that shaped that of a larger part of the world.The more philosophically inclined may want to check out the more concept-based Introduction to Western Philosophy by Anthony Flew. It's a bit drier, but much more rigorous. And hey, if you see something you like, you can always pick up the writings of the philosophers themselves as well, can't you?"},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I made it almost all the way through this book thinking that it was *only* an excellent history of western thought. ...and then I got to the Epilogue. Here, in a flurry worthy of a Perry Mason movie, Tarnas unleashes the brilliant arguments he has been slowly building throughout his historical account. Weeks later, I am still awestruck.Don't spoil it for yourself--read the text first--but when you get to the epilogue, put your feet up, crack a beer and enjoy.Richard Tarnas has written a phenomenally good book."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Tarnas begins with Plato, working backward and forward from him. Plato's Forms, in particular, set the stage for the rest of the book, in my view. According to Plato, there are transcendent Forms for 'Man', 'Tree', 'Woman', for example, that the soul was exposed to before birth and remembers later in life. These Forms are timeless, trancendent and most, Beautiful.Aristotle, the tenth in line from Pythagoras, quickly relegates Plato's Forms to the particular, noting their birth, maturation and decay within the object with no recourse to a transcendent realm.The important thing is, in the greek rationalism of both Plato and Aristotle, the world is knowable and is a Cosmos, an ordered whole that can be readily understood by the human mind.The philosophies of Plato and Aristotle move to the Arabics during the Dark Ages, until the medieval times, when the Arabics courteously return the two behemoths to western civilization where St. Augustine applies Platonic thought to theology, while St. Thomas Aquinas later does the same with Aristotle.Somewhere in the mix, Ockham applies his razor to the idea of the Forms, being the first to deny a Form's transcendent or immanent reality, but rather positing that the Form is a construct of the human mind. Party pooper.Modern science, which has divested the world of anything human,where the universe now contains no spirit or transcendent form, sets it's sights on a disenchanted universe that is now viewed as being mechanistic at best, lifeless at worst.Man is taken, by way of Copernicus, then Kepler and Galileo, from being the absolute center of the Ptolemaic universe, to being a nondescript inhabitant on a planet moving about a sun, which is one of potentially millions of such stars in the now vast space of the experienced world.During the Enlightenment, man having eaten the soul of the Cosmos and stolen it's intelligence and claimed it for himself, suddenly turns the lense on himself thorugh Descartes and Kant.Not only is the Cosmos dead and lifeless and altogether inhuman, but man is incapable of perceiving said Cosmos in an objective way. Man inherently attaches Reality to the universe by viewing the world through the apriori lenses of time, space, cause and effect and so on.So now, we have a dead and lifeless vast impersonal universe inhabited by man, who, due to his psychological makeup, can never understand said world objectively.Nietzsche sounds the death knell. He says God is dead, but really, it is man, glourious understanding, at one with the world, man who is crucified. Nietzsche pronounces the birth of the modern era, where not by intelligence, which has been discounted, not by religion, which is suffering cognitive disonance due to the emerging scientific worldview (Darwinism, Atomism, the everexpanding nothingness peered at through ever stronger telescopic lenses), but sheer Will that will decide who is right.Finally on to the postmodern picture. History has been dominated by white european males. Not only is the universe (and man) unknowable, but we don't even know the proper questions to ask. Language is a prison, seeking to encapsulate experience and reduce Reality to the constructs of the human mind. Western man, through the prevailing dichotomy of his science and religion, has raped women, the environment, destroyed the ozone, produced the atomic bomb, and on and on. No one has hold of the Truth. Truth is provincial, localized and relative, dependent upon a contingent human being. No world view has precedence over another. There is no prevailing meta-narrative that can capture global humanity and unite it.But dear reader, there is hope. There is hope from the beginning pages of this book through to the epilogue. Tarnas wisely weaves a thread throughout that offers a glimpse into a potential new birth for mankind. Tarnas points out history seems to be coming to a culmination, something is definitely on the horizon for all of us.I leave it to you, to read this wonderful book, to discover what possibilities (if not facts) lie ahead for humanity.The book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers that noticed the sudden change of tone and scholarly level as this book comes to a close. While it is true that intellectually the 20th century has been one of a retreat from reason, no where does the author mention the great successes that have come along with that. I also find the \\"end times\\" message very distressing; to those who are unfamiliar with the current antiintellectualisms this part will strike one as odd. The rest of the book is a tour de force in every way - I wouldn't have thought one could do a history of ideas of western civilization in one volume. (Added later: There is one slight oversight in the discussion of Descartes, too. Tarnas labels Descartes an atomist - not true - Descartes' cosmology was plenist.)"},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I *think* this is the book I was looking for. I knew practically nothing about Western philosophy; I knew the names Plato, Aquinas, Descartes, Kant, and so forth, but I didn't know anything about their ideas, nor did I have any grand framework in which to place all these people. I wanted to find a good overview of Western philosophy that could teach me about all of these people and help direct my own further, more in-depth exploration of them and their writings.I'm pretty sure this book did the trick. Now that I've finished reading it, I know who all those great thinkers are and what they thought, and I have a structure within which they all fit. The book coheres, and it tells a great story. That's what I was looking for.But now I fear I might have been sold a bill of goods. Tarnas has an adventurous thesis about the trajectory of Western philosophy, and I suspect that this has caused him to leave out or de-emphasis certain concepts that don't fit in with his thesis. He doesn't mention pragmatism at all, despite the fact that pragmatism was a major force in the 20th century. William James, John Dewey, etc -- nowhere to found. But perhaps pragmatism doesn't fit with his thesis.And I'm not sure the idea of a &quot;thesis&quot; is even appropriate in a supposedly introductory book. Some philosphers, this book taught me, have showed how tempting it is for human beings to discern patterns and structures where there are none. And yet Tarnas concludes the book by presenting his own structure, his own analysis of patterns. His conclusion is kinda wacky but kinda makes sense, too. I'm not sure what to think of it.Although I enjoyed this book and feel more educated, I'm left wondering if Tarnas has twisted the narrative of Western philosophy for his own ends. And I, previously knowing nothing about Western philosophy, have absorbed it.Uh-oh."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"A single-volume history of the ideas that have shaped the Western mind.

Starting from classical (greece) the book takes you through how christianity evolved and what impact classical thought and Rome had on development of christian world-view (and vice-versa). And then author traces the development of modern and postmodern world-views, taking one through renaissance, reformation and scientific revolutions.It doesn't go in too much depth for any single idea/person, so if you want to know about Kant in detail, you will have to refer to some other work, but here you would get a good overall picture of what he was talking about, what problem he was trying to solve and what was his impact.This book would in my top-10 list to recommend to anyone who is interested in history of western world."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I got this book because it was required text for a graduate course that I am taking with the University of Denver. I initially found the sentence construction distracting-- The author uses such complex sentences with so many extraneous words that at times it is difficult to follow his meaning; however, once you get used to the author's writing style, it is easy to follow. The book is a fascinating detail of how people in the Western world have come to think and believe as they do. It outlines the great philosophers and thought movements throughout time, beginning with the Greeks. The author also explains why there is such a dichotomy in Western thinking today. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in Western philosophy, and for anyone who simply wants to understand why it is so difficult for the East and West to understand one another. This book would be a good companion to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\""},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Richard Tarnas wrote this book more than 20 years ago. Yet, a generation later, it retains a freshness and relevance today as it did then. This classical work of philosophy is a timeless treasure that will be read for generations to come. In its 500 pages it summarises the very best of human thought - from the early pre-Socratics to the ideas that have shaped our own modern era.It is a work of outstanding excellence that will suit the student of philosophy as much as the intelligent layperson who wishes to be informed about those seminal terminal points of Western thought that have shaped and re-shaped human destiny. I highly commend this easy-to-read and re-read text for anyone who wants to understand how our culture was shaped over the past two and a half thousand years by the power of intelligent thought. A genuine tour-de-force that should be found on everyone's bookshelf. Highly commended."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Richard Tarnas elucidates the history of Western thought in gorgeous prose and suggests a unifying, healing direction for the future.

Most major thinkers (e.g. Plato, Descartes, Aquinas)are discussed and placed into their historical, philosophical and social contexts. At times the book seemed to ramble on and was a bit disorganized, but overall was an excellent text."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This is a wonderful book to read, a great way to pass the time. I particularly enjoyed the way Tarnas links ancient to modern thinkers and their ideas. This is a book that tries to look at the big picture by panning the entire scope of Western philosophy and culture. I've studied some philosophy in University so it was a pleasure to read this book and see a lot of dots connected.What Richard Tarnas does best is bring out and explicate the ancient roots of modern ideas. But he doesn't quite get the significance of Darwin. Sure he has 18 references to Charles Darwin within The Passion of the Western Mind, but they are brief and not very passionate. Here's how he introduces Darwin: \\" Darwin's theory of evolution brought the origin of natures's species and man himself within the compass of natural science and the modern outlook. At this juncture, science's capacity to comprehend the world had apparently achieved insuperable dimensions, and the modern world view could assert its mature character.\\" Right here I'm ready to fall asleep.Do I detect a lack of passion? Tarnas is actually giving short shrift to Darwin by jumping right to the conclusion that- yah Darwin allowed us humans to understand ourselves scientifically, end of story. But wait a minute, how did he do it and what does it mean now? The fact that Darwin was successful in turning the spotlight of science on human beings and our place on the Earth, is only now affecting all philosophy and the human sciences. Like the Christian Fundamentalists who reject evolution because it challenges the literal truth of Creationism,many secular philosophers and social scientists, especially economists, have been resisting the world picture that Darwin has allowed us to see. In the last twenty years there has been an explosion of evolutionary theory on all sorts of previously taboo subjects including religion.It will probably take another 100 years for there to be a truly accurate estimation of Darwin's place in the Western canon but I would venture to say that Darwin's influence is equal to Plato's. The fact that Tarnas can't really work up any passion over Darwin indicates either a conscious or unconscious avoidance of the subject. Too bad, because it's Darwin's theory that is behind the revolution in our knowledge about life and human nature.I recommend that Richard Tarnas and everyone else read Evolution for Everyone and Darwin's Cathedral, two books by David Sloan Wilson, The Social Conquest of Earth by Edward O. Wilson, and The Darwin Economy by Robert Frank for a more passionate and radical look at how Darwin's idea of natural selection is changing our ideas about what it means to be human and what our place in nature is. These four books basically fill in the part that Tarnas left out."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"For a historical analysis of how and why philosophy has failed mankind, then look no further than this book by Tarnas. It seems to be well researched; there is a large bibliography and a series of footnotes, but I recommend you avoid the pomposity and unintelligible verbiage of the author's epilogue, so typical of the modern day university educated philosopher. Indeed, within the epilogue he introduces a discussion concerning latest developments in the \\"depth psychological\\" work of a man called Stanislav Grof. This work is distastefully and non-objectively venerated by Tarnas as \\"the most epistemoligically significant development in the recent history of depth psychology, and indeed the most important advance in the field since Freud and Jung...\\" Praise indeed. A Google search soon reveals this is simply a case of professional back-scratching as both Grof and Tarnas work in the same department in the same university - funny that!Aside from this distasteful and non-illuminating epilogue, the rest of the book is a useful history book, but it is totally uncritical of the dominance of the influence of Platonism on intellectual thought in the West. Again, there is good reason for this non-critical approach. Another Google search on Tarnas reveals an online interview where he comes right out with the confession that he is a fully blown Platonist.So it is far from being an objective critical analysis, and I am amazed the book is used in the Universities for this very reason.So, reader/buyer beware. The book does provide an insight into the ideas promulgated over the centuries, detailing the influence of Plato, Kant, Hegel etc and will give much technical content summarising the variety of positions.But, whilst the epilogue is quick to determine the problems of current society, it is funny how the Platonic influence on intellectual development is not seen as the reason as to why people are disillusioned with Western intellectual development though! A paradigm shift intellectuals such as Tarnas are incapable of making such is the investment they make in Platonism."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This book is an absolutely superb read.

Plus the small print on what feels like millions of pages is not easy on the eyes.."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I very much enjoyed this book as it was very educational. Thanks to the author I was finally able to understand Kant and his findings and how important they are.. I was also able to fully understand Rousseau for the first time and to understand what a negative influence he has had in philosophy and politics. The book is extraordinarliy good up to the modern era but then it falters as I do not agree with the author that the feminist movement has been a very positive event nor do I believe that Freud and his movement were positive events. In fact, Peter Watson in From Fire to Freud, another great book on intellectual history, totally disagrees with Tarnas on these two matters.Overall, I highly recommend this book but Watson's book should also be read as should Bronowski's for a balanced view."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"So much has been written about this book, I can hardly add anything new except you need a background in philosppy, theology, arts and sciences to truly appreciate and understand it. This I lack and thus the 4 *s. The writing is excellent and I am in awe of the mind and intelligence that could creat such a work."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I loved this book and devoured it over a weekend, like an angry ghost, angry at the diagnoses of my dreary and pre-mundane reality. Tarnas shows that my estrangement is also your estrangement and our alienation runs deep within all our brains. The West is a spiritually broken and mechanically ordered machine and we are its plodding keepers.. Tarnas argues that Simon Cowell's fat breasts are not the tasty delights we have been led to believe and that all science will ever be is a mirror to the hollow glass void within us all, with technology being a narcotic rather than a lubricant and leading to nought and all that.The blurbs on the back of the book are written by the big names of the philosophical community and their words promise The Passion of the Western Mind will be an brain galloping horse ride through Richard Tarnas; minds eye. Mightily clever Tarnas will reveal to our spiritually broken lives what the messiahs and the prophets throughout history have all failed to convey. Tarnas tackles questions such as; is there a God? Yes there is! Do we survive our bodily death? We sure do! etc. This is what we've all been waiting for and so we must thank G/d for Tarnas, because he's uncovered the truth and lifted the veil off her rusty hinges.What is conveyed in our world, Tarnas points out, is only illusion for the production-line people. Tarnas invites us awakened ones to all soar free from this world; he's uncovered the secret you see, and, in so doing, he's only managed to untangle the world knot of existence. Gulp!!Tarnas is right is saying that we are so close to the zero point. We are so close to the transcendental object that all you need to do is to plough the Tryptamine Palace, like a serf ploughing the Lords field, and there it is!What is it? This is the problem! And so when Tarnas is assaulted by the Western exegesis, he is as poor and as dumb mouthed as our Neolithic ancestors, and they were as knowledgeable as an iPod! This long trip from the Neolithic; to the dreary de-caffeinated present, there exists an abyss of titanic immensity. Richard Tarnas has witnessed these titanic realms; they are open to all. \\"All you need is a bong and courage\\" (Plotinus). Indeed, this is gnosticism on steroids, and you too can smoke the toad venum, and you too will be thrown into the presence of the Titan, and all the capability of your puny human conception sinks exhausted, with nothing to hold onto but a fall; a fall outside of time; even outside of metaphysics; a palace of radiant light; a Tryptamine Palace will emerge from this light. Richard Tarnas has smoke royally and he will attempt to describe the experience in his ambitious book.We need this sort of book to carve our way out of this eternal X-Box tyrant we find ourselves living under. So here comes Richard Tarnas with, hopefully, some dazzling poetry, to rock the sleeping multitudes; the multitudes prostrate their tongues towards Simon Cowell's flabby breasts, and his army of dancing mannequins; forever trying to convert us all into dribbling morons. The multitudes withdraw from us all and from our way of thinking; 'it's our job to inspire them with our better ideas; we will then convey the realities of the places we all struggle to describe and open the pearly gates to worldwide enlightenment; it can be done methinks!Tarnas has plunged deep into the unfolding of the western mind and has some treasure to show you and I. However, one could argue tha explaining history and seeing history are different enterprises. We can all explain history, but only God can look into the foggy past and tease out transcendental truths. Tarnas is not God, rather, he's a dry academic sort of dude; not a fired up polemicist with historical idols to burn. No harm done there; because if he were God, or just a fired up genius, he could never get a job at a university. Gods and geniuses never find work in the academy; sad but true.Philosophy if far from dull and get a time machine and just go back to ancient Greece, and Socrates is still hearing voices and Plato's still peeping into the other places. Forward past the pythonesque Christian era, and Rene Descartes' still sleeping a huge oven, David Hume's still laying doubtful foundations; only for the hammer thrower, Immanuel Kant, to come along and shatter all what went before him; only to start afresh with Friedrich Nietzsche putting two fingers up to all that went that and flinging open the gates to our broken carnival ride. All this hyperbole did happen by the way. So this is great stuff for a fired up story teller. Unfortunately, this monkey can't open a tin of beans; never mind breaking the gates of storytelling with an original work. I am the monkey, Tarnas is not!I reckon it's weird the way normal people write one volume histories of philosophy anyway. You can spend a lifetime on just one philosopher, and only a genius can cram all the philosophers into 500 pages. There are also some old BBC philosophy programs on You Tube presented by a clever guy called Brian Magee, who interviews other clever guys about ideas. (Go to You Tube: type+ Brian Magee Philosophy. or..+ Copleston Schopenhauer:)My advice if you wanna learn philosophy is to watch Brian Magee's interviews on you tube and then try reading the original works. Then read this book.So this book is still well worth a look, even though the postmodern angle is getting dated now, but I suspect Tarnas was hinting at a psychedelic something. He attempts a leapfrogging over the Kantian shielding-us-off from the unspeakable (noumenon), and all that, to reveal something outside spiritually broken materialism. Stanislav Groff's LSD work is mentioned in here, but Groff is only used by those who are terrified of resurrecting the ghost of Timothy Leary (though Leary was erm, still alive back then).There is a You Tube clip of LSD inventor, Albert Hoffman, talking about the mind being a receiver of outside signals, like a television, and that there can be no object without a subject and so the world is my representation. That is directly from Schopenhauer via the Kantian philosophy. This is a very interesting avenue to look into."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"&quot;The Passion of the Western Mind&quot; suffers from poor writing. The sentences are long with lots of punctuation and emtpy phrases. Tarnas seems to write around his point. Here is an example sentence taken from the book: &quot;Although this perspective took on a number of distinct inflections, and although there were important contercurrents to this view, it would appear that not only Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and Pythagoras before them and Plotinus after, but indeed Homer and Hesiod, Aeschylus and Sophocles all expressed something like a common vision, reflecting a typically Greek propensity to see clarifying universals in the chaos of life.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Tarnas uses the appearance of a Historical work to support his other ideological views. This man is no historian. He misrepresents his sources and writes things that are simply not based in factual evidence. This is shown in his documentation of his sources. I grant you that this book is a good read (and easy to read at that) but only as a work of psycological fiction. Documentation is sparse and it seems that much of the sources he uses comes from his own mind. He makes statements that are completely based upon opinion and represents them as concrete fact. Most of his references are not primary sources, but pre-processed &quot;documentaries&quot; that support his beliefs.

The diligent author really did do such an \\"excellent job gathering information, seasoning it with something mystical and cooking it with humanism\\"(as one reviewer below comically and aptly puts it)! And it is also from my perspective unfortunate he served as the final entree \\"the half-backed idea of a 'feminist rebirth'\\". This book might be spoiled for many thoughtful readers due to author Richard Tarnas bringing anti-enlightenment views to bare on our passionate intellectual history. But this book is so delightfully well written the prose goes down like a cr&egrave;me brl&eacute;e prepared by a master chef. So granted the author's spin is in the wrong direction, I still enjoyed this trip through intellectual history very much even if it may be cause for possible indigestion. I'd advise the prospective reader that you don't have to savor every taste, much less swallow everything you are served, to still enjoy such a well prepared feast for the intellect. I devoured most of this meaty, content stuffed book-especially savoring the portions on \\"postmodernism\\" and Existentialism. And Romanticism. One blurb among the several thousand included in the first pages of the book is correct in it's claim that the summary of postmodernism is worth the price alone. The dish on the Greeks was superb and latter in the evening I still even had room for Hegel which went down surprisingly well. 4.5 star meal for the mind, using the Amazon rating system, not a mere 1."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"From the time I first bought Tarnas' Passion of the Western Mind, I was fascinated. I am already familiar with the subject matter to a certain degree, but learned a lot from this book. But much more than that, compared to other dry and boring books on the subject, this one truly tells an exciting story with a real sense at the end that the story is ongoing, with major developments before us. The book helped me to see better where we are now and envision my own contribution to the future of serious thought. It makes me glad to be an intellectual in a teaching role today."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"An amazingly articulate, well-written treatise on the origins of Western thought.

Tarnus' is THE WORK that stands out. Tarnus presents the history of thought with a level of insight and understanding that reaches depths previously not considered possible for an introductory work. Not only do you get the particular ideas of each philosophy and era of thought, you get the cultural influence and the context out of which each philosophy arose. What motivated each thinker? What particular convictions influenced the philosophy of the era? What were the pressing concerns building in history of thought that motivated each thinker to construct his particular system? These are the invaluable truths Tarnus makes clear for the reader. In this respect his \\"introductory work\\" can also be considered important even for readers who are well educated and familiar with the typical history of philosophy. Tarnus' education in the field of psychology offers the reader a rare insight. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Most books are written to be read from beginning to end. Here the reader might profitably begin with the Epilogue near the end with a quick look at the Chronology on pages 446-467. After such a perusal, one might think twice about bothering with the rest of the book, or if one is like-minded, begin at the beginning with enthusiasm.To my mind, the Chronology, which lists important events in the history of Western thought, unfortunately (and tellingly) contains such inexplicable entries as Rupert Sheldrake's A New Science of Life (1981); Stanislav Grof's Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research (1975); Anna Freud's The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense (1966); the Boston Women's Health Book Collective's Our Bodies, Ourselves; and Carlos Castenada's The Teachings of Don Juan (1968). These titles are scattered among works by Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Berkeley, Hume, Goethe, Tolstoy, Darwin, Nietzsche, Marx, Kant, Einstein, Kuhn, Popper, etc., leaving the reader a bit puzzled. Why not throw in Dr. Phil's TV show? Well, okay--it wasn't on the air when this book was written over 15 years ago.By the way, the last two named books, which Tarnas seems to think belong on a list of great works of the Western mind, do not even make his 18-page bibliography.What is going on here? Simply this: Richard Tarnas, who spent ten years working as program director at the psychotherapeutic Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California is the victim of a mind set formed by his personal experiences (as we all are); and those experiences include a heavy reliance upon ideas from psychoanalytic theory, from Freud, Jung, Maslow, etc. These men developed a branch of psychology now largely displaced by cognitive psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. Quite simply, Tarnas's erudition, which is considerable, is nonetheless largely passe in a world that no longer sees Freud and Jung as other than historical personages. What Tarnas is able to do--and he does it very well with an engaging style and a penetrating intellect--is to lead us to the brink of the postmodern world before he stumbles backward into a mishmash of Freudian constructs, Jungian archetypes and other delusions from the psychoanalytic babble.Perhaps the most engaging idea that Tarnas presents is that postmodern humans are in a double bind similar to that formulated by Gregory Bateson apropos the schizophrenic and his mother. Tarnas calls it \\"The Post-Copernican Double Bind.\\" (p. 416). The idea is that since the empiricists and Kant we poor humans can no longer hope for certain knowledge. Indeed, it is clear that our so-called knowledge of the world is really just a construct of our minds. Copernicus put us in our place, Hume destroyed causality, and Kant woke up enough to realize that he might as well go back to sleep since human knowledge is \\"radically interpretive\\" and the world we believe in \\"is in some essential sense a construct.\\" (p. 418) Furthermore, \\"what one knows and experiences is to an indeterminate extent a projection.\\" (p. 419) It's a vast, cold, uncaring universe out there. No longer are we the focus of God's attention and benevolence. Instead we are just insignificant beings on a middling star among a hundred billion other stars in a galaxy that itself is just one of hundreds of billions of other galaxies.To his credit, Tarnas finds an answer to this bind, albeit in passing back on page 406. He writes, \\"Such a position [the postmodern] emphasizes the immense responsibility inherent in the human situation...the human challenge is to engage that...set of perspectives which beings forth the most valuable, life-enhancing consequences.\\" This might be called the \\"happy face\\" of existentialism.Tarnas laments \\"the pervasive masculinity of the Western intellectual and spiritual tradition\\" and ends the book on this note: \\"Man is something that must be overcome--and fulfilled, in the embrace of the feminine.\\" (p. 445)Clearly the human without the feminine is steering with only one oar in the water. However, while I agree that \\"man\\" as presently constituted, with his vast propensity for violence, prejudice and ignorance, is certainly \\"something that must be overcome,\\" I think it will take more than an embrace of the feminine. We will eventually, soon or late, go the way of the dodo, but perhaps that which replaces us, possibly a combination of humanity and the artifacts of our culture, cyborgs and/or genetically-engineered combinations of biological and artificial beings, will look back on us as their ancestors, a place on the way to becoming post human."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Tarnas brings us an excelent synopsis of the ideas that has shaped our &quot;imaginary.&quot; A must read for philosophy students and political sciences students alike. A great tool to shape their knowledge or to start reading the philosphers with an idea of what they will find. A good notion of Greek tought. I loved the Platonic Hero conception and its implications. Even if you have never read about Plato, Arisototels, Copernico, Kepler, Freud and many others this is a great start to learn about the ideas that shaped our history."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The title of the book says it all, and not to be overlooked. This is a book that seeks to ascertain the passion that underpins the development of the western mind. Tarnas does a tremendous job of what is the Herculean task of tracing the roots of that development from the Ancient Greeks, through the birth of Christianity, the middle ages, the enlightenment and the birth of the modern world.Make no mistake. This is NOT a text defining the means by which modernist science came to be the one and only defining truth of the cosmos. Those with a modern western mindset or scientific predilection might be lulled into this impression in the early chapters. But such an initial misunderstanding, to be fair to Tarnas, would be more due to the bias of the modern mind, rather than a function of the text. For throughout the development of his narrative, Tarnas is painstaking in his description of the interplay of the spiritual, the philosophical, and the empirical/scientific. I noted that a prior viewer fell into this trap, no doubt expecting Tarnas to conclude with a denunciation of the spiritual and philosophical vestiges of prehistory, depositing these schools into the waste bin of History, whilst announcing the triumph of the modernist worldview. Far from it. Tarnas' penultimate analysis examines what he calls \\"the crisis in modern science\\" and the emergence of postmodern thought, both of which undermined the roots of certainty. Yet the postmodernist too may be dismayed when Tarnas concludes in his epilogue with a broad sweep of the hand, finally positing an essentially spiritual teleological thrust to the very human development he has traced. It may be anathema to those within the dominant modernist science and postmodernist schools, where spirituality and grand narrative are respectively derided - but it is nonetheless a brave attempt to make sense of it all beyond the respective materialist and relativist stranglehold of the modern and postmodern discourses.But it is not necessary to agree with Tarnas' worldview to benefit from this fine text. The 95% of the book that traces the history of the interplay between the often opposing spiritual/metaphysical and skeptical/empirical/scientific forces within western history is well worth the journey. I highly recommend the text for anybody wanting a broad overview of some of the most influential minds of the western world in the last three millennia.It may be a little light on the twentieth century history of science. So, if you want a History of Science from the modernist perspective read John Gribbin's \\"Science: a History\\" or Andrew Gregory's \\"Eureka!\\" If you want a summative account of the modernist perspective on History/Evolution, read Bill Bryson's \\"A Brief History of Everything.\\" But if you want something that broadens the horizons, Tarnas may be the man for you.Marcus T.

I assumed I was well educated - until I read Rick Tarnas' book, sitting on a beach in India, and realized that I knew virtually nothing about the history of thought in the West. And I realized that without that knowledge, all that I thought I knew was rendered paper-thin. I could not put the book down. It was an incredible experience to trace the history of Europe, the West and thus the modern world, through the lens of philosophical, religious and scientific thinkers and, for the first time ever, feel that I could see the map, grasp the background to my own personal experience, and thereby address the ever more urgent questions arising in me about our world.In addition to the question of at last becoming familiar with the underpinning of the Western way of thinking and acting, I found great pleasure in the way Richard Tarnas uses language. He writes with extraordinary lucidity and elegance. It drew me on, feeding my aesthetic appetite, which I found as important as the content, finally, for this book is an experience. It does what all writers hope for in their writing, but few can really achieve.A few years after that experience, I ended up coming to study in the place where Rick Tarnas teaches, the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. I have found him to be as elegant a speaker and teacher as I found his writing to be.My final thought is that this book should be required reading for ALL students in senior grades of high school, or in the first year of university - whether studying Sciences or Humanities. The way we think is of critical importance for the well-being of the world. The first essential step is to understand how we have got to where we are. From there a creative critique can be born. And at no time has it been more urgent that we learn everything we can about our habits of thought, and become capable of activating our creativity for a more functional, more equitable, more sustainable world. And a world that can value beauty in all its forms. All disciplines, the entire spectrum, developed as they have been in the European mind, need the contribution of aware, creative, innovative minds. This book helps us towards that goal."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I found this book to be an enjoyable introduction to the huge expanse of Western philosophy. It is obviously intended as a &quot;jumping-off&quot; point for individuals (non-professional philosophers) to go further on their own. I particularly enjoyed the Greek Enlightenment and Socrates sections.The negative reviews on this list seem to be centered on Dr. Tarnas's equally enthusiastic presentation of the major philosophical movements throughout history. That is, he assiduously avoids assigning a value judgment to certain ideas simply because they turned out horribly. I think the reviewers would prefer to see him assign a value, rather than present these ideas uncritically, writing about all the advantages and disadvantages of each.Patently, the interested student will go on and conduct his own research, creating for himself the principles upon which to assign a value judgment. I have discounted postmodernism and Marxism based on my further readings, readings that I would not have done if not for the enthusiasm of Tarnas's work."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Tarnas has produced in this book an accessible review of Western cultural developments. By condensing, sensing patterns, and editing as an author inevitably must, he omits some of what more specialized readers might want. However, his intention is less encyclopedic completeness than a hypothesis about the trajectory of Western cultural change. To this end he writes engagingly and informatively. His synthetic, pattern-sensing thought about history is interesting. He appears overly influenced by newer trends in theories about gender roles, psychology, and spirituality. Here he resembles Leonard Schlain of the &quot;Goddess and the Alphabet&quot; ramblings. By the last chapter he is fully immersed in speculation that many, myself included, find unjustified by the preceding survey and assembly of evidence. However, speculation is the stuff of philosophers and theoreticians, and I wouldn't necessarily dismiss the body of the book because of disagreements with Tarnas' prognostications. Alongside other surveys like Daniel Robinson's &quot;Intellectual History of Psychology&quot; and Robert Kegan's &quot;In Over Our Heads,&quot; readers can derive fascinating insights about cultural development."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This book starts well. I found the introduction to Greek philosophy rewarding in the way it made clear various strands running through the work of Plato and Aristotle. Later he piqued my interest in medieval scholastic philosophy. His summaries of Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler seem sound. In fact as far as Kant it's hard to find fault with this book.Unfortunately after Kant things become a little different. You see this is not what it purports to be - an introduction to the history of Western thought. It is the history of Western thought from the point of view of a member of a philosophy department in a Western university - and not just any philosophy department - a *Continental* philosophy department. To read this book you'd think that much of the intellectual life of the twentieth century had simply never happened. Tarnas chooses to completely ignore almost all Anglo-American empiricist philosophy in the last 100 years and clearly has little or no knowledge of sc! ! ientific developments. Almost his only mention of twentieth century scientists, besides the obvious Einstein, is a list of scientists who have prominence purely because of popular science literature - and even here Tarnas is unable to distinguish between genius and merely crackpot.The book has a chapter called the 'Crisis in Science'. Besides the obvious and well known moral issues surrounding science this chapter bears no relation to anything that I experienced as someone who grew up within the scientific tradition. In fact I am at a complete loss to know what his crisis is - unless it be the general problem that academic work (in all fields) is now so specialised that philosophers, who like to make their field *everything*, can no longer hope to understand what takes place outside their field.It's not just in the 'hard' sciences that Tarnas is out of his depth - I was astonished to find him citing the work of Sapir and Whorf in linguistics which has now been completely! ! discredited. Tarnas believes the feminist so-called critiq! ue of science to be one of the most significant advances in the philosophy of science - and yet a large number of intellectuals would find it laughable (though one might argue, of course, that this is a sign of genius).Nonetheless I have still awarded this book a generous 3 out of 5 because the earlier parts of this book are so illuminating and because, for all I know, the later parts are a genuine reflection of the author's own particular strand of Western thought if not of a major part of it.One last word: readers of this book would do well to review the epilogue first - that way they can find out just where the author is coming from."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I've just finished 'The Passion of the Western Mind': certainly the most significant book, intellectually, that I've ever read. But it is more than that. I found with great excitement that not only does the 'Passion' contain a profound, remarkably thorough analysis of the history of ideas - one that manages to simplify, order, and interpret without sacrificing complexity and contradiction - it also affirms many of my own shadowy, hard-to-articulate intuitions about the mystery of human-being-in-the-world. As I neared the end of the book, I humbly realized the striking extent to which my own intellectual/spiritual bents, hunches, and patterns of thought are a product of our postmodern times; that indeed the human mind is seemingly moved by larger forces, forces that appear to exist simultaneously inside the human skull and outside in the world of culture and natural phenomena. In other words, Tarnas's book suggests that perhaps the nature of Mind and the mind of Nature are one and the same! By finding this notion, a mystical idea nevertheless active in many major currents of Western thought from Romanticism and Neoplatonism to traditional religious paradigms, explicitly outlined in the content of 'Passion', I was able to read myself reading the book, as it were. In other words, the very urge motivating my reading - the desire somehow to reconcile my personal intellectual intuitions with the complex, often paradoxical nexus of Western thought, and to do so in a manner that merged an open-ended pluralistic outlook with an overarching intellectual/psychological framework - was itself addressed in the content of the pages I read!From a practical standpoint, the book provides an awareness of the Western intellectual tradition equal in scope to an in-depth classical education; its 400-plus pages are filled with scintillatingly presented ideas narrated with overwhelming intellectual acuity. Yet the Passion is a narrative that, if one perseveres, begins to read like a dramatic novel. On a more meaningful level, the book gives insight into the struggles that face us personally and collectively. Some of our most \\"personal\\" problems are best grasped, I think, as transpersonal historical conflicts still working themselves out in the mind of Western man. If Hillman is right and today History is the great Repressed, Tarnas's book - ostensibly about the interrelated development of philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities - is a book of self-discovery more potent than overtly personalistic approaches blind to their own historical context. Indeed, the 'Passion' actually helps one put the idea of context itself in context, a necessary skill in an era characterized by hyper-self-awareness drowning in a sea of multicontextuality. In short, and to say it most simply: Beneath all the trappings of its challenging, hard-thinking ideas, The 'Passion' is a psychology book that will touch your life in its most hidden places.The daring conclusion presented in the Epilogue relies on various thinkers - most of them existing as seemingly marginal influences vis-&agrave;-vis the current intellectual milieu - in order to comprehend the overall trajectory of Western thought. Though this may seem to some an hubristic stretch that would have best been left out of the narrative, I predict that in years to come this little Epilogue will become the most valuable part of the book (though reading all that comes before it is necessary for its full impact to be felt). Tarnas's fundamental conclusion that \\"the deepest passion of the Western mind has been to reunite with the ground of its own being,\\" in other words, that self-perception has been spurred all along by an urge to glimpse the self in an inseparable matrix of self-other-world - this is the kind of complex epistemological thinking that will dominate the coming decades: it is epistemological thinking that recognizes epistemology as ontology and ontology as epistemology, a movement of the mind that bridges the Cartesian-Kantian gap by realigning human consciousness with its more-than-human base in the natural world (this notion is indeed found in various degrees of articulation in much postmodern thought, but Tarnas makes it explicit in a thrilling manner).This 'Passion' is the real thing: passionate insight that allows the thinking person to grapple more consciously with the multivalent, often confusing realities of postmodern culture. Find it today, and if you give it the attention it deserves, it will likely become one of the most important books you've ever read."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The suggestion below to read the epilogue first is good advice, except that if I had done so, I probably wouldn't have read the book. The survey of the history of thought until modern times is superb and objective as well. When Tarnas gets to about Freud, his own opinions start to seep in, with his clear admiration for depth psychology. Finally in the epilogue we see his full-blown new-age, feminist, psycho-babble theory of the world. Amazingly, this does not detract from the vast majority of the book. Still a must read to get a big picture view of Western thought. (Also be aware that Tarnas goes heavily into the Christian world view, unlike most such histories)"},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I went to one of England's &quot; best &quot; schools, and a leading university where I studied Social Anthropology. I assumed I was well educated - until I read Rick Tarnas' book, sitting on a beach in India, and realized that I knew virtually nothing about the history of thought in the West. And I realized that without that knowledge, all that I thought I knew was rendered paper-thin. I could not put the book down. It was an incredible experience to trace the history of Europe, the West and thus the modern world, through the lens of philosophical, religious and scientific thinkers and, for the first time ever, feel that I could see the map, grasp the background to my own personal experience, and thereby address the ever more urgent questions arising in me about our world.In addition to the question of at last becoming familiar with the underpinning of the Western way of thinking and acting, I found great pleasure in the way Richard Tarnas uses language. He writes with extraordinary lucidity and elegance. It drew me on, feeding my aesthetic appetite, which I found as important as the content, finally, for this book is an experience. It does what all writers hope for in their writing, but few can really achieve.A few years after that experience, I ended up coming to study in the place where Rick Tarnas teaches, the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. I have found him to be as elegant a speaker and teacher as I found his writing to be.My final thought is that this book should be required reading for ALL students in senior grades of high school, or in the first year of university - whether studying Sciences or Humanities. The way we think is of critical importance for the well-being of the world. The first essential step is to understand how we have got to where we are. From there a creative critique can be born. And at no time has it been more urgent that we learn everything we can about our habits of thought, and become capable of activating our creativity for a more functional, more equitable, more sustainable world. And a world that can value beauty in all its forms. All disciplines, the entire spectrum, developed as they have been in the European mind, need the contribution of aware, creative, innovative minds. This book helps us towards that goal."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"The author takes us through a whirlwind journey which begins with the Ancient Greeks and ends with post modern deconstructionism, along the way dealing with the ideas of everyone from Thales, who is credited with being the Founder of Philosophy, to Stanislav Grof, who has studied the unconscious effects of the birthing process on the development of the human mind. For a book which deals with complexities and concepts which can easily defy most people's comprehension, Tarnas does an amazing job of making understandable, while not dumbing down, the key concepts upon which Western thought has been built.The book does have its problems. Maybe the nature of the material made it inevitable, but the author tends to write in complex sentences which string together numerous, and sometimes conflicting ideas, so that after just a few pages I found myself almost \\"winded\\" like after a long run. This density of content requires the reader to constantly stop and \\"digest\\" and in today's Internet speed world that is not something you come across often. However, a more \\"leisurely\\" written book would have easily been twice the size, and the truth is, it was challenging and satisfying to engage such an informative book. Maybe we have just become mentally lazy, and need a workout like this occasionally.The more important criticism is that what, for 90% of the book, is an interesting history of intellectual development, becomes at the end a study in psychology, which, while interesting as well, can be disorienting to the reader. Essentially, the active intellect suddenly takes a backseat to the unconscious, a move which is somewhat justified based on the epistemological work of Kant, Hume and others, but which nonetheless changes the complexion of the book entirely, and thus what seemed to have been a study of the evolution of ideas becomes a semimystical, metaphysical reflection on evolving consciousness, with a great deal of similarity to the work of Eckhart Tolle, even if Tarnas approaches it from an entirely different angle.The end result is that someone who thinks he is reading a book on the history of philosophy and thought concludes with a discussion of the reintegration of the masculine and feminine aspects of the Universe as Mankind evolves into a higher being. Needless to say, not what was expected.But having said that, it is still very interesting, informative and thought provoking. For the reader who is open to nonconventional ideas about the human mind [ i.e. New Age Philosophy] this book presents new rationales and concepts to consider. For the more traditional, if you skip the last 40 pages, this is still a wonderful history of ideas."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This engaging summary propels readers through the epic story of how Western thought has evolved through the centuries. If you are new to philosophy, you will find that this book gives a lucid overview of subjects ranging from the early Greeks through the evolution of Christian thought, and proceeding onward through the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution to current-day Postmodernism. This book gives many insights on the context underlying current-day views and assumptions about man's place in the universe. If you seek answers to existential questions or religious uncertainties, you may find the Epilogue wanting, but the book as a whole will intrigue you."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I think, Richard Tarnas has done a spectacular job of compressing the whole history of the west into one comprehensive volume. Being a PhD student of science who has also explored spiritual ideas, I really like the fact that the author tries to highlight the existential crisis facing the world today.I really recommend this book and would suggest people to be wary of negativereviews on the book. The people who have negative opinions about the book and consider the eplilogue wacky are in denial of the fact that every opinion that they make can also be classified as wacky and subjective. In this pluralistic and subjective world they need to tolerant of opinions if they consider themselves reasonable. But if people want to be completely close minded about anything except their apriori judgements about things like depth psychology, what can be done. They ignore the fact that inconsistency rules even the most precise branch of science --mathematics. Godel's incompleteness theorem actually led to this conclusion."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"This book is one of the most interesting, educative, exciting, well-written, enlightening and important books I've ever read.

It is strong in many areas, but weak in its treatment of many others, such as post-modern and contemporary philosophy, and political philosophy.The Epilogue is quite different from the rest of the book, and is an anticlimactic and disappointing ending to an otherwise exemplary work of scholarship. It should not be in the book."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Richard Tarnas' The Passion of the Western Mind is an overview Western thought from pre-Socratic times to late twentieth century. Tarnas is professor of philosophy and psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. I offer the following comments for potential readers.&#61623; It is as good a one-volume overview of Western intellectual history as I have come across. Tarnas does an excellent good of touching-on nearly all the significant developments in Western thought - being appropriately selective in which areas are explored in greater depth. The book provides a good background for new students of philosophy as well as some helpful connectivity for those who has been exposed to some of the different topics&#61623; The discussion of Greek thought is especially noteworthy. His analysis of Plato and Aristotle (their continuities and discontinuities) is highly recommended.&#61623; The analysis of Christian thought and development is also well handled and helpful. I think that he overemphasises the continuity between Hellenistic philosophy and Christian theology, however, it is still an interesting interpretation.&#61623; Tarnas also has an excellent analysis of post-modernism and its impacts (i.e. the loss of certainty). I disagree with an earlier reviewer that Tarnas does not understand modern scientific developments. On the contrary, he sees all too clearly the implications of recent theoretical developments (e.g. cosmology and quantum theory). The modern era has furnished us with some good practical technological applications, however, it has done little to address fundamental existential questions.&#61623; The book's only major drawback (and it is significant) is its epilogue where Tarnas delves into some radical pantheistic new-age musings. It detracts significantly from the authors overall credibility and makes him appear rather eccentric - to say the least. This closing speculative prattle may have too much of a New-age Milleniumist tone for many readers.Overall I recommend the book. Without the epilogue it warrants 5-stars as an introductory philosophy book. As it stands I cannot give it better than an average rating. Hopefully, subsequent editions will omit the epilogue"},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Richard Tarnas in &#34;The Passion of the Western Mind&#34; presents a clear, readable account of Western philosophy from Plato to the present.

In the book The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas That Have Shaped Our World View by Richard Tarnas, the author delves into the background of fundamentals of our world view.The Greeks, the Romans, and all in between are spelled out in this book. As Friedrich Nietzche said, \\"The world is deep: deeper than day can comprehend.\\"This book is good reading for anyone who wants to have an overview of the western mind and what constitutes the \\"good \`ole days.\\""},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Though this book was written in 1991, it still serves as an excellent analysis of the paralysis of the modern world. Richard Tarnas is primarily focused on philosophers and philosophy, but a glance at the present political situation reveals how strong the connection is between the loss of a common paradigm (or even two or three) and the confusion that confounds the global society.Tarnas, though, grounds that grasp of the present in the intellectual traditions that shaped the modern world, and begins in ancient Greece. Though he is distilling numerous complex philosophical and religious views into a (relatively) few pages, he does so with grace and precision. His long analysis of Christian thought, and how it affected our ways of thinking, is excellent, and he also shows how the cracks in the iron theology of the middle ages allowed the light of the Renaissance to seep in.And though his lining up the Copernican revolution (which removed man from the center of the cosmos), the Darwinian revolution (which removed man from the crown of creation), and the Freudian revolution (which removed reason as the master of humanity's future) is far from new, he clearly states the postmodern dilemmas, and makes it clear why it is so hard to reach consensus on any aspect of 21st century life.Tarnas' semi-mystic embrace of Stanislav Grof's theory about how an infant's passage through the birth canal echoes the constrictions of our culture, and how human culture can be saved by the masculine domination of the past 5,000 years returning to the feminine (womb) that it left so long ago seems like the product of a few too many psychedelics, it cannot detract from Tarnas' achievement. And who knows? Maybe he's right, and maybe we will, as a culture, step back from the dangerous excesses of our male-dominated culture. As Leonard Cohen said, \\"I wish the women would hurry up and take over\\" -- and twenty years on from the publication of \\"The Passion of the Western Mind,\\" I feel safe in saying Tarnas would agree."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"Well written, easy to read book concerning the history of Christian theology, its attempts to clarify beliefs espoused by the apostles, and its development into the understanding we have today of the teachings of Jesus, the Christ."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"An excellent survey of Western culture with an emphasis on the spiritual consequences of the various ideas that have shaped it."},{"Title":"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View","review":"I found less bias and better perspective on every page.

The cover is indeed beautiful, but the content, with exceptions such as Brian Peterson's work, tends towards high heeled black boots and the burlesque. It seems as though fetish is now the order of the day, with erotic photographers following this very standardized path like sheep. Trouble is, the photographs tend to depersonalize and objectify, which robs them of their erotic quality. If making a statement about the objectification of women is the purpose of much of this work, well OK, but how many artists should it take to make the point?A missed opportunity. Take a look at Judy Francesconi's \\"Visual Sonnets\\" or, from the 1970's, J. Frederick Smith's \\"Sappho: The Art of Loving Women\\" as alternatives. To me, these speak more of a belief in the beauty and emotional closeness of the relationships depicted in their authors' images."},{"Title":"Femmes: Masterpieces of Erotic Photography (Grove Press Poetry Series)","review":"I scanned through this book the other day at Virgin Records and I have to say, I really did like it! I do agree with some other people, about how some of the women weren't exactly attractive, but... isn't that rather shallow minded???? Not everyone in the entire world is beautiful and there are many people out there with wonderful personalities but not the hottest looks. Now, if you were going to buy an issue of Playboy and not find beautiful women and a pair of syllacone implants, THEN I would complain, that is purely for masturbation, I would assume.But this is kind of different, don't you think? It goes deeper than masturbation and Playboy bullcrap.I will say it had a lot of fetish type pictures in it, but, if you're into that kind of thing, this will be great for you!I have to say I enjoyed it, DESPITE the \\"unattractive\\" women in it.

Ask four dozen people to describe femininity, and you might get twice as many answers. That's this book: when offered the title \\"Femmes\\", what image would you contribute?Like anyone, I confess to my favorites. I find prettiness optional and beauty almost unavoidable. The woman/women fascinate/s me - not the lingerie or other kink. I warm to affection, even the more physical kinds. I enjoyed Gosbee's work, and Grace's, and Nelson's dotted lady (among others). Hyams's models exhibit a simple but almost superhuman beauty; Karsten's come across with strength, honesty, and a little goofiness. Mahaux's one photo across the fold approaches the models' nudity closely, showing individual uniqueness in narrow detail. It's just me, maybe, but that matters. Even identical twins differ, and I thrive on those differences. Some photographers I find vulgar - many of Roy Stuart's entries dropped below that line. I learn from some, including Sunderland's. Personality matters to me too; that's why Davis's pictures attracted me.Some of this work appeals to me, some doesn't. There's a lot to enjoy here, and nothing (just barely) that I found offensive.

However, not all stories are of the same level.The story of Elric of Melnibone was probably the best story in the volume, with a clear plot, beginning and ending and the hero managed to reach closure, of some sort. The other stories were probably intended to underline a principle of some sort, and sadly this was more important than the plot itself.The fantasy itself is superb. The demons, gods, dragons and other supernatural beings inhabiting the stories are among the best ever created, not to mention the scenery itself. However, it must be pointed out the Elirc, the hero of the stories, is getting more depressed from story to story and this will affect the hero.So, in conclusion, great fantasy but not an easy bedtime read."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"There is nothing much I could say that has not already been said by previous reviewers. I simply am taking this oppurtunity to say that as this is the fourth Eternal Champion novel I've read, it is by far the best in a fantastic ongoing saga. A must read for any dark fantasy fan."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"I first became aware of Moorcock's work through the songs he had written with Hawkwind and Blue Oyster Cult, although I was not a sci-fi fan of any great proportion (and still am not, even as of this late date). But when I first spotted this omnibus edition in Borders, and having been familiar with the tale from Hawkwind's album &quot;The Chronicle of the Black Sword,&quot; I knew I needed to familiarize myself with the stories themselves.And I don't regret having done so. Elric is one of Moorcock's best-known, and best-drawn, characters; and although these stories utilize the unhappy ending, that is a much more realistic approach than &quot;they all lived happily ever after.&quot; Moorcock's universe doesn't work that way.Furthermore, none of these tales goes on too long. You want Elric to succeed, even though there's no payoff for him, as he is doomed to continue searching for Tanelorn, and to be more slave than master to Stormbringer. These tales made me want to read more of Moorcock's work--to date, I have read one third of the Eternal Champion series, and I intend to read the rest. You should do so as well. It's worth the time spent, as well as the money."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"My favourite story in the Song of the Black Sword was the first one, Elric of Melnibone. It was so interesting. There was always something new that the author adds to keep on saturating your mind.For all fantasy fans, read this book along with the rest of the Eternal Champion series."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"Moorcock's wild inventiveness and somewhat scattershot approach to storytelling all cohere into a compelling universe with interesting characters. Elric's weakness and introspection give him more actual weight as a hero than most of the strapping swordsmen of the genre, and his moral quandaries are genuinely affecting.There are some downsides - Moorcock is... not exactly a feminist writer, and his female characters are basically quest objectives. That's probably more true in Elric's stories than in some of the others - the main love interest is the classic helpless female who the alpha males fight over, kidnap, quite possibly rape (although it's never stated) and then... well, I won't spoil that bit.Elric also has an intermittent case of the stupids that's annoying - his &#34;I know, I'll leave my kingdom in the hands of the person who just tried to murder me for it so I can go on walkabout for a year. Oh, he can hang on to my fiance, too. It'll be fine!&#34; is just totally unbelievable and detracts quite a bit from the emotional punch of the finale.That said, this volume has some great adventures, some excellent characters, and is a coherent collection - there's a second volume of Elric stuff later on that I admit I'm looking forward to."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"I've been reading the whole borealis volumens of the Multiverse one after the other and of course knowing about Moorcock I had very high expectations about Elric. But I have to say I liked more the Hawkmoon and Nomad of the Time Streams novels than this one. Song of the Black Sword has some high points and very low and inmature ones, I'll do a summary of each story without spoiling it to someone who hasn't read it.---------------------------Elric of Melnibon&eacute; (1972) -was probably the one I enjoyed the most. It's very good paced, the whole third act is amazing, probably the best in all the volume and the ending has a very exciting cliffhanger. The best story of the whole book for me.The Fortress of the Pearl (1989)- is a pain the ass. This is the first story of Moorcock that I was wishing to end just of the sake of ending it. The novel feels completely like a fill-in, boring and totally disconnected. Even though it has few good moments too.The Sailor on the Seas of Fate (1976)- Is divided in three acts. Three short stories Moorcock joined. Sailing to the Future has Elric meeting the other Eternal Champions, this of course was the story I expected the most, but is wasn't good. The champions have no proper characterization, so besides of the fantastic elements they could've been other random characters easily.Sailing to the present is a stand alone story of Elric between the love story of a sorcerer. I liked it a lot even though it was not astounding. It's entertaining.And Sailing to the past, which has Elric traveling again to a mysterious city that reveals some ambiguous ideas about the Multiverse. I really really like this one. So Sailor of the Seas of Fate goes from semi-boring to really good at least for me.The Dreaming City (1972)- Is a short story that narrates a turning point moment in Elric's \\"life\\". It's very good.While the Gods Laugh (1977) -Another short story that has Elric going to another unimportant quest but not bad either.The Singing Citadel (1977) -Who has Elric meeting an important antagonist for the posterior novels.-----------------------------***I have to say that something that might make the Elric experience a better one might be to read the novels by date of creation and not in order. Because probably the sense of discovery of Elric's world is lost by going step by step without losing detail. And they are separate stories, not so connected as for example Hawkmoon***"},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"I read some of the Elric books when they first appeared and have been rereading them since The Dreamthief's Daughter came out. This first volume of Elric stories is a bit patchy and The Fortress of the Pearl has a formulaic quality most of Moorcock lacks and which isn't evident in any of the other stories (beyond their obvious genre roots) but given that most of these were written by a twenty year old, they are amazingly good. Moorcock is a poetic writer and a naturally eloquent story teller, qualities that don't often go together. If you enjoy a real writer with a real sense of language you are unlikely to find anyone better in fantasy than Moorcock, together with Peake and possibly Lord Dunsany. If the quality of writing doesn't interest you, I suspect you'll be a bit baffled by the enthusiasm some of us have for these books. The great thing about these books is that they can be read at any age and you get more from them. They have introduced many young readers (including me) to ambitious literary fiction and they have fans as varied as Peter Ackroyd, Derek Woolcott and Walter Mosely. Even the current Spanish minister of culture says King of the Swords is his favourite novel. The books reflect Moorcock's complexity as a writer but can be read quickly and enjoyed entirely for their imaginative adventures. This is smart fantasy from a writer who has kept expanding his horizons for over forty years. This is where he started and the talent, if not the literary control, shines through."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"I can't imagine that anyone reading this review is actually someone who could stand to benefit by it; surely, no one reads the review of a Michael Moorcock volume--let alone the fifth volume of his series--without either having already read it, or already being a die hard fan of his work. But let us pretend that it is not necessarily so, and that my words of caution might have some effect on the world other than to anger the Moorcock faithful, and proceed.As you may or may not be aware, this volume comprises the fifth volume in the \\"Eternal Champion Series\\" but was, originally, a number of different works, some of which were written before Moorcock had come upon the idea of an \\"Eternal Champion.\\" The works in this volume, moreover, were not even published in the order that they appear in this collection: the forth story was published first; the second, last. Does reading these stories out of their originally published order affect the reading? Of course it does, and much to the detriment. Also, and because of the lame Eternal Champion idea that Moorcock eventually came up with to unite his works (idea being that almost all of his heroes in various stories are incarnations of the same guy in a different dimension), Moorcock liberally brings in characters and names from his other books without any real context, expecting us to have read his entire library. Further, because these stories are published out of order, some of the stories reference ideas like the Eternal Champion, and multiverse, and some we read after (but published first), do not. Some characters are brought in without much background because Moorcock had described them in an earlier published work... but that's not the order they're in here.Really, this is a poor approach--if you must read Moorcock, read them in the original order as published. But, I think there's a good question as to whether these stories are worth reading at all.The first story in the collection (published forth, naturally) is probably the best--Elric of Melnibone. It is also the worst because it leads you to believe that the rest of the stories might be worth reading, too; your memories of Elric of Melnibone will push you onwards through the LSD-influenced Fortress of the Pearl and dull-as-dishwater Sailor on the Seas of Fate, and utterly forgettable short stories once published as The Weird of the White Wolf for some arcane reason. Moorcock writes bloodless prose, which for him is really more of an exercise in fleshing out his bizzare Law versus Chaos theories than telling a compelling, human story. His descriptions are sparse, his vocabulary alternating between smarter-than-thou fifty dollar words and incredibly repetitious (a great Moorcock drinking game would include a shot every time he uses the word \\"ironic\\" to describe someone's smile or tone of voice, and two for \\"sardonic\\"). His \\"hero,\\" Elric, is a depressed moper who succeeds only because some random God or another scoops him out deus-ex-machina style from the flames at the last second. Make no mistake: Moorcock writes with agendas, political and philosophical. Unfortunately, he doesn't write with them all that well, and his works decline in quality over time as he lets them take over the normal conventions of plot and character.Speaking of, his plots are weak and his characters borderline non-existent. The tone of his work is unceasingly morose, and the only thing worse being when he tries to interject some humor because it always falls flat. Elric hates living--he hates trudging through the stories he's forced, Fated, to endure--and his world weariness communicates itself to the reader. We, too, are depressed after reading his journeys.Moorcock wanted to write something unlike the fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien, and in that he succeeded. (Before--or after--reading this, you may be interested to read Moorcock's nonfiction essay \\"Starship Stormtroopers,\\" easily found on the web, in which he declares the writings of Tolkien, Issac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Richard Adams, C.S. Lewis, H.P. Lovecraft, and many others to be \\"crypto-fascist,\\" \\"misanthropic,\\" \\"misogynistic,\\" \\"bourgeois,\\" \\"anti-semitic\\" and other such things; despite its promising insanity, this essay is sadly even worse written than his fiction.) Tolkien wrote engaging prose with humor and wonderful characters you'll treasure forever. Moorcock wrote dry and funereal prose (though undoubtedly \\"ironic\\" and \\"sardonic\\"), with benighted characters you'd sooner forget, which you will.Once again, I doubt that anyone is reading this review who could actually stand to benefit by it; unlike Mr. Tolkien and the other greats that Moorcock mindlessly maligns, the world has essentially forgotten Michael Moorcock, a process that takes up steam with every passing year, and will relegate him to a footnote in the annals of mediocre fantasy fiction. In the end, I think that Moorcock, himself, understood this, and that jealousy as much as his odd anarchic-fringe idealism fueled his hate-filled diatribe. As these things infected his fiction as well, I cannot recommend this volume to anyone other than the very curious who've already read Moorcock's betters.

Just having so much out of print or hard to find literature in one novel is well worth the price alone.The most interesting aspect of these books for myself was not the massive genocide Elric commits with Stormbringer or the bizarre adventures he physically and metaphysically sets foot on , but the strong development of Elric himself.He has changed the way that I view fantasy with such a dark hero."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"So much has already been written in the excellent reviews here that I will keep this brief. This is my first Michael Moorcock reading and I couldn't put it down. Thoughtful, challenging, and -- in spite of Elric's inclinations toward doom -- not nearly as dark as other books I've read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"This reprinting of Michael Moorcock's Epic Saga of Elric of Melnibone emerses us as the reader into a epic world of dark fantasies and darker philosophies both current at the time of the original printing and currnet yet today. In &quot;Elric: Song of the Black Sword,&quot; Moorcock uses Elric as a symbol struggling with his own morality. While Elric is a hero he resists this title at the same time he struggles for his own perception of truth. It is because of this inner struggle he finds himself at odds with the forces of Law and Chaos. Elric's world is one of sorcery and shifting truths. It is a world were &quot;truth&quot; is not only questioned but changes and is a changing balance between these forces of Law and Chaos. Michael Moorcock has acheieved a very entertaining and stimulating text. This stands alone as a literary work beyond that of a sword and sorcery tale. The saga entertains us as reader with wild images of dragons and sorcery while leads us to question how we define our own truths and how we struggle against todays &quot;sorcery&quot; of technology and those supernatural forces around us. Michael Moorcock's Elric saga, and the entire &quot;Eternal Champion&quot; saga brings to life such philosophies as Existentialism and even Deconstruction of today. Through &quot;Elric&quot; we can enter this world of philosophy and struggle with our own &quot;eternal&quot; debates on truth and reality. I recommend Michael Moorcocks &quot;Elric: Song of the Black Sword&quot; to anyone interested in a very entertaining and fantasical world or to anyone interested in looking at philosophy from a slightly different edge...perhaps the edge of a sentient sword"},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"What to say, what to say... the Elric saga is one of the most excellent fantasy series ever written. This is the first part, composed of the first three books, excluding Fortress of the Pearl, which was written after the six-book saga was completed. Nevertheless, it fits smoothly.Elric of Melnibone - The flawless beginning of the saga. Elric of Melnibone introduces its namesake, his best friend Dyvim Tvar, his lover Cymoril, and his competent cousin Yyrkoon. This is, obviously, the first true advancement into the story; but as I mentioned before, it is flawless.The Fortress of the Pearl - A sidestory, taking place between Elric of Melnibone and the Sailor on the Seas of Fate. Not as good as the other installments in the series, but a gem nonetheless.The Sailor on the Seas of Fate - Split into three seperate, overall unrelated stories. Of course, all three fit into the current storyline, but each can be considered a seperate adventure. The first introduces Hawkmoon, Erekose, and Corum, three of the other incarnations of the Eternal Champion. The next two tell of Elric's adventures with Smiorgan and Duke Avan.The Dreaming City - The conclusion to the plot that was set up through the entire first book (Elric of Melnibone). To say any more would spoil and excellent plot twist. Also, to mention, this is the first part of Weird of the White Wolf, the third book in the Elric Saga.While the Gods Laugh - The second part of Weird. Here Elric meets Shaarilla, the wingless woman of Myrrh. Also, in this story, Elric meets Moonglum, his most faithful companion, and the one who stayed with the albino warrior the longest. An excellent story, simply put.The Singing Citadel - Elric's first meeting with his long-lasting enemy (from this point on), the sorcerer and servant to Chaos, Theleb K'aarna. Here Elric also meets Yishana, who appears once more in the future Elric stories. The third installment in Weird.My final word: Read it, read it, read it!"},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"Elric is probably the best, and best known, of all of Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion characters (though Jerry Cornelius must be a close second), and I almost rushed through the previous four volumes in the series in an effort to get to this book. And while those books were excellent examples of Moorcock's writing, this blows them all out of the water, showing fantasy unlike anything else. Here are some thoughts on the individual stories:Elric of Melnibone: Great introduction and brilliant way to kick off the volume. Everything about Elric is explained here.The Fortress of the Pearl: It's interesting to note that even though this one wasn't published until nearly the nineties, it fits seamlessly into the rest of the books, and of course the device of making him forget explains why the events here aren't referred to in later novels. This one is good, still.Sailor on the Seas of Fate: Easily the best story in here, period. You know its good when three other Eternal Champions show up (Erekose, Hawkmoon, and Corum), and they only stay through the first part, and the rest of the book just gets better!The Dreaming City: Elric takes out his home city. I thought this was just a short story until I read the end and saw the rather major upheval Moorcock threw in at the end. Quite the tragic tale.While the Gods Laugh: Another quickie tale, also tragic. Elric appears to be wrestling with many demons (in his mind, at least). Someone get this guy a shrink.The Singing Citadel: Last short story of the collection and probably the best, it shows Elric finally getting at least partially over the events of The Dreaming City, for a little while. And hey, any volume with the Duke of Hell in it can't be all bad.My only quibble is that the entire six book series wasn't reprinted here in its entireity (only the first two were). Hopefully that will be rectified when the eleventh book in the series: Elric: Stealer of Souls, is published. I'll be waiting"},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"This is one of the best dark fantasy books that I have ever read. It has love, death, demons, and magic. It kept me intuged the entire time. And very few books have done that. This book suceeds in taking the reader not only to a different time and place once but in fact it does several times. It will take the reader and the hero through diffrent dimenions. The storyline is very intersting. The book is also gory and pretty precise in its voilence and gore. The demon callings where also very intresting. And how it captures the way the characters look in the book is very nice. There is onl yone problem I had with this. Is that you have to buy another book to cotitnue with Elric's story. It really just leaves you there saying, &quot;now what?&quot; I have yet to read or even find this book. But all in all this book was a fantastic adventure."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"Lovers of dark fantasy, look no further than Michael Moorcock's Elric. He is a hero for the modern age, constantly wrestling with his own morality and resigned to his fate at the hands of forces beyond his control. Elric is by no means an anti-hero, on the contrary he is a realisticly tragic hero. His actions are governed by a complex ethical code that may, at times, lead him to acts of revenge, deception and treachery, but he is also capable of risking all for a worthy cause. Real life is rarely black and white and Elric's decisions reflect the complexity created by this terrible truth.Throughout the book the irresistable temptation of the power that Elric wields drives him to commit terrible atrocities, sometimes for good, sometimes for ill. However, what makes Elric a hero is the fact that he never stops searching for the unattainable goal of a truly peaceful exsistence.For a time he even manages to achieve that pipe dream, but the moment is fleeting and h! e is called, once again, by the forces of destiny to assume the mantle of the world destroyer.Anti-hero? No. Tragic hero? Defintely."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"I was given the new Elric Dreamthief's Daughter for my birthday a week ago. It had been a while since I had read Elric and DD was as good as the best. This sent me back to reading the whole saga and while I've matured since I first read it, the book also seems to have matured! It's true, folks. These books can be read on several levels. It isn't Marcel Proust, but there are so many more resonances in Moorcock (as in Peake) than in Tolkien that you wonder how Tolkien got so big, since they both started at the same time (admittedly Moorcock was a teenager and Prof. T was an oldster). Tolkien is much more an escape from reality, I guess. Cotton candy to Moorcock's sturdy nightmares ? Elric never lets you avoid the fundamental truths whereas LOTR, IMHO, helps you avoid them. Maybe that's what the mass public wants, but frankly I'll go for the adult quality of Moorcock's writing any old day. Now I have to get back to The Stealer of Souls. You can't help hoping that this time he won't die. I feel like that about Desdemona in Othello. There is also a distinct touch of the Hamlets here! The Prince of Ruins and the Prince of Denmark don't always take the most positive view of their situation... These books were a revelation to me when I first started them. They still offer revelations. Echoes of Byron, Shakespeare and Robert E. Howard. Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"Moorcock ranks among the gods of fantasy.

Elric is evil refined by ten thousand years of culture given entirely to the pursuit of evil as an art form. Having become the first of his race to develop a rudimentary conscience, Moorcock uses Elric to explore the forbidden areas of the human mind. In Elric, good is kept on the far horizon, something to achieve. But since Elric knows nothing except evil and his weaknesses are constantly exploited by the forces of evil it becomes a titanic struggle within that is mirrored in the world around him. Elric's new found conscience constantly plagues him and he struggles to break through his evil by using evil in the employ of good. Many of Elric's attributes seem entirely at odds with each other, his critical eye for great beauty and art clash with his blood lust and horrendous aptitude to cause himself and others pain. As you read of the inhuman brutality and great skill Elric wields in his many battles you may find yourself drawn into his world and reveling with him in the blood letting and misery he causes instead of being horrified. In creating what is arguably the greatest anti-hero or anti-protagonist in modern literature Moorcock allows the reader to explore the most restrained of our primal compulsions from the safety of the armchair. There are so many subtleties intricately woven into the fabric of this story it would be impossible to hit upon them all here. Elric's good twin (metaphorically), Corum, and moral opposite, Captain Bastable, provide an excellent contrast to Elric."},{"Title":"Elric: Song of the Black Sword (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 5)","review":"What can I say except that I was a bit disappointed by this part of the legendary Elric saga. In the UK and the rest of Europe this omnibus is available under the name \\"Elric of Melnibone\\" and contains the same stories Americans read in this \\"Song of the Black Sword\\". I've read my share of books, predominantly fantays and history. This is my first review here. Interesting to see how my views differ from a previous reviewer Mr. Battaglia. I'll go by step by step.Elric of Melnibone: Good and interesting intro to the saga. Not overly impressive though 7,5 out of 10.Fortress of the Pearl: Reasonable story of Elric as a fellow dreamthief. The Lady Oone was what made this story bearable, it was otherwise pretty poor. 6,5 out of 10.Sailer on the Seas of Fate: Easily the worst tale in this omnibus. It was too vague and the magic didn't impress me at all, no not even the short appearance of Corum Jhaelen Irsei, who will be known to Moorcock fans from his other trilogy. 5 out of 10. The enemy was a poorly written one and the internal struggle was not clear.Dreaming City: Catastrophical chapter for Melnibone. Terrible ending, the only moment in this entire book when I was touced by what happened. 7,5 out of 10While the God's laugh: Quality goes down yet again. The struggle within Elric is yet again poorly written. Many superlatives but little actual info. The quest was mediocre. 6 out of 10The singing citadel: Much better. Appearance of the supreme Chaos Lord Arioch. That always does a lot for the story. I also liked the intro with the queen and her sex enslaved pet wizard Theleb Ka'arna. 7 out of 10.All in all, certainly not a bad book but I'd expected much more from this often recommended series. Doesn't come close to Lord of the Rings, or Martin's Song of Ice and Fire if you must compare it to something.However, there are some strong points. Although the internal struggle Elric is supposed to go through is extremely weak in my humble opinion, there's the interesting matter of him being the last in a great and powerful line of sorcerer emperors. There's Elric being such a remarkable character with his long white hair, crimson eyes and his length. There's the intro to his incredible black Runeblade Stormbringer and there's sometimes the appearance, just a hint of the power of the Lords of Chaos in the form of Arioch (great name by the way). And some romances are well done. But like Zelazny's Amber series , there's so much more Moorcock could have done with magic and his characters. Especially the magic is too vague and unless the power of the Chaos Lord is shown, it lacks grandeur. It has it's little inconsistencies, for instance regarding his Red ring of emperor's , the Actorios, which then he does, and then he doesn't need in order for him to be able to use magic.Note however that the second omnibus, available here under the name \\"Stormbringer\\", is about better this one. It contains two stories that are arguably the best Elric tales ever, Stealer of Souls , Stormbringer and Revenge of the Rose. But you need an intro before you can read that one, and that would be \\"Song of the Black sword\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book month ago. I love it.

In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers.

However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN. It has all sorts of great messages about faith, love, and life.

I would probably have to read it again to fully understand it and get all that it has to offer.I also like the richness of the characters. Jo, the tom-boy, Meg, the pretty, mature one, Beth, the sweet, shy one, and Amy the artistic, prim and proper one. They are fun characters to read about along with Laurie, Marmee, Aunt March, and others.I definatly think this is a good novel to read because it is a classic and it would be a good one to read to learn more about the time period.I just wish it wasn't so long."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book is the coming-of-age story of four sisters. In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead.

I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently.

Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money.

Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like the book Little Women because it tought me I dont need money to be happy.

Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband.

I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried.

I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book.

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer.

The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance.

Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"it is a really nice novel. it is so good that i wish i could read it more. it was like i was witnessing the whole story myself . it was a really nice experiance. we can learn so much from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Definitely a classic that I think should be required reading.

I recieved mine new from a seller."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"THis book was delivered in the condition promised (Brand new and shrink-wrapped). Great price too!Thanks."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people. Yeah, that might have sounded pretty cheezy, but it's still nice to read some books like that."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i read books called little women in my school library and i thought the were sieres so there must be a lot of different versions i cant wait to read this even though im only 11 i heared great things about this book and i loved the ones i read in the library i just love to read and i love old books i think its cool to learn that really thats acatally how people lived then and then there were these lucky ones it toght mehow unfair life was and sometimes still is"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I inherited my mother's copy of \\"Little Women\\" when I was young, but always had a bit of trouble reading it. It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a little girl and I read this long version when I was eight.

I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review...

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago. It was one of my favorite books as a child. Each of the girls is an amazing charactrer with her own strengths.I love this book as much today a I did when I first read it. There are no formatting issues with the kindle version and you can't beat the price!!A fantastic read that showcases the strength that is woman."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i had heard of this book back in school... i am 27 yrs old now and read it for the 1st time and let me say i have no idea how i let this book slip for so long. it a wonderful story and i will always remember it. it a must read for all girls of any age. so glad i finally read it. would give more than 5 stars if i could."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Near the end of the nineteenth century, a family with four girls is growing up in \\"genteel poverty;\\" their lives derive much strength and goodness from the example and teaching of their loving parents. They are the March family, and they consist of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, guided by their loving \\"Marmee\\" while their father is away in the war.We first meet the \\"little women\\" when the older two are in their teens and the younger two are approaching those adolescent years. We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free. What a lovely tale. Definitely on my list of alltime favorites. I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had to read a novel for my high school English class. I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition. I love the Barnes and Noble classics series! The text is highly readable and easy on the eyes (while maintaining elegance), and the covers are well bound and lovely for a paperback. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined. At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I give this a one-star only for the introduction. The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition. Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This may sound ridiculous, but I was bound and determined to hate this novel. I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Despite the Jessie Wilcox Smith illustrations on the front and back covers, I was very disappointed to discover that the artist's color plates that so perfectly capture the characters and events in this American literary classic, were omitted from this edition. Intending to give it as a gift, I ordered this book because I was under the impression that it had the famous Jessie Wilcox Smith pictures. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased a copy of this book strictly based on the graphics of the cover. I was truly disappointed when I received the book of LITTLE WOMEN with an entirely different graphic for a cover, no way resembling the cover shown."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I agree with the reviewer below me 100%. This cover is disgusting. I was hoping to find a lovely copy of this book for my sister as a gift because she loved the copy I purchased for myself a while back. Mine is from Borders classics but unfortunately I don't think they are making the same copy anymore. It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics. I guess this was an attemt of modernizing a book which doesn't need to be modernized in order to be loved, that is what makes it a classic after all. What a shame."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A bit repetitious in the character morality lessons but that's just from my adult perspective.For Kindle Users:Recommendation - if want a fabulous fully illustration version, mobileread has it. Note, Amazon keeps editing out where elsewhere to get this.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics. My teacher recommended \\"Little Women\\" for me to read. So, I went off and bought it at the bookstore. In this edition you read an introductin first which I thought was a bit boring and long. It tells about the back round of the author and how this book was made. This story is broken up into two parts. The story starts out with four girls- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic. All in all, I thought this story was pretty good and I am not disappointed in it. I am very happy I read it. I know it is a classic and I do understand why."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic. And it is deffinately in my top five."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four girls coming of age during the Civil War. It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee.

Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago. From hair, dances, boys, and growing up. Little Women is a timeless classic that all are sure to enjoy forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task. Four girls growing up during the Civl War was hard for tomboyish Jo, gentle Beth, helpful Meg and exciting Amy. When they meet their wealthy nieghbor, Laurie, life becomes anything but boring.

Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece.

The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a young girl myself like this book very much because it gives girls like myself something to read that is not inappropriate.

Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!?

It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it. I know I enjoyed the descriptive tale of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a very interesting, realistic story. The different situations that these four girls go through are both heartwarming, sad, and interesting. I recommend that every person should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was an amazing book that pretty much kept me reading the entire time. I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read. It is the complete and unabridged version and the reader can tell that there's a difference. The story centers around four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy who are growing up during the Civil War. Add one loving mother, Marmee, the boy next door, Laurie, his tutor, John Brooke, and Friedrich Baher, a German professor and you have the best book of all time!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had to read this book for a high school English project. I thought the book was very informative. Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots. I didn't wanna put the book down, event after event, it kept on coming. I encourage you to read this book whether your 14 years old or 60 years old. It teaches good moral values."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott should be read by middle schoolers because it shows great moral values. For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read. Read this one. Your eyes will thank you later."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Much to my delight I read this book after a semester of boring classes and this was the PERFECT distraction. Even as an adult (almost there anyway), I could identify with nearly all of the March sisters, moved to tears and laughter throughout the whole book. I recommend Little Women to everyone especially young girls - you will absolutely treasure this book. Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a wonderful little book -a definite GREAT BUY!

There is a lot of love through out this book. You will meet in the beginning four young ladies and get to see what it was like for them to grow up during the war. While reading this book you will meet Amy, Meg, Beth and Jo. You will get to take adventures with Jo and see what it was like for her to br a tomboy, a writer, and an older sister.

If you are like me and found that the movie sucked please don't let this discorage you from reading this wonderful book. Louisa May Alcott captures beautifly the lives of the four March sister during the bitter era of the American Civil War. I gurantee you Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy will simply steal your heart and leave a warm and cozy feeling with in you for years to come. To all the parents out there with daughters I especially recommed this book for your little ones it is great to read aloud or for children to read to themselves..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"And so begins one of the most enduring and endearing stories' for the very own &quot;little women&quot; inside us...my favourite book of all time, I read it when I was 13 and have read it hundereds of times since and each read brings with it a new perspective-a new understanding of the important things in life...family and the value of friendship... an unfogetable classic."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Five stars?

Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about more than just living to please and getting married, it's a guide for life if you read it right! It definitely holds an honored spot on my bookshelf and it never gets old no matter how many times I read it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Sorry , but I truly could not abide the narrator. Smarmy beyond tolerance. It the March girls were 5 or 6 years old I could perhaps understand the way their voices were characterized but considering they are teenagers.....well, intolerable. I really tried, but I could not listen for more than half an hour and then I was done. Too bad they didn't find a better narrator."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first version of this book (which is this one) is so much better than the other versions!

A must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was delightful! I have wanted to read this book for many years and finally got to it, and I am SO glad! It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner. I wanted the story to go on. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book really makes you think about what you would do in their place. I have not finished this book but it is a great book to read but unless you have a mind that can understand Shakespeare at least a little bit you might need to take it slow and reread a LOT. trust me i have to do it ALL THE TIME! it makes the reading slower but overall this is a magical book that will show you the truth of friendship."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The download was very quick!

Says that I need more words for review, so here are some more. This is ridiculous Amazon! Ok"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult.

It is filled with romance and travel.

Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up. This story is a perfect example of how family's should love each other and not give up on anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In the senior class of the &quot;Great Books&quot; program at the college I attended, one of the weekly speakers asked how many of the women had read Little Women. Nearly all of the women in the class raised their hands. Then she asked how many men had read it. One man raised his hand - the chair of the English department! That was when I decided to read this book, and it has become one of my all-time favorites! I would recommend this book to everyone - men and women, young or old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved the book. I thought that Louisa May Alcott did anoutstanding job describing Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. I likedthe book also because it described a family in poverty, andshowed the whole picture, not just the good nor just the bad.I loved the book because all four of the girls get to go fromyoung ladies to women, and they all are allowed to marryfor love, and they're not forced to marry. I cried at the partwhere Beth died of Scarlet Fever. But other than that sadpart the rest of the book was great"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic. She is the third person who marries, and she marrys \\"the Laurence boy\\". She complains to many people that her nose is flat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too.I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a book for all ages. I have read this book numerous times and highly recommend it. It was the first book I bought my 8 year old daughter to read. That was two years ago, and she has read it twice. Its a great book to share with young girls. It has mystery and romance on a level that young girls can understand and women can relate to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book! It is beautiful and heartwarming and sweet. It actually inspired me to write stories as well. I laughed and cried and displayed about every possible emotion! My favorite characters are Laurie and Jo. I also have the movie (1994 version with an extrodiary performance by Christian Bale...Laurie, Winona Ryder...Jo and Susan Surandan...Marmie) The CD is just as delightful. A must read..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a timeless story of four sisters and their lives as they grow into adulthood. I read it first when I was quite young, but even now as I reread it, I never tire of it. Parents, you should buy this for your daughters. Every girl I know who has read it loves it and identifies themselves with one of the sisters. I would recommend this book even for adult women who have never read it. It is wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is nice because Alcott wants to make the world a better place so she tells about a family that goes through hard times and good times. They learn a lot of lessons together about how to be happy and keep fighting when things don't go so well."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In the book, &quot;Little Women&quot; written by author, Louisa May Alcott, you will be captured by the story of the four March girls and how they grew up during the time of the Civil War. I loved reading it and I'm sure anyone who takes the time to read it will be just as touched as I along as many others were. This is a great book to read and share with those who you love.

The story about four sisters Meg(the pretty one), Jo(the tomboy), Beth( the sensitve&amp;quite), and Amy(the ladylike one.)and how they grow up during the Cival War and after. Even though tragedy strikes more than once these girls pull thruogh with the love they have for eachother, and in the end find happieness."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I always thought that this was going to be a boring book that went on and on with no plot, but when I finally gave it a chance I realized that I couldn't of been more wrong. The book is like a whirl-pool that you can't get out of. You feel like you are part of the March family and cry when the cry, laugh when they laugh, etc. etc. The movie on the other hand was ok, but wasn't nearly half as good as the book. The put so many unimprtent things in and left so many really good parts out. I definently recremend this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is really wonderful!

I've read it more times than I can count. It's a joy to pass on my love of this book and this wonderful author to my 10 year old daughter. This is a book to inspire a love of classic literature in young women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I absolutly loved this book! I read it for school and I really enjoyed it! Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy deal with their problems as girls in the first half. Their father is in the war, and their mother works hard to keep the family going. Jo meets Laurie, the boy next door, Beth gets a piano, amy suffers horible humiliation, and meg duscovers that being vain is a terrible price to pay. My grandfather is an English professer, and he recomended it to me. Well now I'm recomending it to you. Read it now!!!! You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of these four girls and their experiences growing up is one that all readers can relate to. I have read the book multiple times, and each time I do I discover a new thing about these vivacious girls. I would especially recommend this book to anyone with sisters because the relationships between the four sisters is the main focus of the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Lousia. Through the years I have read ALL her other books but this one remains my favorite. If you read it you will understand why it is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old. The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Hi I;m Amanda. In 1999...my grandma said I'd enjoy the book Little Women. Did I ever! It's my favorite book in the world. It's about a loving family, with four girls.

I'm sure one of the girls personality's will match yours. Please get it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I've even got the movie.

These sisters live with their Marmee while their father s away in the Civil War. They overcome hardship by using the only thing they have, love. They each have their individual and unique talents. They each find their true love, and live in happiness. Louisa May Alcott, the author writes a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book about family. It shows struggles and hapiness. The story is about 4 girls growing up with their mom. Their father is not there because he is at war. Their names are Joe( main character) Amy, Beth, and Meg. Beth struggles from a disease and is usually not well, so her family must care for her when she is in need. Joe, the main character wants to be a writer but must put that a side when her sister is sick. Amy is the youngest, she trys to help Beth but is sent away because they fear she will get sick also. Meg, the oldest is married and lives at the house so she can help with the gardening and wathing Beth. The last character is Lorie he is their neighbor, he helps them out a lot. Once he sent a carriage to transfer the girls mom to their father because he is ill. Lorie ends up marrying one of the girls, but I won't tell you who. This book is one of the best books that I have read. So I suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"While this book is often relegated to \\"girl's fiction\\", Little Women should be read by anyone interested in American literature and history. Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. These sisters are very differnt. Meg, who dreams of having a husband and a family. Jo, who is a tomboy and who dreams of being a published writer. Beth, who is nice and sweet and loves to play the piano. Amy, who is vain and a good artist. Everytime I read this book, I cry. If you have or do read this book you know why. A very touching story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a librarian and purchased this for our library after reading several of the other books in the 'Whole Story' series. This is a lovely book. It feels good in the hand, has great sidebar photos and info and will draw in old and new fans of the classics--especially Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Don't panic the reading flows easily after the first couple of pages. It is, afterall, written during a different period. Even after knowing the story and seeing all the movie versions, I still wanted to read the original...no movie will make you cry more than the Book. At the end you will not want to say goodby to these sisters. I can understand why young girls read it many times over."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If you haven't read this book, I totally recommend that you do. What a beautiful and charming story and full of life lessons for all. It is one of my top 10 books!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"CENTENNIAL EDITION LITTLE WOMEN OR MEG, JO, BETH, AND AMY A wonderful book I remember from my childhood and plan to read again. The illustrations by Jessie Smith are outstanding. Also, the story is set in a period of our history which is so fascinating."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book reads like a children's novel and is an extremely pleasant reading experience. Really lovely!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of four sisters growing up in their mother's house in (I believe) New England. We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today. For a period book, the writing is very smooth and clear enough for our generation to understand. In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then. The neat thing about Little Women is how I connect more with different characters during different points in my life. Romantic Amy, Rebellious Jo, Homemaker Meg, I love them all. This is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Ive watched all the movie versions of this book but to actually read it myself, with my own imagination is too great an experience.

All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be.

Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have loved this book since I was a child!

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great classic read. I enjoyed this book decades ago when I was in high school, but enjoyed it even more this time.

It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one.

This book is a diaryof their lives, until three of them get married and have babiesof their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am absolutely torn as to how to rate this book.On one part, I feel awful about giving it a BAD rating, because it is a classic novel with an impeccably clean story.On the other hand, I can't bring myself to give it a GOOD rating, because the whole thing read like a Puritanical rant.Therefore, I think I will go with a 2.5 out of 5 star rating.I feel that Ms. Alcott said it best in the following quote: \\"'You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the Ten Commandments?...This man says, \\"An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy\\"...The next, \\"The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fantasies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\"'\\"As this quote was found in Part 2 of the book, which was written some years after Part 1 was published, I can only assume that the quote itself reflects real criticism that Ms. Alcott received for Part 1 of Little Women and reiterate that \\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\\"Of course, all of this is coming from one who is long past childhood and young adulthood and therefore somewhat jaded in both spiritual and relationship matters, and as this book is basically the epitome of happy endings and moral tirades, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it as much as I may have 10-15 years ago."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book a long time ago and absolutely hated it. Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago. I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars. I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like. I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps). Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them. But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm so glad to see that the cover and illustrations for the hardback version of LITTLE WOMEN have stayed the same; this book (along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's A LITTLE PRINCESS) were staples of bedtime reading when I was growing up, and as I became an avid reader on my own later on, LITTLE WOMEN revealed more layers to me. Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with?

It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments.

Never have I read a book that better deserved the title, &quot;classic.&quot;This is the moving story of the 4 March sisters, each strong in their own accounts and weak in others. It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole. Though the recent film treatment of the book is probably the definitive screen treatment, it could never capture the sense of beauty that the book did, or develop the characters as well.I was only 15 when I read this book, but I consider it to be one of my all-time favorites even still.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE, but anyone with an appetite to learn and an appreciation for life in general (or lack thereof) should find this book a reminder that despite wealth, poverty, sadness, happiness, death, and all other aspects of life that may separate us, we are all human, and the one thing that keeps us us together is love. -Ben, age 16"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it.

I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked this book sooo much! Sometimes the way the language was back then, i had a little bit of a hard time understanding it, but all in all what a wonderful story, and i fell in love with all the sisters in the novel! Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott has been undervalued for most of its history. This book is a true American Classic. Published originally in October of 1868, it is a story set during the Civil War, but Alcott does not deal with the specifics of the war. Instead, it serves as the pretext for the absence of Robin March, the father of the four \\"Little Women\\", for a large portion of the first book. The novel today actually consists of two books, the original \\"Little Women\\" from 1868, and the sequel \\"Good Wives\\" which was published the following year in April of 1869. The two volumes started being treated as one in 1880.The first book deals with the growing maturity of the four sisters, and in particularly of Jo and Meg as they have to learn to help their mother out more and do with less during the war, and while their father is away. Meg is the eldest at 16 when the story begins, and Jo (who clearly represents the author) is 15. There is then a gap of a couple years with Beth being just 13 and Amy 12. Their lives transition from that of young girls to young women, and each sister has her own unique traits. Margaret \\"Meg\\" with her beauty is following the traditional path in entering society and heading towards marriage. Josephine \\"Jo\\" is attracted by intellectual pursuits, in particular reading and writing. Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" is very shy and demure. She is also a peacemaker between the sisters, and enjoys helping others. Sadly, she also falls sick and never fully recovers from scarlet fever. Amy is the baby, and likes to tag along with others. She is also used to getting her own way.The first book is masterful in its simplicity. The story feels real, undoubtedly largely due to the author drawing on her own experiences, but Alcott also cleverly avoids adding too much into it and thereby making it unrealistic. She chooses a good steady pace, and the characters are well defined and consistently portrayed. Her dialogue is not perfect, but that adds to the overall realism of the telling of the story. It is a wonderful story for young women to read, and is also very readable for older readers.The second book is fairly good too, though it fails to be as believable as the first book as Alcott allowed herself to be convinced to have Jo marry. Alcott never married, and the union she chooses for Jo is a bit unusual and thus it doesn't feel right. Outside of that, though, the second book is a worthy successor to the first. Meg's choice of husband fits perfectly with the character and ideals that she develops in the first book. Most of Jo's actions in the second book also fit well with her character up, including her avoiding marriage with Laurie, her friend and neighbor who plays an important role throughout both books. Only at the point where Jo marries does it not fit. The tragedy of Meg's passing is beautifully described, and the reader is touched by the goodness of her character. Lastly, the full development of Amy fits well, including her choice of spouse.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Little Women\\" includes a very informative introduction by Elaine Showalter and extensive notes by Siobhan Kilfeather and Vinca Showalter. One of the important notes is that this edition is based on the original publications, and not those which were amended by Alcott for later editions, though obvious printer errors were corrected. There is discussion of some of the changes which Alcott made in the notes to the text. This is a wonderful book, but I will take part of a star away and round down for Jo's forced marriage."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book because of Jo March.

((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This classic novel is a must read for everyone. I found it to be well written and most entertaining. Isn't it wonderful that we live in an age where books can be stored on a computer. Amazon.com is better than a bricks and morter bookstore, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just finished reading this book and I liked it a lot. The first three quarters of Little Women were amazing, couldn't stop reading. The last quarter was slow. I had to skip a chapter or two to keep from dozing off, but the ending was very nice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic. Recorded Books always uses excellent narrators, and Barbara Caruso is no exception.Now if I could only get my hands on audio versions of Little Men and Jo's Boys, so I could once again enjoy those favorites, also...."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it.

However, it didn't really detract from the reading experience for me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've read this book several times and it just gets better and better.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this book for my girls and we all love it!!Hours of good reading.

I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It started out that I just wanted to get more AR points than this other girl in my class who had been unable to finish the book because she had thought it was so boring. I was anticipating the worse, but I began to read it and I just fell in love with the dear little book. It was just so great! My favorite character by far was Jo. After I read it more people in my class became curious and four other people in the class read it including the first girl who gave up on it. She tried again and after she finished it she said that she had loved the book too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Book little women is a classic tale of four sisiters liveing with there mother, there father risking his life in the civil war. it tells what it was like to be a girl in the times of the war.

Meg the eldest sister is about fitting in and watching over her sisters when ever there mother is not around.

I strongly recamend this addion for its beautiful illustrations that complament the classic story, you will treasure"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book.

This is one of the best books around for people of all ages. I so appreciate that the March family experienced the joys and pains of everyday living and handled both with dignity, spirit, and a genuine love for each other. Even though poor, the March family rose above it. So many lessons are taught in this book that young people, particularly, could benefit from reading it.

It wasn't the book I remembered. Deciding to stick with it, I kept going and it picked up steam as it went along becoming the book I enjoyed previously.I wonder how young girls react to this now when \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Gossip Girl\\" seem to be the norm and are so vastly different from this. The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit.

The novel concerns the lives and loves of four sisters growing up during the American Civil War. Beautiful Meg, tomboy Jo, serene Beth, and selfish Amy are based on Alcott's own experiences with her three sisters.Little Women has such a sweet feel to it. The characters are all so real, each with their own personalities that jump off the page. They make you care deeply about what happens to them. It's lovely to see how they struggle with their own and each other's flaws.Little women is overall a wonderful classic.

Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping.

However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us.

The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old. I had to read it for school-it was a desperate last choice for the required reading. Boy, didn't I see this coming! It took a while, I will offer that (I eventually had only read half by the test.) But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady. Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely. I mean this with all my heart, when I say that Little Women is the purest, realest, lovliest novel I have ever known. Thank you, Louisa. I now long for a better time."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"&quot;Little Women&quot; is my favorite book of all time. I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books dearly, and I seem to keep coming back to this one. Who cannot laugh with the Alcott sisters when Jo burns Meg's hair off? Who cannot shed at least a few tears when sweet, gentle Beth dies? Whose heart cannot be ripped apart in agony when Jo rejects Laurie's declaration of love for her? This book is a masterpiece. It's a role model - an encourager. To the person who said that the Marches were the &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they when I grow up. I feel like the Marches are my family! Read the book. You won't regret it, I promise you."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of the greatest works of American fiction ever written. It touches my heart in a different way each time I read it, and I have read it several times-every Christmas since I was 12. I've been looking to replace my worn, cheap, but dearly loved copy with something with a classic cover to mirror the classic literature its binding holds. This \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is a disgusting display of...I don't know what. The cover has nothing to do with the story. Cartoon scribbles of girls with pimples? Not only is this unappealing, it also implies that what lies on the inside is inconsequential dribble which it most certainly is not.Buy this book, just not this edition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott. This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Aside from a few typographical errors in the Kindle version, this book is an excellent e-book freebie.

It may well be considered a literary classic, although I still don't consider it a must-read for every young girl."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is best read at a younger age. As an adult, I can see the important lessons in regard to friendship, family and finding your place in the world even when it goes against the norm. I appreciate the simple tone and wording that would make this book an easy read for a middle school child. And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again. I would recommend it to my daughters for it's message, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends as recreational reading."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said &quot;told yah so&quot; and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading. They still haven't read it but thats their loss!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I chose to read Little Women for my 6th grade English book report because I had heard that it was a really great book as well as a great American novel. I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge. But if you want a way to pass a rainy day (or even a snowy one), this is one of the greatest books to curl up with."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered.

Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out.

I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day.

Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older... This is a great book for teaching these things to children."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale of four sisters struggling their way through life during the Civil War. I have read this book more times than I can count, and I still love it. Once I pick it up I can't put it down, lost in this seemingly fantasy world, which was actually quite true more than 100 years ago.My favorite thing about Little Women has to be the characters. Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages.

There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've seen three of the movies made of this classic.

And you cannot go wrong with so little money for it. Love those classics."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott.

In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting.

I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children.

I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a \\"capital\\" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!)

This book reflects on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War. While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war. The four girls must learn many lessons in life and grow up to be fine women even during hard times. The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls.

The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play.

Set in New England, the story captures the essence of sisterhood and finding things to occupy the time in days when there was little money or entertainment provided.Written by Louisa May Alcott, the story retells the childhood of Alcott and the ways that strong family values helped hold the family together during tough times. The story tells of how the family followed the transcendentalist theories which emphasized always perfecting oneself. The girls all struggle to find their place in the world and their own personal perfections throughout life.Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy all struggle with where the days of childhood end and the days of being a Woman begin. Each girl tries to discover her calling and her gifts that she will present to the world. Whether an artist, a writer, or whatever life calls them to be, each of them have dreams of growing up and making their mark on life and the world.The family seems to overcome all obstacles handed to them. Whether their father is away at war, money is hard to come by, or illness plagues the family, they always seem to get through it. They get through it with the love and support of each other.This classic novel reaches out to audiences of all ages. It touches the hearts of all who have ever loved, lost, struggled, and overcome obstacles in life."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, in my opinion, is the best book ever written. It tells the story of a family living in poverty, but are much richer in love than any family I know of. There are four sisters who love each other very much, but are often quarreling as sisters do. I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before. I recommend this book to everyone who likes classics. Also all women who have sisters will really appreciate the trials that these four have."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is one of the most captivating and heartfelt stories I have ever read. This is the story of four sisters, living at an unstable time in American history, who learn to overcome poverty and selfish wants to become mature and accomplished women. Their triumphs will bring a smile to your face, while their trials will bring you tears. The March sisters will win their way into your mind and heart, and their story is one you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women by:Louisa May Alcott.This book is an amazing book. It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not. But I still think this was a great book and I reccomend it to anyone searching for a book that you can not help but care about the characters."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was nine years old i read little Women. Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book. It is about four sisters who live with their mother, \\"Marmee\\". Their father is working in the Civil War. I think it was very interesting because Miss Alcott makes it full of surprises. Even when sometimes the surprises seem out of place, everything comes out perfect.Anyway, it has a very nice ending, and I loved reading it even though it was very long."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I thought the book was rather good. It was kind of easy to read and easy to follow. I also liked it because it was about four sisters. I think books with sisters it in are good for children to read so they no what other ppl think its like to have sisters. Then ending was really cute too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I actually liked the book Little Women. I am not huge fan of reading, but for some reason i really liked this book. It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down. There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering. An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away. It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes! A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies! I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I remember seeing this book on my Grandmom's book shelf since I was old enough to read the titles. Yet all my life I just passed it by. I saw the '90s movie and read Little Vampire Women, but still did not pick up the book. Finally I decided to download it. I cannot believe I never read it before. It was such a great book. You feel for each of the girls and find a little of yourself in one or all of them. This is one of those books I could see myself reading again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing. The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book but after reading it I didn't realize it had two parts ( Good Wives is the second) and bought the second book. So if you read it you will love it but be carefull!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is such a long book, it would have been nice if there were a table of contents included with this version. But if you're not picky about that, this is a great free version of the book, I'd recommend it vice paying money for another edition. I very much enjoyed re-reading a novel that was so much part of my childhood."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am ten years old and I read Little Women when I was eight or nine years old and I read it again recently and I think its a wonderful classic."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book was excellent. I would highly recommend it to others. I expected the ending to end one way and was completely surprised when it ended another way. Even though the time period is way back when, it kept me interested."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was little. I read it multiple times, and even held my own version of their Pilgrim's Progress roleplay. I hadn't read it for years, but when I got my Kindle for Christmas and saw this free version, I had to download it. The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too). It's a gentle, quiet book filled with profound wisdom and loving relationships between family members. The path of growing up is never easy, but this book shows how for many, faith and family can be the underpinnings for a bright future."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is so well written and accessible. I had only seen the movie before reading the book, and as with most all stories, the book is by far better. I felt as if I were a silent member of the March family. I laughed at Jo's antics, and cried at Beth's departure. I really think this book has encouraged me to be a genuinely better person. I feel challenged to hold my tongue and have patience and to show kindness. This is definitely a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love this book and the charming characters in it. The book is about girls growing up to be Little Women, and there journeys and lessons on the way. It's a great book but in a little to much detail for my opinion, but it was an old book and still is."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book touched my heart. Since I'm 10 it's hard to get books without nasty dirty stuff in them. The book started off slow, but by the 80th page I loved it I recommend it to everybody young and old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book arrived in perfect condition, which has not been the case recently with books ordered from Amazon. Hopefully this signals a change for the better in their packing."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Every year I give my eleven year old daughter a book for Christmas so this year I bought \\"Little Women\\" and I was very pleased with the book. I love the cloth cover and graphics. It was a great value for what I paid for it. It looks great on the bookshelf and of course who doesn't love \\"Little Women\\", a great classic!! My daughter also received a Kindle Fire for Christmas which she loves but I still love to see children with a book in their hands."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a great classic. A must read for young girls. I could not believe that it was free from Kindle. Worth so much more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I got this book for free so I just read it to see what it was about. I am surprised to say Little Women is actually a very addicting book. All of the characters are fun to follow. The second group of stories are stronger than the first, but overall this is a great read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own. Watching each girl grow up into mature women was like seeing your niece grow up, mature, and turn into a new person."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've been reading on this book for some time; truth be told, I actually started reading this book about forty-five years ago! I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good. Genuinely inspiring people in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book. I found a lot of life lessons in it. I had such an easy time reading it on my Kindle, especially during my sleepless nights before having my baby."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa Alcott was born in the 1832 in a town called Germantown, Pennsylvania United States.Her father was a philosopher and teacher averse to any work activities.For this reason the family was forced to move in areas in and around Boston Massachusetts.In my opinion it is wrong to criticize him like an layabout mainly because he was surely against the labor exploitation and the alienation of the man - machine.The family was involved in an intense moral conviction, for instance they did not wear cotton, because it was produced by slave labor in the south of the United States.Reading this novel we will be conscious of the good teachings and the tension due to the Civil War.In my opinion this is a fundamental reading for young and adult readers, because they will learn the significance of poverty, the importance and rules of the family for the evolution of the society, and the collateral effect of the American Civil War on a family of four daughters.From the first paragraphs emerges their purity and social commitment when the girls decided to renounce of their Christmas' gift for buy a present to their mother and their commendable attitude in regard to the Hummels.The central character is Josephine March, in my opinion the author of this novel and the particular description of her childhood in a difficult context in a difficult time and her true love for a man and the culture.Before analyzing the most important phrases, I have to say that the good teaching of this novel is that as responsible citizens we must empower our children about their centrality for a proper development and maintaining of the society."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I remember opening up this book one day when I was in a particularly melancholy mood. After reading a few chapters of this book, however, I found my heart warmed to its very core.I cannot even count the amount of times I shed tears while reading this book. Mr. Laurence and Beth's relationship is beautiful. The unbreakable bond of the four sisters is heartwarming. Laurie's friendship with the girls is moving. The connection between the girls and their mother is tender.&lt;Little Women> is...A captivating little novel that makes one remember that there are things more dear on this earth than money, fame, and other worldly things.A story of four magnificent young girls who go through sorrow, joy, suffering, and happiness to grow to be great women, all wonderful in their own way.Louisa May Alcott's way with words makes one adore the American language, as Alcott uses her words to paint the best picture of the welcoming home of the March family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Very good book. I know why it's considered a classic. Nice easy read. Well written. Type of book that you just want to sit down and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading. Free on Kindle -- so Kindle readers, download and enjoy this enduring American classic. Not just for children or for girls; I'm a 61-year-old man!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was in the 7th grade, my mother gave me Little Women for Mother's Day from my dolls (yes, I still played with dolls in the 7th grade). Reading it was a life altering experience. I remember reading parts of it to my mother in the kitchen while she was cooking dinner. When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today. I ended up having 4 daughters myself, daughters whom my family refers to as my \\"Little Women.\\" One of my girls even calls me \\"Marmee.\\"! Jo inspired me to write St. James Place.St. James Place"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book when I first read it as a girl and I loved it even more the second time when I read it as an adult. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy became like sisters to me as I read and I miss them now that I am through reading!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of those books that I hated to see end...but the \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" brought us to some closure. I recommend this book to every young girl to read and soak up it's good morals, Christian wisdom and thrill of adventure in the world of the March family!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It's nice to have these freebie classics. Especially when I don't want to pop for a kindle, just the iPhone app."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I must have read this book a dozen times before I graduated from junior high, but it is still a favorite of mine. Even after first reading it 15 years or re-reading it, I still cry when Beth dies, laugh when the sisters write and star in their own plays and pull for Jo as she makes a way for herself in a man's world. If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price. I can't recommend this book strongly enough. In fact I am beginning to read it again even now!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My Mama used to read to us all the time, and this was and is still onbe of her favs."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When my book club selected this book, I didn't want to spend alot of money on another copy since I had already read and thrown out 2 others. When this one arrived (earlier than expected) and in perfect condition, I was delighted. I decided that I am going to keep it in case my grand daughters want to read it when they come to my house for a summer visit. Many thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The last time I read \\"Little Women,\\" I must have been somewhere between the ages of 10 and 12. I'm now almost 70. The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again. And I'm so glad. First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story. I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read. They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship. Someone said to me the other day that it is a real tragedy that this story has been read primarily by girls. We girls want everyone to know the story of the \\"Little Women.\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When their father goes off to war,the March sisters (Meg,Joe,Beth,and Amy)must work together to help their mother go through many hardships.As the girls grow up and fall in love,they remain the BEST of friends.This is a great book,that you will be excited to finish!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I liked the way that the book delt with things that people actually went through. I can not relate to wearing a dress with a hole burnt in it to a party, but I can relate that situation to spiling something on yourself, or getting a surprise stain on your new dress while dancing. They showed the family in all living conditions. Them living in poverty being angry about not having all of the things that they wnat, and them doing good for others by giving them their Christmas breakfast. Sisters will always argue, but they learned to love each other in spite of the things that made them mad. Each of them had something that they had a passion for and they loved each others work. They all loved to read the stories that Jowrote, and tey loved to hear about all of the parties that Meg attended, and listen to the music that Beth played, and Admire the pictures that Amy drew. They were each special in their own way, and love each other even more because of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is my all time favourite book.It is the heartwarming story of a family during the American Civil War.It describes the joys &amp; sorrows of four girls belonging to the March family &amp; follows their journey through life.As a child it was their personal stories that fascinated me, but as an adult I appreciate the authentic potrayal of the turbulent times that were the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I recommend this book, Little Women for not only child but adult. This is a very heart-warming story. It is a story about 4 sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy during the Civil War. Through many experiences such as dreams, illnesses, quarrales and so on, all sisters get to go from girls to women. My favorite character is Jo. Though she was a very tomboy and quarraied with Amy so often, she ran through her dream to be a writer. I admired her intent mind. Also she had a kind heart to think about others even though sacrificd herself. Mr. March became ill during he went to the war. However Mrs. March didn^t have enough money. Then Jo cut her long beautiful hair and sold it to make money for her father. It was very hard thing for Jo but she sacrificd herself. What I was most moved i 4 sisters^ strong cooparation.

I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Don't get me wrong. While I'm the type that shrieks and covers my eyes when watching something like \\"Spiderman II\\" at a kissing part (or at a violent part, for that matter...) I don't mind books about marriage. And so the first part, Little Women book I, was a perfect portrait of a family. A good book, despite the heavy prejudice I carried against it, as it was (gasp) A Required Reading Book.The Part II, Good Wives, was -- er....interesting. Let's go through it, marriage by marriage.Meg's marriage. Cute. Same age, good match, and even I, who have decided that my marriage to ANYONE (or dating, for that matter) would be a sign of the Apocolypse, could understand why some less fortunate souls devote their life to another, staying with that person forever (well, not in the twenty-first century they don't - unfortunately). Meg and John Brooke was good. Nice. Sweet. You get it. Now let's move on.Laurie (Theodore's his real name, for all you thinking that to name a male child Laurie is about the greatest measure of torture you can inflict upon a boy) and Amy.

It was already bad enough that the March sister were extreamly good (too good)and how they complained about stupid stuff, like noses and how they were poor (which doesn't even make sense if you have a servant and a manor!)but she killed of Beth so early in the series and Jo didn't even marry Laurie!!

I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible. Thus, one more book fed to the dustbunnies in 2009. (zero)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I haven't read this book &amp; probably should. I started to in grade school and got bored after 2 pages. Anyway, I watched the movie recently and was very confused. It was a pretty good story and apparently autobiographical, but can someone who is hip on this story answer some questions. e-mail me at msbeckaru@aol.com1) Who is Marmee? The sisters are Meg, Jo, Beth, &amp; Amy as best as I could tell. Does the mom have a name? 2) Is Teddy the same person as Laurie cuz I'm really confused on that. 3) What are Meg's babies names?

Recently I sat down in excited anticipation to read this story to my ten-year-old daughter, only to have both of us fall asleep in record time. Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read. I'm sorry to admit that my old friend is collecting dust on the shelf, but the world is full of great books of our time just waiting to be read in substitution."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Bought this book for my friend, who recently became a 4th grade teacher, to keep in her classroom for her students to read.

The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings. The characters just all around have great qualities and are so loveable. It's a nice life story to read about. The genre is like a biography but not quite. It's a great old fashion book to read and shows the true meaning of family. It's a sure attention grabber! The Little Women have gone along way in their lives and will continue to live their lives to the fullest ability no matter if riches come or do not come their way."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book that once you read it you will never forget it.

I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. \\"Watching\\" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but &quot;Little Women&quot; retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But &quot;Little Women&quot; is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as &quot;heartwarming&quot; stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.&quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised to find that he book I had been occasionally rereading for over 50 years was NOT the original novel. My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose.

I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book. Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned.

It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my \\"home copy\\" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one.

This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy! If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!! I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!!

Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion. Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School. This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....This book (and the books after it) were great. Lousia May Alcott made 4 girls, that seem real. 4 girls with problems that girls have now.I especially loved the bond that the March family had.

I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War. The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands. Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced. They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place. These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock.

Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding.

Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth show us all of the mountains a girl could encounter.Meg, the oldest is strong and beautiful. Beth, slowly washing away like a wave upon the sand. Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical \\"little women\\" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all. The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted. The friendships and relationships this book has to offer are so much fun to read about, especially anybody who has been a 12 year old girl.Louisa May Alcott uses a wonderful narrative voice to tell the story. She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins.

Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done. I like how the language and story are so old fashioned and find myself using such dialect after reading it!

If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book.

She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching.

As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now.

Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less.

I really liked the beginning but then had trouble whenmy 11 year old A.D.D-afflicted brain could'nthandle it's rather long length.Curiously, I never got beyond aboutthat part of book,then one night, having nothing to read I decided togive it another go and I loved it!Then in my 20's,(and A.D.D better under control)I got the humor, understood all thesister's hopes and ambitions betterthen ever,especially Jo's and Amy's. It really was a &quot;progressive&quot;book for it's time in that these girls had ambitions beyond just getting married, is about following your bliss,doingwhat makes you happy and living your life to the fullest.

The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I also read this book as a child and re-read it as an adult, finding it just as magical, tender and great as I did back then.

It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book alot.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women Louisa May Alcott, 2004, 520 pages. $9.95Sterling Publishing ISBN 978-1-4027-1458-0Have you ever had a brother or sister and you just can't be without them? Would you do anything for them? That's how it is for Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They are not perfect but great sisters. They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full. The interesting theme is love, I would recommend this book to children ages, 12 and up and I would also recommend the book to young adults, because the book is very enjoying."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Wouldn't it be fun to live in the early 1900's?

I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls. It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today. There are times when you need an \\"old friend\\" to read and provide some comfort and \\"Little Women\\" is that friend. It's a true classic in American literature."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This amazing classic made me laugh out loud,pulled at my heratstrings, and made me cry. but close to the end there were even tears of joy.

Even as an adult, this is still a wonderful, touching story, and is a refreshing breath of fresh air in a world that's become increasingly jaded."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.\\"Everyone is no doubt familiar this opening line. It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters. Jo March being the real main character. If you have enjoyed the movie. Then you will love the book as it does continue past where the movies left off.

Although I was only 8 years old when I read, and are ten now, I believe that I fully do understand what the book is about. I have always been fascxinated by this book and when I read this it just blew me away. When I read this I actually feel like Im in the attic with Jo, in the dressing room with Meg, sitting at the piano with beth, or trading lemons with Amy.

I was read to this book when I was very young, but only did I understand it's full meaning until reading it again recently. This is a classic book that is not to be missed.

I love it and a whole family can read it !"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless novel appeals not only to the young, but to the seasoned reader as well. None have captured the hearts and minds of the feminine creature as has this famed American author. Whether the reader desires a realistic period piece or a touching story about life, love, death and the human condition, Alcott covers all the bases. Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are. Classic novels are more than artillery for our educational arsenal, they are explorations of ourselves. &quot;Little Women&quot; does not disappoint to be all that and much more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story is very interesting and good.It talks about alot of different things, like sorrows, mishaps, love, etc.I especcially like Jo."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"a very nice story. you can read it as many times as you want. it is always fresh."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really loved this book.

I think there are a lot of girls who don't want to be good at all. I don't like it that the author takes wanting to be good for granted."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women are the perfect compliment to little men. Large men can like them too, however, if they are careful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women's Dreaming GlassesI have always had extremely vivid dreams. While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amys' father has gone to war and they all have their own problems.

I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much.

Nor is the theme concerned with the &quot;tension between social responsibility &amp; individual and artistic freedom&quot; except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with &quot;group identities&quot; who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility &amp; intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to &quot;re-frame&quot; &quot;de-construct&quot; and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture.

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The words are so crowded. So I won't suggest this one."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"After reading Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre, both written in the 1800s and which I loved, I thought I'd try another classic, Little Women. What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war.

These four girls&iexcl; weaving story touches my heart deeply. Laurie, a charming young man, has an unusually sincere love for Jo, yet marries her sister Amy in the end. This scenario gives me another answer about the love and deep affection. John, who is Meg&iexcl;s husband, and Friedrich, who is Jo&iexcl;s husband, helps the story becomes more exciting.

There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included.

The story revolves around the home life of four close sisters and two strong, moral parents. As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read.

First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang.

It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself.

It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone.

Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read ! I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book.

Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing. It is there that Jo meets Fridrich.This classic novel of home, family and love, inspired by the author's own life, will linger in your heart long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real?

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story line is quite excellent, I love the words the Louisa uses! Such variety! In this book are triumphs and failures, love and loss. Overall an astounding book - I would read it again in a heart beat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\", written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four sisters, Jo March who is fifteen-years-old, Meg March who is the oldest, Beth March who is thirteen-years-old, and Amy March who is the youngest by twelve-years-old, who live in England with their mother, Marmee. They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother. I thought it was a great story because it is really easy to figure out what they are doing in a jiff. The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters? Read Little Women and get into the story. I think the best rating for this book is four and a half stars. It needed a little more happiness towards the end. But still take the risk and read Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver.
