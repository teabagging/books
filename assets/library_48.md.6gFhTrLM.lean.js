Since the first copy came into our home 2 generations ago, it has been replaced several times and read by adults and children alike, and is now being enjoyed by a 4th generation - our grandchildren. We purchased the 1966 edition shown in this listing with the beautiful dust jacket repro of Tolkien's painting of the Misty Mountains. Tolkien's unique art always piques the imagination. The image on the dust jacket of this edition was reproduced by one teenage son on his bedroom wall, and remains there to this day, some 25 years later, and in much better condition than the dust jacket of his parents' old book...Unlike Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit is not moralistic, i.e. there is no battle of good and evil. It is simply a straighforward adventure story. Little did we know when first reading The Hobbit that Bilbo's finding of a magic ring would trigger armageddon. Finding this out in our later readings of the LR trilogy did not reduce the continued pleasure and interest in Bilbo's adventures. Our first joyous discovery of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is renewed with each re-reading to a grandchild.The Hobbit carries on galantly alongside Winnie the Pooh, Alice in Wonderland, The Wind In the Willows, and the Just So Stories. There is plenty of intellectual value for children in terms of broadening vocabulary, because it stirs intense curiosity through following a complex story line. Such books offer a look into other worlds where life and people are quite different, where rivers don't flow to familiar ends, and where simple objects can have properties and uses other than the obvious. No one absorbs this kind of material better than children, but over the years we saw the family's teens and collegiates sometimes re-read The Hobbit. The story keeps its hold even on minds that are jaded by age and hard knocks."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Let me just start by saying that I love, and have always since the first time I read it, loved this book. No one should go through life without at least giving this book a shot.In this novel J.R.R. Tolkien pens the archetypal adventure for the modern world, complete with memorable characters, a rich world, and a good amount of danger. The story, although sometimes touted as a book for young people, is perfectly acceptable for adults as well. Regardless of age, this is one of the few reads which will truly engross you from the first page to the last.Do yourself a favor: buy your kid a copy. Buy yourself a copy. This is a book every amateur adventurer should read at least once."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A fantastic rendering of this tale. Rob Inglis is a treasure -- the voices are amazing and engaging. A must-have for anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This particular copy of the hobbit was just amazing.

Tolkien fan and if you keep your books nice. I recommend this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am very satisfied with the purchase, the book was new, very new, like nobody had read it.

Therefore, it's hard for me to think of The Hobbit without comparing and contrasting it to the trilogy. First off, The Hobbit bears all of Tolkien's genius: descriptive passages that are more like a painting than a paragraph, clever poetry and songs, and an imaginary world that has come to life with Tolkien's inventive language and culture of the characters. When one reads Tolkien, it's like reading about a real place. However, the one thing that I really did not like about \\"The Hobbit,\\" especially in comparison to LOTR, is that there is very little character development. I often had trouble keeping track of names because the characters just don't do much besides have adventures. On the whole, I give this book 4 stars for its creativity, originality, adventurous plot, and beautiful language."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The title says it all.

It really kept my attention and the vocabulary was at a pretty easy level for me. I also liked how you could tie christianity into the book. J.R.R. Tolkien's book, The Hobbit, is a big book about the adventures of Bilbo (the hobbit), dwarves, and many other fascinating creatures that you meet along the way. Now when I say big, I mean big. This 272 page book is filled with page turning fantasy that will keep you reading for hours.Hobbits are creatures that don't like to leave the comfort of their home, and especially don't like to go on adventures. One day Gandalf the Wizard comes to Bilbo's hobbit hole and asks him to join him on a gigantic excursion to get the dwarfs' gold back. One day latter about one dozen dwarves come to Bilbo's house encouraging him to come. Bilbo finally gives in even after being warned that the journey will be long, hard, and dangerous. This book is about their tough times. I definaily think that the theme of this book is about how adventure can change a person."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have an affection for the Hobbit that I don't have for the other volumes in the series, likely due to seeing the cartoon in childhood and enjoying the comic book adaption. (see paperback edition highly recommended!) It is rightly described as a prelude to greatness.We see how it all began when the most inoffensive of creatures Bilbo Baggins enjoying a day of smoke rings and the ordinary life he leads is drawn by fate (or Gandalf) into a great adventure with 13 Dwarfs, Elves, Spiders, Gobblins, Eagles, and of course a dragon. It is an adventure where he finds out more about himself than he himself knows.Unlike the later volumes the songs are of a higher quality (or so I think) but that again could be because I have actually heard them sung in the old cartoon. The story is both exciting and calm and easy. Not even the climatic battle near the end seems to take the focus off the Hobbit.The book seems to keep the calm and relaxed pace that a Hobbit likes in his life. In my opinion it adds to rather than takes away from the telling. Lots of time for more adventure in the next series.I think the pace of the book more than anything else makes it. It doesn't thrust itself upon you. It seems to say; to paraphrase the words of Bilbo: &quot;It is a fine day for smoke rings, come blow some with me.&quot;It is an invitation worth taking"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With all of the current hype about the Lord of the Rings, I decided to read both that trilogy, and its predecessor, The Hobbit. I haven't quite gotten to the Fellowship of the Ring, but if it is even half as good as this book, I will be overjoyed.The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who is, well, a hobbit. The wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Thorin, along with the rest of the company of dwarves, came to the doorstep of Bilbo's respectable hobbit-hole in the Shire, in need of a burglar on their &quot;adventure&quot; to regain the treasure currently in the possession of the great dragon Smaug. Reluctantly, Bilbo agrees to the journey.J.R.R. Tolkein weaves a wonderful story, following Bilbo's adventure. Along the way, Bilbo and his counterparts meet trolls, goblins, elves, humans, giant spiders, and many other dangers. As Bilbo learns more about being a burglar and going on adventures, he slowly gains the respect of his comrades. And in the end, it was Bilbo alone who took the weight of the company, when worse came to worse.This is a classic tale, one that has already been immortalized in literary history. I loved it, as many have before me, and many will after. I reccommend it to anyone and everyone, because it is one of those books that must be read at least once in your lifetime!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Only C. S. Lewis can come close to J. R. R. Tolkien in creating exciting mythincal worlds and believable characters and still have room for plot. Of the four &quot;Lord of the the Rings&quot; books, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is truly the best, and is, in my opinion, the greatest fantasy tale ever told. The Trilogy is splendid, but Tolkien is able to put all of the adventure and granduer from the other three books into this one, outstanding novel. This book is the paramount novel of fantasy epics and it shall be remembered throughout history as one of the greatest stories ever told."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There and back again, as the subtitle goes. A round trip in the book, yet a beginning to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A round trip, yet an intro into Middle Earth. A spectacular story about a Hobbit, his journey, and a ring.As you can see, there have been over 900 reviews of this book. All told, this book has a 4.5 star rating. What can I say that will change your mind on this? What can I say that has not been said already? Most likely nothing. I can shed no new light on this piece of fiction. All I can do is chime in with an opinin that has already been stated but by using other words. This book is excellent.Well, so be it. The book is a great read. It's a great tale in a great locale. This book is certainly required reading for anyone who reads various genres. Be it normally fantasy, sci-fi, history, or satire, I'd be surprised if you picked up this book and did not at least like it.Is this a high level brain teaser? No. Is this going to change the world? No. Are your problems going to be solved after you read this book? I doubt it. This book is an escape, an escape into the world that JRR Tolkein pulled from his mind's eye and thrown down on paper. This is the intro to that world he saw. And what a great advaneture it is.I'm not into revealing polt when I write reviews. I think that's silly stuff and I don't want to be told what to expect when I read a review. However, you have to give hints. And the book here is all about an adventure. An adventure that goes over hills, under hills, and around them. An adventure that meets with various good and bad people/things. An adventure that sometimes goes well, and seomtimes not. An adventure that finds its way to the lair of a dragon and his hordes of gold. This adventure is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but only a small find by Bilbo along the way links the 2. That and the wizard Galdalf.In reading this for the first time in about 10 years, I found it just as interesting as the first time, if not a lot easier to blaze through the pages. The writing is fantasy. You could easily digest this whole book in a solid day if you wanted to. And it would be a crime to do so because then the adventure would be over barely after it began.The only point of my review is this. Read it. Even if you hate it (which you probably won't), this is something you should have read in your lifetime. If you are 10 or 100, it is a fun book to pick up. It appeals to all ages and is something that no home library should be without. I can say I've read American history, Tom Robbins, Kurt Vonnegut, Doglass Adams (and Coupland), Middle Eastern history, as well as other fantasy books and escapism novels from the likes of Clive Cussler. And this belongs on my book shelf just as much as any of those."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Dating back to 1937, THE HOBBIT is truly a timeless classic. This wonderfully vivid fantasy stands perfectly well on its own, but also sets the stage for Tolkein's grand work, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Hobbits are (or were) little people, smaller than bearded dwarves, but without beards or magic. They dress brightly and are somewhat fat in the stomach. They don't need shoes and have good-natured faces. Bilbo Baggins is a very well-to-do hobbit.When Gandalf the Wizard comes calling on Bilbo, offering a great adventure, Bilbo graciously declines. However, Bilbo is cleverly tricked into joining, or rather leading, 13 dwarves on a long and dangerous quest for a long lost golden treasure.The Hobbit captures the hearts of young adults and adults alike; a classic to be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As I was planning to read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I found it essential to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

I could not put this book down until I was through with it. (That is actually true).

These children's parents should be ashamed to have raised such illiterate children who (apparently) are bankrupt of imagination.

It is an inspirational coming-of-age tale, starring a reluctant hero who is made of tougher stuff than he realizes. It is a classic--perhaps timeless--children's tale that adults enjoy more so than the younger audience, especially in modern times. It is an epic fantasy tale that has influenced the genre--along withThe Lord of the Rings--more than any other book. However, it is not--in my opinion--perfect.The biggest complaint you'll find about \\"The Hobbit\\" is that the prose is 'too descriptive.' You'll see many Tolkien-enthusiasts bashing those who think that, insinuating that those reviewers who dislike Tolkien's style are simply too stupid to properly understand it. I, however, disagree. It all comes down to a matter of taste and, for me (at times), Tolkien's highly descriptive prose bogs the story down a bit too much. However, not a sentence in this story can be deemed \\"bad,\\" because the writing--whether you consider it too descriptive or 'just right'--is beautiful. His talent for describing both landscape and character is immense, and will leave any high-fantasy fan more than satisfied.\\"The Hobbit\\" is undoubtedly a beautiful book. As I said, I wouldn't call it perfect, but the story of Bilbo Baggins and his epic adventure is at the very least a \\"must-have.\\" I recommend you buy it in hardcover, preferably the Alan Lee Illustrated Edition, so it will last through the ages.8/10"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an amazing book to read.

But I have been unable to find a hardback copy until now! Thank you! I will treasure the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a captivating story that combines ancient Greek and Roman mythology and Anglo-Saxon tradition to produce a timeless classic. J.R.R. Tolkien creates his own mythical world called Middle-Earth, which is actually Earth the way it existed millions of years ago. Tolkien first introduces the reader to the race of hobbits, which are little people who live to eat, in the form of Bilbo Baggins. A wizard named Gandalf approaches Bilbo with an adventure and out of courtesy Bilbo invites him to tea. Bilbo receives a surprise when a group of thirteen dwarves arrives with Gandalf. Gandalf has already volunteered Bilbo to be a burglar for the dwarves in their attempt to reclaim gold that is rightfully theirs from the vicious dragon, Smaug. Bilbo finally agrees to this plan and they set off the very next day for Lonely Mountain, the place where Smaug currently inhabits. Bilbo then experiences an epic journey where he is transformed from a regular hobbit that is incapable of leading to a leader who is courageous in the face of adversity and even becomes a hero before the journey is over. As the story develops the road for Bilbo and the dwarves becomes increasingly ominous and the road ahead seems to present more dangers than the road behind. Each of Tolkien's chapters symbolizes a new obstacle to overcome, which actually has little to do with the ultimate goal of Bilbo and the dwarves of reclaiming the gold from Smaug. However, all these chapters culminate in an ultimate battle between good and evil which pits the \\"Good People,\\" the humans, elves, and dwarves in a battle for supremacy over the brutal Whargs and goblins. Even though initially written as a child's story people of all ages can enjoy The Hobbit, which is the prequel to and establishes many of the ideas prominent in Tolkien's most famous work The Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What is there to say? It is tried, proven and true from the master of fairy tales. The illustrations are great. It's a must for all fantasy libraries and collectors."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Branch G. - Miller Place, NYThe prequel to the epic Lord of the Rings series, The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is a must read for young adults who love fantasy literature.One reason I enjoyed reading this novel so much was because of its unique storyline set in a fantasy world called Middle-Earth. Its storyline is so exclusive compared to all other books because it is almost like a lost part of Earth's history, set in the Middle Ages, and yet includes fantasy items such as immortality and magic.Another reason I took pleasure in reading this story is because it is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. If you have already read the series, this will give you a very good background on how the One Ring of Power was originally discovered and passed down to Frodo.On the downside, I disliked the Old English elements in the story and high vocabulary used by J.R.R. Tolkien. I must have picked up the dictionary fifty times to look up words that I was unaware of their meanings. Also, the author usually goes into great depth using detail to describe the setting and characters.

I immediately loved it. It is much easier to read than The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo was funny, and I liked the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum. Fat ol' Bombur was humorous,too (mostly by the fact that he was so lazy and fat). I felt sorry for poor Bilbo. He was forever wishing to be back at home in his nice hole, the kettle just beginning to sing. The Hobbit definitly showed Bilbo's Tookish side. I would reccomend this amazing prelude to The Lord of the Rings triloqy. The amazing thing about J.R.R. Tolkien is that he didn't just create a few characters, he created a universe! He made cultures and empires, from the men of old to the graceful elves, from the evil orcs and goblins to the peaceful and food-loving hobbits. This is, in my opinion, the best book of the century. This is a must have book. If there is an avid reader in your family who likes fantasy, buy them this book for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The novel starts out with some strange happenings. First a bunch of dwarves come and visit the main character without any notice. Next the main character (Bilbo) starts this adventure to try to kill a dragon. Bilbo is only 3 feet tall and not very strong. They face many adventures and during one of these Bilbo finds a magic ring that can turn you invisible. The problem is that the ring has an awful magic power. It will consume and take over the person who wears it. The ring doesn't consume him in this book but it does in the next. Bilbo also faces many creatures like wargs or wolf-like things. He also meets trolls and with the help of Gandalf, a wizard, he defeats the trolls. Then Gandalf leaves their traveling band and they think all hope is lost until elves capture them. The elves put all the dwarves in prison but not Bilbo. Eventually Bilbo figure out a plan to get them out. They finally make it to the land of the dragon. The dragon is bigger than Bilbo could ever imagine. Bilbo steals some gold from the dragon and that makes it mad. At the very end the enemies who were fighting each other become friends to fight off the goblin hordes that come and try to take over. As they gain friends throughout the story all of them come together to fight. A funny part is when Bilbo gets home he sees people are auctioning off his house and all of his other stuff. He eventually gets most of it back but is still missing some.

Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End. Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including monsterous trolls, pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring. To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket. Gollum has lost his precious (the ring). Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal. They will play a riddling game. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains. If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears. He becomes invisible. Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children.

Though it lacks the powerful poetry of Lord of the Rings, its prose is that of a charming bedtime story, but with all the cleverness and antiquity of Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. Bilbo is a wonderful character, now a clich&eacute; of the genre, the unwilling, comedic, yet wise and brave hero. And, though Tolkien falls into flat characters based on race, many of his characters, particularly Thorin (a flawed, yet heroic, character), defy classification. Bilbo and Gollum, are in fact, very childlike; two sides of the child: the greedy, selfish child, and the selfless, adventuring, heroic child. One grows up through adventures; one horrifically stagnates. Many of the scenes, particularly the Riddles in the Dark and the final ending, are the quintessential Tolkien: thoroughly engaging, deceptively simple, and totally, utterly brilliant. A fairy tale, hero tale that is a classic for a reason, even if it is just a book to curl up with with a cup of tea and a quilt.

Not happy with how maps look on kindle and how some of the poetry lines formatted, but all in all decent kindle version."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of my favorite books of all time. Perhaps it is because I read it as a child, and it first introduced me to dwarves and elves in a way far different from their Disney counterparts. Perhaps it was the humanity of characters laid out for me to see. I am not sure exactly what it was, but after rereading it for the upteenth time, it still has not lost a smidgen of its charm.Sure, Lord of the Rings is the serious book, the more adultish, more classic quest fantasy to save the world from mortal peril sort of thing. The Hobbit is more of a quest to save Bilbo from living his life without a single thing happening that was unexpected. I think this central difference, combined with a younger target audience for this book, makes this book have a much more carefree attitude, and a generally much more merry tale.The pace of the Hobbit is pretty rapid, since really the journey of this story would have been of a similar length as Lord of the Rings, with a lot of detail simply missing from this book. The first leg of the journey was almost identical to Frodo's in route at least, yet it is over in a couple of chapters. Really, the lesser significance of this quest required a lot less development early on.What you really do see happen in the Hobbit, which is nearly absent in Lord of the Rings, is how a bit of a fussy homebody is changed into a daring and wise companion by means of the journey. Bilbo proved to be the lucky 'fourteenth' man on the quests of the dwarf Thorin to reclaim his homeland and treasure, and that was lucky for not only the dwarves, but for Bilbo himself. Even Gandalf discovered that there was more to Bilbo than meets the eye, as the hobbit proved himself useful in a lot of very different situations.It is a wonder to see a character develop like Bilbo during the course of a single novel. It is an exceedingly rare sight these days, to see something like this happen, and it is refreshing to see it again here.The songs in this book aren't the poet things from Lord of the Rings, but more like drinking songs with simple rhymes. This [songs] is not a favorite now a days, but I kinda like them. Trying to figure out a tune to go with each one is difficult at times, but it makes it that much better. You can always just skip them, like I did when I was a kid.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is phenomenal. There is lots of action and adventure.

I picked up the book years after seeing the LOTR Trilogy motion picture and I thought to myself how did I not pick the book years before and felt I've wasted my time reading other fantasy books when we have the granddaddy of all fantasy literature just waiting to be read?The great thing about this book is, it is surprisingly readable (since the story was originally for JRRT's children)and not bothering to rack up your brain trying to decipher excessive archaic writings. This is one of the best literary treasures to own along the lines of Tolkien's sagas!The only drawback is also the very thing that made this book great; you will not stop reading it and feel the need to read and know more of the canonical characters, places and events. But worry no more, Tolkien's preceding/succeeding stories are in no way short of stock.All in all, I am awestruck and amazed how a children's book could still enchant a grown up like me. And you get to spoil the upcoming movie to irritate friends who are non-readers!! How cool is that?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fantastic novel. The pages practically turn themselves in this tale of Bilbo and the Ring. Bilbo's journey is epic. Our humble hobbit faces up to great dangers, is morally and physically challenged. In the end Bilbo is transformed by the journey: he becomes more courageous, more generous, and more a complete living being. I read this as a twelve year old and absolutely relished every page: it's readability is outstanding. The far more imaginative Lord of the Rings trilogy is often badly written and overdrawn. The later work has obviously lit the fires of fifty million dreams, but this first book is the more taut. While many readers will dislike the trilogy and recoil from its complexities, nearly everyone can enjoy this wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent recording by an animated narrator.

(Alert: Possible Spoilers!) There is the hobbit hole where a certain Bilbo Baggins lives. Then, Bilbo receives a visitor, Gandolf, a wizard. And, the visitor brings other, visitors (dwarfs). And Bilbo is enticed into setting forth on a journey, which becomes very adventurous and dangerous. Bilbo acquires a ring, which belonged to Golum. And, finally, there is Smaug's treasure. Every thing, seemingly, turns out good for Bilbo. It, eventually, will turn out that the ring that Bilbo acquired is a very special ring. But, that is another tale.This adventure is fantasy at its best. Though, once upon a time it might have been called a fairy tale. There is adventure and magic throughout. And, this is where the author, Tolkien, begins to build his reputation as the finest fantasy writer of the twentieth century. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After reading the Silmarllion first, I read this book. Wow! What a contrast. If men are stupid, the hobbit is small AND wise. How refreshing. It has been a long time since I have read a book so entertaining. Reading The Hobbit is a most cherished experience. All illustrations were created by JRR Tolkien. There are four (4) colored illustrations and the rest are black and white. The black and white prints are of very poor quality. What a shame. The binding is solid, the black hard cover is well made, the paper is standard quality with intermittent annoying ink blotches, and the paper book jacket is well done. Of interest is the paper book jacket. It is reproduced exactly as JRR Tolkien wanted it since he was the artist. Which leads me to think, the 70th anniversary version was an attempt to recreate what JRR Tolkien wanted when originally published but budget wouldn't allow. Also annoying is that at the end, the book publishes the first chapter of the LOR? What? Everyone knows of the LOR! Even with the short comings of the publisher, JRR Tolkien's genius shines thru in this little Masterpiece. I recommend this gem (or Arkenstone of Thrain) to anyone who has not read this book. I envy your first read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A wonderful book filled with lots of excitement.This is only a small preview of what's in store in the following books.It will keep you reading!Strongly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful book. It is entertaining for all ages. I first read this book when I was eight and I still love it. My parents love this book too. It is very creative. For those who have started reading the book: Keep reading. The beginning is a little slow, but once they leave Bilbo's house it is wonderful. One of my favorite things about this book is that the villians are not SOOOOO SCARY. They are funny. If you liked Harry Potter you would love this book. This is one book I consider equal to Harry Potter even though it is a bit slow moving."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My personal feeling is that not many books in literature today even come close to the adventure contained in the Hobbit. 'The Hobbit' has everything from the magic of wizards to the bravery of knights to the simplicity of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit. The culmination of this book at the battle of five armies as a backdrop for the slaying of a giant dragon named smog is untouched by any book I have ever read since. This story sets the table for J.R.R.Tolkien's opus trilogy 'The Lord of the Rings' which is a masterpeice in itself. When I first read the hobbit many years ago it captured me for days and still a part of my heart today resides in 'Middle Earth'. I think you will feel the same way when you read this great story. It's truly magical. A really great one indeed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit (in my opinion) is the best book that was ever written! It is an extrodinary adventure for people of all ages. All of the characters are very well developed. The Hobbit is adventurous, humorous, and touching story about our dear Mr. Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) who leaves his beautiful hobbit hole one fine morning to find adventure. Acompanying Thorin, King Under the Mountain, his 12 dwarves, and Gandolf the Gray as the &quot;expert treasure-hunter&quot;, Bilbo undergoes many new experiences and meets a lot of people (not all of them friendly). The Hobbit made me a fantasy fan. It opened a Whole new world to me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was but a child, having seen no more than eight years my mother read to my siblings and I this most beloved of tales. Amazing in both its simplicity and its scope Tolkien's Hobbit is a delight to readers of any age, and should-as others have proposed-be read over and again, at different stages of one's life. It is in this humble reviewer's opinion that it remains a jewel in the crown of fantasy literature, timeless in its appeal and its applicability.I am now in my twenties, and have only recently re-read \\"The Hobbit\\", and while I am more critical of the book now than I was when I was eight, I cannot in any way belittle or take away from its effect. While I read it, I fought against the constant exclaiming of the characters, more often than not a sentence ends in \\"!\\". However, once I understood the simple, cheery, and kindhearted nature from which our vantage point sprang, I embraced it.\\"The Hobbit\\" or \\"There and Back Again: a Hobbits Holiday\\" draws the reader into the first adventure of the honorable Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit. We are privy to his journey, along with a band of Dwarves as they venture off across the Wilderlands in search of treasure and nothing more than vengeance against the venerable and most feared Smaug the Dragon. No doubt, the story is familiar to you, but if not, I will not be the one to ruin any of the suspense or wonder you will behold.This wonderful story is necessary for every respectable reader, and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone of any age without remorse. And I'll always take one thing away from it with me, best summed up in these words: \\"If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\" Indeed, I believe old Tolkien hit the proverbial nail on the head."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great for people of all ages. I was read it as a bed-time story and am still reading it 10 years later.

A truly great book I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great! It, and &quot;The Lord Of The Rings,&quot; are so fantastic! There is no other book about Middle Earth better then these four. READ IT! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the work that made Tolkien famous, and rightly so. Written in a light tone, it is nonetheless not a book solely for children; as Tolkien himself has said, adults are in greater need of fantasy than children, and 'The Hobbit' shows us just how true that is.The focus of the story is, of course, on Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit indicated by the book's title. Initially, he is a solid member of his society -- well respected for doing nothing rash or unexpected. After being essentially co-opted into an Adventure by Gandalf the Wizard, he is forced, little by little, to grow from someone who bewailed having left his pocket handkerchief behind to one who is able to face down Smaug the Dragon (admittedly while invisible) and give up the Arkenstone to prevent a war between Dwarves, Elves, and Men. These are serious matters, even if told in a faintly whimsical manner.Finally, however much one might want to analize what makes 'The Hobbit' a great book, what comes out most clearly is what an outstanding story it is: one that can be enjoyed by almost everyone, whatever their age or temperment, and read over and over again without losing its flavor."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My parents had tried to get me to read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series since I was 11 or 12 years old. I read The Hobbit last week and now I am 19. I can't believe that I didn't read it sooner! It was such a great story, so interesting, so descriptive, and with all the action and adventures, there was never a dull moment! I just want to know why Mr Bilbo Baggins and the rest of the Hobbit tales (which I am presently reading) are not part of school reading lists. Tolkien is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As far as fantasy books go, this is the best one yet (that I have read). The Hobbit, one of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece works, is clearly one of the most amazing pieces of literature ever dreamed up. It is extremely well thought out and written. Now any time my parents go tell me to read I think I will go pick u The Hobbit and read over and over again. After I finished The Hobbit I rushed out to chapters and bought the next novel in the series, The Fellowship of the Rings. After only reading the first couple of chapters I can see that this will truly be another great adventure to read. The Hobbit is the ultimate fantasy book of all time. It starts out by a very mysterious and powerful wizard by the name of Gandalf passing by Bilbo's (The Hobbit) house. Somehow the wizard despite Bilbo's eagerness to get rid of him gets invited back for tea the next day. However before the wizard shows up, a band of dwarves arrive at Bilbo's door. Then when Gandalf arrives Bilbo is informed of what all these dwarves are present for. He has been selected by Gandalf to assist these dwarves in retrieving a stolen treasure, dwarves gold. He becomes the burglar of the band of dwarves. He is the one that must figure out how to steal back the stolen treasure from an evil and incredibly dangerous dragon Smaug. At first the dwarves have no confidence in Bilbo; they do not believe that he will be able to do what Gandalf says he will. Gandalf you see have a great deal of confidence in Bilbo, this will prove to be a very wise decision. It will be a very perilous journey or the dwarves and Bilbo. Along the way many hard-ships will occur, this will prove to be training for Bilbo; it also convinces the dwarves that Bilbo will indeed be able to retrieve the treasure for them. As for the rest of the book you will have to read it to find out what happens in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is always a refreshing read for me, as Tolkien uses a simpler style of writing than he uses in the Silmarillion or in the Lord of the Rings. But even though the prose may be simpler, the underlying tale scratches the surface of Middle Earth, evoking many deep themes that are later unveiled in the later books.I like the Hobbit for its simplicity and its depth, and the beautiful illustrations by Alan Lee complement this edition handsomely."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought Tolkein is a wonderful author, who in The Hobbit describes things so well that it is like you are on the adventure yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book THE HOBBIT is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.

A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins reluctantly embarks on a perilous quest to help dwarves recover their long lost treasure. They encounter trolls, goblins, elves, and others along their way to Lonely Mountain where the dwarves had their treasure stolen from them years ago by Smaug the Dragon.One strength that The Hobbit has is that there are many thrilling adventure points throughout the book. You are also able to get to know the key characters and feel the dilemmas that they go through. One weakness that I felt was that it takes a lot of time and pages to get to each of the thrilling spots of the book. Also, at some points it can feel like the plot is slow moving. But, it is an easy read in terms of use of language and plot and I recommend it to the youngest teenagers and adults alike. I truly enjoyed the casual writing style that J.R.R.

I have read many books since middle school and I think that fact helped me to appreciate what a great story teller Tolkien truly is compared to the rest of us mere mortals.

My 13 year old daughter read it and really like it and she doesn't like these kinds of stories.Do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Lord of the Rings is an amazing achievement that has set the standard for all other heroic fantasy efforts. Many people who have read Lord of the Rings expect The Hobbit, (because it deals with events that set up the plot and action of Lord of the Rings), to be written in the same style and to the same standards as Lord of the Rings. If so, those readers will be disappointed.The Hobbit is written for a younger audience. Simpler language, shallower characters, broader humor, less rigor. It is just fine as a tale for younger readers and listeners, and just fine as an introduction to Middle Earth for youngsters, but if you start your Tolkien reading with this work, you should understand how different it is from Lord of the Rings.Interestingly, if you have heard the audiobook version this point is driven home by the entirely different performance given by Dale from the one in which he reads Lord of the Rings. Dale's Lord of the Rings is gripping and dramatic. His reading of The Hobbit is light-hearted, almost casual in places, as though he felt the material only warranted a very broad interpretation.So, enjoy this pleasing and light-hearted tale, but then be ready to be captured by Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.Reading the first 10 words of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 The Hobbit in the 8th grade, a sense of wonder overcame me. What is a hobbit? Why does it live in a hole? I had so many questions, and I was hooked. I wanted answers! I knew immediately that Mr. Tolkien's hobbit hole would take me somewhere I had never been before, somewhere that would lead not to Alice's Wonderland but into the complete unknown.That's the appeal of much fantasy fiction like The Hobbit. That's the secret. It is the unknown that stimulates the imagination and keeps readers turning pages. Quite a feat, too, considering how even children's fantasy isn't known for brevity. J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is over 750 pages. Nevertheless readers of all ages press on with wide yet perhaps tired eyes for answers to the mysterious and often tantalizing questions presented by fantasy authors.What is a hobbit? Why does it live in a hole?Only by continuing to read will answers be discovered. And by reading, audiences are transformed into the explorers of faraway, strange places. They become Neil Armstrong, Sacajawea, Magellan, and Captain James Cook. New worlds await!In my youth, no work inspired me more than The Hobbit. While not the first fantasy book I had ever read, it was the one that inspired me to continue reading (and writing) fantasy into my 40's. I owe part of who I am to Bilbo Baggins and his illustrious creator."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the only unabridged version of The Hobbit. The reader is pretty good but SLOW!!!

It is a great story and one I like to read or listen to from time to time. As one who enjoys the pleasures of being home, I can relate to Bilbo as he ventures forth on this great quest. While many of us are comfortable with things we know and are familiar with, I think Bilbo's story is good for all of us to read and enjoy.

The is a wonderful adventure read ,with man-eating spiders ,the goblin fight and of course the dragons lair, and yet having to go through that Gandolf and the 9 dwarves were strong to handle it all. Tolkien , through his writing gets you to like the characters more and allows you to expereince whatthey do as he pulls you in to the story wanting more at every page! I do recommend this book it you havent already had the visit with them, go out and do so. It was well worth it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I received this beautiful 1966 leather-bound edition of The Hobbit as a result of winning a contest on author G.T. Denny's blog. I wanted to publicly thank him for such a wonderful prize which, of course inspired me to re-read the novel.The Hobbit is a tale that I will always hold near and dear to my heart. My father first read it to me when I was around five years old and I have had a love of fantasy in my heart from that point forward. The time that we spent together journeying with Bilbo and Company in their quest to the Lonely Mountain is one of my treasured childhood memories and I cannot talk or think about Tolkien without bringing up fond images of my Dad.Luckily, the story also holds to the test of time. It is a fast-paced, sometimes humorous, adventure story with an almost continual stream of action. The poor party seems to go from one peril to the next to the next in such rapid succession that it is truly one of those books that is almost impossible to put down for any significant span of time. The characters, especially dear old Bilbo, are lovingly crafted and presented to the reader in such a way that they become stamped into the memory for all time.Truly one of the greatest stories of all time and forever one of my favorite books. If you haven't read The Hobbit, I cannot recommend it more highly to readers of all ages, levels, and interests. (And IF you haven't read it yet, I envy your fledgling journey into the magic lands of Middle-Earth!)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is LOTR light; Well written, but not nearly to the fullest extent of the literary powers Tolkein reached later with LOTR.

Great story!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What an excellent book!Great plot and awesome characters!I should have read this years ago instead of waiting until 31 yrs old! OH well, never too late hmmm =)If you are looking for an easy but fun read, give this book a try!I am onto the series The Lord of the Rings now!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in high school and the Lord of the Rings movies began to hit theaters, I had no idea what Middle Earth was or what was so important about a ring that Peter Jackson thought deserved three movies. I did have a few friends that had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and said that I needed to read them before the movies came out. I'm not sure if it was my age or the fact that the books had been sitting in my parent's basement for years and were yellowed, but I had trouble getting into them.As soon as rumors started going around that Peter Jackson was going to be doing The Hobbit as a movie, I decided that I wanted to try and read it before it hit theaters. A couple weeks back, I downloaded it on the Kindle and started this unexpected journey, only remembering bits and pieces of it from the cartoon that I watched as a kid.Needless to say, I loved this book and recommend that you read it as well. The style that Tolkien chooses to write his books in is amazing, because you can almost imagine sitting in a room with him, while he smokes his pipe and rocks in chair, telling you this epic tale of bravery, dragons, dwarves, goblins, wizards, and rings.It was also very cool to see how Bilbo actually got the ring and how it was used to complete his journey. Once again, I would recommend reading this book and it might lead you to some other Tolkien books, like it has for myself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I grew up with this book. I swear I've read the book 20 times. I bought it the other day. And I loved it. Tolkien at his best. Its just a must read before you die.!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Good book easy to follow and it kept me wanting to read it, enjoy I know I did!!!!!!!!! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Really good! I loved the Lord of the rings and thought the hobbit would be a good read, and I was not disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!! J.R.R. Tolkien has a magnificent way of writing books for all ages to read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a particularly nice copy of The Hobbit, bound in green leather or something like it. Personally, I've never been quite sure why a single book would be in a box, but I suppose it does protect the lovely gold embossed cover with Tolkein's runes all over it. The full page color reproductions of Tolkien's watercolor illustrations also really added to the quality of this edition of the book. Some of them are very pretty, and were not present in my smaller copy of The Hobbit. This is definietly the collector's edition, not the small portable copy to read in waiting rooms.It had been a while since I had read The Hobbit, so it was nice to refresh my memory of the story before seeing the movie. It has a little introduction in the beginning, which may have originally come from the Lord of the Rings, explaining dwarves and that orc and goblin are interchangable terms. I would say this edition is well worth the cost for an enthusiast willing to wait for it to come out of backorder. If you haven't read The Hobbit before, you should, whether you buy this or another copy, but be warned: there is a lot of singing and other poetry. Even the orcs sing at least once, which is odd, even if it is about torture and cannibalism and other orcish topics."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was a great book, and I've always enjoyed adventurous ones,but this one seemed to really catch the idea of true adventure. I also enjoyed the constant action and suspense throughout the book, it kept me very interested."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a small child my parents got me the Golden Books version of The Hobbit.

I hope that you enjoy this wonderful work by Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am, I will admit. I've read this book at least four times and it never gets old. My first experience was when I was 18 and I am now 59, I've never had a problem understanding or following the story. I think mid teen and older would enjoy this story. It is a great break from my normal reading of historical mysteries and Christian romance."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well written tale of magic, mystery, excitement and adventure! A must read for fantasy lovers! My first e-book and worth the purchase!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent narration, epic story and it has all the elements that a reader who loves middle earth fantasies would expect! I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This really is a coffee table treasure. For reading convenience get a lightweight paperback, but for incredible, lush, artwork meshed perfectly with the text look no further."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm fairly picky when it comes to books. I love action, twists, turns and plenty of suspense. Unfortunately, I was only given half of my portion of expectations. First, I must admit that I really enjoyed reading this book, and it had a few unexpected twists. It was a remarkable story that frequently changed my opinions about the characters. But a fair warning to those of you who are determining whether or not to read this book; the beginning is extremely slow, due to its descriptive nature. Personally, I like having full description in suspenseful areas of text, rather than full description consistently. The rest of the book is occasionally slow, yet when compared to the beginning, the rest of the book is full of nothing but excitement. It seems that Tolkien rambles off on something unimportant once in awhile, which was most likely his only downfall. Although the beginning was slow, and he tends to get off subject once in awhile (which is not always a bad thing), this book is extremely creative. Who would have ever thought of such things as hobbits that live in hills that eat 6 meals a day? His descriptive settings really helped me feel as if I were in Mirkwood, or gazing upon the dreary Lonely Mountain. The story overall was incredible, and I especially love the poetry and songs. \\"Alive without breathe, As cold as death; Never thirsty, ever drinking, All in mail never clinking\\". Gollum was the most interesting of characters in my own opinion. Living most of his days alone in darkness with nothing to talk to but himself and his \\"precious\\". On the other hand, Smaug's personality did cause me to laugh several times. Tolkien brought each character to life, and really portrayed the contrast in each of their personalities. His ideas were imaginative, funny and sometimes suspenseful. His style of writing makes the book more humorous and interesting to read, plus his fantastic description of objects left a perfect picture. Although this perfect picture remains, the overall reading was for me, fairly easy. It is often thought of as a child's tale (although it is definitely not written as one), but it seemed to be so much more than that. It is definitely a book worth reading, and has plenty of description. So don't get upset when the beginning starts off a bit slow, for trolls, goblins, wargs, elves, spiders and a large dragon are awaiting you!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although a fan of LoTR, it was only movies I had ever seen. Needing this book for my school I wasn't alltogether sure about how it was I'd be willing to read it. But, even after completing my assingment, I continue reading this book. It is very excelent and explains a great many things. It also encourages me to buy the books of LoTR.This purchase was worth it by far."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What a book! Anyone who is a fan of Tolkien or fantasy novel should never miss this. It is humorous, clever, interesting, creative and inspiring. Never regret buying this!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Between 2001 and 2003 I became a fan of Peter Jackson's movie version of \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Since it was shot in New Zealand I got to see a lot of the country's scenery as well as enjoying a masterpiece of film. When reading a copy of Tolkien's original work sometime later I read \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" all the way through but something about Tolkien's writing style caused me to lose interest after I started \\"The Two Towers\\". The fact I'd seen the movies was likely the reason, since I knew how the story went. After reading \\"The Hobbit\\" I might have to read \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in its entirety to see the differences between Tolkien's work and the Peter Jackson films (I'm sure both Tolkien's and Jackson's work are masterpieces of literature/film).While reading \\"The Hobbit\\" I could see/hear in my mind the faces/voices of Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm and Andy Serkis (who played Gandalf, Elrond, Bilbo, and Gollum, respectively, in the films). I heard these actors had agreed to reprice their roles from Lord of the Rings one more time for \\"The Hobbit\\" (not sure about Ian Holm). It's too bad about the rights to a \\"Hobbit\\" movie remaining in legal limbo, but Tolkien's work is a literary masterpiece and I'm so happy I finally read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you love adventure or just a fantastic story I highly recomend that you read this book. I have read it three times in about five years and will porbably read it a bunch more. It is captivating and a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great way to dive into the world of Tolkien. Easy to read. Great for those who want an easy intro into the series."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" back in the late 70's... and I haven't been the same. To say that this book fired my imagination would be an understatement. As a result, I have reread it dutifully every five or six years since.I am truly in awe of this commemorative edition celebrating the 70th anniversary of one of the most entertaining books of the twentieth century, and there's not much more they could have done to make this book appealing to a Tolkien fan. The sumptous artwork on the dust-jacket, the maps of Middle Earth, even the detailed illustrations reach out to the reader and expand upon Tolkien's carefully constructed world in the most appreciated way. Seriously, this is one of those times you really want to click on \\"See inside the book\\" and see what all the fuss is about.Oh, and as an addendum for those interested in medieval romance, Tolkien's translation of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" the 14th century's gem of the alliterative revivalist movement, is equally compelling. I don't think it's currently in print but it's definitely worth tracking down if you want to see how literature influenced Tolkien's creative spirit. He was a professor of medieval studies, after all, and knowing his influences only serves to deepen our love of his fiction."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great read, should have your children read it before they see the movies as a kid, one's imagination takes off when reading Bilbo's adventures, quests and all the fantastic worlds he visits."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This unabridged rendition of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit provided many hours of entertainment for my wife and I on long drives. Rob Inglis performs admirably using different voices for the characters and as narrator.I'm sorry to have to rate this brilliant work only 4 stars but years ago I heard another version of The Hobbit read by another that was even better. Unfortunately I cannot remember the actor's name and I have searched the interwebs in vain.There are other versions done by an ensemble of actors but the one I am referring to was done by a single actor and his performance was outstanding. If anyone believes they know of the version I'm talking about, please comment. I would LOVE to hear that version again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not the best book I have ever read, however it is impossible to put down once opened. I found myself spending every free moment with this book and became completeley absorbed in it's characters. The only strike against &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is that it is way too short. I intend to read much more J. R. R. Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Any one over the age of 16 who has not read or had this book read to them should be shot. I read this book when I was 11 and still have not found a fantasy story to beat it. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, ( the other three books that go with this one) are just as good. Don't pick up another book untill you've checked this book out. Watch the movie of it too. It needs alot to compare with the book, but the animated hobbits are pretty cute."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a superbly written book. It tells the tale of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is taken away from his cozy hobbit-hole by a band of dwarves led by Thorin Oakinshield and Bilbo's friend the wizard Gandalf on an adventure to reclaim the dwarves' hord of treasure. The treasure had been stolen from the dwarves by the dragon Smaug. He guards the treasure ever so carefully in the dwarves' once glorious kingdom. Bilbo is appointed as the &quot;burglar&quot;. As the company travels towards the Lonely Mountain, they face the constant threat of orcs, trolls, giant spiders, and ultimately, the dragon they seek to slay, to name a few.I first got this book when I was nine years old for my birthday.Ever since I've read it, I have been enchanted.

Well, a hobbit is a dwarf like creature that lives in a hole (that's home for him). Our hero's name is Bilbo Baggins. He sets off for an adventure with many companions. First is a wizard named Gandalf and 12 other dwarfs like himself. Their travels take them everywhere, such as to the Eleven Kingdom and the Pull of Goblins and many, many more. Luckily our hero saves everyone from the evil dragon Smaug. There is more but I don't want to spoil you all. I think people who love to read advertures should pick this book up."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is one of the most amazing books I've ever read. It is told from the point of a rather immature hobbit known as Bilbo Baggins, and we see all his adventures from his childish point of view. Yet, there is always an underlying sense of dread, yet it never overwhelms the sense of wonder and enlightenment. The LOTR trilogy continues on the journey, and we suddenly realize how dark and dangerous Bilbo's journey actually was... words can't describe it, it's simply amazing.."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm glad to see that nearly every reviewer has given this story glowing praise. However, I feel truly sorry for the unfortunate children who were forced to read this book against their will; not because they were made to read garbage, but because their closed minds and lack of literary drive kept them from appreciating this work of art. I can only wonder if any book they have been assigned will ever bring them joy. Best not to ever make them read the works of Dickens, or Shakespeare, or Hemmingway. As one child pointed out, &quot;it had paragraphs with 20 or 30 sentences...&quot; Oh dear, I guess Oxford University was wrong to let Professor Tolkien be the dean of their English department for 50 years. It is a shame that children cannot appreciate such great literature! This book moved me as no other has before. It is a treasure, a joy, a work of art. It is in the same league as Beethoven's 9th symphony (I can only assume this too would be despised by our MTV non-reading &quot;yutes&quot;), the Sistine Chapel, a '29 LaTour, and a Shelby Cobra GT. It is, simply put, the best. I can only assume that the people who have made negative comments about this book are totally lacking imagination, passion, decency, and taste. Buy this book.

Or maybe they just sounded like it. I know everyone is intitled to an opinion, but I just can't help feeling overwhelming dislike for these such people. They seem to be just as childish as they claim the book is. THE BLOODY POINT OF THE BOOK IS TO GET THE GOLD FROM THE DRAGON! I MEAN, HOW DUMB DO YA HAFTA BE?! But I guess there are just some people who'll get it, and some who won't. For those that can't, why don't you go and find a nice Atlas or something that won't stretch your beleagured brain too much.

One reason I liked it was because of the detail. Tolkien wrote with such precise detail and acuity that I thought that I was acually there in the middle of all the action following Bilbo the hobbit every step of the way. What each character looked like, acted like, smelled like, what they were wearing, even what weapons or tools they were carring were all described in the most precise detail. Also, Tolkien describes the settings down to the cracks in the road so anyone can just picture these places right in his or her mind. I believe that this particular piece of literature is directed toward anyone who loves to hear stories about wizards and magic and dwarves and trolls and hobbits and goblins and elves and all other manner of Middle Aged mythology. The only drawback to the entire book is the fact that it requires the reader to be at a fairly high reading level do to some of the relatively long words and odd concepts.

The travelers faced a few more problems like goblins, until they were separated in a cave. Bilbo went downwards where he found this strange ring and met a strange monster. Bilbo discovered his ring made him invisible, and decided to make a deal with the creature. The creature was hungry, so Bilbo said that if he lost at a competition, the creature could eat him. If Bilbo won though, the creature would show him the way out. They decided to tell riddles, and by slightly cheating, Bilbo won and escaped. After Bilbo was reunited with his team, they voyages on, fighting more goblins and giant spiders until the final showdown with Smog the dragon. Everyone was too scared to face him except Bilbo. The dragon was so large he couldn't beat it alone, but he didn't have too. The dragon flew out of the cave and attacked a small town nearby. One townsman shot the dragon and killed it, ending the tragedy and the adventure. The real reason on how the dragon was killed was because of Bilbo.

Somewhat naive and innocent compared to the immense dark forces displayed in the rest of the trilogy, but if you plan on reading the other books, you absolutely must read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I originally read The Hobbit in 7th Grade. It was the first full length book I ever read. Up until that point I had no real desire to read. I lost my virginity to The Hobbit and went from reading my first book in 2 days to reading a book a week for the rest of my life.The Hobbit is a great first book for anyone new to Fantasy. Although it is not sophisticated enough for some readers; it sets the stage for the true masterpiece of fantasy: The Lord of the Rings. You cannot read TLOTR without first reading The Hobbit. I would categorize The Hobbit almost as a children's book. Whereas The Lord of the Rings is definately for adults.Please take the time to read The Hobbit and then read TLOTR. You are in for a wonderful treat. Then do your kid's a favor, read The Hobbit to them at an early age. You will see their eyes light up with wonder and fascination.

I particularly recommend it to younger readers, as it is not very hard to read and is easy to follow. It is a very wonderful gift to young &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans, because it has the same wonder that captures the imagination. However, seasoned SF/fantasy readers (such as I) will probably see it as merely a stepping-stone for LoTR. While I enjoy this book very much, I feel it is not on the same level as the books that followed.

TolkeinA ReviewWell, after reading the whole Lord of the Rings series in the summer of 2001 for the first time, I soon afterwards purchased the Hobbit and read it. Let me start by saying the anything by Tolkein is OVERRATED! Sure, he practically kickstarted the fantasy genre into creation (although not all of his concepts are original; most are based on historical mythology), and therefore is responsible for an unimaginable amount of literature and content in the world today. Without Tolkein's the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings, there would be no Dungeons and Dragons, and therefore no true joy in my life, hehe.Anyway, the LOTR series was, admittedly (in which I admit in a somewhat resigned, even grudging, fashion) an excellent work. Tolkien has been heralded by many as quite possibly the best author of all time, but I beg to differ!Okay, just because the Hobbit gave birth to fantasy means NOTHING to me!!! Listen to the following, and you will discover why I did give this book a five out of five rating but why I do not feel it does not entirely deserve such a high rating. Without a doubt it is a classic, respected and adored by many worldwide. Is that reason enough to call it one of the best books of the century? Well, I most certainly do not think so! Why not? Look at it this way: if one could rate one of the very first computers, those Apple/Macs that were so big and expensive that they took up a whole room, would one give such a computer a 5/5 just because, at the time, it was the best in the industry? OF COURSE NOT. One does not term such a computer a &quot;classic&quot; because if it weren't for that exact computer many technological advances in computer technology would have not even existed today? A bit confusing, perhaps, but the TRUTH. The fact is, that the Hobbit really isn't altogether anything remarkable, at least in comparison to the other fantasy books out today.It's still good, though, I'll admit. Why do I feel this way, though, compared to all the other reviews? Most likely because I'm a heavy fantasy reader, and am used to reading much more complex, intricate, and contemporary fantasy than Tolkein. Furthermore, the fiction I read is so much more fast-paced and with hundreds of gallons of adrenaline that the Hobbit seems like something of a ROAD-BLOCK in my mind.Nonetheless, I cannot deny that I DID enjoy the book and Tolkein is an exceptional writer, his imagination so great that he created an entire genre never before considered. I also recognize this book as one of the best books of the 20th century. How could it not be, after all, considering that it created a whole new genre?! I guess these comments and remarks are a bit contrary to my earlier rants in the review, but really I like Tolkien's books. My only problem with them is that I feel they are OVERRATED. Not too overrated, but overrated nonetheless.So, to sum up my review and to give the read of this review an undeniable verdict, I advise them, regardless of their circumstances, to somehow get ahold of this book and read it. It is written in a very archaic fashion, which is another something I have difficulty enjoying, but it is, without a doubt, the most original, imaginative book ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought this to be a truly adventurous book. I have rated this book with 4 stars because at the beginning it was hard to get hooked into the book, but once you were hooked you couldn't put it down. I think that the climax in this book is towards the middle when Bilbo Baggins confronts the horrible red dragon, with the armor of jewels and scales. A description of Bilbo's personality is kind of challenging. I think that he has a fairly diverse personality. Gandalf on the other hand is full of suprises, but can be very serious if need be. There was something different about each dwarf and I would have to say that Bombur is my favorite. He is the lazy, fat one who loves food and of course Bilbo's friendship. I thought that the lowest part of the story would have to be at the very beginning, well the first 50 pages or so. What I love most about the whole story is the folklore and magic that drips from almost every page, and the adventure and mystery that fills up nearly every paragraph. I don't know why, to tell you the truth, I picked this particular book, except that a friend suggested that I read it and so I did. Well this pretty much concludes my opinion of this Hobbiton fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book is a fun, enjoyable book that i recommend to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For a very long time, I have heard some great things about The Hobbit.

The riddle sequence with Gollum and the Battle of the Five Armies is epic"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this book. The stories of Biblo Baggin's adventures away from his safe Hobbit hole and into the dark underworld were riveting. I would have given it five stars if the plot had a few more interesting twists."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbitt elegantly presents an entertaining fantasy quest story in which the main character, a hobbitt named Bilbo Baggins, is an antihero (or, at least, a reluctant hero). The story describes a beautiful world in which live all manner of fantastic beings - dwarves, elves, hobbits, goblins, trolls, men, and a dragon named Smaug. These various somewhat disimilar beings live in such proximity that, if they only move around a small bit, they will affect each other in significant ways. That is what I like about the story. Mr. Tolkien succinctly describes and compares and contrasts these different beings as the story goes along in a way that, I think, provides a metaphor for relationships among different cultures in the real world in which we live. He shows that some differences are tolerable and, even, desirable and advantageous; that some differences are insurmountable; and, that this is just the nature of the world that must be handled, sometimes carefully.Some may not agree with me when I say that Mr. Tolkien's descriptions are succinct. This leads to what I dislike about the book. I wish for even MORE elaboration. I wish the descriptions had been as full and elegant and as wide in scope as I know Mr. Tolkien could have made them - as in The Silmarillion (in my opinion, the real Tolkien masterpiece). Of course, I know this would have dramatically changed the realized audience and that may not have followed Mr. Tolkien's intentions. This is just a personal wish of mine.This is a wonderful story for readers of all ages (8+ ?); however, I would not rank it as one of the greatest stories of all time as many other Tolkien fans seem to do.The story contains some wonderful lessons for younger (and, I'm sure, some older) readers about self-reliance in the face of adversity and fear; commitment to one's values and relationships, especially when that is difficult; and, realizing that sometimes one must (even reluctantly) do things one would not have normally chosen to do in order to lead a life worth living."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am currently rereading this book for maybe the sixth or seventh time. If you don't like this book you haven't an imagination nor a soul."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is modeled on Beowulf, but yet anti-Beowulf, in that the fierce dragon is stalked not by the toughest guy around who prefers fighting hand-to-hand, but by a rag tag collection of dwarves blundering around the countryside, at times the opposite of intentionality.The lair, the hoard, the smoke--but games of wit and tricks of evasion, culminating in some other guy shooting down the dragon based on inside information mediated by a bird.Another opposite trend of this is the way the characters strengthen and develop, whereas in Beowulf, the hero ages and deteriorates. These dwarves, by contrast, are already old, but become more adventuresome, and more bold.The skeleton of the story, though, is still Beowulf. But much improved by the inversions. Another refreshing twist on the old story is the way both Gandalf and Baggins both hold their accomplishments lightly, Baggins preferring to go home to his pouch of tobacco and his pantry, and Galdalf vanishing somewhere undefined after closing off a conversation with Bilbo on the terminal point of how individuals acting on their own, yet have a part in fulfulling someone else's prophecy.All the while as I was reading through this, for the first time since grade school, I was reminded of what I guess I'll call &quot;Middle Led Zeppelin&quot; and the Song Remains the Same scenes with Robert Plant dramatizing the songs of quest and discovery, many words of which seem lifted from the same old English sounds reflected in Tolkein's work, particularly this text.So if Tolkein is updating Beowulf, were Robert Plant and Jimmy Page revising the Hobbit, or at least struggling to interpret it? Dwarves on a far cliff with dueling stratocasters? Elves down below churning and hopping around in curious pagan synchronicity? I'm thinking sure, why not?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Over the years (lots and lots of them) I have read this book numerous times. It never gets old or stale.

Though actually originally written as a children's story, it almost immediately transcended such a classification, and through the years many adults have read the delightful story of a small, but tough Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.Most folks know the basic premise of the story. If not from reading it, then certainly they know part of it from the prologue to *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* movie, and likely went out to learn the rest of the tale. A wizard, Gandalf the Grey, goes and visits the son of an old Hobbit friend, and after spending time with him, surreptitiously marks Bilbo's door with a sign that is an advertisement of services for a professional burglar.The dwarves that Gandalf was helping look for a burglar promptly knock on poor Bilbo's door, and up he finds himself enlisted in an adventure to slay a dragon and find lost gold. Initially the dwarves belittle Bilbo, and this just makes him all the more determined to prove them wrong about him, which attitude he does, to put it mildly, regret more than once on their quest. Eventually he finds the Ring and the adventures are many, but that is too much of a spoiler for this review. Suffice it to say, it is one grand adventure after another.It is said that the Hobbit was published on the recommendation of the publisher's son, who heartily endorsed the tale. It also was published on the strong recommendation of Tolkien's friends, including C. S. Lewis. Tolkien was a man of a very exacting nature. The debt owed to Tolkien's close circle of family, friends, and a few close academic peers is incalculable. For their insistence that Tolkien merely \\"publish it already\\" ensured the book kept the whimsical tone it may otherwise have lost.*The Hobbit* is often criticized, to be sure, for not having the extremely \\"serious\\" tone and \\"complex\\" plot lines of its sequel, *The Lord of the Rings*. While this criticism is perfectly fair, it also greatly misses the point. Yes, Tolkien included fantasy elements in the story derived from the epic fictional history of Britain that he was writing. But that was all that these were, small derivatives. There was not a concerted effort when he wrote the *children's* story, to include all of these. Indeed, while Tolkien had to go back and rewrite the section \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" to make the story of the Ring and Gollum coincide with the overall story of *The Lord of the Rings*, that is as far that he was able to go. He realized that to make the tone and story of *The Hobbit* match that of it's sequel would effectively make it no longer the fun story that everyone loved.So the question is, what is *The Hobbit*? What kind of story is it? It is lighter, but with a sense of foreboding. It is the story of a fat, happy, contented age coming to a close in a devastating war that will change the face of the earth. It is the origin of a story that is an attempt to explain how a variety of myths can be true.To this, many may object that *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of the story, but this is untrue. *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of *all* stories, and only concerns the events of the later periods of Middle-Earth very faintly, and near the end of that epic narrative. It is the Creation myth, one that connects with the Christian faith of the author surprisingly well.In fact, the light-hearted tone of *The Hobbit* is the pefect bridge for the reader. It is the most \\"modern\\" in perspective, and introduces the reader to the peoples, geography, and events that they will find are connected from the First and Second Ages in *The Silmarillion* and the Third Age in *The Lord of the Rings*.J. R. R. Tolkien didn't like allegory, as he himself attested, but he did try to do \\"applicability\\", which is really just a way of saying that he didn't directly do \\"x = x\\" in the story, but allowed his Christian worldview to mesh with ancient epics in an effort to reconcile the two differing myths, or as he later convinced Lewis, to separate the \\"one, True Myth\\" to which the other myths copy and pay homage.Perhaps the most important link, however, to *The Lord of the Rings*, however, (besides the Ring itself, of course) is the importance of characters and the emphasis on certain truths and values. Among these are loyalty, the Providence of God, and the simultaneous righteousness and brutality of warfare.Before entering the military after the outbreak of World War I, Tolkien and his closest friends, who made up the core of a club that was likely the inspiration for the later Inklings and other clubs Tolkien loved to found at the various colleges at which he taught, had this notion of the glory of war, and how they would find renown for their deeds. This is shown in the perspective of Bilbo and the other heroes at the end of the story. While they were happy to have won the battle against evil, they also felt the horrors of war quite keenly.For the careful and patient reader, this book contains so many nuggets of truth for a \\"children's\\" book. It is most definitely *not* only a simple story. It is WELL worth your time.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading it. I loved all the characters.

If you read it once, then 5-10 years later you want to read it again. I read my first (paperback) edition of The Hobbit when I was 12 years old. As I re-read it over the last four decades, I found that I could appreciate it for many different reasons. As a pre-teen, I liked the author's light and lively story-telling. It was easy to visualize the characters and enter into the story. As a young adult, I appreciated the way the author showed the characters could change/grow by being willing to enlarge their horizons. In mid-life, I appreciated the exploration of moral issues woven into the engaging tale: racial intolerance, obsession, selfishness. Later on, I began to see some of the political allegory: Hobbit culture echoed how the British saw themselves and Bilbo's encounters with Elves, Dwarves, Wizards, and Men represented the best and worst of how the relations of nations were in motion at the time of the book's first publishing. My point is no matter how many times one reads The Hobbit, it's many rich dimensions will bring us back to time and again to read and enjoy it anew.

There was so much detail that allowed me to visualize the entire settings perfectly. I was expecting somewhat of good detail because that's what I've heard about the book, but not this good. It was incredible. Prior to this book I have never read a Lord of the rings book, but now I plan to read the rest of the series. The book gives you the feeling like your actually there more than the movie does.The book lets you know how Bilbo Baggins is feeling, and that is a big asset to the novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading or who is looking for a book to read. It will be especially enjoyable for the people that like adventure books. The setting of this book is takes place in a forest, mountains, and other outdoor places. I can honestly say that this is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. I was actually looking forward to reading it day after day for homework. All the other books I've read did not have any appeal to me.This book has a great tone set by the author. The tone of this novel is very curious. By that I mean that is it constantly makes one wonder what's going to happen next in the story. The tone made me want to read more and more are the story went on. The book got exciting at the perfect times and it became subtle at the appropriate times as well. The characters were perfectly made up, they fit the tone of the book perfectly, and without any one of them the book would not be nearly as good as it is."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Paperback set in an illustrated hard box, includes the original versions of: The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\", was an intense novel considering the novel took place during the third age of middle-Earth, 2941-2942. In \\"The Hobbit\\", there were numerous obstacles the group of dwarves had to overcome including a fight with a spider and a battle with a fire breathing dragon. This helps each person especially Bilbo grow as individuals, as well as make them realize that not everything and everyone are as they seem.I believe this kind of novel was written for young adult audiences who are interested in reading adventurous novels. It is also a great novel for people interested in all kinds mystical creatures. In my opinion, the novel's appeal is full of heroism, action, and discovering inner abilities and emotions. I honestly don't think the book could be considered a classic due to the fact that this book is aimed for more enjoyment and does not consist of the elements you're typically to find in a classic novel. The book could be recommended to those who are interested in science fiction novels and those who are intrigued by treasure hunting adventures.This novel was unusual from the typical novels that I am use to reading, and I was blown away by many of the breath taking events. Throughout the entire novel I was able to witness a young hobbit transform into a strong and proud leader, who takes on responsibility for the welfare of the whole group on the adventure. After Bilbo kills a spider in Chapter 8, the young Hobbit finally has enough confidence in his own abilities as a leader and hero, and thus is the transformation where Bilbo overcomes his internal conflicts. Bilbo has a newfound appreciation for the comforts of his dwelling, but he recognizes that his view of society and his surroundings has undergone profound change."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit is one of the best book of the lord of the rings saga.

Bilbo and the dwarves fight trolls, goblins, wolves and more, and when they finally get to the Mountain they still have to find a way to get rid of the dragon. This book is filled with almost non-stop action and adventure, and if you like either of those you will like The Hobbit. Just make sure you can make yourself stop reading it when you need to!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One.of.the.best.books.EVER. Ok, I don't know when we started writing like that, but Tolkien's writings still remain some of the most vivid ever. This was actually the first &#34;grown up&#34; book I ever read, at the ripe age of 5, and it STILL holds me entranced, in my 40s. I love all of his writings, and I'm so glad to see so many others still appreciate him as much as I do!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As far as fantasy books go, this one was quite disappointing. I put off reading it for years but I finally gave in. I guess I'm glad I did because it is another notch in my bookshelf. However, the characters are not compelling, and the story is not that great.

I downloaded this book on my Kindle for Mac because I hate having hard copies. They get damaged over time, are sometimes too bulky for my wrists to read for an extended period of time, etc. I did hesitate at first because I was not sure if the maps would be included in this digital version, but after downloading a sample, my question was answered. The digital version comes with all the maps and writings. Most importantly, the table of contents is pretty thorough that I could jump between chapters or go back to check the maps. The only problem with the Mac version is that I could not listen to the audio of Tolkien singing and narrating the chapters... That was a huge disappointment. I bought this particular version because of the promise of audio contents from Tolkien himself. Oh well, it was still less than $7. It is still worth the price."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Nothing to say really. This is a great story that has held up over time.

This is the basis for the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings by the same author. I highly recommend you read these exceptional books with well thought out characters and story plot.

I read this book aloud to my children who found it wonderful and amazing and completely different than the movie.It is a spring board into The Lord of the Rings for sure! After reading The Hobbit I instantly bought the trilogy. I must say if you have seen all the movies- they are not accurate and the book(s) are far better in every way."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"You can't go wrong with this book.

It is a more enchanting book than the Lord of the Rings: less defined, less certain, and more magical in every sense. It is also interesting to note just how many references there are to the First Age such as the swords were forged in Gondolin, Glamdring belonged to King Turgon, and threads are started that continue into LotR such as where the ring is found, which is where Isildur was slain.A lovely read again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is an easy to follow book and very fun to read.

Light to read and very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Lots and lots of information about The Hobbit and JRR. I was surprised by the illustrations by Tolkien. I didn't even know he did that. It would have been nice if more of the illustrations had been in color but I think maybe they were originally in b&w. Fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are many strengths to The Hobbit including it's great writing, characters, and overall length. I especially enjoyed the plot of the book. It is expertly paced to with the chaotic moments separated by clever conversations and character development. I was hard pressed to find really any kind of weaknesses in this book, which is part of the reason that it is known as a classic. One of the negatives I found though was that of the 13 dwarves in the party, really only half of them are actually useful and have an important role in the story. I cannot even remember hearing Oin and Bifur's names being used in the story besides the beginning where they are introduced and the end. Another small issue I found with The Hobbit was that how Bilbo was able to expertly fight off many different beasts and creatures with his sword even though he had no past experience with one. However, these are extremely minor flaws to an otherwise amazing tale."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a beautiful edition of this book. Its in great condition especially for the price. Very happy with it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed listening to &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. It felt like I was listening to J.R.R. himself. The only objection I had was that the narrator sang the songs! I would have preferred him to read them as poetry rather than sing them. Unless Tolkien had provided the music to go with the words, I think it's better to let the reader/listener imagine the tune. Other than that, I recommend the book whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was all I was hoping for and one of the best books I ever read I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a fantastic fantasy story.

Though the movie was nothing like the book :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Warning: This review is biased and sappy. Since I first read this book 45 years ago, it has stayed at the very top of &#34;My Favorite Books&#34; list. Every single book I have read since first discovering The Hobbit has been compared to this one. Rather than bore you with all the things I love about this book and it's companions (The Lord of the Rings), I will just note what distinguishes this book for me: the denouement, the &#34;after story.&#34; Every adventure changes us, and Tolkien lets us know exactly how the adventure changes the life and spirit of his characters. Enough said, I have read the book in hardback, and tattered paperback and have listened to it on audiotape, cd and recently MP3 (Rob Ingliss does a fine job bringing Middle Earth alive for me). I ordered this book for Kindle since I was bitten by the eBook bug. I do not know why I resisted switching to eBooks for so long.

It's even better than the new movie that's out!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In an earlier time, and in a different place, there was once a time of magic--a time of wizards and dragons and elves and dwarves. And, in an unnoticed corner of the world there lived a race of hobbits: a small people with furry feet, and too much common sense to go on adventures. But, when a particularly stable hobbit named Bilbo Baggins is visited by the great wizard Gandalf, he soon finds himself in the middle of an adventure with 13 dwarves, facing ogres and orcs and all sorts of dangers. Is the adventuring life too much for one small hobbit in the great big world? Read this book and find out!OK, everybody knows the story of the Hobbit, right? Well, if you haven't read this book recently, then it's time to reread it! My children are now old enough, and every night I am reading a little more to them from the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. They love this tale, and reading it again is a great treat for me! This is a great book, correctly considered a classic of western literature, one that my children and I highly recommend to you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read this several times before. This time I reread it after watching the movie. Too bad that Jackson didn't totally follow the story line!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wanted to read this book again because, after watching Peter Jackson's film of the first part, I was not sure I had seen the same depth when I read it as a young adult many years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the book had the same avuncular, almost childish, style I remembered, the depth of story and myth telling was there in spades and I could see why it was such a mine of a story for the film maker. The Hobbit should never be read as a predecessor to The Lord of the Rings, but it remains an ancillary story which is fun, and tempts the reader to explore the whole Tolkeinverse."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'll not rate the book content, because everyone knows that it's amazing, but I'll rate the edition, which is simply deluxe.

There are no words to express what these books mean to me except that they inspired me to start writing myself.Lucifer's Pocket. The performance of Rob Inglis was very good and convincing. He actually did a very decent job singing the songs rather than just reading them, which added a lot to the feeling of the recording. The packaging has a little to be desired being made of a cheap thin cardboard with cutouts for the CDs to be put in.

Tolkien is truly a \\"precious\\" piece of the fantasy genre. As the book is about a group of dwarves, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard named Gandalf whom embark on a journey through the world of Middle Earth. Along the journey they will meet new and unthought-of characters that will make the story even better. For example, along the journey the group meets dangerous goblins and giant spiders. You will not want to put the book down, as the adventure never stops from the beginning of the journey in the Shire to the end of the journey in the mountains where the dragon Smaug lives. However, the book can get a bit slow at some points when you are just waiting for them to do something. As a reader though, this book will attract the eye of a young reader interested in fantasy or someone who has read the Lord of The Rings trilogy because The Hobbit is a prequel to that series and written by the same author. The book is overall a good and a well-written book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the book \\"The Hobbit.\\"which I purchased from Amazon.

I got this as a present for a friend of mine, who is a huge JRR Tolkein Fan. The entire set is bound in green, and gold lettering. It's beautiful. Really an excellent price for such good quality."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a group of dwarves, a wizard, and an unsuspecting Hobbit who go on an adventure. It takes place in Middle Earth, a fictional land sprawling with all kinds of mythical creatures, lush scenery, and dark secrets. The main character of the story is Bilbo Baggins, an ordinary, unadventurous hobbit who one would never expect to be the hero of a story. He is kind and clever but not very courageous at the start of the story. However, he grows to love adventures and gains courage along the way. The wizard who travels with him is Gandalf, an old but spry man. He is the wise and pushes Bilbo to join them on the adventure. He serves as a kind of guide to Bilbo. They adventure into mountains, hunt for treasure, fight a dragon, and Bilbo finds a mysterious ring and meets a peculiar creature named Gollum. I enjoy reading about Bilbo because he is not your normal hero or adventurer. He spends most of his time at home and doesn't know the first thing about fighting, but he manages to make it along the adventure and uses his wits to get him out of trouble. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of many things. The characters were interesting and likable, especially Bilbo who was a great example of character development. One of my favorite quotes is \\"Please don't cook me, kind sirs!...I'll cook beautifully for you!\\" this is said by Bilbo as three trolls discuss how to cook and eat him. The book has a good resolution even though it is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I give it 5 stars for great characters, story, setting, and the dialogue is witty and enjoyable. The only reason I could see people not liking this book is because it can be slow at parts. With that being said, it makes up for it with incredible detail."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I liked this very much. A good version of the classic book. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to my friends."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien really captures the imagination that a young child has. The Hobbit shows you a whole new side of the world. Whether you're sitting on your couch or flying in the claws of an eagle, you can't help but love the adventure that Bilbo Baggins is experiancing. You begin to have a real fear of the goblins, and to admire Gandolf for his wisdom. The Hobbit truly brings out the inner child in any adult."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A father with his middle school son asked me recently what I thought of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie. I gave my two thumbs up and asked if they have ever read Tolkein. They hadn't. Our local church library had copies of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. I encouraged them to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; aloud before entering &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I have read most of Tolkein's fiction aloud to my sons, including &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Simarillion&quot;, and several other works as well. Tolkein reads well. Several years ago, we unplugged our TV and started regularly reading to our kids. This has been one of the best parenting decisions we've ever made! Turn off the TV this week and read aloud to your kids. If you've taken them to see &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (I would advise children over the age of 10), then read Tolkein to them. Your children's imagination sparked by Tolkein's genius descriptive writing will create an even more detailed and wonderful Middle Earth than the blockbuster movie was able to create. Encourage their imagination to fill the big screen of their minds with Tolkein's epic tale, beginning with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.For two books with many more creative ideas for parents, look into &quot;The Family Cloister&quot; and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot;, both by David Robinson and available on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilboand the 13 DwarvesBilboBaggins begins the story as a respectable and somewhat carefree hobbit, butasthe story progresses J.R.R. Tolkien shows us the true Bilbo. Bilbo is visited by thewondrous wizardGandalf and thrown into a series of adventures with thirteen Dwarves,who areon their way to reclaim their homeland from a furious dragon. Bilbo is taken on astheir burglar. Gandalf is about the only one who believesin him, until Bilbo is constantlyput in the position of saving the othermembers of his group. Bilbo gains hisconfidence andsome respect when he finds the one item that will help himtremendously throughout therest of the book, the ring. From Golbin bashing to Dragon slaying, thisbook is filled withmany battles and dangerous escapades. For a hobbit to encounter such things isalmostunheard of. At many pointsTolkien has the reader at the edge of their seat, just waitingto see if Bilboand the others will pull through. Theconnection formed between the readerand characters is unbelievable. The Hobbit is a classic tail of goodversus evil, with Bilboplaying the role of the unlikely hero. Bilbo alone could never have accomplishedsuch greatfeats, but with the knowledge given to him by the Dwarves and thechance given to him byGandalf he achieves much of the unthinkable. Throughoutthe story Tolkien lays thegroundwork for his enchanting trilogy, The Lordof the Rings by introducing characters andshowing their relationships. The enduring hatred between the Goblins andthe Dwarves dueto the Goblin War makes for an interesting and compellingcontroversy leaving you longingfor more. If you are looking for a fast paced,action packed, spellbinding epic, The Hobbitwill surely not disappoint.-"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I read the review that mentioned how this audio book was created to give the listener the feeling of an old time radio show, I did not realise the drawbacks of this format. The sound effects come across as low-buget and amature. The music drones on and on, with the vocals being so quiet and hard to hear. I ran tests on portable cassette and home theater. This book is acceptable if you have a powerful amplifier -- but any environment that has background noise (car, walking) this is not a good tape to try and listen to."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am just a reader who happened to see someone else interested in the book they were reading. it happened to be the hobbit and you might say i was inspired to read it. Now, if you are still hooked on harry potter, read this classic and you will be blown away by the magic of it. its better than harry and the rest are too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"About the story:The Hobbit is an excellent story. Its plot is perfectly developed, though the first chapters may seem boring to some. It is much less complex and deep than LOTR, but is able to deliver the same type of emotion and interest. A must read if you are beginning with LOTR, giving you easy to remember background info before you begin the actual masterpiece or the much more advanced Silmarillion -even though it actually isn't ONE story-.About the edition:This paperback edition is well enough for an average reader. It has a nice cover design along with a good size and clear maps. The only problem I found is that there are a couple of spelling mistakes through the story -gonig=going-, but hey, what edition is free of them? Overall, it is a great value for what you get, both an excellent story and a nice new edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is definately worth reading. It captures your imagination and takes you into a whole new world. It takes you into the world of dragons and gold and dwarves. If you read this book then your probably going to love it. This book is really special. Not very many authors can create books as good as this. If you get this book then your in for a real treat. So take the advantage and read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is just great! If you're a fantasy reader you just need to read this book. Its about bilbo( the Hobbit). Bilbo (in this) is not actully how he seems in the Lord of the Rings. Its a very high standerd book, and i think really good. You'll read about a whole new world and there are such lovely characters!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A friend of mine had told me about the coming of the movies for the LOTR series about six months ago. I had always wanted to read the series, but just never found the time to do so. This announcement came as a wonderful way to get me to start it though, and I have to say that once I started reading, I just could not put the book down.I like a decent story just as much as anyone else, but this one had me positively hooked! I read this book, just as I later read &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and was constantly finding myself gritting my teeth, correcting my posture, and feeling my heart beat faster and faster and faster. There is just no way to accurately describe just how gripping this book really is. The only thing that could have brought me any closer to the story was actually being there and witnessing these things happen firsthand, for through much of the book, that is how I felt anyway.Traditionally, I have found my niche within the realm of contemporary fiction, but this may lead me away from that path. If you are not one who likes books about fantasy, magic, or even science fiction, you probably aren't here to read this review anyway. But if for some reason you are here reading this review and you still don't like those things, have no fear. Tolkien's mastery of detail in this truly dramatic and suspensful precursor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy will keep you on the edge of your seat.Further, if you enjoy this book, let me just add that the Lord of the Rings trilogy itself offers ten times as much excitement as is packed into &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; It is without a doubt, a book that should not be missed by anyone!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"[...]There are enough adjatives already said on the book (maybe I'll write a full review of it later) but for now lets talk about the comic (or as it is refered to the paperback version, click the link below, you'll like what you see.)It's a collection of three part comic book adaption of The Hobbit put out in three issues back in 1989. I considered it the best comic book adaption of anything I ever read and the passing of a decade, and a new cover for the trade paperback has done nothing to change my opinion.It should be said up front that 134 pages are just not enough to give the entire book its due. If you want the actual novel then read it. This is a comic book, it is a GREAT comic book and on my list of best ever, but it is a comic book.That doesn't mean avoid this this is a great adaption. The artwork is supurb, colorful, and \\"takes\\" you into the story quickly. David Wenzel does his job well. When I think of the characters in my mind. The faces I see are these drawings. And I've seen every cartoon adaption and the movie. He also did some very nice prints from this book.Charles Dixon adapts the story well. This was version I read to my children when they were six and eight and it was kept by my youngest son near his bed for easy access over the last two years.This will definately get your brood especially the younger members of it into the story and into reading as a consequence.A great addition to any person's collection of Hobbit or Tolklen stuff. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as \\"not helpful\\" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While this book is acclaimed as one of the best fantasy novels of all time. I find that the most weighing factor for this is age. Being published in the early 20's, it was certainly a groundbreaking book in its time. At this point, however, while the book is better then some of what is out there, it is given far to much esteem. I found the book, superfluously wordy. The resolution of the plot easy to foresee. And I had a hard time finishing it, I wasn't filled with wonder. Perhaps this is due to my reading a great deal of fantasy previous to reading the Hobbit. I feel the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne have weathered the ages much more effectively. So I would recommend the Hobbit to adolescents, people who are interested in getting into fantasy, and those who have a great deal of patience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Meet Bilbo Baggins just your ordinary little ol hobbit that keeps to himself then one day is asked to go on an adventure with alot of dwarvs and a wizard follow along with bilbo in this amazing journey in the hobbit. this book was alot better than lord of the rings and alot easier to read. don't get me wrong lord of the rings is good but i liked the hobbit better. and now i can't wait untile the movie comes out on 12-14-12. it will be good. this is a awesome book. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book i received was different than the one in the Picture, and in much Worse condition that i expected.I was disappointed with the quality of this product.

Tolkien is a book that is recommended for students at the middle school level and even the high school level who are interested in reading fiction and action/adventure books on their spare time. This is a book that may be hard to read at times because of the language that Tolkien used, so it may be a good idea to look up some words in a dictionary that are difficult in order to understand some parts of the book better.In my own opinion of the book \\"The Hobbit\\", I did not really like the book at first, but as the book went on and got more exciting after the great wizard known as Gandalf invited thirteen dwarves along with Bilbo Baggins to find the evil dragon named Smaug and reclaim the lost treasures that the evil dragon had taken from the dwarves in the past. At first, the dwarves were skeptical about Gandalf's decision, as well as Bilbo himself because of the grave danger that they could possibly face. Bilbo's character in the story was one of a humble manner; Bilbo did not have the character of an adventurer, or a burglar. To Bilbo's surprise, Gandalf assured all of the Dwarves that Bilbo had the hidden character within himself to be a stealthy burglar and a courageous adventurer. Bilbo not believing the omniscient Gandalf went along on the journey anyway. On the journey that Bilbo, Gandalf, and the thirteen dwarves endured, they had to face many secondary enemies such as Gollum, the trolls, and the Demon King. They also traveled to many lands such as the Lonely Mountain and the Mirkwood village on their quest to defeat the evil dragon Smaug.The characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien were each uniquely significant to the clarification of the plot. Bilbo, the main character is the central character who is trying to change his destiny of crude comfort. He becomes a hero and an enemy to evil. Yet his nature does not seem to emphasize his central role. He is still a little old hobbit, as he was always wishing to be sleeping at home in his hole, even towards the conclusion of the plot. This story will intrigue the mind of the reader, and this is definitely a book that will not be able to stop reading until the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I guess I am one of the few, very few apparently, who was not blown away by THE HOBBIT. While the story itself is fun and adventurous, I was let down by the telling of the story. While I felt the ending was much better than the begining, the Narrator just got on my nerves. Everytime the story got interesting and exciting, this voice would come out of nowhere and say something like, &quot;This was not the last time that Bilbo would use his sword Sting, but that is something you will hear about later.&quot; I know that exact line was never written, but stuff like it certainly was. I just think you shouldn't have to be told what will happen later so bluntly. Maybe a subteler form of foreshadowing is needed, or maybe I am just overly sensitive. In any case it was a good story, but not great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"CHARACTERS-The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, seems to be a very strange person to write about in a fantasy novel (considering he's plump, lazy, has hair on his toes and hates adventures) but turns out to be a rather enjoyable nostalgic-like outcome. The dwarves (they could of done with less, I suppose) are pretty much the same character with some variations and exceptions such as Thorin, but just their rhyming names and happy demeanor throughout the story makes this book all the more merrier (besides the traditional cliche for fantasy is a large group of heroes setting out to fight evil, right?) Gandalf is like all mysterious mages, sorecerers and wizards in fantasy novels...you just can't do with out them. It seems they always set the foundation for the plot as well.....STORY-Not the best story in the world, and definetly not one set on need. Gandalf the wizard and king Thorin of the dwarves are setting up a group of adventurers to embark on an journey. Gandalf suggests Bilbo (the burglar) would be the the perfect person to be the last member of the dwarven group. King Thorin is setting out with his companions to retake his throne from the evil red dragon, Smaug. Smaug lies in the midst of the dwarven kingdom where dwarven gold lays in heaps along with a valuable item of particular dwarven interest.QUALITY-This will be very short. Tolkien is a great writer with a great mind for imagination. The adventures the rather small group takes on are very fun and mysterious if not terribly entertaining.FANTASY-The good ol' stuff... dwarves, wizards, sorcerers, elves everything that makes up traditonal fantasy. If you don't like traditonal, this book might not be for you. I myself used to be a huge fan, but now am more into the original stuff, like Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time.RATING-From 1 to 10, I give this book a 7. Keeps you very interested! A classic fantasy buy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo was a quiet, calm Hobbit who loved to eat and live in comfort. That's just what he did until a band of dwarves led by a wizard came with an interesting proposition-stay home safe and happy or help kill a dragon and face certain death? What will Bilbo do? Will he accept? Of all the mysterious and adverturous things in this book there is one drawback. There are so many characters that it gets confusing. But do read the book. To help, write down the characters and a few personality traits to help understand them more. This book is enjoyable for all ages, but is suggested for teens and adults. The plot is amazing and keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages. The story pulls you into it as if you were helping Bilbo and marching off to fight the dragon. The details are magnificent and the adventure is enough to make your heart throb. The Hobbit is a book to read when you have lots of time and feel the need to read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In my opinion the author really messed up when he started dragging out sentences... For instance, in the first chapter when Bilbo had his visitors and it was time to wash the dishes instead of saying the dishes the author chose to name every single solitary dish(the plates,pots, pans, glasses, cups,etc.) I feel that he lost a lot of interest like that. In short this book could have been a very interesting 100 to 200 page book instead of a long drawn out 300 plus book (paperback)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"No doubt The Hobbit is classic work of literature. Unfortunately, this dramatization (as with the related Lord of the Rings Dramatization) suffer from three problems:1. Recording Quality. This is a simple technical issue, but the audio mix is atrocious. Voice levels are unmodulated rendering many passages inaudible even with your volume set to 11. Much of the dialogue is muddy at best. Just hearing what is being said is extremely challenging.2. Dramatization, Not a Reading. This is not a book on tape, it is a re-written interpretation of the original. It relies almost exclusively on dialogue to tell the story. The original story is driven and paced by Tolkien's beautiful description of locations, thoughts, feeling and atmosphere, so cutting all that out is akin to selling a dramatization of the Mona Lisa under the verbal description of \\"a portrait of woman in the country\\" - it just utterly falls short.3. Gaps. Wow. They have simply edited out huge plot-line swaths of the story. Enormous chunks are neither alluded to or explained.To riff on Lucas - This is not the story you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I started reading this book, I was interested: a wizard, 13 dwarfs and a passive home-person hobbit set on an adventure to kill a dragon and take back what was robbed by a greedy dragon. I thought this was a typical fantasy novel with some adventures, good vs. bad encounters, and a happy ending where the party succeeded in killing the dragon and restored the city to its old glory. Boy, was I sure wrong! The characters were round, possessed both good qualities and flaws (for example, the dwarfs were excessively greedy, and there were serious problems because of that) and the group changed by each new experience acquired. The story was mysterious, suspenseful, funny, and dark, and the adventures were fascinating. The ending (*grin*) was totally different from what I imagined.

I personally could never get through it, but I've gotten about halfway various times, and I don't care for it. The reading level is about the same a Black Beauty, which I read in second grade. However, you never get to really like any characters, and there isn't any kind of theme. As Tolkein says, if you like there-and-back again kind of books, read the Hobbit. I would recommend it to middle school boys who enjoy action figures and role playing battle games.

His luck seems to explain some very fortuitous events, but makes it feel as though the book was written backwards (Okay, _this_ is going to happen, so _this_ had to have happened here.).Gandalf: a powerful wizard presumably fighting for good, but condescending and self-important.and a group of dwarves only really distinguished by Bombur the Fat and Thorin the Leader.It was interesting to see where some other fantasy realms got their ideas, but I found it difficult to pick the book up. Nothing important happens for periods at a time. Of course, the benefit of this is a more in-depth view of Tolkien's world. Don't get me wrong: the world is fascinating, but I'd much rather read about more interesting characters living in a very similar world (Dragonlance novels by Weis and Hickman come to mind.). Why suffer through the bad parts when everything can be wonderful?The only moment I felt any connection to the book was a section towards the end, when someone admits their faults and moves on.

As he tries to find his way out he finds a gold ring. He picks it up, being the burglar he is. He keeps venturing through the dark, damp cave. He comes upon a murky lake.

In 2012 I wrote a new review, and am editing my original text to include this new review. Mike London 10-3-2012]New Review 2012: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature. For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a sequel to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"\\"The Marvellous Land of Snergs (Dover Children's Classics)\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character (for though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life experience to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past.Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others).This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicitly prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistencies between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature.-----Original Review 2000: \\"Inferiour to L.R.? I think not! No, just different!\\"The biggest problem with this novel is perception. Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children. There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that was his master achievement in children's literature.The Lord of the Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The Hobbit's success. Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the Rings. It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him as The Silmarillion.So delineation is required if you want to read this. Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings. Think of it like you would think of any other children's classics: children's classics. If you take it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not written to be like that. But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a failure in children's fiction. It is not children's fiction, it is epic fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction. That is EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit. They try to put it in the same type of genre or playing field as The L. R. They are both masterpieces, and I love them both dearly. But one is for children, the other with adults.Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem. How many books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel? Not very many. The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in the children's market. He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a sequel. So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put it. He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into it. So we have two works, spanning two different genres, and as far as surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel. Instead of looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece, an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece. The Hobbit is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time. The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market. Both are as important as the other, just in different fields.I haven't talked about The Silmarillion much. I have already reviewed it, so I won't go real in-depth here. But the same thing happened with it. People, expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the Biblical style of the published version. If Tolkien wrote that book out in narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer than Lord of the Rings. The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to many preconceptions that are incorrect.So, basically, in conclusion, think of it like this:1. The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece. He scores big with this one.2. The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy, not a trilogy. (Tolkien was always quick to point that out). The Crowning achievement of modern fantasy.3. The Silmarillion - the Bible of Middle-earth. Much more for students of his work than the causal reader.[From the Amazon.co.uk review: Enjoy Tolkien's Middle-earth!

It is second only to The Lord of the Rings.Some say that fantasy is a lower form of the art of literature, because the highest art occurs when the artist puts himself and his real world into his work. But this is exactly what Tolkien did. As a scholar of ancient literature, he created a World like unto that which he studied, a World more wonderful than the creation of any other human.He created Hobbits who liked to draw maps and study ancient tongues and write about their adventures in their [his] World.His Hobbits faced the terror of giant spiders--as a child Mr. T. fell on a tarantula and was sick for days from the bite.His peace-loving Hobbits came to understand the horror of war, and found within themselves the courage to go forward, even in this understanding, to do what was needful. Lieutenant T. was leader of one of the few platoons which actually reached the enemy trenches at the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest battle in history, where the English advanced into a hail of machine-gun fire so fierce that the generals at headquarters could not believe the casualty reports.Mr. T. was raised and remained a devout Catholic. In the Lord of the Rings his Hobbits, along with good and valiant Men and Dwarves and Wizards, faced the evil Orcs of the Dark Lord of Mordor. It is not hard to notice that the Wizards are like Angels without wings, the Orcs like the imps of Hell, and the Dark Lord an enemy worthy of Satan himself.&quot;Here is beauty that cuts like a knife and burns like cold iron.&quot; -- C.S.Lewis, in the first review of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The biggest problem with this novel is perception.

TolkienThere and Back Again told by Bilbo Baggins&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is, simply put, the seminal novel in modern fantasy fiction. Although many may see &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as strictly being a children's book or at best one for the teenagers, there is much in this novel for fans of fantasy fiction of all ages. I believe the last time I read this wondrous and beautifully crafted story was when I was a teenager myself but having been inspired by Peter Jackson telling the tale of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the theaters I gladly purchased this novel to reread the epic and recapture the joy that it is to read one of Tolkien's classics.Although many an author in many different fantasy series have come close to creating worlds such as Middle-Earth in the fantasy genre, they have done just that, come close. Giving credit where credit is due though, a majority of these authors were inspired by Tolkien and their great works may never have been were it not for his in the beginning.If you're like me, making a revisit to the world of Tolkien's writings or coming to it for the first time, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is definitely the place to start. This review is for the Leatherette Collector's Edition, ISBN: 0-395-17711-1 which is a beautifully crafted novel and the illustrations by J.R.R. Tolkien himself all combine to make for a wonderful experience as Tolkien weaves the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his first big adventure through an extraordinary premise, exceptional plot setup and execution and perfect pacing.The premise:&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit that is visited by Gandalf the Wizard and the very next day twelve dwarves show up in his &quot;hole&quot; and enlist his aid as a &quot;burglar&quot; in their quest.Before poor Bilbo knows it, he's on a quest with the twelve dwarves and Gandalf to the far reaches of Middle-Earth to rob Smaug the dragon of that which belonged to dwarf King Thorin's father Thrain and is rightfully his, the treasure of Lonely Mountain.What follows from there is most certainly one of fantasy fiction's classic tales and an extremely enjoyable tale for all ages where Bilbo, Gandalf and the twelve dwarves go from one adventure to another on their way to the Lonely Mountain and an inevitable meeting with Smaug.I highly recommend this novel in this Leatherette Collector's Edition to those who've never read the story before and to those that have and wish to have the best possible version of it. It would be absolutely perfect if Peter Jackson would see fit to further immortalize this novel by bringing it to the silver screen after the overwhelming success of the &quot;The Lord of the Rings!&quot; {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit who lived a quiet life except for a single, life-altering year. He is recruited by a wizard named Gandalf to accompany a band of dwarves on their quest to reclaim the land and fortune that is rightfully theirs by slaying the dragon who took it from them. Bilbo is a reluctant hero, but nevertheless a memorable one. And his tale is an extraordinary flight of fancy that will stay in your heart forever. I am extremely picky about which books I like to reread, but after reading this for the first time I am sure that there will be a second, as well as a third and fourth. Tolkien is a masterful storyteller, and the world he creates is so vivid and well-conceived that it is easy to lose yourself in the forests of Mirkwood, the Misty Mountains or the desolate Lonely Mountain. Bilbo's adventure is captivating from one leg of the journey to the next. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; touches on issues of greed, courage and friendship without ever losing focus or seeming preachy. The only fault I can find is with me, for not reading it sooner."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My father introduced the late great Mr J.R.R. Tolkien to me when I was 8 years old, at a time when I had an insatiable appetite for literature of all kinds. From one night to the next I used to long to hear of events that - somehow - had been happening during my daily absence.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; only added to my impatience. The animated tones of my father's voice as he described Bilbo Baggins's journey into the middle earth, created images of green mist, rugged mountains and dark woods that only a childs mind can see so vividly. Yet I can remember the look on my father's face as he turned every page to rejoin the adventure. And I realised that this book - this fantasy land - had captured my fathers imagination as it had mine.For years after my father read me &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, I longed to recapture the feelings that I first encountered in Bilbo's adventure - to learn more about Gandalf, and conjure up further images of dark, mysterious scenery. But maybe that time was too special. Maybe I'm never mean't to find another book with such magical power ..... because maybe I was lucky to be introduced to one in the first place.There are a lot of maybe's in life - questions that go along unanswered - as there are in this book...... that's the magic.In my adult wisdom (!?) I now know that I'll never truly recapture the feelings that I had as a little girl. But - when the time arises - I will strive to provide the same atmosphere in which my children can realise the magic of reading. And &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the book that made me realise how important the magic is.So Mr Tolkien, wherever you are, I give you 5 stars.... for the thousands that you have already given me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent fantasy adventure. It was easy to read and understand, and had lot's of humor in it. Though inferior to its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, the story of Bilbo Baggins quest provided the background that LOTR depended on. The Hobbit has a different feel from LOTR; it reads exactly like a fantasy, and that's what makes it a fun story. Wizards, dwarves, orcs, people, dragons, trolls, elves, and of course hobbits populate this book, so its in the right formula. Whenever I had to actually put the book down, I had thoughts of what would happen next to Bilbo and the dwarves. Despite the lighter tone in contrast with LOTR, there's nothing corny about The Hobbit. Upon finishing Tolkien's original classic, a person can't help being curious about Tolkien's masterpiece, LOTR. Besides, to feel the full grasp of LOTR, it is essential to read about Bilbo's quest first. Read and enjoy this classic, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I listen to a lot of audio books.Prior to The Hobbit, I heard Tim Curry read Dune: House Corrino (the last in the Dune Prequel Trilogy)...Edward Hardwicke read Sherlock Holmes...and Jim Dale read the Harry Potter books.All of the above voices are British, so I'm used to that. In fact, I prefer it. A Brit could read a telephone book and it would sound interesting to me.However, despite my penchant for the British dialect, it took a while for me to get used to narrator Rob Inglis' deep, mellifluous voice. I'm not sure why. Maybe because he seemed to read more slowly than the other narrators. Maybe it's because some of his vocalizations sounded similar. Or maybe it's because I've read the story before and I kept waiting for the next exciting thing to happen.Or maybe it was the songs J.R.R. Tolkien's characters burst into from time to time throughout the book. Inglis actually sings the songs! His singing voice is very good, but the songs seemed to last forever. (I fast forwarded through a few of them.)All of this is starting to sound as though I didn't like Inglis' reading of The Hobbit. Pish-posh. As it said, it took a while to get used to, but I quickly did so -- and hated to see the story end.A classically-trained Shakespearean actor, Inglis is a natural to read Tolkien. He has an incredibly expressive voice. Because of its baritone nature, his renderings of dwarves, dragons and goblins was dead-on.As I mentioned, I've read The Hobbit many times. I bought my first copy of it in the early '70s, in fact. But this is the first time I've ever heard it read to me.It was positively delightful! Perhaps Tolkien intended for his story to be read aloud. I don't know. But I loved listening to the adventures of Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin &amp; Company and all the creatures they encounter in their journey to Smaug's lair. Especially by a reader with such a marvelous voice.The quality of this 10-CD set is impeccable. The voice is clear and crisp. The sound level in all CDs is perfect. I have nothing but praise for this unabridged audio book.Which is why I bought Inglis' reading of Tolkien's other (perhaps more famous) works: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King. Collectively known as The Lord of the Rings.I have my listening cut out for me!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This 70th anniversary edition of The Hobbit is a fine production which includes the most recent corrections to the text. The introduction by Christopher Tolkien is about twenty years old, having been written for the British 50th anniversary edition in 1987. I don't believe this introduction has been available in an American edition before, so its good that it finally made it into print here. The book is well-designed and made so that it will last through many rereadings, as a classic should, and it is much nicer to hold and read than previous American editions, which tend to feel cheap and clunky. The paintings and line drawings by JRR Tolkien are as fresh and beautiful as they must have been when they were new, and much to be preferred over the illustrations provided by other artists. I believe that this edition of The Hobbit is the closest American version of how Tolkien himself would have liked it to have been published."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's Hobbit takes the imagination on a wonderful flight of fantasy. I read this book on a yearly basis and each year I am delighted and captivated by the world of Bilbo Baggins.Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, Smaug. They have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climactic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but also to a new adventure for his friends in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Tolkien is a master storyteller and the depth of his skill is best seen in this tale. In the following trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; the story is continued, but the sheer delight of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is never fully recaptured. This collector's edition is beautifully bound. Even more enjoyable are the illustrations and paintings by the author himself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Not only is it great fun for all ages, but a must read for fantasy fans.

Although Bilbo disagrees with Gandalf he ends up in the front lines in many of adventures.There are subtle hints that a darker time is coming for Middle Earth. Many little things fall into place that would later tell the Lord of the Rings stories. This is the first appearance of Gollum. The scene with Bilbo and Gollum always stood out the most, that and Gandalf.There really was nothing I disliked. To come up with something I would have to compare to the new movie but I am not going to get into that.

I didn&#8217;t remember much about it except that I quite enjoyed it as a young child. This time I also enjoyed reading it, but to a lesser degree.Perhaps the best thing about The Hobbit is that it sets the stage of how Bilbo Baggins came to possess the Ring of Power, relating the necessary background for The Lord of the Rings. My main issue with The Hobbit is that it was, as opposed to The Lord of the Rings, specifically written for children. The plot is very predictable and told in a fairly childish manner, and lacks the more mature style of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book gives you the background for lord of the rings..I'm still reading but cant put it down (almost burned dinner)..I highly recommend it for lovers of fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was the bees knees.

I remember that once I began reading the trilogy I no longer had that much desire to revisit The Hobbit, thinking of it as child's fare. That was a loooong time ago, and I have wanted to re-read the book that started me into the fantasy genre. I have now satisfied that desire with the kindle version, and have to say that the story reads almost like a summary of itself in too many places. It's also written in a voice entirely unlike the serious tone of the trilogy to which it is a prequel---it is truly a book written to appeal to children, not adults. So, the adult in me wants to give the book three stars, but the child I used to be remembers this book quite fondly and had it on a pedestal at the time, and would give it five stars. So I have settled in the middle---pardon the unintended pun reference to middle-earth---at four stars. If you have a child in elementary school or early middle school, or even better a child that you are reading stories too every night, that child would probably really enjoy this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's imagination.

A few differences from the book and movie but overall it stayed pretty true to the book (thus far)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book that started it all. And a classic of fantasy.For those who have never read it, most highly recommended.If you are familiar with the Lord of the rings, the hobbit merely sets the stage. On many levels it is a happier story: it's villains not as villainous as those in the Lord of the rings: bad rather than evil. A good introduction for a young reader to the world of middle earth.I've probably now read this three or four times and each time enjoy it more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was the best book I ever read. I really liked it and It was so good i could read it again and again"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien takes us out on an journey you cannot help falling in love with. this is indeed a masterpiece full of beauty and magic!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This story never gets old. I read this book when I was 10 years old and could not put it down. The magic has returned! I wanted to read it again before I saw the movie, as I did before the Lord of the Rings, and it did not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fine example of an adventure novel. The entire movement of the fantasy genre in our modern day all come from this book. The story of the littlest creature in the universe making a difference, and making the other more powerful characters successful is one that resonates through all of time. The story also works well to introduce the ring into the lexicon of this universe.This story is so ubiquitous now that some see it as cliched. However, I like the book as an introduction into the fantasy genre. This book also brings into focus many of the races that become important in later areas such as dungeons and dragons. The quasi-pagan universe is one that builds as one goes through this story and also the installments of Lord of the Rings.I teach this book to Freshmen in High School English class. I think they enjoy it, and I like it as an intro into this new exciting world. Special thanks should go to Peter Jackson for making this book into a new film this year."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book I read in my youth and with the movie coming out soon needed to replace my missing copy. This book is perfectly compact, hardcover and written to the original text, including maps. Awesome gift for any Tolkein fan you know."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of the all time classics, now has a permanent place on our bookshelf for many years to come. We will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This has long been a favorite book of mine. These days, I mostly read Kindle books, but my oldest boy is about to turn 9 and he wanted to read the Hobbit before the new movies come out. We opted for a real book and I must say that this edition is exactly what I wanted. The book seems very well bound, the type set is crisp, and the jacket seems durable. It was cheap enough that I didn't mind giving it to a child knowing it might get destroyed (though he usually reads with us or has us read to him as Tolkien is a real challenge for him.) It is nice enough that he views the book as a prized possession worth caring for and keeping for years. I'm so glad I didn't cheap out and buy a trade paperback edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased this book for my infant son in hopes that it would survive until he was much older and it appears that it will. I've started reading it to him and, despite his best attempts, we have not had any ripped pages despite a thorough man handling. Beautiful presentation and artwork."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book. I remember reading it when I was younger but I still love it. A must for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&#34;The Hobbit&#34; as a book, needs no review. It is too famous, and one of the more important works of fiction in recent decades. If you haven't read it, do so immediately.This Edition, however, is a charmer, that any true book lover will want on his shelf. Complete & unabridged, about the size of a hymnal, with a nice leatherette cover, gilded pages, and what seems to be acid-free paper, is is a joy to hold, to read from, and to look at on your shelf. If you love books, **as books**, you will prefer this adorable little volume above all others. Illustrated with pen & ink drawings by Tolkein himself, and with Tolkein's own maps as front & end pieces, I have never seen a better edition of &#34;The Hobbit&#34;.I **do wish** that the &#34;Lord Of The Rings&#34; would be issued in identically bound, complementary editions. I would snap up the set in a second, & treasure them.I **also** want to see more leatherette covered books in stores, as they are cheaper than hardcovers, and vastly nicer than paperbacks."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is probably the 4th or 5th time I've read the Hobbit-I wanted to re-read it prior to seeing the new movie, and as we were going out on a 5 week vacation, and needed to travel light, I got it on the Kindle. One of the big advantages of using the Kindle edition for those of you who like me, are rapidly approaching 60, is that you can readily adjust the font size. This makes for an easy read. Great fantasy book if you happen to be one of the few people not yet introduced to Bilbo Baggins."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was invited to do a public radio talk show about what books to buy for the holiday season and I decided to play the Ghost of Christmas Past and argued for finding old beloved books to give as presents (or, in my case cards: I give books instead of cards). I also talked about the joy of rediscovering beloved books through annotated editions, and &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; of J. R. R. Tolkien annotated by Douglas A. Anderson was my prime example. After all, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was about to hit theaters and even as I write this I have learned that yesterday would have been Tolkien's &quot;Eleventeenth&quot; birthday.An annotated version of book involves much more than simply rereading a book. If that was all I want to do I still have my illustrated edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will pictures from the Arthur Rankin, Jr./Jules Bass animated production of the story. The annotated edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; provides an explication of the sources, characters, places, and things that made Tolkien's novel a classic. The text is fully restored and corrected, for those who care about such things, with Anderson's notes placed alongside for easy reference. That along would justify adding this volume to your Tolkien library, but in addition there over 150 illustrations, including Tolkien's own original line drawings, maps, and color paintings. Those, of course, are treasures, but Anderson has also provided illustrations from around the world and the most fascinating part of this book for me was looking at how, for example, Bilbo and the Trolls were drawn for Portuguese, Slovakian, and Swedish edition of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; won the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inkling Studies, which sounds very impressive (and I even have some inkling at the what it means). This is one of those treasures where you would give five stars for the story, five stars for the annotations, and five stars for the illustrations. Granted, this is not the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; anyone should read. But after you have read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; a few times and gone through &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least twice (the trilogy itself and not the movies), then it would be time to settle down and pour over this revised and expanded annotated edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The annotated version of the familiar There and Back Again expands the book's value enormously. All of the archaic words that have boggled generations of readers have been explained, and the story can be seen in a new light due to the implications these words arouse. Also are included the illustrations from the foreign versions of the book (several are quite funny - like the way in which the various nations imagine the dwarves and Gandalf - especially those whose mythology includes neither dwarves nor wizards). A very eye-opening book, Annotated Hobbit is a quite interesting piece of work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There is no question that J.R.R. Tolkien's story of The Hobbit is outstanding literature, so I will keep this review strictly to specifically the Alan Lee illustrated hard cover edition. Many people feel that the only high quality hard covers are leather bound. This book should quickly prove this to be false. Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth covering with a beautiful gold dragon in the lower right corner (non other than Smaug himself). The pages are crisp and bright white, not a hint of yellow. The illustrations, scattered generously throughout, are both in color and in black and white and intermingle beautifully with the story. Alan Lee has truely captured Tolkien's characters better than any of the other artists who have tried. The detail in each illustration was enough to hold my attention for quite some time and definately added to my enjoyment of this timeless classic. Whoever feels pictures are for children needs to purchase this book and find the child in himself again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An small, unimposing creature - a Hobbit - is roused from his comfortable life in an unassuming home and pushed into a fantastic adventure. Accompanied by dwarves, wizards, beasts, and men, the Hobbit becomes the key figure in a quest for lost gold and lost glory.This story, the brilliant prequel to Tolkien's _Rings_ trilogy, lives up to the accolades surrounding the stories. The characters have depth, and the perils - as fantastic as they are - have a vivid air of urgency. While the _Rings_ epic may be faulted by some for including too much &quot;superfluous&quot; expository information, the Hobbit sticks to the story at hand. It is a wonderful introduction to adult fantasy books for any child, and one that would work well read out loud.Young readers can easily identify with Bilbo, the diminutive protagonist. Small in stature and initially lacking in confidence, the others in the expedition doubt his worth. However, eventually he proves himself to be invaluable to the cause and the most rational of the party. Isn't this the dream of many children? To leave the humdrum everyday life, and be part of an adventure in which your abilities prove to be the key to success?Read this book as a child. Read it again as a teen, and again as an adult. The story is exciting, impressive, and just plain fun."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is for the Kindle version of The Hobbit:I reviewed this a couple of weeks ago, but I didn't see the review appear here. That works out for the best, however, because I needed to amend my review. I read several reviews from others who complained that the Kindle version had issues with portions of the book missing, and I also experienced that about 10% of the way in - whole paragraphs were missing. I returned it for a refund, but a few days later, I had an idea, purchased the book again, and having read 84% of it at this time, I have had no trouble with missing portions of the book.So what changed? The first time around, I increased the font size, as it is rather small. The second time around, I did not, and I have been able to read without problems. The font size is still a little small for my tastes, and if increasing the font size causes interruption of the book material, that is an issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm still glad to at least know that this might be the problem if it happens again with other books - I suspect it will.The Hobbit is a fun and entertaining book, and you can get much better reviews of the content from other people. I just wanted to put this out there for others who might be experiencing the frustration of missing portions of the book and to suggest a possible reason/solution. It is an issue that needs to be dealt with for the Kindle developers, for sure.Good luck and God bless!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was given this hardbound, encased version of The Hobbit for my 6th birthday in 1978---and have read it about ten times since. (Just finished re-reading it yesterday.) This book, and this version, are magical to me. The Hobbit is a wonderful book, full of adventure, magic, camaraderie, and growth---and is a perfect metaphor for the internal healing process: taking risks for the betterment of our character and soul. Bilbo is a classic example of a comfortable, under-exposed being who breaks out of his comfort to challenge himself and rise to new heights of truth and daring. You gotta love him!Also, the illustrations---all originals by J.R.R. Tolkien---are just marvelous. I've looked at them SO many times over the decades, and they are simply special to me: especially the picture of Smaug the Dragon sitting on his hoard of gold. WOW!So I highly recommend this book, and this version, to everyone and anyone.And if you haven't get read The Hobbit, LUCKY YOU---you have an adventure in store for you!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. However, there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. Moreover, it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.The Hobbit: or, There and Back Again (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fascinating adventure tale about wizards, elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other fantasized creatures. Burrowed inside a hill, deep within Hobbiton, lives a particularly interestesting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Being the jolly little hobbit that he is, Bilbo enjoys his peaceful life in the Shire until he is summoned by the old wizard, Gandalf, to go on an adventure across the lands. Bilbo accepts this adventure and sets out into the unknown on a quest for gold and riches. On his quest through the land, curious young Bilbo encounters many new things that are foreign to the Shire and life as he has known it. Traveling over the lands to strange towns, treacherous mountains, and dangerous forests the hobbit gains possession of a magic ring that he uses to his advantage on this journey for fortune.This novel has been acclaimed a classic through generations for over the past 60 years. The Hobbit is an adventurous book about strange lands from long ago in a time when things were very different than they are today. The book is sometimes a little hard to follow with its elfish dialect and some tongue twisting sentences, but it is nothing a couple of read-through's can't fix. You may hit some boring drawn-out scenes, but stick with it. Once you are into the heart of the story, you will find it hard to put down. If you have a vivid imagination and an interest in fantasy, than this book will become a classic favorite of yours too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent...."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What some people don't seem to realize is that The Hobbit predates The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien didn't anticipate just what his larger work would be about, but he worked it around a lot of the elements in The Hobbit.This first book was not written as a prequel, but as a story in itself. It lacks the epic scale, being more of a children's bedtime story, and an incredible one at that. If you've read it after reading The Lord of the Rings, expecting something in the same vein, you're not going to find it. You'll get a rich tale with no peer in children's fiction, written for the sheer enjoyment. The complexities of Middle-Earth are absent, and the excitement of the quest is the focus.Growing up I had the good fortune of having The Hobbit read to me over and over. When I was old enough to take on the Ring trilogy, it was a joy to see the mysterious land of Tolkien's imagination grow into a whole history. I suppose this is the ideal way to experience The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a delightful ebook to share with someone.

Tolkien had the ability to weave a story and pull the reader (or listener) into his tale. It must be 25 years ago when I first read this story and what a story it was. The Hobbit opened my eyes to a whole other world of reading. Being the son of a librarian, I was accustomed to books, but when I received this book I did not want to put it down. As I have read this story yearly, I was very excited to see the BBC dramatization released on CD. I must tell you that the BBC did a wonderful job with this story, bringing out the highs and the lows with precision and believability. You will not be disappointed with this series.

This review refers specifically to the edition illustrated by Alan Lee. While it is more expensive than many other editions, no other captures the whimsy and adventure of the novel so eloquently. Like many of us, Alan Lee has clearly fallen in love with Middle Earth. Unlike many of us, he can capture our imagination and set it to canvas. This is an outstanding edition, worthy of one of the great tales of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am in 11th grade, and I just read this book maybe... September. Part of my grade in my English class was to come up with ten words out of our current books, write them down, and define them. We would then hand these words (with their definitions) into our teacher. There was a probelm, though. The Hobbit contained maybe one word that I wasn't exactly sure of in the whole book. This resulted in a bunch of failing marks in my English class.The Hobbit just &lt;i&gt;flows&lt;/i&gt;. That's really the best way to describe it. A third grader could read this, and yet an 11th grader is set to read it again. I read the Lord of the Rings trilosy, and while that was good, it was much harder to read. To get through them, you need to read all the appendixes and such. It was much deeper too. The Hobbit is light and free-flowing, and that's why I gave it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This magnificent book is a must for all fantasy-readers. It is the first truly succsesfull fantasy book, and it introduces you to the most famous fantasy world, Middle Earth with all its mystery and magic.In this book you follow the hobbit Bilbo Baggins who is accompanied by 13 dwarfes.

He led a normal life until a unexpeced visit occurs from a Wizard named Gandalf and 12 dwarves all in need of a good thief like Bilbo to help them on a quest to ... Smawg and get his gold.

If you are buying it for the side notes in particular, my opinion is that it's okay but not great.I was expecting deep insights about Tolkien's writing, such as whether he had something in mind (like from WWII, etc.) and symbolized it with something in the book or not, if he &#34;massaged&#34; something over time to finalize and perfect it, etc., and there are some notes like this, but most of them are mildly interesting to boring notes on word derivations, etc., which disappointed me. Do the &#34;Look inside&#34; thing at Amazon or something to see if it appeals to you. Not bad but not what I was expecting.Of course, you still get the book text itself, which is a great read, and this is a good price for that alone (although I prefer the edition that has &#34;illustrations by the author&#34;, with more Tolkien, and obviously includes the entire book text too, and also at a good price). If you're a student of writing and/or of Tolkien, this annotated edition is probably a very good buy, but if just a person who enjoys The Hobbit and hopes to get great insights into it, okay but I don't think great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was the first book I ever read..

Then the movie came out and in order not to seem to far out of the main stream read the book.I really liked it. The plot was straightforward and easy to follow. There were some surprises. What did surprise me- and what did not translate into the movie- was the clever, convoluted and crafty writing style J. R. R. Tolkien used to capture the reader's imagination and unleash the power of the mental image. Would it be pretentious of me to say that it is more how the book was written than what it had to say that fascinated me? If so, forgive me. It's the truth.

It brings back so many good memories."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was introduced to the works of JRR Tolkien by the movie. Needless to say I hated it. I thought it was just a rambling mess with too many extreme closeups, too many far shots and shallow characters. It was also 3 hours long and I felt like killing myself to end the madness. I recieved the trilogy for christmas and I figured that the books were better than the movie. Well they were a lot better, but were kind of boring and drawn out. But then I decided to read the Hobbit, and finally I was impressed. This, in my opinion is where anyone who is reading Tolkien should start out.This book is fairly easy reading and fairly lighthearted. It is written with much more excitement than the LOTR and as a result is much more suspensful. I actually felt tense when the wolves were attacking the company.Though the language is not as polished as in the LOTR, Tolkien makes up for in character development and plot.Well anyway, I feel this deserves every bit a five star rating. It was exciting, fast paced and wasn't boged down with page after page of meaningless description. So I guess Tolkien was a good writer after all, it surpised me to find out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the story of how Bilbo Baggins obtained the powerful ring and found sources of bravery and courage within himself through his adventures with the dwarves and Gandalf the wizard. I was spellbound within a few pages and was astounded at how energetic and compelling the story is. And this was published in 1937! I believe the reason for the book's longevity is that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is about a character challenging himself and proving himself (to himself and to others), which is something to which everyone can relate. This is certainly a masterpiece of storytelling."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The style of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are quite different, though they share the same author and universe. The Hobbit is more childlike with sillier characters. The world is not so large and dark as in the Rings. There is much less background texture in languages, history and poetry.I've read the Hobbit twice over the decades, but the Lord of the Rings about eight times. You pretty much see everything in one reading, while there is new detail each time in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful work and achievement. It is a splendid escape from our current fast forward high tech world. I must say that I do enjoy the Trilogy to the Hobbit. The Hobbit aims more at a younger mind, where as the Trilogy is broad and universally appealing. I love everything that Tolkien ever did, and for a young reader this is probably the best place to start."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"if you're thinking about diving straight into the lord of the rings trilogy, i'd suggest you take the time out to delve into the hobbit first. this prequel to LOTR is equally fascinating and beautfully creates Tolkien's magical world for you as a start, whetting an appetite for the hefty story that follows. that done, you're now prepared to tackle LOTR.enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've always loved fantasy novels, and my friends have always told me that The Hobbit was a &quot;most read&quot;, ok after several tries now I've read it and, don't get me wrong it's really good, but I don't think it's worth five of four stars. The descriptions of both settings and characters are very good, the story is extremely imaginative, but I think it's a very &quot;light&quot; adventures story because of all the perils Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit) and his dwarves companions encounter, there's not one in which you can really get concerned of what the outcome will be. I enjoyed it and never will regret reading it, but also think there are better fantasy novels, like the ones of Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It would be easy to simply applaud this famous and well written story.However, I do not enjoy the grandfatherly storytelling style and tone of the writing of the Hobbit as much as I enjoy the depth and detail in the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit, if seen as a part (or a prequel) to the main story of the Lord of the Rings, is too simple.There is, of course, nothing wrong with the children's book writing. Personally, though, the themes and characters portrayed are much to deep for the story to be written as a children's book.I got just as much out of reading the intro to the Lord of the Rings (explaining briefly the events which came to pass in the Hobbit, for readers who have not read the Hobbit) as I did reading the entire book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a story about a little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.

I haven't read The Hobbit in ages and remember more about the animated movie than the book. Still it was a better place to start being a short book, not to mention the fact that my wife owns an old hardcover edition.It was better than I remembered, a nice tight adventure story told in Tolkien's odd but unique style. Tolkien's works present an interesting dilemma as far as which novel to start with. In particular The Silmarillion, which takes place first chronologically first in the story, and was the first book Tolkien started, was actually released last, after his death. But was it really meant to be read first? Hard to say. Still, Hobbit is by far the most approachable and makes a good starting place.I suppose you either like Tolkien's wandering style or you don't. His loopy old English conventions and penchant for flat out inventing words and tenses might put some off. The structure of The Hobbit in particular is fairly repetitive as well. Once the intro is over the the adventurers are on their way the story falls into a kind of repetitive patter of increasingly more challenging but basically similar challenges for the group. And I'm not the first to mention Tolkiens arguably lazy use of certain recurring plot devices for use when he writes himself into a sticky situation. Gandalf appears and disappears just when needed. And The Eagles always seem to show up at just the right time to save our heroes from dangerous places here as well as in the later trilogy.There's been talk of a new live action The Hobbit film adaptation which is especially tantalizing with the faithful adaptation of the trilogy. Obviously it will be a much easier task considering the shorter length, but it still presents challenges. I see the biggest problem being too many persistent characters. There are thirteen fairly anonymous dwarfs, Bilbo, and Gandalf to deal with. No easy task on film. Should the actor from the trilogy return to play Bilbo? Strictly according to the story it might work since The Ring kept him from aging since The Hobbit. Similar problem with Gandalf. These characters are now firmly planted in the audiences mind with these actors and it would be difficult to replace either.Then again there would be a couple things that make it easier. Much of the creative and production work is already done: the creation of Hobbiton and Bag End for instance, as well as Rivendale sets. Recreating is certainly easier than starting from scratch. It seems all of New Zealand has already been prescouted for locations. Plus all of the creative talent is already in place for costume and CGI work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was browsing in the bookstore when I enountered the Graphic Novel version of The Hobbit (IBSN 0-345-44560-0). It's illustrated by David Wenzel with the text adapted by Charles Dixon and Sean Deming.This version is simply amazing. I gave up trying to read The Hobbit to my seven year old. It was just too wordy for his short attention span. This version is perfect. It's illustrated like a high-end comic book (do the \\"look inside\\" thing to see an example). The text is marvelously adapted. Tonight I pulled out my deluxe leather-bound version to see what they left out -- yes, they do leave things out, but you wouldn't know unless you compare the two books side by side the way I did.It's great for kids and great for adults too. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien is my favorite. No one even comes close. If you're going to read the triology - I strongly suggest you start with The Hobbit.

The book starts out in Middle Earth, in a town called The Shire. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable hobbit is living in quiet comfort. Hobbits are not supposed to have adventures or do anything out of the ordinary. His normal routines are upset when a wizard, Gandalf the Grey, comes knocking on his door. Gandalf brings 13 dwarves, and an adventure. Their task is to reclaim treasures that the evil dragon, Smaug, had taken from their ancestors. At first Bilbo is reluctant to go, but soon the draw of the adventure pulls him in.Along the way, the group meets all sorts of evil creatures, orcs, goblins, and of course Gollum. Bilbo meets Gollum when he becomes separated from Gandalf and the dwarves underneath the mountain. Bilbo also finds the ring. He finds it near Gollum's lair, and unknowingly takes it. Soon he discovers what it does, and escapes out of the mountain and becomes reunited with the group. They continue into the mountain to encounter Smaug's lair and take back their treasure. Bilbo returns to the Shire with gold, and jewels, and a more \\"precious\\" treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A classic children's story, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" was first published in 1937. The hero of the book is a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins. A small and agile race, hobbits are generally between two and four feet in height. They rarely wear shoes, and - while not magical - can move both quickly and quietly. Fond of eating, drinking and skilled in the smoking of pipe-weed, hobbits live in holes in the ground and thoroughly disapprove of adventures. Bilbo, as the book begins, appears to be a very typical hobbit. He lives in a very comfortable and well-stocked hole, known as Bag End, in a town called Hobbiton. However, things change after a visit from Gandalf the Grey - a very famous wizard - and thirteen dwarves. Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves' leader, is leading a mission to the Lonely Mountain far to the east of Hobbiton. Thorin's people had lived there until being driven out by a dragon, known as Smaug the Magnificent, and he intends to reclaim their stolen home and treasure. Gandalf has persuaded Thorin to bring Bilbo along as the company's burglar. Unfortunately, Bilbo knew nothing of this until the night before they were all due to leave. Although Bilbo has no good reason to join the group of exiles on their adventure, he still decides to go along with them. As the book progresses, he meets many strange people and creatures - including giant spiders, trolls, goblins and elves. The strangest of them all, however, must surely have been a riddle-loving creature called Gollum who cares only for something he calls his \\"precious\\".Following the success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations of the Hobbit's slightly more famous sequel, the Hobbit may - for a short time at least - be seen as nothing more than a precursor to \\"Lord of the Rings\\". It does introduce certain things that play key parts in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" : the race of Hobbits, Gandalf, Gollum and, of course, the Ring itself. However, it is a complete story in itself with a start, middle and end ! \\"The Hobbit\\" will be greatly enjoyed by children - and will also be enjoyed by adults who choose to read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Book Review ofThe Hobbit written by J. R. R. TolkienBy Scott KoorsThe Hobbit is a very interesting and exciting book. The main character, Bilbo, is a little dwarf person that doesn't wear any shoes that they call a hobbit. Bilbo and a great wizard, Gandalf, set out on a great adventure together. The two of them overcome some unbelievable hardships. They also make some new friends and at the same time some new enemies.This book allows you to let your imagination run wild. I found that I was putting myself into the different character's shoes during the story. I just imagined how scary, but at the same time, how exciting it must have been for them. Even though there is a lot of science-fiction things in the book, I could still picture all of the scenes and settings. The book wasn't too abstract. I also felt that the book was very detailed. I could almost paint a picture of what was happening in the book in my head.I have always enjoyed reading adventurous books and this one was no different. The book kept me entertained the whole time. I found it hard to put it down, I just couldn't stop reading it. I had to keep reading just to find out what happened next. This was pretty unusual for me, since I don't really enjoy reading that much. The Hobbit was just an all around good book that keeps your attention, while at the same time allows your imagination to run wild. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventurous book, that is written very well by J. R. R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot and it began my interest in fantasy reading altogether.

It keeps you interested throughout the whole story of Bilbo Baggins travels and problems. Tolkien is very descriptive in his story telling and when you are reading it almost feels like you are right there with Bilbo and his companions.This is a great tale of how Bilbo Baggins is a little, fat hobbit from the little Shire village. Everything is green and bright in the Shire with houses carved into hills with round doors and gardens surrounding every house. Bilbo is minding his business when some unexpected people who are dwarves lead by a wizard named Gandalf.The dwarves convinced Bilbo to come along with them on their great quest to kill Smog the might dragon that has been terrorizing their home for quite some time. Soon on their journey Bilbo has to face the dragon by himself to save the whole country that the dwarves live in.In this tale of good and evil Bilbo comes into battle with many strange creatures from HUGE spiders, and angry demented wolves. If you are one for adventure and fighting, this book is cram packed with tales that will keep your nose in the book from the first page to the last adventure home."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a well-off, quiet little halfling (a Hobbit) who'd never wanted any adventures in his life, and of how he became the reluctant participant in a perilous treasure hunt.It all began one afternoon, when Gandalf the wizard came knocking at the round door of his cosy Hobbit Hole. The next morning, thirteen dwarves were crowding his living-room and enrolling him to steal the gold guarded under the lonely Mountain by Smaug, the last of the great dragons.So off he went, through forests old and mountains cold, deceiving trolls, solving riddles in the dark, escaping from goblins and elves, and most of the time rescuing the dwarves from the many perils he himself inadvertenly put them in, thanks to a magical ring he found in Gollum's cave, a ring that has to power to render him invisible.This was the second time I read The Hobbit, and looking at it now with the critical eye of the (amateur) reviewer, I'm afraid to admit I was somewhat annoyed at the beginning by Tolkien's paternalistic tone, by how he sometimes addresses the reader and makes references to the real world, or hints at what's coming up later in the story. This makes the book seem clearly targeted to a young audience, and indeed, The Hobbit would be perfect for reading aloud to a child. However, this tone changes in the course of the story, and especially during the final Battle of the Five Armies, where it reaches a more epic scope, more suitable for young adults.

I am not a big fan of the fantasy genre, but this book is amazing. Once you pick this book up, you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As far as fantasy books go, this is the best one yet (that I have read). The Hobbit, one of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece works, is clearly one of the most amazing pieces of literature ever dreamed up. It is extremely well thought out and written. Now any time my parents go tell me to read I think I will go pick u The Hobbit and read over and over again. After I finished The Hobbit I rushed out to chapters and bought the next novel in the series, The Fellowship of the Rings. After only reading the first couple of chapters I can see that this will truly be another great adventure to read.The Hobbit is the ultimate fantasy book of all time. It starts out by a very mysterious and powerful wizard by the name of Gandalf passing by Bilbo's (The Hobbit) house. Somehow the wizard despite Bilbo's eagerness to get rid of him gets invited back for tea the next day. However before the wizard shows up, a band of dwarves arrive at Bilbo's door. Then when Gandalf arrives Bilbo is informed of what all these dwarves are present for. He has been selected by Gandalf to assist these dwarves in retrieving a stolen treasure, dwarves gold. He becomes the burglar of the band of dwarves. He is the one that must figure out how to steal back the stolen treasure from an evil and incredibly dangerous dragon Smaug. At first the dwarves have no confidence in Bilbo; they do not believe that he will be able to do what Gandalf says he will. Gandalf you see have a great deal of confidence in Bilbo, this will prove to be a very wise decision. It will be a very perilous journey or the dwarves and Bilbo. Along the way many hard-ships will occur, this will prove to be training for Bilbo; it also convinces the dwarves that Bilbo will indeed be able to retrieve the treasure for them. As for the rest of the book you will have to read it to find out what happens in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is certainly one of the best books I have ever read. Although intended for a young audience, I think it certainly can appeal to just about everyone. While the plot is simple in nature, Tolkien does an excellent job of description and character development. A truly great book that will remain a classic for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a very exciting book about Dwarves, and Elves, and Dragons, and so on. Even if you don't like those kinds of books (like me), you may still fell that it keeps you wanting to read more. I am currently reading The Lord of The Rings, but while it's not bad itself, I believe that The Hobbit was much better. Follow Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin Oakenshield as they travel down the road towards the infamous dragon that devoured many of Thorin's friends and family."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book has an excellent plot, excellent characters, excellent everything!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are into hardcore, realistic, real-life stories perhaps you should check out the non-fiction section. However, if you enjoy letting your mind go on a mystical adventure, with no concern for reality this is the book for you. This tells the story of a peaceful, passive young hobbit who, by fate, embarks on a journey with some dwarves who wish to regain their stollen treasure. Tolkien's writing pulls the reader into the story, as he describes the mountains, you actually feel as though you are carefully making your way through the steep, violent mountains. Once again if you are looking to escape reality, and find pure enjoyment and adventure read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a must read for any book lover, especially anyone who also shows an interest in fantasy type worlds. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who loves to live on his own in his own home, goes on an adventure with 13 dwarves across the lands to the misty mountains to claim gold from a dragon named Smaug. Through the journey he and his group encounters things from goblins to trolls to giants, and eventually lives through the epic battle of the five armies.

In other words, cheap cardboard-sandwiched discs of which I personally guarantee that each one will come with more scratches than the behind of a dwarf in a sand-laden speedo. Again - not green as in soft green grass, but green as in the greenbacks the company makes from this type of cut in quality.If a company had pride in its product it would have at least foregone the post consumer content grade recycled paperboard and upgrade to paper sleeves. Or better yet, perhaps a $3 jewel case that holds all 5 discs? The exterior box is certainly large enough for a nice plastic jewel case. Instead it contains a cheap, thin, cardboard book of the discs that takes up all of 1/3 of the interior space. The rest of the box is loaded with a large cardboard insert as filler.These type of (goblin) antics are why people stop buying audio CDs and look for other means to acquire their audio (preferably without the aid of a burglar). I certainly won't buy any more products from AudioGO or BBC Audiobooks without holding the product first. The NPR wood box set of the Hobbit radio drama at least shows some class... and (not an official review) from when I last held the wood box set, I could say that the discs were protected enough that not even scratches from Smaug would be of concern."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The lord of the rings trilogy was much better.

Tolkien writes of an adventurous tale of a little hobbit and some friends. It is set in a fantasy world where good is always at battle with evil. It is the book that starts up the series of stories told by J.R.R Tolkien calles, THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It is a story of one very small creature taking on the greatest challange of his life. The main character is a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Hobbits are well mannered, small and fat creatures. This story is about a jorney which dragged Bilbo out of his hobbit-hole(a place where he is secluded from danger and anything that might harm him. Bilbo;s adventure brought out courage he didn't even know existed. None of his companions believed in him at first because he seemed so small and useless. After Bilbo saved all of their lives, they began to respect him. Throughout the book, Bilbo hets many chances to prove his courage. In one part of the book, Bilbo's companions get in serious trogble with a group of giant spiders. It was Bilbo;s chance to prove he was courages. Bilbo did all he could to help his friends and in the end became a hero. This book shows that everyone has courage somwhere inside of them and they sould try to fingd it.

But the wizard gandolf comes and rather takes him on a frightning, dazziling and thrilling adventure with 15 homeless dwarves to capture a stolen treasure-a treasure stolen by the great dragon smoug-the tire of an entire nation! The dwarves rather dislike Bilbo intill they discover what he is hidding as a secret-a magic ring he found on the trail.

Finally it was Bilbo-who was (if you remember) very refluctant who defeated the great dragon smaug!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Lord of the Rings being Tolkien's masterpiece, The Hobbit often gets overlooked.

I enjoyed it very much.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a struggle between good and evil."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With the new release of the film and because I revisit the Lord Of The Rings books each year I wanted to revisit The Hobbit. It's been a favourite of mine since I was a little girl. We actually read it at school as one of our \\"book list\\" books.The story of Bilbo Baggins is an exciting one. Hobbits don't usually leave the Shire but as Thorin and his dwarves along with Gandalf turn up on Bilbo's door he is encouraged to take an adventure with them. From the minute the book starts I was pulled into the story and found it hard to put the book down.The way Tolkein writes is pure genius. He paints a picture with his writing and Middle Earth, possibly thanks to the films, was so easy to picture. The characters are very easy to like or hate depending on how Tolkein intended them. Bilbo, the hero of the story, is someone that stays with you when you aren't reading and I found myself wanting to read more and find out what was happening.I think it is fair to say that since childhood the books have always been quoted as amongst my favourites. The Hobbit was one of the very first books that made me fall in love with fantasy and even now, 20...... years after my first reading I loved the story as much as I did when I first discovered it. It will stay in my heart probably until the end of my days.If you haven't read the book yet I would highly recommend it to you. If you don't fall in love with Middle Earth like I have I would be highly surprised.\\"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\"I give The Hobbit 5/5."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Absolutly one of the rare books that truly takes you to the world created as if on the adventure yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the Hobbit.

I decided to reread it before the movie adaptions came out to refresh my memory.The story was not as detailed as I remembered it being...I guess my imagination filled in a lot of blanks as a child.Overall, the story is a fast read and at a level that is quite suitable for young adults. The violence in the story is not graphic rather implied. It is not in the Drizzt vain of adventure stories (every sword stike described in key battles). The characters are interesting and well executed given the large number of characters in the story. The dwarves are a bit on the bumbling side which is counter to most of the ways dwarves are represented recently (short, stout highlanders).It is a great read especially on a cold or rainy day! This is a book/story that will last the test of time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who doesn't like it. Classis tale of magic and adventure. Loveable and despicable characters.

Gollum is the person that Bilbo found when the troop is lost in the Orc Kingdom when Bilbo found the one ring to rule them all. Along the way they meet many new and old enemies.I think readers should give this information to every one they know. I love this book because it gives the right word choice for the era like \\" That was a good pull my lads\\" or \\"The sun was shining brilliantly \\". It also gives a very good prologue to the new Lord Of The Rings series that can give the reader much satisfaction .It explains much of the new fables.

I never heard the thing without skipping first parts of the chapters that weren't as important. Last year, in fourth grade, I read the book for a report and loved it even more than before. I am on chapter seven again. The book is about a hobbit who is asked by a wizard and thirteen dwarves to go on an adventure with them to reclaim a lost treasure stolen by the evil dragon Smaug. It takes a lot of courage and adventure to go on the journey to get to the mountain that Smaug lives in and the crew of thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and a wizard have to brave. They eventually get there, though. You should definetly read this wonderful, exiting book if your are a person who loves adventure, excitment, and just plain great writing. If you liked this, I suggest you read the Lord of the Rings--what the Hobbit is leading up to. Those, I am just starting to read. I am loving it on chapter seven. Read that too. GREAT BOOKS!!

Tolkien has the imagination of a 3rd grader, and puts his skills to the paper in one of the best books ever written. Although written decades ago, the fantasy novel still intrigues readers of all kinds. The Hobbit could very well be read by the average middle school student, but also enjoyed by the grown-up that whishes to be once again like a middle school student. Tolkien takes you through the world of Middle-Earth on a journey where no hobbit would normally venture. It is a trek that you will not forget. And like many others, they have taken the trek over and over and over again(you will probably end up reading The Hobbit again and again)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" when I was in 7th grade, it was required reading. The difference between it and other required readings for school was that I couldn't wait to finish this book. I constantly read ahead. Now after seeing \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" I decided that I would read \\"The Hobbit\\" again. It proved to be twice as good the second time around. There were many parts of the book which I had forgotten about, and there were also many parts of the book which helped explain the movie. It is a quick read (I finished in about 3 days), very exciting, and an action packed book. I would recommend that anyone interested in reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" start with this book first. If you like it you will surely like the remaining books. If you do not like it then you should probably not waste your time with the rest of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hobbits are little creatures, only about half your height. They have no need for shoes, because lots of hair grow on their little feet and leathery soles, and they can creep around very quietly without a noise. One particular hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is an ordinary hobbit that lives in a large hobbit-hole in The Hill, and never thought he would have an adventure or wanted one until one beautifully sunny day in April. On this day, while sitting outside, there stood the great wizard, Gandalf! They planned tea for the next day, and before poor Bilbo knew it, there were thirteen dwarfs (not including Gandalf and Bilbo)! Bilbo was so surprised and busy (preparing more tea and food for the dwarfs) that he did not remember that it was his fiftieth birthday the next day. On the day of his birthday, Gandalf and the dwarfs, Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bomber, and Thorin, took him on a quest to retrieve the treasure that the evil dragon, Smaug had stolen. It was a very hard trip there, with little and sometimes no food, lots of horrible situations and enemies including some giant spiders, goblins, wolves, and trolls. In one occurrence, Bilbo finds a golden rings and figures out that it can make him invisible and he uses it to try to escape from many bad situations.This magical fantasy masterpiece is sure to capture your heart and live in your imagination forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a delightful story with much adventure and drama.

If you didn't really understand what was going on, or are wondering why its such a big deal, then do read this book.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; will get your imagination going on all cylinders - so to say. There is so much going on. Lets start with the adventures - a new one unfolds literally every few pages. Have patience and get through the first few pages, especially if you've read any or all of the Harry Potter books. Tolkien's epic is dramatically different from Potter's magic.Then, there's the hero and other characters - each one as exciting, interesting and lifelike as the others. You'll have so much fun just trying to mentally sketch out their personalities.Finally &quot;middle earth&quot; - the environment in which the story is set, cannot get any more interesting and exciting, although it is bleak at times. But, remember its all in the imagination. Every reader will probably imagine the story in a different light. That's the best part - the book's an experience and no two experiences are the same.

I really like this book because it's nothing like them boring adult books where you never get into the subject this book right from the start you are into it. Another reason why I like this story so much is because it has a lot of action and adventure. My third and final reason why I like this book is because it has all the stuff I like, like Dragons, Magic, even Trolls!My most favorite part of this fast-witted book is when the crew is attacked by giant spiders you never knew what was going to happen next! Now, to me there is one part I didn't like and that was when the crew right after the spider confrontation they get captured by wood elves. There is absolutely now action whatsoever in this part.Now the best parts to this story are all in the writing like...the charecteristics of the characters when you first meet them and the setting it actualy makes you think you are there!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is, by far, the best book I've read...period.It begins with Bilbo Baggins, as we all know, enjoying his little home in the side of a hill. Shortly after though, the great Gandalf himself comes tapping on his door followed by his Dwarven Companions. \\"Hobbit's are NOT adventurers\\" all the Hobbits say, though Bilbo pays them no mind as he marches out of his home with his friends on an adventure he wont ever forget. They encounter many dangers like Orcs and Goblins, but nothing compares to the being they will encounter near the end of their journey...The Hobbit is one of Tolkiens best works. Being the prequel, it is essential that he gets everything done right...and he does with a vengeance! Everything about this book is perfect, from the descriptive battles to the cute jokes hidden in the story along the way. Tolkien appeals to both the strong Fantasy readers and even those that are just beginning. If you are wanting to get into the Fantasy world, this is the book to begin with. It is very easy to read to any age, and would be a perfect bedtime story for the little ones.Hobbit should be read by those young and old, and receives my rating of 5 stars without any problems."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The artwork in this book just floored me when I first saw it.

It's filled with mystery, suspence, action and adventuer. You will not be let down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien was published on September 21st of 1937. It is the success of this book that paved the way for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Hobbit\\" is definitely geared towards younger readers, and it received favorable reviews from papers in the U.K. and the U.S., and it was nominated for the Carnegie Medal, as well as the New York Herald Tribune Children's Spring Book Festival Award in 1938.\\"The Hobbit\\" is often over-shadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and this is especially true when one treats \\"The Hobbit\\" as the prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". To consider it as such is both fair and unfair. It is fair, because clearly the events in \\"The Hobbit\\" took place prior to, and are key to the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and of course there are common characters in both stories. However, it is also not fair in that \\"The Hobbit\\" clearly was written for a younger audience, and even when reading one of the revised editions, where some passages were altered to better fit with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", the overall tone of the work is much lighter. There was a brief attempt by Tolkien to rewrite \\"The Hobbit\\" in the same style, but he soon gave it up because it destroyed what was so good about the original. As a result, it would be better to consider \\"The Hobbit\\" as the children's telling of the events which took place prior to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and not attempt to hold it to the same standard.Another thing that people have noted about the two stories is that at a high-level outline the two stories are very similar. The adventures both start in the Shire and are initiated by Gandolf, they travel to Rivendell, they go through caves and have to deal with the goblins/orcs therein, they meet elves on the other side, there is a huge war between numerous armies, and of course they return to the Shire to find things changed that they have to put right. Of course, that is an overly simple way to look at either of the two novels, especially \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", even though it is true on the surface, but it is an interesting observation.As beings that are roughly half the height of a man, Hobbits make an ideal hero for a children's story, as it gives them a hero with whom they can identify. The story has a fair amount of humor in it, and a light-hearted feel through most of it, though certainly as an adventure there is a fair amount of peril, whether from the trolls, worgs (wolves), goblins, spiders, and even the wood elves, not to mention the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Despite being accessible to younger readers, older readers can still enjoy \\"The Hobbit\\" as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A true classic. After recently slogging through most of the pre-Hobbit works (e.g. the Silmarillion, Chidren of Hurin, etc.) it was refreshing to re-visit the easy-to-read Hobbit. The book runs through the story of how Bilbo Baggins ended up with the One Ring around which the events of The Lord of the Rings revolve - though it really is a small plot element when compared with the adventures the characters have in enchanted woods, dark caves, dragon hordes, elven dungeons, and battlefields that occur in the rest of the book. The book gives a wonderful introduction to Tolkien's universe and weaves a spellbinding tapestry of sorcery and adventure that provides a great prologue to Tolkien's greatest work. A short and easy read (especially compared to Tolkien's other works) that I've added to my short list of books that I read again and again. A wonderful afternoon escape that almost everyone will love...let's just hope the upcoming pair of movies does it justice."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book full of fantasy and adventure.

Owned paperbacks since the early 90's.Love this fantacy fiction. This was my first fantasy sci-fi book I have read. It had the perfect amount of fantasy to where I didn't feel like I was being assaulted by the make believe. Tolkien's story focused on the plot and kept the fantasy on the background.Own the paperbacks but I thought I'd buy this ebook edition too.Audio doesn't work but it's worth it for the other special editions added to book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was intended for a young and innocent - but not naive - audience. The tone of the story is lighthearted, yet it holds treasures of imagination and character development well worth exploring.Though I am no Tolkien scholar, like any thoughtful reader who compares this story to his later work, the Lord of the Rings (of which The Hobbit is supposed to be a prequel) the differences in the Middle Earth of The Hobbit versus LOTR are several, but not irreconcilable. Hobbits are, for the most part, as hobbits should be and are expected to be; when tossed (or dragged as in Bilbo's case) into adventure they prove themselves quite worthy of the label \\"hero\\" in the most unexpected ways. But you'll not find orcs; here they are goblins. Elves are very lightly sketched, being either rather silly as they sit in trees and sing la-la ditties, or as in Mirkwood where they are more ominous, magical folk who toss unsuspecting travelers into dungeons without a by-your-leave.It's Middle Earth in its infancy, in my opinion, but nonetheless has special charm. I enjoyed the magical \\"talking\\" birds and the shape-shifting land of Beorn. The dragon is deliciously evil, though his part short-lived.There are powerful characterizations. Bilbo's growth into a true Heroic type is treated honestly, showing both his errors in judgment and self-serving tendencies, as well as his golden moments. We watch Thorin's descent into greed with a clenched heart of sympathy and horror as the fairytale devolves into all-out war among races. Death and destruction are dealt with head-on and realistically, and the reader feels the impact of it.The first time I read it, I barely noticed that there is a total lack of female characters in this story. As to why, who knows? I doubt Tolkien was being mysogynistic and more likely, the product of his own time - as I am of mine, when we do expect to see more heroic females in literature.Overall, it's a gem of a story, a modern classic for good reason, and time well-spent for the lover of Fantasy. And if you want to understand Bilbo's finding of the One Ring, you need to read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is indeed a great book and there's no need to write a review of the author's work. However, you may find useful short (subjective) list of information on the edition with ISBN: 978-0-618-96863-3.- The paper wrapping looks perfect to me, the wrapping designed by the author is definitely something a fan must have. The picture is printed in color and a short history of its previous appearances is included in the book. What makes me little anxious is relatively fragile paper - if you want it to stay so nice, you should handle it very carefully.- Book contains two maps printed in black+blue, their paper is semi-glossy and looks resistant.- The paper of the book is appropriate, neither too thick nor too thin, it has smooth surface so it is a pleasure to read and turn the pages. The color of the paper is yellowish.- The book contains all author's illustrations that ever belonged to the title (according to the book's preface). Some of them are printed in black and white on the regular paper, some of them are included in color on the glossy white paper.I find this book to exactly match the expectations of a Tolkien fan - all in all, The Hobbit was meant to be children's book and that is how it looks and feels like."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the prequel to J.R.R.

I devoured the rest of the book (and the trilogy afterwards) and have been re-reading them all ever since (I stopped counting after my 45th time through!).

Everyone else seemed to love them and I kind of felt left out, so I asked my cousin, a big fan, to explain them to me. He told me to go read The Hobbit.I gave this book a concerted effort, and after plodding through for its 300 pages, I still didn't like it and I'm still pretty confused. The hobbit and these elf guys get together, wander around for most of the book, fight off a few evil things and come back home. I think the reason so many men like this stuff whereas it's harder for some women to get into it is because this is the ultimate appeal to men's hunter instincts. They love stuff like this, chasing around things and fighting things and going off wandering in the woods. I guess I'm the woman who would rather be back gathering berries and looking after the kids. If you don't like Lord of the Rings, chances are you won't like the books either. To all the girls out there who just don't &quot;get&quot; Lord of the Rings, you're not alone!That being said, I'm glad I stuck with this book and read it to the end, if only because so many other books, TV shows, even everyday conversations refer to it. I am reading Stephen King's The Stand right now and he mentions The Hobbit. In fact he says The Hobbit inspired him to write The Stand. It's important to have a knowledge of some of the most influential books out there.

So I repeat: If you can, don't read this novel!:-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo!:-(&quot;BOO FOR YOU HOBBIT!&quot;&quot;DIE HOBBITS, DIE!&quot;&quot;DEATH TO HOBBITS!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I borrowed this book from the library as an audiobook, read by Rob Inglis, 10 CD disks. Unabridged by \\"Recorded Books Presents\\".I have seen (and liked) the Lord of the Rings Movies, but I have never read any of the books. I heard that the Hobbit movie was coming out soon, so I thought it would be a good idea to read the book now, before the movie comes out. Apart from the movies, I didn't know anything about this story. It was definitely all-new to me.When I first started listening to it I said \\"Oh GAWD, is he really going to sing and recite poetry for 5 minutes straight\\"? Really, I wasn't sure why there was this need for singing and poetry, and it was boring, and felt endless, and it didn't really progress the story along. The story itself was a bit slow. The narrator was talking about how EVERY character was feeling and I remember asking myself \\"is that really necessary?\\" Why go into so much detail? Really. It started out quite dull.Then as it went along it started getting better. Once I realized that every creature and animal in the story could talk, including spiders and eagles. I also realized that this was a children's story. A really sophisticated, long, serious children's story, but it's definitely easy enough for 10 and 11 year old kids to understand. Plus, there is a certain amount of silliness, and strange word use (I kept asking \\"is this a REAL word?\\" even though I never looked them up), so I think kids will like it.There is also a lot of talk about FOOD - whether they are hungry, and want to be home with the hot teapot or a creature is planning to eat them - it seems like any animal can eat you and you can eat it. I thought that was strange, because ,I wouldn't want a spider to eat me, (not that it could, but still). It was strange that anyone could be PREY to anyone else, but oh well, that was part of the imagination of the story.Once their quest really got going, it wasn't so bad. They go through many lands and much turmoil to get to the end of their quest. It seems like they're always ALMOST killed (and/or eaten), but thankfully, luck helps them escape. Plus, it's in this story that Bilbo the hobbit finds the magic ring of invisibility, even though Sauron doesn't come looking for it.I think it helped to have watched the movies first because it really helped me see the characters of the dwarfs, the elves, the men, and of course the hobbits.I do like that the story doesn't end at the mountain (if you read it you'll know what I mean), but that the authors tells you what happens 5 days after, a few weeks after, and almost a year (or many years) after. It's nice to see that after all that hard work and danger and struggle, there is peace after all. It gives a good ending to the story.One of the things Tolkein does that I don't remember seeing in other children's books, is he talks directly to the audience, almost through the voice of the reader. For example, \\"And then, well, I'll tell you what will happen next, but right now we have to go back to _______ 's story.\\" So if a parent was reading this story to their child, it sounds like the PARENT is saying that they'll have to stop.Inglis did a good job reading the story. He did many of the accents, and they were quite different, and I think he did them well. He also actually SANG all the songs in the story, and for a narrator to do that, I think he should get bonus points!Would I recommend this book? Sure, just to a younger audience, one that has patience to get through it. It's not a short book. It took me a week and a half to listen to it, so I think it will take at least 2 or 3 weeks to read through on your own. But I think they'll like it.For adults, it's okay, not quite there, but not terrible.Am I glad I read this before the movie came out? Sure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have never actually read the book but I will be reading it later this year. My sister told me that it is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit, a creature unlike anything in our world. He is small and furry but acts quite human. He lives in a little house in the side of a hill and he treasures his home, his quiet, his regular meals, and his boring life. Then one day an ancient magician, Gandalf, appears at his door. He starts Bilbo on a fantastic adventure.This adventure mainly has to do with a group of dwarves who used to live in a fantastic kingdom underneath a huge mountain far away, where they would mine for gold and precious gems and turn them into lovely works of art. At the height of their power, a dragon swooped in, killed the dwarves inside of the mountain, scattered the rest, and took up residence inside the mountain, hoarding all of the gold and gems for itself.One of the dwarves who shows up on Bilbo's doorstep after Gandalf's visit is the grandson of the king under the mountain. He is determined to get his rightful kingdom back, by journeying to the mountain and getting rid of the dragon.Gandalf tells the dwarves that Bilbo is a brilliant burglar and will make an excellent addition to their traveling company, and the dwarves bring the timid creature along with some reluctance. Over the course of their long journey, though, as the mountain gets closer and the dangers get worse, the company learns to respect Bilbo more, and he learns what he is truly capable of achieving.This story contains lots of plot twists and dangerous situations. I can also appreciate that much of today's fantasy has built off of what Tolkien wrote. However, I hated the story. I found it mind-numbingly dull. There was little character development, especially in the dwarves. They had no individual personalities, which made me unconcerned for their well-being. I thought Bilbo was one of the most irritatingly weak and whiny characters in all of literature, which made me even less concerned about this story having a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is confusing and pointless.

However I'm just reaching page 250 in this book and though everyone promised me it would get interesting I'm still waiting.I find Bilbo an interesting character but quite frankly he didn't pull at me like characters such as Harry Potter and Novalee Nation.

The _ONLY_ flaw, which isn't really a flaw, is that he makes Mirkwood a gloomy and spooky place, and he makes the wood elves complete idiots (I LIKE ELVES!). Well, if you want to know exactly how, and who, brought the ring out of Smeagol (Also known as Gollum)'s hand, you will find out in this book. The main character in this book is Bilbo Baggins, who is also half Took; he gets confused, and two sides of him speak about adventure, since the Took side was born for adventure, and the Baggins side just wants to drink hot tea in front of a fire-place. None of the fellowship is mentioned EVER in the Hobbit, though I would say this book is better than the Lord of the Rings series (in my opp.), so I would suggest you read all four books. Me?

The Hobbit, being the prelude to the Lord of the Rings, is mostly the story of how Bilbo Baggins aquires the Ring of Power from the mistake of the murderous Gollum. But there is another \\"main\\" story. This book recounts the adventure of Bilbo, in the service of Gandalf and 13 dwarves, in which he must kill Smaug the dragon and steal back his hoard. Read this wonderful story, which is Tolkien's best work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit, Tolkien does a magnificent job creating a world of characters in using indirect characterization. Tolkien also uses vivid imagery to give us an idea of what this world is like. Also, Tolkien use of foil through Thorin and Bilbo helps readers further understand characters. The Hobbit is strengthened through the use of the indirect characterization, the vivid imagery, and the use of foil. The best example of the characterization is when we first meet Bilbo, and when Bilbo is described to us in the end of the book. In the beginning Bilbo is described as quiet and reticent. But by the end of the book, we see through Bilbo's actions what he is really like, which is courageous, brave, and does what always is right. Tolkien also helps readers further understand the characters by using foil through Bilbo and Thorin. The characteristics of the two are completely opposite, Thorin being brave, doing what he likes, and confrontational, while Bilbo is timid, reticent, and taciturn. Tolkien helps readers imagine what the world is like by telling us what each land is like when the dwarfs and Bilbo crossed the mountains. Tolkien basically paints out the entire scene for the readers making them feel like they were just a few feet away from the other characters. All three of this literary devices together help strengthen the story. So that the reader doesn't feel like they are just reading, but that they are there in the book and know exactly what the characters are like."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed this novel from beginning to end. The beginning was a little hard to read because there was a lot of description, but after that it jumps right into the adventure of the plot. The action is very suspensful, and a lot of diverse characters are met throughout the adventure. The book really created a variety of vast images and I was able to stay enticed from beginning to end. The main character Bilbo is easily comparable to a regular person. If you are into fantasy adventure then The Hobbit is a great read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Imagine sitting down, picking up you childrens bedtime story and not being able to put it down untill the end.

Tolkien has a tendency to make everything evil or good, with the exception of gollum and the hobbits(the most interesting characters). Thus, the characters have no depth and the places are boring. He describes every bush too. It drives me crazy. It is like this:And then the party came to a knoll. A more wonderful knoll the hobbit had never known, and his heart was filled with joy. Then after the beautiful knoll, the small party came to a plateau. The plateau was very evil. Dark evil things fluttered about and bla bla bla.....It really is garbage, but the hobbit is saved because it is funny and ventures into the gray area. Tolkein never understood the fanatics of his books, and neither do I. They truly are crazy. It is not that Tolkein is so bad, it is just there are so many incredible books to be caught up in this series. The appendix is stupid too.

I don't know if people read these with a preconceived notion that for their time these books were ahead of their time and convince themselves that they are great, or if they genuinely like them. However, I don't really see any difference in the writing style or the storyline than many other fantasy books that are geared toward gradeschool, and they fall well short of modern Fantasy writers, so there's no comparison there. And after The Hobbit, I tried to start The Lord of the Rings series and couldn't get through the first book.The story dragged, the characters were great, but didn't do anything new and different from what I have already read, and for some reason I just don't have a soft spot for these to give them kudos for historical value.

Other Hobbits found the Tooks less respectable than the other side of Blibo's family. The ohter hobbits loathe going on adventures, in fact they hate going anywhere very far from home.(Adventures make Hobbits late for dinner). One thing you should know about Hobbits is that they really like to eat and sleep. They have about six meals a day. I only gave this two stars because it seemed like the author was in a hurry so he ended the book. Like he really had to go to the bathroom, so he ended the book as fast as possible. It also seemed like the author got really into the story and when he came to the end(Last four chapters) he didn't know how to end it. I am hopeful for the other books in the seires.

Tolkien, is a fantasy adventure about a group of dwarves going on an adventure with the assistance of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. The wizard who suggested Bilbo as the last member of the team is named Gandalf. Gandalf chose Mr. Baggins because he is no ordinary Hobbit, he is a burglar. Hobbits personify small people, roughly half the size of humans, with hair on their feet, round bellies, and love food and comfort. This is why Mr. Baggins is such a successful burglar, noone would suspect it from him. The adventure that the Hobbit and thirteen dwarves embark on is to a land called Lonely Mountain, the home of the evil dragon Smaug. The fourteen plan to reclaim the dwarves' lost treasure that Smaug has taken. Along the path to Lonely Mountain are many dangerous obsticles they have to avoid. They are captured or almost killed by trolls, goblins, wood elves, spiders, wargs, a Gollum, and Smaug. During the close encounter with the Gollum, Mr. Baggins finds a golden ring on the ground. He finds out after the Gollum's riddle contest that it is no ordinary ring, for it has the power to make whoever wears it, invisible. This ring comes in handy throughout the rest of the book during their later close encounters. In the end of the book, the original fourteen reach Smaug the Dragon and......you'll have to find out for yourself. The main character, Bilbo Baggins, symbolizes a big adventure for such a small character. He symbolizes that no matter how small and worthless you or others think you are, if you really try you will be able to accomplish anything. The theme of the book is teamwork, the thirteen dwarves would never have been able to accomplish what they did if Mr. Baggins didn't accompany them. The narration is told as a third person point of view, \\"Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was.\\" The tone of the book was told in a much warmer and more humorous way than most fantasy books that I've read. This is shown during the whole adventure, \\"Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me!\\" The Hobbit is one of the best books I have ever read. Other books I would recommend would be all four \\"Harry Potter\\" books. I would recommend \\"The Hobbit\\" to anyone who likes magical and imaginary tales. Never during the book could I say that it was boring or too long. \\"The Hobbit\\" was so good that it has lead me into reading the next book in the series, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This piece was enlightening to read because I have just recently watched, &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; and I didn't understand it very well.

The story line keeps reader's in anticipation as to what is going to happen next. This book gave the before look at how the hobbits lived and more in depth about Frodo. It explains the living styles of the hobbits(like what they enjoyed doing to their work habits for a day's time.

So finally, the time came when I was old enough to want to read the book. I picked up the book and by the time I finished it, I wanted to read LOTR. The Hobbit is truly a masterpiece, for all ages, and is not corny or just for kids. I beleive that any adult would enjoy this book as much as I did. It's a great experience, and it makes me want to beleive that the whole thing is true and that I could round up some dwarves and go on an adventure to steal from a dragon!...for, that is what Bilbo Baggins did...Now I am reading LOTR, and am I big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I saw the first two movies now. I suggest you follow my path and read all of the books. Someday, I hope to read The Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit takes place in a fantasyland called Middle-Earth. The story is about a hobbit that goes on an adventure with a group of dwarves to steal their treasure back from a dragon who stole it from the dwarves a long time before this. The main character is Bilbo, a hobbit that lives in the Shire. Other main characters are Thorin, leader of the dwarves and heir to the gold that a dragon named Smug stole from his family, and Gandalf, a wizard that added Bilbo to the group and helped them as much as he could on their adventure. The story is about Bilbo, who gets stuck with an adventure being a thief. Which is funny because he has no clue how to be a thief or even to steal from someone. He and a group of 13 dwarves lead by Thorin go on an adventure and steal the dwarve's gold from a dragon. The whole trip across the mountains led them to many little adventures, with trolls and goblins and other creatures of Middle-Earth. My favorite character is Gandalf because he is very smart and knows everything about everything (well pretty much, anyway).At one time I was much like Bilbo. Not really afraid to have any adventures, just saw no reason for them. Then I got to High School and that all changed. Much like how Bilbo did, with a friend showing him the way. Gandalf started him on his adventure and a friend named Bobby started me on mine. Bobby taught me that taking a risk every once in a while wouldn't do much harm and that changed my whole life around. Much like how Bilbo met Gandalf, I met my friend. Bobby was a friend of one of my family members. Just like Gandalf was Took's friend, who is one of Biblo's family members. Right when I met him he began changing me. He showed me many adventures and changed my life much like Gandalf did for Bilbo.When I first opened the book I thought it might be a little strange, but the book was amazing. It is now my favorite book. It is very hard to pick a favorite part in this book because there is so many, but if I had to pick, the part where Bilbo starts killing all the spiders and names his sword Sting. Tolkien writes so well I could see this part taking place in my head. And if I had to change one thing I would change the lack of information. I want to know more about Beorn and the Necromancer.I think if someone likes to read; they will like this book. It is so much more then a fantasy, more like a life lesson. But you have to be willing to let your imagination go.

This book is a classic example of great fantasy, with the elves, hobbits, dwarves, goblins, men, dragons, and much more.

This collector's edition is well built with solid binding and a sturdy slipcase. It has nice, large type and great illustrations. The book looks great sitting on my bookshelf, and it's even more of a pleasure to read it. My next purchase will be the Lord of the Rings collector's edition...then my library will be fully upgraded!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's hard to write a review about a classic like The Hobbit. You can't help but be awed by the history and literary significance of the books (and I include both The Hobbit and the trilogy that follows when I say this) upon which so much of epic fantasy literature is now based. Everything from the heroes quest to the world building, from the wizards and dragons to the goblins and elves scream fantasy to you and you can't help but realize that this was one of the first, and that definitely gives you pause and something to think about.Everyone knows the story of Bilbo Baggins. The poor Hobbit gets caught up in a quest that he embarks on with a little help from a wizard (Gandalf) and the adventures that unfold as this hired burglar journeys with thirteen dwarves to face a dragon that has conquered their home. Though initially reluctant and timid, Bilbo comes into his own as he journeys with the dwarves facing trolls, goblins, whargs, spiders, elves and more on the way to facing the evil dragon Smaug.With the help of his sword Sting and a ring that he picks up in Gollum's cave he soon becomes a formidable hobbit indeed, and also soon finds that the timid hobbit from under the hill will end up deciding the fate of an epic battle as five armies come to meet on the the slopes of the Lonely Mountain.I loved this book! The details, the storytelling, the narrators voice, the songs, all of it was just so readable and enjoyable and a very comforting read to snuggle up with on a cold January day. I would recommend this book to people young and old, and especially to any and all fans of fantasy.Whether you are reading is as part of the LOTR story, as a piece of fantasy's history, or as an introduction to the world of epic fantasy, I think you will enjoy reading The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is my first Kindle book, and probably the first 'proper' dead wood book I ever read! I cant think of a story that has drawn me in as much as The Hobbit, and after seventy years it remains the best fantasy book ever written in my humble opinion. Sure the Lord of the Rings trilogy is fantastic, but The Hobbit is a far less challenging and better paced read, written in Tolkiens fantastic language!Over half way through now, I just dont know what to read next, is there a better book out there?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I got this book for my father for Christmas. He had the same one when we were kids and had always wanted another copy after losing the first one. I found it here and ordered it through one of the marketplace sellers. It was the exact same edition from my childhood. The illustrations are beautiful and match the cartoon movie version that came out at the same time. The book was in fair condion. No dust jacket, loose binding and a little yellow but, because it was so hard to find I found it to be worth it. Other copies of the book were selling for several hundred dollars. My father was very pleased."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"*** 3 stars FOR THE AUDIOBOOK NARRATED BY ROB INGLIS:I purchased this audiobook version of the Hobbit for a road trip my husband and I made recently as he had never read the book(!), and, with the movie version coming out, I liked the idea of reacquainting myself with the tale.I was initially pleased that the narrator was British, as I have a fondness for the accent and the diction, finding it generally more rich than that of American readers. Sadly, that approbation did not last long. Granted, the reading of this story, with its many and varied characters, and many songs and poems, is a daunting task. Unfortunately, I found the narrator's soft, somnolent drone more suited to a bedtime story than an adventure tale, and I even dozed while driving! In addition, I found the pronunciation of the dwarves' names to be odd, and some of the voices to be not as I would have expected, most notably Beorn.Worst of all were the attempts at singing the various songs. It started with the warbling rendition of the delightful \\"That's what Bilbo Baggins hates/So carefully, carefully with the plates!\\", and concluded with a ghastly interpretation of one of my favorite song/poems \\"The Road Goes Ever On\\", the latter which was so awful I actually had to turn off the audiobook a couple of times to seethe before being able to listen to the entire thing.The best thing I can say for this is that it is unabridged narration, and it is better than the BBC dramatization (reviewed below since some quirk in Amazon can't distinguish between these audiobooks for review purposes). Perhaps with the movie spurring a renewed interest in this classic story a better audio interpretation will become available.** Two stars for the BBC DRAMATIZATION of the Hobbit: A dismal rendering from start to finish.For those of you who own and enjoy the stellar Lord of the Rings dramatization with Ian Holm, Bill Nighy, etc., you will unquestionably be, as I was, astonishingly disappointed at this dramatization of The Hobbit. From the cheezy, tinny opening horns, to the horrible voice of Gandalf (sounds more like an effeminate villian in a 1920's melodrama), to the absence of some of the charming passages that made the book colorful (only adventuristic aspects seem to have been included), to the jumble of narrator vs. Bilbo vs. some other character speaking all at once or on top of one another, to the mispronunciation of character names (Thorin sounds like \\"tureen\\", and Gollum is \\"gol-oom\\"...huh?!), this adaptation is, as they say, \\"one hot mess\\" and best avoided, especially for those of you who expect it to be on par with the LOTR radio drama aforementioned."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I needed to reread this before seeing the movie.

As I understand it, Peter Jackson's sourced ancillary material to stretch this one book into a film trilogy, so I wanted to be certain of the legitimate origin first. It doesn't disappoint on this visit. That's the best word to describe it. Coming back to this warm, familiar tale is like visiting a friend. Who lives in a hole in the side of a hill.

I can usually read a book in a couple of days but this one took me over a week; and it's not that long of a book. I thought the characters were a lot of fun and Bilbo is wonderful little hobbit. However, some of the descriptions of the journey were a bit tedious.Overall, I'm glad I finally read The Hobbit.

The story follows one Bilbo Baggins in his wonderfull adventure. He is enterrupted from his normal life by some Dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf who want him to go with them to battle a dragon named Smaug. He eventually agrees and follows them on thier journey to the Dwarves to the moutain they once called home before the dragon lived there. On the way Bilbo encounters goblins, spiders, orcs, wolves, and even a former hobbit himself in Gollum. It's in this meeting Bilbo finds what would later become the most important thing in Middle Earth, THE RING.In a match of wits Bilbo out smarts Gollum and escapes from his clutches. Funny enough the thing that warned him of gollum was a sword he had found earlier that glows when things lurk about. Yet after his escape a reuniting with the others only leads to an attack from giant spiders, and being help captive by some elves. But after he manages to get out of those little binds he must now face Smaug.After entering threw a secret passage he usses the ring to hide from the dragon, which eventually leads to the dragon attacking the town down below untill he is hit with an arrow in a weak spot and killed. Things are over right, wrong now comes a war of giagantic proportions. Humans, dwarves, goblins, wolves, and birds all end up in the fight. and after it is all said and done Bilbo returnes home, RING included."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think that The Hobbit was a great book! JRR Tolkien does a great job at keeping the plot moving and keeping the reader's attention. I liked how he constantly threw in unexpected events. For instance, when I thought that the book had come to an end, he added an extra part which kept me reading. I also liked how he wrote in some of his own comments about what Bilbo Baggins (the main character) felt and how he took the time to describe each and every one of the many dwarves one by one.One of my favorite characters in the book was Gandalf the Wizard. JRR Tolkien does a great job of describing Gandalf as wise, trustworthy, and powerful. He was the \\"glue\\" that held the group together and was always giving them advice and helping them get out of tight spots.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and science fiction. It tells a lot about what happened before the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I'd read the Lord of the Rings books before this one and after I'd read The Hobbit, I thought that it was just as good as those books, if not better!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitBy.Alex TaylorThe main characters are Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the Great dragon Samsung.

Tolkein, is a book for everyone. It has comedy, jokes and riddles along with suspense and adventure for those who seek a good page turner. Tolkein tells you how the hobbit, Bilbo, came of the ring and had thirteen other companions to help find what the ring could do. It tells of their adventures against the giant spiders, evil wolves, orcs and much, much more. Even though he first wishes that he was home by his warm fire and on his soft bed, this adventure changes his life and the lives of his companions. I myself have never read a book like THE HOBBIT, and hope to have the pleasure of talking to more of the fans of this book because in my opinion it is one of the worlds' finest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" takes place before the Lord of the Rings series. It is centered on a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is the Uncle of the Hero in the Lord of the Rings, Frodo. \\"The Hobbit\\" is about a group of traveling dwarves, the leader of which goes by the name of Thorin. Him and his band of 12 Dwarfs are on a quest to get back the treasure that belongs to them. Thorin's ansester by the name of Thror was known as the king of the mountains because him and his people discovered a great whealth in a mountain range that was thought unexplorable. One day an evil dragon by the name of Smaug came to Thror's kingdom and recklessly destroys all of Thror's people and steals the treasures that he worked so hard to obtain. Thorin and his men are looking for a Hobbit to join them on their quest to use him as a burglar since he has \\"Took\\" blood in him. (The Tooks were notoriously known for their spirit of adventure that most Hobbits lacked.) After some convincing from the Dwarves and his Wizzard friend Gandalf, he accepts the invitation. He must endure many hardships as he travles the monster infested land, fight off massive spiders, escape a 500 year old Hobbit that is deformed by the power of the \\"Ring\\", and slay an ancient Dragon that not a kingdom of men were powerless to stop!\\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R Tolkien is a national classic and a book that has inspired all of those who read it. It is a book that combines the excitment of a fantasy adventure with a massive amount of suspending events to keep one occupied. Add the touch of comedy and you get one of the finest books ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The style is very different from what I'm used to, but it worked! Tolkien writes somewhat light-hearted, almost like he's sitting down with you telling a story. And the story is excellent. He goes into more detail about hobbits and elves and their societies than you get in the LOTR movies. Bilbo Baggins is so hesitent to go on this adventure with Gandolf and the dwarves (Hobbits aren't supposed to have adventures), but the more situations he gets into, the more inner strength and creativity he finds. The adventures through the Mirkwood and the escape from the Wood Elves were thrilling. The description of the Mirkwood was done well and you get a good feel how dark and forboding the place is. Tolkien really brought the characters alive. The Battle of the Five Armies was more an overview than a detailed fight. Still it was really good and if they ever make a movie out of The Hobbit it will be one of the greatest movie battle scenes ever. Now I can't wait to check out the LOTR novels."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is absolutely incredible. Tolkien truly is a spectacular storyteller.

Hobbit are very small people that look very similar to us except they have large feet. Bilbo considers himself a treasure seeker and this is how he got hooked up with Gandalf the Gray and a group of 13 dwarves. The dwarves needed a fourteenth person for their journey and Gandalf recommended Bilbo. Gandalf the Gray is a very old traveling wizard that is known by many people. Gandalf was friends with several of Bilbo's ancestors and Bilbo was very familiar with him. The dwarves work endlessly underground looking for treasures in the Misty Mountains. The dwarves needed to get rid of a dragon and Bilbo and Gandalf were going to help. The book describes the events before The Fellowship of the Ring,so, the most exciting part to me was the capturing or the Ring from Gollum. The story concluds with Bilbo being rich in gold and being admired by other hobbits for his great adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the second time I've read the Hobbit but the first time I have owned it.

I was excited to listen to the BBC Radio version of the Hobbit because not only do I love the story, I love listening to great stories while driving in my car, which is why I own several audio books. This version of The Hobbit was very poorly executed. The voices were sometimes whispers and sometimes too loud, the accents were unbearable, and the music was too loud during some points and just plain awful. I honestly could not force myself to listen to any more of it once I had gotten through the first two discs. I feel bad for anyone who listens to this and has not previously read The Hobbit.

Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.\\"Growing up in the back country, I frequently slipped away in the afternoons to hold tadpoles in my hands at the pond or to run through the woods and crawl into the hollow beneath an ancient and dead tree, pretending I was hiding from giant birds, the wind from whose wings might have knocked over my parents' house. Or I would climb the hill and look out on the peaks of the Cascades, snowy and massive against the sky. What child has not dreamed of going somewhere far over the misty mountains cold?And what adult has not experienced brief moments of nostalgia and wonder -- of considering whether it might, after all, not be a good idea to dash from one's house or one's office without hat or handkerchief, to go slay some dragon or find a treasure? And what adult had not learned, as Bilbo does, the high cost of an adventure not taken and the high cost of an adventure pursued? Or come home at the end of a long journey or a fierce project to realize, as if for the first time, just how sweet a thing home can be?More than just a children's book, The Hobbit takes us \\"there and back again,\\" into the adventure we long for and back again to our own hearth only after we've been provoked to reconsider both the costs and the rewards of going across the Water, of stepping outside one's home onto roads whose end we can't see.It's a beautiful novel.Also, the dragon is quite good.Dragons in stories don't often live up to our expectations, except perhaps in Pern. But this one is quite satisfying.If you haven't read this before, you're in for a treat. If you have, drop a comment below and celebrate with me. This book has quite a venerable age now!

And there was a little boredom with the denoument, which is the quiet relaxed winding down of the book plot after the dramatic climax, which I think is one of the most satisfying parts of reading The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings but which my child did not yet appreciate.The only parts that I skipped were the many references to smoking pipe tobacco, which is portrayed as a positive pastime. I am not telling anyone what they should or should not do, it is just that in my family my spouse is trying, so far unsuccessfully to quit, I am an ex-smoker and my six year old is starting to pick up on the anti-smoking campaign, and saying such things as \\"smoking makes you sick.\\" I am beginning to open up a conversation about personal choice and trying to be a good person yourself and not judge other people but I just did not want to deal with the topic at the 9 pm reading time with a sleepy six year old.

Tolkien.After reading these books, i found that the Hobbit was truly my favorite. The Hobbit was written for the entertainment and pleasure of children, and it seemed to do just that. It is full of adventure, action, and imagination. It is easy to follow and very hard to put down once your expedition.

Once they have reached their destination, they must take back their old home and treasures from the evil clutches of a mighty dragon, who goes by the name of Smaug.On the journey, Bilbo and the dwarves encounter all sorts of villains and obstacles. They do not traveled very far when they stumble upon a group of trolls. A combination of Gandalf's wizardry and Bilbo's burglary land the group out of harm's way, enabling them to continue on their way towards the treasure. This is not the only time you get to meet all the wonderful new creatures within the land of Middle Earth. On their way, Bilbo and his companions meet a kingdom of wood elves, a nest of giant spiders, a man who is also an ancient bear, and a strange, devious creature by the name of Gollum. Tolkien sure has a way with words in this book as he describes all of the new places and creatures that his characters encounter.Throughout the entire book, Bilbo and his accomplices find many different problems to over come and people to befriend. The soon-to-premiere film that is to be based on the Hobbit, should be very interesting. The animation that was made earlier to reenact the book lacked in profession, and by making the book into a movie, you will be able to better understand the novel and be closer to the adventure then you could have thought.The Lord of the Rings trilogy was very detailed and interesting, but not quite the reading material for children, or people with short attention spans. The movies help the reader visualize the new characters and lands that the books contains. The movies also, in my opinion, are much better then the books, because they keep you inthralled. The books are much too tedious and long for my liking, while the movies cover the main points and give you the adventure and action in a way that everyone can experience.In conclusion, the Hobbit is the only book worth reading, and if you are interested in learning about the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you should just watch the movies and save yourself a lot of time and headache."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"****************************SPOILER ALERT****************************SPOILER ALERT*******************************************Before Frodo, there was Bilbo, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. He is the Hobbit who led the Dwarves to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim their treasure from the dragon named Smaug. Bilbo is middle aged and resides in a clean, warm burrow dug into the side of a hill (the place is called \\"The Shire\\", home to many hobbits). In the beginning of the story Bilbo is a very weak character. He is easily frightened, and very shy (one of the conflicts, but I'll get to that later on in the review). Bilbo is also a Hobbit. Hobbits are known for their skills in thievery and spying. The Hobbits are very small creatures (they can only grow up to three feet... if they're lucky) with big feet, covered by tops of thick hair. They are very simple, and never wish to partake in very exciting activities. A very common profession found in their lives is gardening. Some of the other important characters are Gandalf; he is the wizard that accompanies Bilbo and the dwarves on their quest. Thorin Oakenshield is son of the king of the dwarves who were driven from the Lonely Mountain. Smaug is the dragon of the Lonely Mountain who hordes the treasure he stole. Gollum is a slimy creature that was born a Hobbit but had the ring too long; this is the character that Bilbo steals the ring from. Bard is the archer that kills Smaug.I'm not going to go into depths with the story, but I'll give a brief summary. Bilbo enjoys his simple and peaceful life, but all this changes by a simple knock on the door, a surprise visit by the wizard Gandalf. To Bilbo's surprise, Gandalf has arrived with a company of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield. They are embarking on a journey to recover lost treasure (from the town of men \\"Dale\\") that is guarded by the dragon Smaug, at the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf has decided, much to Bilbo's chagrin, that he will make an excellent addition to the team and Bilbo is going to play the role of a burglar. As they start on their way, Bilbo has serious misgivings. During their journey, they encounter various obstacles and, and all sorts of villains. They also encounter various creatures such as giant spiders, goblins, wolves and many others. In the end, they endure all of them. They eventually kill Smaug and on their way to claim the treasure, they are forced to battle armies of goblins and wargs (of course, Bilbo's party aided by several allies, otherwise they would've been out-numbered and killed). In the end, the wargs and goblins are vanquished and Bilbo returns to The Shire with treasure, the ring of power and a heart full of adventure.The world of the Middle-Earth is a complicated one. Tolkien took great care in representing this world, from creating new languages to including very particular cultural details that add to the richness of the world's fabric. Tolkien states that Middle-Earth was the planet we live today in an imaginary time (supposedly 6,000 years ago), but of course, this is just fiction.As I said, in the beginning Bilbo is the shy, weakest, and most frightened character of the group, but in the end he amounts to be the strongest. And now is when the conflict comes in. The main conflict is man vs. himself, or should I say Bilbo vs. Bilbo? Bilbo has to overcome his fears of dragons and other creatures in order to carry out his part of the mission.Now, let us talk about the theme shall we? I have noticed the story has several themes and morals, but the main one is this: never let your fears get in the way of what you want to do or be in life. Bilbo is an excellent example of this. And then there comes greed. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters' simple desire for food, or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed comes fully to the fore in the story and provides the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone, a most ancient relic of the dwarves, and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure in order to help those in greater need (this theme can also be seen in Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy with Frodo and the \\"One Ring\\").Normally people read this book after watching the LOTR movies, and I don't blame them, I did the same thing. But some people look at this book as a prequel to the trilogy, and I really think they shouldn't do that. This is a completely different story to LOTR, one that may not be as good as the trilogy, but it definitely has more color than it.My thoughts on the book? It was brilliant. I loved the way that Bilbo grows up from a shy humble tea-maker into this great, mature adventurer. It's fairly short, and easy to understand. The plot is fantastic, and the build-up is very well done. Anyone can easily read it, the story is written in a very lighter tone than the actual trilogy (even has its comical parts) and I do recommend it for those who have a thirst for adventure, interested in taking a journey to a new land, to Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I didn't think that The Hobbit could get better in reading it again. I was wrong. This edition enhances everything. This has now become my preferred edition of this contemporary classic of English literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who wouldn't get the annotated version? The notes are so helpful in answering all those little questions that come up along the way."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***By now, Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" must nearly be a de rigeur rite of passage for almost any pre-teen or adolescent. Its wide, sprawling story of wizards, dwarves, goblins, eagles, elves, orcs, ordinary men and treasure is diverse enough, but also understandable enough, to attract and entertain almost anybody. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss \\"The Hobbit\\" as a mere episodic adventure fantasy, just as it would be a similar mistake to do so with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I believe the main secret to \\"The Hobbit's enduring appeal is its optimistic assurance that no matter how small, timid, and scared you are, you have the tools, the ability, and the courage to confront life in all its hostility and triumph over it, if you really want to. As I said in the title (which sounds like an Obama slogan), you can, and you always could.I'm not going to go into slavish detail about the plot in this review. Basically, a mysterious wizard named Gandalf yanks a bourgeois, complacent hobbit (who are even smaller than dwarves) named Bilbo Baggins from his comfortable middle-class life and compels him to accompany a motley assembly of 13 boisterous dwarves on a quest to recover their homeland from a fiery dragon. The group has many adventures along the way with various beings, most of them dishearteningly harsh and hostile. Understandably, for the majority of the trip, reluctant, accidental hero Bilbo grumbles, trembles, and complains about his wretched circumstances. However, two things keep us on Bilbo's side. One, we would do the same thing in his place. Two, Bilbo gradually reveals latent aspects of his character that help the dwarves progress in their mission, even after the wizard leaves them to pursue his own adventure. Bilbo finds he has skills (like stone throwing and subterfuge), resourcefulness, and even daring that actually save the dwarves' lives on more than one occasion. He has the wits and luck to snatch an invisibility ring from the loathesome amphibious creature Gollum. He manages to keep up the dwarves' morale, especially when they finally meet the dragon Smaug at the dwarves' mountain home. He find Smaug's Achilles Heel which enables the Lake Men (namely Bard) to slay Smaug. Despite Bilbo's almost-constant fear, he forges ahead and even becomes an inspiration to the dwarves, even to their stalwart leader Thorin Oakenshield.In a way, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a mythological life metaphor, since life throws so much adversity, pain, and suffering at us. Sometimes we think we don't have the stuff to keep going. But we do and always did. If a little hero like Bilbo can persevere, the story tells us, we certainly can. But surprisingly, \\"The Hobbit\\" demonstrates a little bit something more - the deadly, foolish futility of stubborn greed and the stupidity of war for material gain.With Bilbo's unassuming help, the dwarves regain their mountain stronghold and their vast treasure that the dragon had kept for eons. However, Smaug's attack and death decimates Laketown and its dispossessed people quite logically demand restitution (i.e. part of the treasure). Consumed by avarice, the normally-sensible dwarf band leader Thorin refuses. A siege and standoff ensues. It may remind you of many modern-day conflicts, like, I don't know, the Israeli/Palestine impasse.Peaceful Bilbo attempts to break the stalemate by sneaking off and giving the siege leader the Arkenstone, the dwarves' most prized possession. When Thorin finds out, he conveniently forgets how Bilbo helped his crew and threatens to dash him on the rocks. Sadly, Bilbo throws his lot with the siege men. However, a more noble reason to fight arises as the goblins and their wolf allies the Wargs attack the compound. Man and dwarf are forced to become allies and repel the threat. Thorin's Iron Dwarf relatives also arise as the brutal Battle of Five Armies commences. Bilbo turns invisible and wisely stays out of it. Man and dwarf (and elf, I think) prevail, but its a Pyrrhic victory. Young creatures in their prime needlessly perish. Thorin does too, but not before seeking Bilbo's forgiveness. One gradually realizes that if you must fight a war, do it for freedom and right, not for gold. Also, to paraphrase Thorin, if more people appreciated a good meal and ale, like Bilbo, instead of gold and fighting, the world would be a much better place. Amen, especially in this day and age.Bilbo found it within himself to be a guide, a leader, and even a bit of an non-materialistic peacemaker. \\"The Hobbit\\" reminds us that we can do, and would do, well to be the same.5 stars out of five."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I knew Tolkein when I was an undergradute at New College -He was a delightful - self effacing scholar - sense of humour like a hobbit- having had first read this masterpiece when about 9 yrs of age -enduring great book -infinitely more intelligent and enriching of a young mind than the Potter saga"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had not read The Hobbit in quite some time and was looking for a new edition when I found this version and was blown away by the different illustrations that it contains from all the versions of the book in all the languages that it has been published in since its initial release in 1937.The background information regarding some of the sources of inspiration for Tolkien while writing the story are most enlightening. If you read every footnote, you will find the difference between each edition which may be of interest if you have more than one edition and wondered why the text is not always the same.

Children might like it but it isn't 'for' children any more then the fantasy genre is in general.I think this books stands above the LOTR triology quite easily because it's primarily a book about good vs evil as opposed to the two blended and mixed on so many levels as to leave you feeling depressed. This is a straight out story. Beautifully written, no axe to grind or weird theology to push (or confused theology) it just is.I like it.I gave it five stars for the quality of the writing and the storytelling magic it conveys. The characters are very memorable and leave you feeling inspired.I think it was on my top ten books list for over a decade or so.(a fantasy novel doesn't have to have depression and horror stories to make it 'adult'.)PS. I don't generally like the fantasy genre because it often glorifies all kinds of things that arn't healthy (harry potter for example). But that being said, I think that the hobbit would fall less into that category then the narnia series (personally) and those are marketed as 'christian books'. It's the heart of a book that strikes you the most - not necessarily the vehicle that carrys it. I think the hobbit is pretty harmless compared to the majority of stuff that's out there.I'd read it to my children if they were old enough and wise enough to understand the implications of what they were hearing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm ashamed to say I have never read the Lord of the Ring series before (I may have started one once but didn't like it and put it back down) and even after seeing the movies, which I did enjoy, I still didn't dive into Tolkien's world. Well I decided to remedy that and picked up the Hobbit, the prequel of sorts to the Lord of the Rings series. I have to say I wasn't all that impressed. It was an inventive story for sure, and Tolkien had a lot of imagination, but there were a lot of flaws in this book in my opinion.We are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit that likes to make sure meals are regular and a comfy chair exists in his hole in the ground. He is surprised one day by the wizard Gandalf who brings thirteen dwarves to meet his acquaintance. They tell him he is to come on a journey and help the dwarves so that they may regain their homeland and treasure from a dragon who has stolen it all. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems though and they encounter many hardships and perils on the road. Not a lot of people seem to like this merry band of travelers and they are constantly fighting for their lives and freedom. But some other things do happen, and a lot changes when Bilbo finds a very mysterious ring.The characters in this novel are well developed. I was glad to see Gollum as he is my favorite character in the movies and he was well written in these pages. Bilbo was also done splendidly and you were able to get a good sense of what Hobbits are like from him. Even the dwarves, as many as there were, had distinct personalities.The writing is where I found some faults. This book is extremely rushed! It seems like they were no sooner getting into trouble than they were out of it and into some different sort of trouble. Because of this, there didn't seem to be any suspense to the novel and it would have been nice if Tolkien had settled on a few instances and described them well, then had many that hardly got any description at all. He seemed to repeat himself too with our heroes getting captured at least four times, although I stopped counting after awhile. That being said, even the violence in this novel was tame and nothing was offensive that I could find so it is appropriate for all readers.I wish I would have enjoyed the book more. I do hear that this is the weakest out of the series so I will continue on. I just hope they get a little better as right now I'm not sure what all the hype is about.The HobbitCopyright 1937306 pagesReview by M.

It is time to take the journey again and look for more landmarks along the way. Bilbo Baggins is an everyman character very easy to identify with. Perhaps you feel ordinary, don't let that stop you from having an adventure. Go with Bilbo on his journey and cheer him on. Treat everyone you meet with caution and courtesy--you don't always know if they will be friend or foe. For more travel adventures in Middle-Earth read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--the reading level is somewhat harder than the Hobbit.

This book relates that adventure.Though it explains various parts of the Lord of the Rings series (such as how Bilbo got the Ring), this is truly a tale independent of the well-known trilogy. Very little of the journey actually deals with the finding of the Ring, and the focus rests on Bilbo and his journey with Gandalf and a troop of dwarves.The story, as it is told, is of Bilbo's part in a quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and recover lost treasure and land of his dwarven companions'. The tale abounds in adventures, encounters with mystical creatures, hardships, and every other element for which Tolkien's stories are famous.This book was written for children (the reading being much easier than Tolkien's other works), but is a timeless classic which can doubtless be enjoyed by young and old alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Perhaps THE BEST little adventure story every written. Written for kids but certainly enjoyed by all. It has trolls, dragons, a kindly but strange wizard, dwarves, and of course Hobbits. It's really a story of bravery and strong friendships in the face of mishaps and evil things. What stands out in this book and The Lord of the Rings is that the world Tolkien creates sucks you in hopelessly. It only takes a few sentances and you really feel like you are along for the journey.Tolkien creates a world with a huge history full of peoples and monsters and dwarves, with nature playing a large role in all of his books. The history part is small in The Hobbit since its focused on the journey and characters. The Hobbit is meant to be a lead-in to The Lord of the Rings, which has much more history and nature and more characters than the Hobbit. 'Rings is a darker tale and much more serious. Its harder to read, much longer, and I think the best adventure story ever written.In response to Chris Fletcher, you have some valid criticisms of Tolkien. His writing style is a bit, well, sticky. When you think things should be moving faster and faster and the action is coming, you instead get \\"and then the big troll (or whatever) was killed. On to the next adventure.\\"However, the upside to this is you really feel like you are reading a kind of history book found in Middle Earth. I think Tolkien was a bit nuts and that's why his stuff was so good. He half-believed he really was writing and living in the world of his own making. He created entire languages, maps, unforgetable characters and mostly sad but gripping tales of adventure. Some people can't get through Tolkien's sticky prose when reading the lengthy The Lord of the Rings and I understand why, but stick with it! After reading the whole thing you will be glad you did. Remember no one can tell you how to read a book. If you come accross a paragraph about Bilbo's half-sister and all her family and the history of her cat, just skip it if you want. Tolkien really does go out on a limb sometimes escpecially with all the names and family trees and fictional history.However, this same strange Tolkien style allows for re-reading and getting much more information, and a sense of depth and life to Middle Earth that is truely amazing. I have read the series, both the Hobbit and LOTR twice and I got much more the second time through. I read it slower and tried to keep the characters and places in my head. You can buy a nice map book which lays out all of tolkiens worlds in detail including battles and paths that the characters follow. Its by Karen Wynn Fonstad and has a lot of detail. Careful though, some plot happenings are given away in the tracking of characters and the battle maps :DIf you really want to get background info you have to start with the Silmarillion. And that beast can drive you crazy. Parts of it are amazing to read however and it explains some of the history that was confusing in LOTR. Where did Galadriel come from? What or who exactly is Gandalf? What's a wizard? What are the counterparts to Sauron and other evil in middle earth? Surely there must be some good gods or angel like beings? So, Silmarillion: very difficult, for tolkein fans mostly. Its long, hundreds of names, not a continuous story. It does explain a great deal about the gods and formation of Middle Earth and many things and people and places that show up later in the Hobbit and LOTR.Hobbit: very easy fun read, not a whole lot of depth, short, great characters, great adventure.The Lord of the Rings: medium difficulty, lots of depth, some history, lots of names, some difficult and confusing paragraphs, but a truely great tale. The kind of book where you find yourself kinda stunned after reading the last sentance. (The movie is not bad, but messed things up a bit, read the book! Notice that Tolkien's name is not on the movie. The family took their name off it because of the Hollywood treatment.)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the best book i have ever read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkein's now classic fairy tale of the land of Middle Earth and its inhabitants, the Hobbits, is an enchanting and mythical story of the underdog hero Bilbo. The so-called prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually a splice or intersection of the Ring in which Bilbo discovers the ring in Golem's cave. The story of Bilbo and his adventures is classic lore of slaying the dragon to win the pot of gold. With his band of misfits and hungry tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum gnomes, there is a comic ambiance to the story that helps the reader through some of the slow scenes. While this is not a must read to understand the Ring Trilogy, it certainly is a worth while read unto itself without the burden of two more books to complete the journey. Tolkein's writing is fun and witty while asking the reader to understand a few new words in his created language. There are times as well that the story slows down either for narrative purposes where the writing speaks to you, the reader, or for the group to sing a song to celebrate their happiness in the style of medieval celtic literature.

He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and uses his cleveness and magic to help the group out of tough situations. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with the alot of people through out the novel.

Very descriptive."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an adventurous prelude to Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien.The story is about a quiet hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who leads a relaxed life in his hole. That is until the visit from the thirteen dwarves and Gandalf the Wizard. They take Bilbo on an exciting journey to get their gold back from the evil dragon Smaug. About half way through the journey the life saving wizard must leave on important matters. This is when they really start heading into troubles. Bilbo must take charge and be the thief that Gandalf told the dwarfs he was. Bilbo manages to save his friends many times and even discover something magical. Quiet no more, Mr. Baggins earns the respect of the dwarfs and learns that life isn't as easy as he once thought.I really liked this book because it is action packed. It is a story that would keep you up reading until you are done. The characters are very well developed. The setting is described fantastically. This book takes place in a fantasy world. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to sit down and read a great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.

Tolkien's Hobbit is the greatest book of all time. His originality and ingenuity created a timeless classic that quickly became my favorite book. Not only has it been my favorite book but fantasy writers since have used this book as a reference point for their own. I suggest this book to everyone who is breathing. Read it, read it, read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What else can be said about the greatness of this book? I first discovered it 20 years ago by mistake, and it has never left me. It sparked my love of reading and led to my choice of college degree. (In fact, I might never have gone to college if it weren't for my research of Tolkien and his time at Oxford as both student and professor. To be close to saints, one must walk in their footsteps!) But all of this is purely consequence. What about the story? Why does it affect people so strongly? To be honest, some don't get it. But most others do for the reason that The Hobbit answers a very deeply held longing in most of us to be part of a simpler time and to be part of a Quest, which is both a physical and spiritual journey, a testing of the soul, and a chance for heroism and the overthrow of Evil. The ethics of The Hobbit are those we would have operate in our own world. Through the main character, Bilbo Baggins, we are allowed to experience this romantic world where the underdog overcomes great difficulty to smite down the bad, raise up the good, and make life better place for all. Tolkien's use of language is also superb, relying heavily on Anglo-Saxon derived words which provides and emotional link between the book and reader. This is the language we first heard in the cradle and we still respond to it. The setting is also hidden deep in our sub-conscious, reflecting a simler time in our own world before electricity, gasoline, smog, television, skyscapers, overpopulation, crime, etc. -- all the suffocating and demoralizing debris of modern living. This reverence for the past played a large role in Tolkien's life. Out of that longing came his choice of schooling and profession and this book. We cannot escape it ourselves. Middle-earth is our world made perfect. There is no one who loves The Hobbit who wouldn't trade places with Bilbo Baggins or even, for just one day, take a long walk through the sunlit fields of the Shire. What a beautiful place to live. Through this book, we can."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"READ THIS BOOK. It is one of the best books ive ever read. Its a mix of Fantasy and Adventure. But for people who are gonna read it, stick with it for the beginning, because the beginning is kinda boring. But keep reading and your in for a good book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have just read the reviews of this book, and I want to say to everyone, past and future, to practice what Samuel Taylor Coleridge called &quot;a willing suspension of disbelief.&quot; Forget about stylistic problems and tongue-twisting placenames, this is a story meant to be enjoyed at face value. Sheer delight!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read The Hobbit, I could not stop until I had read The Lord of the Rings. I kept going back to the library to get each book! I still cannot read one book without reading all of them, from start to finish. The beautiful, in-depth descriptions are so clear-cut it is almost like seeing a movie unfold in your mind. Tolkien obviously loved his Middle-earth and wrote of it with a piercing sweetness, a sweetness much like that of the High-elves of Lothlorien. Shelley describes it best: &quot;Our sweetest songs often tell of saddest thought.&quot; Perhaps this book is not for everyone, but for those who want to read a classic, filled with chivalry, wizards, romance, and sheer fun, I hope you will give The Hobbit and The Lord of the Ring a try."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one the classics, it was aimed at children but not to many today would have the patience or understanding to persist with it. It's the perfect book for those that are visiting their second childhood - a real book to truly &quot;get lost&quot; in, becoming one of the characters is a real pleasure that makes it a real joy to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought this book was really good.I on the other hand like LOTR better.The hobbit really grabs your instrest after the first couple of chapters."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As the prelude to the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit or There and Back Again, is a magnificent tale of magic, fantasy, and adventure. I found that I could not set this book down. With each page, I was that much more drawn into the realm of Middle Earth, and I made myself put the book down for a little bit in order to enjoy it.The characterization in this book is phenomenal. Both the protagonists and antagonists throughout the novel help creat the landscape of the book, as well as set the foundation for Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, displays the ideal character in that he is forced into a world of adventure of magic. As an innocent creature unaware of the outside world, Bilbo matures throughout the book, and is a classic example of a character who, by the end of the book, has developed into a great intellectual character. Bilbo continues to display this intellect throughout the Lord of the Rings.I have experienced many a conflict with other readers who did not enjoy the Hobbit, and I'm not saying that this book is in everyone's favor, but any reader of fantasy, magic, and adventure will love this book. I recommend the Hobbit to every person no matter what age. As a timeless tale of Tolkien, I give this book five stars (although, it probably deserves more)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was boasting with the great imagination of J.R.R Tolkein. About 60 years before the lord of the seires Bilbo Gandlaf and a gang of Dwarfs travel through the misty moantians to get to a treasure stolen from the Dwarfs. As the gang travels through the land they meet tons of epic characters (elfs dwarfs goblins trolls). Tolkein could have written more voilence like its sequel Lord of the Rings. Overall it was a epic classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Though I grew up reading fantasy, playing Lone Wolf books and sometimes joining an AD&D game, I had never read any of Tolkien's works until recently. The Hobbit sat on my bookshelf for seven years because I couldn't get past the first chapter. Now I breezed through it, soaking in the rich world of Tolkien's imagination and discovering where most modern fantasy has its roots. Though I've seen the first two Lord of the Rings movies, I'm now going to get and read those books and anything else JRR Tolkien wrote in the way of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was a sophomore in high school when I first read this book. Since, I have read it probably 4 times, written 3 papers on it in college, and taken a Studies in Text class on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This book is a must have for anyone who enjoys literature, whether it be fantasy, history, fiction or non."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is my favorite book that Tolkien wrote. I honestly wish that it would be come a movie not unlike its sequels in the Lord of the Rings.The characters are well thought out and everything just seems to flow. The novel is creative and exciting. It often gets overshadowed by the Lord of the Rings but honestly this is the gem of the series in my mind.Pick it up today if you haven't read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy was the beginning of the Middle Earth world. Easier to read, an ideal start for young fantasy readers before they tackle LOTR. This book began a life long love of fantasy for me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Like many, I am a long time fan of Tolkien, and have read The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion more times than I can remember. This audio adaptaption is not as strong as the BBC The Lord of the Rings. I especially prefer the LotR's Gandalf, and no one can beat Ian Holm as Frodo. Nevertheless, the BBC Hobbit is entertaining and delightful. After aquiring my own copy and listening to it numerous times in the car, etc., I bought a copy for my niece and nephew, and they loved it too. It is abridged, and has minor changes to the actual story. But overall, I thought it was pretty good."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are several important facts to remember in history: the first being the signing of the Magna Carta, the first movement towards democracy; the second is the rise and fall of the Roman Empire; the third is the Declaration of Independence in 1776; and lastly is the creation of The Hobbit. Now, the reader of this might be questioning the validity of this statement, however, in every case a new \\"empire\\" rises to introduce something so revolutionary that it shakes the foundation of the Planet itself. Understandably, overthrowing tyranny, introducing governments for the people, and building understanding for all that is good in the face of evil mark monumental events in history. Unlike previously mentioned events, The Hobbit is the first book to use fantasy to capture interest in the struggle to overcome pure evil from an underdog. The Hobbit is the world's first view at a self-help book that uses a magical world created by J.R.R. Tolkein to illustrate overcoming adverse odds to learn about the power of the mind and breaking out of the ordinary: in short, a must read.When reading The Hobbit there are a few key things to remember. A Hobbit is a small person, only about three to four feet in height, with a taste for beer and food, a life without adventure, and normality. Bilbo Baggins represents the boring life of a Hobbit, constantly in uniform behavior with which he is expected to partake in. However, surrounding the land of the Shire, home to Hobbits, lies an immense world filled with goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, dragons, and other fantastic creatures eager to be explored. Bilbo Baggins is the book's main character and symbol for taking on the unordinary and challenges contemporary theology. Living in Hobbiton, there are key differences between men and Hobbits, all of which Bilbo represents. Hobbits are only about half the size of regular humans, have hairy feet because they do not wear shoes, and are foremost opposed to taking up adventures, much rather preferring to Garden or drink tea. Bilbo's quest into adventure begins with the introduction of Gandalf, the Grey Wizard, and 13 dwarves in search of a \`burglar' to accompany them on a mission to hunt out the marauding dragon Smaug, who took their gold and hordes it on Lonely Mountain. Surprised to find himself involved in such a quest, unbecoming of a Hobbit, Bilbo accepts the introduction to the \`unexpected party' and heads out of his comfort to the land of Middle Earth.While on his quest, Bilbo learns about relying on others, himself, and bravery. Bilbo partakes in fighting goblins, tricking trolls, riding upon eagles, and saving his entire band from killer, giant spiders. The themes of the novel and motifs are not very well exhibited, except through Bilbo's narration and the chapter titles, such as \\"out of the frying pan, into the fire\\". Through the chapter titles, and Bilbo's personal queries into fighting off creatures unknown in his homeland, the Shire, Bilbo learns the most about himself and displays the book's message: if faced with adversity and doubt, anyone can do anything if they just try and push through the comfort boundaries. Overall, The Hobbit is a wonderful book because it introduces things children and adults can come to enjoy in fantasy, with real world, mature lessons about life that connect to a broad range of readers. Like the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, and Roman Empire, The Hobbit teaches its followers to rise up against the tyranny of doubt and fight for anything previously linked to doubt, a true historical masterpiece of the human spirit and escape to a world of Fantasy.BY SEAN CAMPERSON (NOT CYNDIE CAMPERSON)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are several important facts to remember in history: the first being the signing of the Magna Carta, the first movement towards democracy; the second is the rise and fall of the Roman Empire; the third is the Declaration of Independence in 1776; and lastly is the creation of The Hobbit.

Our protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, finds himself drafted most unwillingly into the role of burgler for a band of dwarves who seek to reclaim the treasure stolen from their ancestors by the dragon Smaug. But before they can accomplish this goal, they must survive the journey to the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug dwells. The trip is long and dangeous, and Bilbo proves his worth along the way.While this book doesn't have the deep and powerful themes of the subsequent trilogy, it still provides a cautionary story about the dangers of greed, and of unintended consequences. Bilbo's companions allow their greed to cloud their judgement (as it does many others along the way), and while they only intended to reclaim what they considered rightfully theirs, their actions provoke the dragon into attacking a nearby town, with potentially disasterous consequences. Only the arrival of a common foe prevents these natural allies from fighting among themselves.An enjoyable fantasy tale, with a simple message, this story is still a classic because it sets the stage for the powerful battle between good and evil in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of my favorite books by my favorite author.

Took about a week to read and i am now reading the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit- By J.R.R. TolkienThe Hobbit is a very good and quite easy read. It is not very difficult to read because of the vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. Although in some areas it is a little difficult because the names of the dwarfs get confusing. The characters are explained very well and by the end of the book it really seems like you have met the characters. All except for Gandalf. Gandalf is a little less explained than the other characters, all of the other characters have a little backstory on how they came to be in the story. Although the author gives a brief physical description of Gandalf, Gandalf's personality or non-physical characteristics are unknown. I really like J.R.R. Tolkien's writing style because in one paragraph he is telling the story of what is happening and the next paragraph he may be talking directly to the reader which I thought was very interesting. My favorite character has to be Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is my favorite character because he is the character that the reader gets to know the most. Another reason why Bilbo is my favorite character is because he is an unsuspecting, \\"normal\\" hobbit when Gandalf came along and changed his life. I think what the author was trying to say through this book, was that life can change very quickly so enjoy what you have. You never know when the next wizard will come along and tell you that you that you are going on a quest. One of my favorite moments of the book was the Golem chapter, or chapter five. This is one of my favorite moments in the book because it really sets the entire story up and for the Lord of the Rings books. This is the scene when Bilbo picks up the ring that can make him invisible. I also really like the author's word choice and how he forms sentences that flow and transition into one another. I also think that the names of the places and people are very interesting. I thought that it was very inspiring that he made up his own language for the ruins. One thing that I didn't like about this book was that the names got very confusing and I kept having to flip back to figure out who was talking, what race the thing that was talking was, and what the relationship between the speaker and Bilbo. Another thing I didn't like about this book was how some of the characters were not explained as thoroughly as the others. \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\\" This quote sticks out in my mind because it is a key describer, hook, and introducing sentence to the entire story. J.R.R. Tolkien was a English writer, university professor, poet, and philologist. Overall, The Hobbit is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone that has an interest in fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this story 30years ago in a pocket paperback.

The whole story is injected with humour and wry observations during Bilbo's journey. All the characters are carefully wraught through Tolkien's imagery and language. I hope to get through &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (I think that's the title), but unfortunately can't get into &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Oh well.

On their quest to restore the dwarves wealth and pride; Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 Dwarves encounter numerous challenges of both the emotional and physical nature. Bilbo's revelation from a timid, do-gooder hobbit to a daring thief is the most exciting transformation experienced.

They often need the powerful wizard, Gandalf, for protection though sometimes he cannot help them and they must overcome these grave dangers themselves. The Hobbit is one of my all time favorite books. If you like The Lord of the Rings, then you will love this book. If you've never read The Lord of the Rings this is a great novel to enter the enchanting world of J.R.R. Tolkien. J.R.R. Tolkien is a writing genius, no other author can compare. No one can create a fantasy world like J.R.R. Tolkien can. He creates the Middle Earth, a land laden in fantasy, full of Elves, Wizards, Hobbits, Dwarves, Men and so much more. In this novel the magic comes alive and assists in the classic story of good versus evil. Yet the novel has a human aspect one that we can relate to as mere mortals such as dwarves, hobbits and men conquer evil. This is a timeless novel that will always be considered a classic.

Along the way, Bilbo obtains a ring which turns the wearer invisible. He uses the ring many times to save the group from danger. Eventually they end up at their destination, Lonely Mountain, where a dragon guards Thorin's treasure. After the dragon dies, the people of a nearby town come to claim their share of the treasure, but Thorin refuses and locks them out. So the humans and elves besiege the mountain. Then goblins arrive and everyone joins to defeat the goblins.This is my favorite book that I have read so far. It took my imagination through a great adventure of magic and monsters. I liked it because I am a fairly big Dungeons & Dragons fan. Although I have never played the board game, I have played similar games since I was five. Though the games I play have come along way since then, it's the same concept.If you're the type of person that is fascinated by adventures, especially with magical creatures, objects, and places, this book has them. Maybe you enjoy Role Playing Games, or maybe you have just seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy on DVD, then this is defiantly a good book for you. It's also a fairly easy read; any person from an eleven year old kid to a middle-aged adult would enjoy this book very much. My last suggestion is that when you read this book, be prepared to not want to put it down, because it keeps you wondering, \\"What's going to happen next?\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a fantastic read for older children and adults. It takes you to a fantasy world (Middle Earth) and deeply involves the reader. The book may be complicated for younger children, but if read to them could be an awesome imaginative journey."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since this is a book I love, I have always felt I owed it to myself--or the fourteen-year-old me--to put in my two cents worth on a review. But you know, as I sit here, I cannot think of much to add to what's already been written. I mean...if someone has already read The Hobbit, then she's already got an opinion. And if someone hasn't yet had the honor of being among those who have journeyed along with Bilbo through Middle Earth, then odds are she's been exposed to enough \\"Hobbit 101\\" background information on this famous subject to the point where anything I say is merely added noise. And if by some rare chance a person who has neither read The Hobbit nor knows details of it should locate this review, then is it really fair of me to say anything at all to influence how this potential reader might feel, or alter what he or she might know? Funny, but I've never felt this hesitation about any other work, and perhaps that says something unexpected about the sacredness of this book to me even now, a dozen years after I first spent a wonderful Saturday in June 1993 reading it. Maybe writing this review has been more of a voyage of discovery about myself and my regard for J.R.R. Tolkien, that right-wing, nature loving Oxford professor, whose life's work made him an icon among those of the political left. So let me end here by saying this: The Hobbit is a work of wondrous scope that was huge to me at one time in my life, is still of more importance than I knew a moment ago, and if you are about to read it for the first time or the thousandth, I hope you enjoy it as much as I always have."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"'The Hobbit: Or There and Back Again' is a wonderful book by author J.R.R. Tolkien! It has a lot of adventure and fantasy in it. 'The Hobbit' is a very literary book and is a great, and most descent, read for children and adults alike. This story is a wonderful prelude to Tolkien's amazing 'Lord of the Rings' book trilogy! I highly recommend you buy and read 'The Hobbit: Or There and Back Again' by author J.R.R. Tolkien! It is a wonderful book which was, is, and always will be a bestseller."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is full of adventer,and it keeps you on your toes for more.

I always looked forward to picking it up."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i thought it was a really good book, even though i don't read many. It had a lot of details and it just kept getting better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was great personaly I thought the character count was perfect and the detail was just right so I can see their world. The fact that people could not understand this book baffles me because I read it and understood it in 5th grade. The people who think this book has too many characters and too much detail must have absolutely no memory because I who can not remember how old people are could remember almost all of the detail. I agree that this book should not be class reading, not every one reads at the same leval and not everyone can appreciate this form of lituratuer, but Shakspere is no better he totaly bores me. His books have too much dialog and not enough substance. I think Tolken is a great writer and his books are at a level that not many people can understand. So if you have trouble reading or have poor memory don't read this book, but if you are a good reader with relitively good memory at least try this book, you may not like it so you should cheak it out from a library, so if you don't there will be no loss but if you do like it buy the book, it is an excelent investment."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and I thought it was a good book in nearly all ways.For readers that have not read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; please do not do what my mother and many other people have done:give up at the start or in the middle just because it's boring for a bit (near, in or just after a chapter called &quot;Flys And Spiders&quot;). The best bit in my opinon is at the end of the book but the whole thing is good. It is worth buying but I still sugest you read at a library it first because looking at the other reviews there are some people who don't like it. But if you do like it I highly sugest you to read &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;.Please E-mail me about my review if you want to."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was extraordinary with all of the characters and suspenseful settings.

I think that anyone who likes adventure and fantasy, should read this one because it's the best."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Some people call this a children's book, and in a way it is. But Tolkien's Hobbit has plenty for older readers, a sense of oldfashioned fantasy not found in most modern sword-and-sorcery books. My dad used to read it to us kids when I was just 4 or 5 years old, and my love of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; has only grown with age. Reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has made me appreciate the book and its author even more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was ten years old I was introduced to the world of Middle-Earth by an older friend. I had to struggle through the section of the book that describes hobbits and their habits, but the story that followed made the struggle worthwhile. Every lover of fantasy owes a great debt to Tolkien -- his success, both literary and commercial, made the fantasy genre viable. If this story seems too familiar it is only because every fantasy writer since &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was published in 1937 has drawn from the well of Tolkien's creativity and imagination. Now my son is ten years old and I am a proud father to be sharing this timeless classic with him. Like many other readers I preferred the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, but reading this book first enables the reader to truly mine the depths of the masterpiece that follows. Brian Jacques and Piers Anthony have learned well at the foot of this master, and if you enjoy their work you need to go back to the beginning with &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; While it is clearly a children's book, the depth of meaning contained within &quot;The Hobbit&quot; spans all ages. P.S. If you are a parent who is concerned about the pending demise of the English language turn your children on to something that doesn't have an &quot;on-off&quot; switch. This book will kindle even the most dormant of imaginations!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a wonderful escape, and for more mature readers offers amazing sybolism. I read LOTR before I read The Hobbit and not all of it made sense. But after reading The Hobbit the world of LOTR simply came alive. The Hobbit may not be as goob as LOTR, but I highly recommend it for anyone who loves this genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This one of the best books I've ever read. Great Imagination this Tolkien guy has."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's book, The Hobbit, is the exciting beginning to the story of the Lord of the Rings, his greatest work. Even though this book was written about thirty years ago, it is still considered one of the best fantasy books of all time.This book tells the story of a hobit named Bilbo, who is swept up into an adventure when a wizard, Gandalf, and a group of dwarves show up at his house with a request. The dwarves are going on a journey back to their home in the Misty Mountains that has been taken over by a dragon named Smaug. Bilbo's role in this journey is to steal the gold held in the mountain by the dragon for the dwarves, and in return he would receive a share of the reward.Along the way, Bilbo discovers a ring with magical powers. This ring is the reason for the conflicts found in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The ring has the power to make whoever is wearing it invisible and have a longer life. This ring gives Bilbo the strength and courage he needs to survive the adventure and help his friends.This book is a good choice for anyone who has seen and liked the Lord of the Rings movie or enjoys fantasy novels of adventure.

The story teaches that not everything is at it seems, and friendship is much more important to keep then even the greatest riches, also it shows that if you are determined then you will succeed. Tolkien's bed time story to his chidren is a novel every adult should read. There isn't much you could do to the book to make it better, and if you did it wouldn't be the same.

I hope you enjoyed my review."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic of children's fantasy for good reason - it is fun, light-hearted, full of adventure, episodic in nature (so no need to follow a complex plot), and simply BEGS to be read out loud. All this combines for a perfect adventure tale.Those coming in fresh from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" should be forewarned, the tone here is much lighter that the \`trilogy,' the writing very much meant for children (or to be read to children). It's a great read, but if you come in expecting more of what you got in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" you will be disappointed. Be prepared to read a children's book, because that's what this is.For those willing to plunge into children's fantasy, however, \\"The Hobbit\\" is simply a delight. Bilbo Baggins, something of a homebody, is the hobbit in question. He is pulled into an adventure with a wizard, Gandalf, and a troop of dwarves. Their quest is to venture across dangerous mountains and dark forests to reclaim treasure stolen by a terrible dragon, Smaug.What follows is a series of adventures that have our heroes meeting trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, elves and more. Each encounter is an adventure unto itself, with a thrilling climax that leads us to the next. The adventure is nonstop. Each chapter brings a new discovery.Tolkien's writing is clear, straightforward and very \`English.' It is also written with an ear for reading aloud, breaking the \\"fourth wall\\" on occasion to speak directly to the reader. This book is meant to be read to children - and no wonder, since Tolkien wrote it specifically to read to his own kids.Fans of Middle Earth discovering the wonderful land through \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will find things to enjoy here (if they are willing to sink into the lighter tone). We see our first glimpses of Gollum and the One Ring. Elrond, too, appears in Rivendell. We hear about some of Middle Earth's ancient lore, like Gondolin, see the origins of famous swords like Sting, and meet dwarves who play a part in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The cross references, while not vital, will bring a smile to your face and will enhance your enjoyment of the famous trilogy.For those looking to explore Tolkien's world, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a no brainer. Along with the classic trilogy and \\"The Silmarillion\\" (a difficult read for some), it makes up the three essential Middle Earth works.For those simply looking for a good children's fantasy in the same realm as C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles or Lloyd Alexander's Prydain saga, you won't go wrong with \\"The Hobbit.\\" This is fun stuff that even adults will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like fantasy books, the Hobbit is a must read. This book inspired me to read all three Lord of the Rings books that are also amazing. It is one of my favorite books of all time. Despite what people say, the book is not boring at all. The begining can be a little slow, but once you get into it there is no putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien Published by Houghton Mifflin CoBilbo stooped down to pick up the shiny object. It was a ring. He slipped it on and... Want to hear more? This is one of my favorite books because it is fantasy and that is my favorite genre. There are wizards and battles and lots of cool things in it. It is a long book but it needs to be to have all of the right details which it does have.The main characters of the story are: Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, all of the dwarves, Smaug and so many more that I could go on and on. First of all the character that the story focused on is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit that lives in a hole in the side of a hill. Hobbits travel in bare feet and they are about 3 feet tall. He calls his home Bag End. Bilbo is a normal hobbit who doesn't like adventure and who eats 3 or 4 breakfasts. The only thing is that Bilbo finds a liking for adventure and that is how the book begins. Gandalf the Grey is a wizard who has taken a liking to Bilbo. Gandalf is a traveler who fights evil and befriends the good. Gandalf is the reason for the whole book because he starts the adventure. The dwarves are about the same size as the hobbits though they look nothing like them. Dwarves have beards and wear hats and are the greatest miners and blacksmiths. They are in the journey only to get something they own back from Smaug. Lastly as you know, there is Smaug. Smaug is a dragon that lives in a mountain. He is almost indestructible though he has one weakness that is revealed in the book. Smaug is also an important part of the book.I would recommend this book to anybody who likes fantasy, wizards, battles and old things like that. This is one of my favorite books because I like all of the old beliefs. I couldn't put this book down because it was so exciting. This book was put together so well that you were never lost and you could always find something good about any part of the book while you could almost never find something bad. I think that anybody with reading talents can easily read this book although some of the words are a little hard to pronounce so you might want a parent or an older person around to help you with them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you ever thought of slaying a dragon? That is what Bilbo Baggins does in this book. Bilbo is an innocent hobbit who does not know anything about the wide world. Suddenly he finds himself in a great adventure to slay a dragon. Bilbo leaves the Shire and goes to the city of Dale. He goes though seven obstacles. On the way he finds a ring that makes him invisible. This story will lead into the series Lord of the Rings. J.R.R Tolkien makes a whole new world in your imagination. People ages 6 to 60 would love this book. This book is much like Brian Jacques. I think you should read this adventurous and magical book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book. I have never been able to read a book very easily because I could never pay attention long enough, but this book really caught my attention the whole time.To begin with, a wizard visits the hobbit, whose name is Bilbo Baggins. The wizard puts a mark on the hobbit's door and then leaves. Later twelve dwarves visit the hobbit. They hire him as a burglar to help in their quest.He finally decides to go along, but highly against his own will. They start on the journey and have all sorts of strange happenings that occur. They encounter goblins and are taken into the depths of a very large underground network of tunnels. Here, Bilbo finds a ring that is quite magical. He does not know it yet, but the ring will prove to be a very vital part of their quest.After the goblins, they meet a man who is both Man and Bear. They manage to ask him for food and lodging for a while, though he does not like strangers. At night, Bilbo hears sounds of scratching and thumping, but does not dare to get up for fear of being eaten by Beorn, who is the Man/Bear. In addition, Beorn's animals have the ability to communicate with him and can do most anything that a regular man can.The Mirkwood Forest is quite peculiar in itself. The group of twelve dwarves and Bilbo must travel through a forest that is extremely dark. Although it is daytime, the forest is very dimly lit because all the trees form a canopy, which blocks all the light. Near the end of the forest, they become lost. They are forced to battle huge spiders and are eventually captured Wood-elves.Bilbo slips on his ring in time and is able to follow the elves as they take the dwarves to the cavernous hideout. Each dwarf is questioned to try to find out why he is traveling through the Mirkwood Forest. None will give the answer that the Elf King is looking for, so he throws them all in prison.While the dwarves are in prison, being quite well fed, Bilbo figures out a means of escape for all of the dwarves and himself. He also has time to learn quite a lot about the inside of the elf cavern. Bilbo gets the chance when a guard and another man go and taste the new wine that has been brought. Both become drunk and fall asleep. Bilbo is able to get all the dwarves out and himself.After this, they are not far from the dragon's lair. Smaug has taken all of the dwarve's treasure in gold and jewels and is in a cave on the Lonely Mountain. The quest of the small company is to reclaim the treasure that is rightfully the dwarves'. Bilbo faces Smaug and...I cannot tell you what happens, that would ruin it. They also face a war, but you will have to read to find out.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were very well developed and easy to remember. I usually lose track of who is who in a book, but this book was easy to keep track of the characters. The book is actually quite believable if the reader looks past the fact that the characters are dwarves and a hobbit. I was quite lost throughout the book wondering what the characters were actually feeling. I felt this was a very believable story.I have never been able to sit down and read a book as easily as I did this one. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book. It keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat and has action in almost every page that is read. I recommend this book to anyone, no matter who he or she is. This book is deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, I think this is a good book for ages 11 and above. This is a great fantasy/adventure for girls and boys.

Tolken. This epic story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Hobbits are small people who love peace and quiet, and certainly don't like to embark on big adventures. One day, when a wizard named Gandalf comes to Bilbo's door with a band of dwarves. Gandalf and the dwarves are going across the countryside to find some gold and they invite Bilbo along. Bilbo Baggins isn't exactly prepared to meet evil goblins, carnivorous wolves, scary trolls, and definitely not a dragon. I would strongly recommend this book who like the Lord of the Rings series and the Percy Jackson series because this book will help you extended your knowledge about mythical creatures. I also would suggest this book for people who like to read about fantasy and adventure. If you read this book, I hope that you will enjoy it because I did!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read The Hobbit about five times. Every time I read it I enjoy it tremendously and I take a deeper meaning from it. I've just finished reading it again and I think (if there is a message at all) that it is a message against vanity. Thorin immediately tells Bilbo he never wants to talk to him again when he finds out that he gave the Arkenstone to the other side. On his death bed, however, Thorin says Bilbo is as worthy of the treasure as he is. Bilbo and the Shire represent, in my mind, a happy people whose minds and desires have not been corrupted by the lure of wealth for its own sake. There are valuables within the Shire, sure, and people obviously want the nice things, but the main theme of the book to me seems to be that the Shire folk are not willing to risk their lives or dignity to get material things that they do not need.I've read hundreds of books and this is one of my all time favorites.

I purchased this hardbound edition of The Hobbit so as to enjoy the story again in a more desirable format. I am very pleased with the quality of the book binding, paper, and the inclusion of many of Tolkein's own drawings that are to be found in the appropriate places throughout."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first picked up this book at the bookstore, with my parents, I didn't know what to expect. I decided to get The Hobbit because of its immense popularity. Being 7 years old at the time, this was one of my first 300+ page chapter books. The introduction was simple enough: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins was sitting lazily outside his hobbit hole, with a long pipe, when the wizard, Gandalf, came by. Our first exposure to Gandalf is quite a bit different however. \\"Gandalf came by. Galdalf! If you heard only a quarter of what I heard about him, and I have only heard very little of what there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.\\" To the reader, Bilbo Baggins seemed the lazy type -- content with his quiet life, baking seedcakes, smoking pipes, and living in his father's enormous hobbit hole. One must question Gandalf's motives for choosing such a person to go on a daunting quest. The \\"daunting quest\\" is helping 13 dwarves, including the great Thorin Oakensheid, recapture their gold from the dragon, Smaug. Smaug smashed down on the merry village of Dale, utterly destroying the village itself, eating up all its inhabitants, and (to add insult to injury) taking all of the gold and moving it into the Lonely Mountain. Thorin himself was the grandson of The King Under the Mountain, and so was even more outraged at this attack. After eating most of his food, the dwarves sang a song, which made Bilbo feel many adventurous things. Hobbits do not normally even appreciate this type of music. Bilbo must use all of the qualities he never knew he had (i.e., bravery, wisdom, ingenuity, and unselfishness). Along the way, a major part of the book takes place in Bilbo's legendary meeting with Gollum, a peculiar underground creature who calls himself \\"My Precious\\". Here Bilbo picks up a magic ring that gives the wearer the power of invisibility. Now, to fully understand the curiousness of a hobbit going on an adventure, you may want to know details about them. Hobbits are half the height of humans, love to eat, dress in bright colors such as green and yellow, live in holes in the ground, and hate adventures or anything that is unpredictable. The Tooks are an exception to this, and are the unpopular relations of the Bagginses. This is why Bilbo has his \\"Tookish\\" side. Another amazing part is Bilbo's memorable confrontation with Smaug. I would recommend this book for all ages. As this was also the intended age, since J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this book for his children (unlike the darker, yet still fabulous Lord of the Rings). And many other children will probably also enjoy this book. Lastly, I have to say that my soft cover edition of The Hobbit has lasted four years, an amazing feat for a soft cover book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Normally this wouldn't have made my reading list... J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: or There and Back Again. I was well aware of Tolkien's books, but I wrote them off because \\"I don't do fantasy.\\" Elfs, dwarfs, hobbits... just not my thing. But I'm also a techno-geek, and as such the Lord of the Rings books and movies are required in order to maintain your geek cred membership card. I 'fessed up on Twitter that I hadn't read any of them, and immediately was pilloried by my peers... Then I was subjected to the debate as to whether Hobbit or LOTR should be read first. My peers even went so far as to send me BOTH of them via mail (thank you, ladies). Since I had both at the same time, I decided to start with Hobbit.Having explained the backstory as to *why* I read this, the question becomes did I enjoy this. And the answer is yes, I enjoyed it very much. Bilbo Baggins was quite human in his personality, and I could relate to his struggle between wanting to be left alone vs. living up to the expectations that others had of him. Watching him go from a timid hobbit afraid to do much of anything to a leader able to stand up to anything others could throw at him was something you could definitely learn from. And of course, his traveling companions mirrored much of society... totally behind you when you have something they want, but also ready to throw you under the bus moments later if fortunes turn.My friends didn't tell me until after I was done that this is technically considered a \\"children's\\" book. Could have fooled me. :) I enjoyed it, and it was probably the best way to get my mind wrapped around the LOTR concepts and imagery (since it's not a normal genre for me).

I have to say that this book may be up with some of my favorite books.I was introduced to this book from my father. I had to pick a book for my 10th grade reading project, and my dad brought up \\"The Hobbit\\". He said that when he was growing up, \\"The Hobbit\\" was one of his favorite books, so I decided to give it a try. It was worth it.What I truly like about the book is that there is almost always something going on. You never find yourself bored with it or wishing that the characters would be more exciting. I could not find a truly dull moment in the book. I love Bilbo's evolution as a character throughout the story. I don't think that I found anything that I didn't like about this book.If I had to recommend this book to someone, it would be to anyone who enjoys a true adventure. There are times in the book that you get sucked into the adventure and don't want to put the book down.

Bilbo's story is the classic fantasy yarn. The quest, the surprising courage and wisdom that comes in most unexpected packages - the sheer magic of it all - makes it a pleasure to read every single time.

For my money it's still the best one out there."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Picked this up on a whim at Wal-Mart. I'd never read any Tolkien before this. I'd seen the first Lord of the Rings movie and some of the second, and liked them, but I wasn't exactly wowed. I guess my main aversion to Tolkien has always been the same as my main aversion to almost all sci-fi and fantasy literature and film in existence: that, aside from humans, all races are either 100% good or 100% evil. Example, hobbits are 100% good whereas goblins are 100% evil. This just annoys me and turns me off from a lot of \\"high fantasy\\" and lots of sci-fi as well.Anyway, as for The Hobbit itself as a novel, I have to say, I was both underwhelmed and impressed at the same time. Having finished it, I was left with two distinct, seemingly incompatible impressions. Firstly, I didn't get how it had become regarded as such a great literary classic. It was good, I reasoned, but not great. Just a basic adventure story. And a little repetitive in its descriptions sometimes, and overall just chock with too many characters when, besides Bilbo, Gandalf and Thorin, they're all essentially just fodder, all basically the same guy with identical personalities (except for Bombur), with the only differences being their names.The adventure itself was also very episodic. Which is fine I guess, but it left me wondering whether Tolkien was just killing time to fill out the book before getting to Smaug. And the ending was somewhat anti-climactic after all of the buildup.There's also the distasteful revelation of what Beorn did with the goblin and warg he caught (killing prisoners makes him better than the evil goblins how?).Now, you might be wondering, why did I rate it so high if I have so complaints about it? Well, my friends, just because something isn't perfect doesn't mean I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself while reading it. As I said, I don't get how or why this became such a literary classic, but, for what it is, a fun adventure story, it's pretty great. It's funny and has a lot of tongue-in-cheek moments. Tolkien does comical stuff quite well, in a very deadpan way. The character of Bilbo was also very endearing and easy to identify with, and I liked how clever he was in figuring out problems using cunning and intelligence instead of fighting skills or strength.And, randomly, I liked the explanation given for Gollum's name, \\"Gollum\\" being the closest verbal approximation to a particular compulsive swallowing noise he makes. Very gross and creepy.All in all, despite my complaints above, I did really like this book, so much so that I got a second copy as a \\"backup\\" in case something befalls my first. I even sought out and enjoyed the animated Rankin-Bass film (I actually liked its Gollum better than Andy Serkis') and am looking forward to the new movie version of it coming out soon too.So, good book, loved it, please don't hate me for finding faults with it 'cause I did honestly enjoy it. :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Last year NPR published a list of books which were chosen by their listeners and a special committee that are considered the best 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books ever written. I am not sure if I agree with the selections made here but nevertheless one of my current reading projects is to read through the list. There are many old friends of this list; books that have become a part of my life over the years and have gone through multiple readings by myself indeed, but this reading project I am now on requires me to give them all a reread...I cannot wait!Anyway, the first on the list, as printed, is Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is not on this list. It is my personal feelings that LOTR cannot be appreciated or fully understood without having first read The Hobbit - ergo I have taken it upon myself to start with The Hobbit and proceed from there. First though let me do some house keeping.Amazon, in all of its wisdom, had thrown the reviews of ever edition of The Hobbit all into one bag. There have been quite a number of editions of this book since the first which was in 1937 with the first American edition being in 1938. I note from reading the reviews here that there is mass confusion, and indeed a lot of disappointment over ordering this book. The only thing I can tell you is to do your research and MAKE SURE you order the edition you want. Many of the sellers here do not know one from the other. This review is on the book, not on the edition. I first read this work in 1961 from a very ragged old paperback I found in a junk shop in Istanbul, Turkey. I think it was the Puffin edition, but cannot be sure. Since that time I have collected quite a number of these books - all different, but with very minor \\"errors\\" all the same story. (We silly Americans changed \\"Dwarves\\" to Dwarfs\\" because we felt Tolkien had made an error in spelling...Tolkien was NOT happy!) If a person is interested in such things, I personally would suggest an edition which includes Tolkien's original illustrations. That is of course just my personal preference.Anyway.....Before Lord of the Rings there was the Hobbit. I am most certainly not going into a plot summary here as all that has been well covered in the 2,000 plus reviews already posted. There are some important points I feel that need to be pointed out.First is the fact that to consider The Hobbit as a simple children's story would be a big mistake. Yes, older children will, do and can enjoy it, but like LOTRs, The Hobbit is still and all an adult book despite what others might tell you. This book needs to be read very carefully and savored.Second, the reader should note that when Tolkien transitions to LOTRs his style does change somewhat and the overall tone of the story darkens. It is noted that the story of how the \\"Ring\\" came into the hands of the Hobbits (Bilbo), is told. It should also be noted that the caste of characters changes from The Hobbit to LOTRs. Gandalf the Grey is present as is Bilbo and Elrod along with a couple of the Dwarves. For the most part though, the old characters found in The Hobbit are left there as the story moves on with the next three volumes.Third, the reading level is lower in The Hobbit than in LOTRs. This is important. I have found, over the years, than many young people an handle The Hobbit quite well, but when they then go to LOTRs, they find themselves in a bit over their heads and loose interest quite quickly...not all kids, mind you, but enough to be significant.Forth, Tolkien has used more of a fairy-tale mode in writing The Hobbit than he did in LOTRs. This throws some folks off when they transition from the first to the later.I have thoroughly enjoyed this read over the years. I as sorry to find that NPR had not included it on their \\"official\\" list along with LOTRs...but then I suppose that everyone that will conceivably read the list will have some disagreement...that seems to be the nature of lists.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is magnificent.

I also forgot how much the Hobbits like to eat, a funny little quirk that makes these characters even more loveable. I got much more from it now and can not wait to see the movie. Reading the book gave me an idea on how Peter Jackson is going to present the story in two parts. I ordered the LOTR blu-ray's and an going to read the book again before I watch them. The book I got was not the book I ordered though. I ordered the green version where the pages looked molded but got a golden 50th anniversary edition. I believe the one I got costs a little more then the one I ordered and I paid the lower price but I would have rather have had what I ordered.Update: 07/31/12 at 03:35. I just read on Variety's web site that Peter Jackson will be releasing 3 films for the Hobbit. He is going to pull from the Silmarillion & other Tolkien works as well as embellish on the gaps in the book The Hobbit. He is going to address the rise of the Necromancer aka Sauron and go into more detail on Bilbo, Gandalf, Galadriel along with Legolas Greenleaf. If you do not own this book buy it now, the prices will only increase as the DEC 14th 2012 release date for the movie draws near. I hope you will cherish this masterpiece as much as I do.

(Penguin Press Science)","review":"Suppose two generals each have two choices: attack or defend. The decisions are simultaneous and private. Military strategy favors the offensive, so both really want the other guy to defend while he attacks and really does not want to defend while the other guy attacks. On the other hand, war is extremely bloody. Both generals agree that mutual defense is better than mutual aggression. What should we expect the generals to do?Intuitively, you might think that mutual defense is a reasonable outcome since peace is an agreeable outcome. However, this fails to appreciate individual incentives. If one general knows the other will play defensively, he should take advantage of his rival's cooperation and attack. As a result, mutual aggression is the only sustainable outcome. But war is worse for both parties. This is the tragedy known as the prisoner's dilemma: both parties end up in a mutually despised outcome but cannot commit to the better result due to their selfish individual incentives.The prisoner's dilemma has been around since the 1940s. For the next three decades or so, game theorists believed that repeated interaction could solve the cooperation problem. Perhaps war favors the aggressor, but only a slight degree. If so, the generals could agree to maintain the peace as long as the other guy does. But the moment one slips up, the generals will fight all-out war. The threat of a painful breakdown in peace might incentivize the generals to never start conflict, even if a surprise attack might yield short-term benefits.However, the cooperative solution remained elusive...until Robert Axelrod's The Evolution of Cooperation. For a three sentence summary, Axelrod shows that these generals can adopt a \\"grim trigger\\" strategy and credibly promise infinite punishment in the future to enforce cooperation in the present. Thus, even bitter rivals can maintain friendly relations over the long term. In essence, we can rationally expect cooperative relationships in even the worst of environments.Despite how I glossed over all of the intricacies of the repeated prisoner's dilemma, The Evolution of Cooperation is a must-read for that result alone. But the book is so much more. I first picked it up during my junior year of college. I hadn't taken a math class in five years, and I was a C student back then. Yet, despite the sophistication of the argument, I understood exactly what was going on. Axelrod's exposition of formal theory in this book is quite simply the best you will ever see.The fourth chapter is also nothing short of awesome. Axelrod takes cooperation to the limit in his study of the \\"live and let live\\" trench warfare system during World War I. For a significant chunk of the war, troops spent most of their time deliberately shooting to miss their enemies in the opposing trench. While shooting and killing an enemy soldier provides a marginal gain should a battle take place, said act of shooting could spark a larger battle in which both sides would suffer causalities. Thus, for the sake of self-preservation, armies avoided fighting. This culminated in the famous Christmas Truce, in which the troops actually got out of their trenches and began fraternizing with the so-called enemies. (In that vain, you should watch Joyeux Noel if you have not already.)If there is one issue with the book, it is the emphasis on tit-for-tat. Tit-for-tat is a less aggressive way of responding to your opponent's aggression than grim trigger; rather than punishing forever, you merely punish at the next available opportunity. Axelrod correctly identifies a bunch of nice properties of tit-for-tat, especially how well it plays nice with others. However, as every modern game theorist knows, tit-for-tat is not subgame perfect and thus is extremely questionable on theoretical grounds. Of course, we would not have found out about that had this book not existed, so this just further solidifies how important The Evolution of Cooperation is."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

(Penguin Press Science)","review":"In the 1980s, political scientist Robert Axelrod organized two competitions of programs playing iterated prisoner's dilemma against each other; both times, the winner was a 5-line FORTRAN program called Tit for Tat by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport: first cooperate, and then do whatever the opponent did during the previous round. This book grew out of a 9-page article describing these competitions, and it covers more material: suppose a player can choose among several strategies to play against his neighbors in a 2-dimensional universe; can Tit for Tat invade a population of meanies (players who always defect)? Under certain circumstances, it can.In order to illustrate a game theory concept, Axelrod quotes a 1965 memo to Robert McNamara, LBJ's Secretary of Defense, from his adviser John McNaughton, which was published in the Pentagon Papers. It defines the aims of the United States in South Vietnam as \\"70%--To avoid a humiliating US defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor). 20%--To keep SVN (and then adjacent) territory from Chinese hands. 10%--To permit the people of SVN to enjoy a better, freer way of life.\\" The sheer self-referentiality of it boggles my mind."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"Overall, the book is interesting and provides nuanced insight into what could easily be dismissed as something too simple to be true or useful.The author's basic assertion - that \\"tit-for-tat\\" is the best strategy to produce long-term cooperation - seems hardly worthy of an entire book. Also, the primary evidence in support of this assertion is a few simplistic computer simulations from the early 1980s. This may not seem terribly compelling. However, each chapter supports the assertion in a different way and cuts to the heart of why \\"tit-for-tat\\" is, indeed, a good strategy in life as well as in game theory.The best summary, perhaps, can be found on p. 54:\\"What accounts for TIT FOR TAT's robust success is its combination of being nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear. Its niceness prevents it from getting into unnecessary trouble. Its retaliation discourages the other side from persisting whenever defection is tried. Its forgiveness helps restore mutual cooperation. And its clarity makes it intelligible to the other player, thereby eliciting long-term cooperation"},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

It's a no-brainer that this book should be at least Summer reading for anyone interested in sociology, evolutionary biology or game theory. However, this book does not get the attention it deserves in the world of legal education. I believe it should be required reading for every law student.

I cannot recommend The Evolution of Cooperation highly enough."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"It is interesting to note this book which was written more than 20 years ago is still fresh in ideas.Some philosophers said human are born benign, but some said otherwise. The most famous answer was given over three hundred years ago by Thomas Hobbes. He was pessimistic and argued that before government existed, the state of nature was dominated by the problem of selfish individuals who competed on ruthless terms and life was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short. He thought cooperation could not develop without a central authority.You may have heard, or played, the Prisoners' Dilemma. The setting was that two criminals together committed a serious crime were caught. The detective kept them in separate cells and asked each of them to confess the crime. Circumstantial evidence was weak and so if both of them cooperated and kept silence, they would only be convicted of a minor offense. The detective told each of them that if he confessed and turned into a prosecution witness against the other, he would be acquitted while the other would get the maximum sentence. If both of them confessed, they could beg leniency for a lighter sentence. The game theorists proved that the best strategy for the game was to confess and to defect against the other. This may partly prove that Thomas Hobbes was right.The crux of the game was that the prisoners did not know the intention of the other party. They could only guess the scenarios and calculate the probability of returns. Axelrod developed a variation of the game, involving repeated game interactions between two players with the results of each interactions known to them. He gave scores to each game played: 3 points each for mutual cooperation, 1 points each for punishment of mutual defection, 5 points for defection leading to conviction of the other, and 0 point for keeping silence while being defected against. When previous performance of the other side was known, the player could take it into account and develop a strategy to take advantage of cooperation and also timely defection to gain points. There is afterall merit in cooperation sometimes.A computer programming tournament of the iterated game was organized. Programmers engaged various strategies, ranging from algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, occasional defection, being nice or forgiving to induce cooperation, etc. The winner of the game was the program Tic-for-tac. Its strategy was to be nice and cooperative on the first move, then consistently repaying cooperation or defection according to the last move of the opponent. Analysis showed that the success of Tic-for-tac was based on four factors: being nice and never defect first, being provocable as it would retaliate by defecting whenever defected upon, being forgiving as it only retaliated once; being clear in intention as its strategy was quickly known by its opponents. Axelrod concluded that these basic characteristics were conducive to developing cooperation. Being nice and forgiving were essential attributes while making them known was also important. Being provocable was a good defense from being bullied of being nice and could raise the chance of survival.A further conclusion by Axelrod was that Tic-for-tac was robust even in a hostile environment. In such an environment where there was no cooperation, participants would gain a few points through mutual defection and a single Tic-for-tac would die out. However, if there were a small number of Tic-for-tac in such environment, interactions of cooperation between them would bring more points. If they were a close group, then such in-group interactions, however small in number, would be better off than the always-defect majority. As a result, this Tic-for-tac group would grow in the population and cooperation would eventually evolve to be the dominating strategy. This phenomenon has been observed in the development of many civilizations.The book also found that cooperation did not necessarily occur between friendly parties. It described the case of the trench warfare in World War I. Known as Live and Let Live, troops on both sides of the trench warfare spontaneously developed a strategy of cooperation whereby they shelled the other side according to a fixed schedule only known to the soldiers and allowing either side to minimize casualties. The generals were satisfied that the war was going on with the shelling but the combat line was neither advanced nor breached. The soldiers followed a similar strategy as Tic-for-tac that they never directly shelled bunkers nor supplies first, always retaliated with more accurate shelling when directly hit, always returned to pretentious shelling afterwards, and making sure that such behaviour was known to the enemy. This cooperative phenomenon which went on for a long time during the war saved many lives.From the perspective of a reformer, Axelrod proposed the strategy on how to promote cooperation. 1. Enlarging the shadow of the future - Mutual cooperation can be stable if the future is sufficiently important relative to the present because the players can each use an implicit threat of retaliation against the other's defection. 2. Change the payoffs - This is usually adopted by government in raising the payoffs in terms of taxes, harsh punishment for crime and obligations to honour contracts; that is: to raise the payoffs for cooperation and vice versa for defection. 3. Teach people to care about each other - Through education, adults shape the values of children so that the preference of the new citizens will incorporate their own welfare with the welfare of others. 4. Teach reciprocity - Always reciprocating defection may not be the standard of morality for some religions, for example the teaching of always cooperative by turning the other cheek. However, reciprocity is a robust strategy in upholding cooperation and avoiding exploitation. The self-policing feature of the strategy gives an incentive to cooperation. Teaching reciprocity to those with whom one will interact will help build a mutually rewarding relationship. 5. Improve recognition abilities - The ability to recognize the other players from past interactions and to remember the relevant features of those interactions is necessary to sustain cooperation.http://raympoonnotes.playgroundhk.com/2008/03/evolution-of-cooperation.html"},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

If this book keeps you out of one court battle, its worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"Without question, the case studies in this book have applications in biology, sociology, international relations, economics and business. The basic question put forward is, \\"How is it possible, that in an environment of mutual hostility where acting selfishly will lead to gain against your opponent(s), cooperative behavior between the antagonists will emerge and become the dominant long-term behavior?\\" It turns out that it is easy to see how such behavior can emerge, even in hostile battlefield conditions. In fact, cooperative behavior has distinct evolutionary advantages.The solution is found within game theory, in particular the situation known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. Two people, (one and two), who jointly committed a crime are arrested for the crime and placed in separate rooms where they cannot communicate. The police interrogate him or her separately and offer each individual a deal. If they defect and testify against their comrade, they will be given a reduced sentence. In this situation, there are four possible outcomes:1) Neither defects - both go free, each is considered to have earned a positive reward.2) One defects and two does not - one is set free and two serves a long sentence.3) Two defects and one does not - two is set free and one serves a long sentence.4) One and two both defect - each serve a reduced sentence.In the problem, reward values are assigned to the results, and typical values are1) Both one and two are both assigned a value of +3.2) One is assigned a value of +3 and two the value of -5.3) Two is assigned a value of +3 and one the value of -5.4) One and two are both assigned a value of -1.It is clear that each prisoner wants to avoid the situation where they are the only one who serves time in jail. Therefore, if this event will only occur once, then option four will be the result and cooperation will not take place.However, if both prisoners have the potential for a future relationship, where that relationship has the real potential for rewards for cooperation and punishments for defecting, then option one can emerge. The best demonstration of this is what took place in some sectors of the western front in the First World War. When the same units faced each other for extended periods of time, a live and let live policy emerged on both sides. Each side adopted a strategy of not engaging in lethal force, unless the other side did. When required to expend artillery ammunition to demonstrate aggressiveness to superiors, they would shoot the same target at the same time of the day. Since their firing was predictable, soldiers on the other side would know to avoid that area and in fact would often climb out of their trench to observe the explosions.There were instances where German snipers would demonstrate their prowess by continuing to hit the same position on a wall until they made a hole. Therefore, even though superiors admonished the soldiers to continue to kill the enemy and both sides had the capability, the fact that they had a lengthy relationship allowed the cooperation to occur. These phenomena did not take place in regions where units did not face each other for extended periods.The first chapter describes tournaments, where computer programs competed against each other by defecting or cooperating and the scoring is similar to that of the Prisoner's Dilemma already mentioned. What emerged as the most successful tactic, even when the results of the first round were incorporated into the second round, is the TIT FOR TAT. This strategy is very simple, cooperate in the first round and for each successive round, do what the opponent did in the previous one.I was fascinated by these results and it was easy to see the obvious implications for relationships of all types. For cooperation to occur, all that is necessary is that there be the expectation of a continued relationship and the potential for future rewards/penalties. What makes it especially interesting is that no appeal to morality, ethics or any other abstract concept need be made. The behavior occurs as a consequence of an increase in the long-term gain for all parties.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

(Penguin Press Science)","review":"The goal of a model is to explain complex reality with parsimony. This means that a model is a simplification of reality or approximation to some aspect of our world. Likewise, the goal of game-model is also to explain reality by abstracting the important features of reality for a particular problem.Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) game has represented the reconstructed reality of international politics without overriding or overarching government authority, because it does not only explain persuasively why states have suffered from the problem of non-cooperation, but also show what states should do in international anarchy.In PD game, the more self-interest each player pursues, the more collective interest both players lose. Nevertheless, they can not stop pursuing their self-interests. Otherwise, they will be faced to the worst case. As a result, all of players do not escape from social inefficiency and eternal conflict.Hobbes, who described human existence in the state-of-nature as Bellum omnium contra omnes, suggested Leviathan as the solution to the dilemma. However, in that states exist in \\"international\\" anarchy, the argument is meaningless. If Hobbesian state-of-nature is the reality among nations, the world is in a constant state of war.Axelrod finds the new puzzle in here: In situations where each individual has an incentive to be selfish, how can cooperation ever develop? His goal is to explain the cooperation under anarchy. To do so, he designs a variation of PD game with R > (T+S) / 2 value and introduces the concept of time. His explanation depends on the iterated PD game (IPD) where players do not know which is the final move.Achieving socially efficient or Pareto-superior mutual cooperation in PD game is possible if the reciprocity works as times go by and the players consider the future consequences of their present actions with foresight (the reciprocity is emphasized much more than foresight). Especially, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) strategy and the Shadow of Future play a core role in explaining cooperation.First of all, he sets five preconditions for IPD: (1) players cannot make any threat or prior commitment (2) there is no knowledge of the other players&iexcl; upcoming move, as each game is simultaneous (3) the interaction among players can not be avoided (4) there is no way to change the other player's payoffs (5) the only communication allowed is through the player's own prior behavior.Also, the concept of a discount parameter, w, which represents the degree to which the payoffs of each move are discounted relative to the previous move, is introduced. Thus, w is the weight of the next move in the future. As times go by, value tends to decrease in negative squares.This can be represented as the sum of infinite series. The higher the value of w, the more likely the players will meet in the future. Contrarily, since 0&lt;w&lt;1, the closer w is to 0, the less likely the players will meet in the future. Also, he divides available strategies into three: All D (Always defect), TFT (cooperate in the first move, then do what the other player did on the previous move), & All C (Always cooperate).From this setting, Proposition (1) is derived: If the discount parameter, w is sufficiently high, there is no best strategy independent of the strategy used by the other player.Also, Axelrod runs two computer tournaments by inviting the top game theorists, and reports that Rapoport&iexcl;s TFT was the best strategy. Although 15 programs in 1st tournament & 63 programs in 2nd tournament were submitted, TFT won all of them. TFT got the average score of 504.5 in 1st round & the score of 434.73 in 2nd round. Why?He divides the reasons into 4: (1) TFT avoids unnecessary conflict by cooperating as long as the other player cooperates; this is being nice and never being the first to defect (2) TFT has no hesitation in retaliating in the face of the other's defection; that is, TFT does not wait to see if the defection was a mistake, as defection is to be punished immediately.(3) TFT is open to forgiveness after responding to a provocation; in this way, a TFT player do not wait to reward cooperation (4) TFT has the clarity of behavior, so that the other player can adapt to TFT pattern more easily than others (TFT program length was the shortest). Thus, TFT could do well over a wide range of environments, against both nice and defection strategies.Next, the stability of cooperation based upon TFT is discussed. He explores the relationship between a native population uniform strategy & a newcomer strategy. He assumes the existence of a native population employing strategy B & a newcomer using strategy A.If the players interact with each other one at a time, the expected utility of the newcomer with A might be higher than the expected utility of one of the native population. In that case, A is said to invade B.Otherwise, B is said to be collectively stable. When p is the frequency of a newcomer interacting with other newcomers, the condition of invasion by newcomers is:(p)*EU(newcomer|newcomer)+(1-p)*EU(newcomer|native)>EU(native|native)If p is between 0 & 1, newcomers&iexcl; strategies can invade the strategy of the native population and vice versa. So, can TFT invade All D? Can All D invade TFT? Assume w = 0.9.(p)*EU(TFT|TFT)+(1-p)*EU(TFT|All D)>EU(All D| All D)(p)*[R/(1-w)]+(1-p)*[S+(w*P)/(1-w)]>P/(1-w)(p)*[3/(1-0.9)]+(1-p)*[0+0.9*1/(1-0.9)]>[1/(1-0.9)](p)*(30)+(1-p)*(9)>1021p+9>1021p>1p>1/21(p)*EU(All D|All D)+(1-p)*EU(All D|TFT)>EU(TFT|TFT)(p)*[P/(1-w)]+(1-p)*[T+(w*P)/(1-w)]>R/(1-w)(p)*[1/(1-0.9)]+(1-p)*[5+0.9*1/(1-0.9)]>[3/(1-0.9](p)*(10)+(1-p)*(14)>3010p+14&iexcl;V14p>3010p+14-14p>30-4p+14>30-4p>16p&lt;-4Thus, when the shadow of future is very strong (w = 0.9), TFT can invade All D if there is more than 1 TFT invader for every 21 All D natives. It takes so few. Also, All D cannot invade TFT when w is sufficiently high (strictly speaking, the critical value of w for TFT to be collectively stable is 2/3).From this, he derives additional 6 Propositions. The most interesting one among them is Proposition (6)The strategies which can invade All D in a cluster with the smallest value of p are those which are maximally discriminating, such as TFT. This means that cooperation is possible even in the world of All D, as long as small clusters of discriminating invaders with TFT have a small proportion of interactions in the Hobbes state-of-nature.More interestingly, he shows that cooperation could emerge even without friendship. Let-and-Let-Live system (i.e., the static nature of trench warfare) might be considered as the prototype that small TFT interactions invaded the strategy of All D native population on war. However, Axelrod also mentions that the stability of cooperation based upon the reciprocity can be impaired by (1) the rotation of troops (2) the artillery less dependent on reciprocity for its life than infantry in trench (3) the raids.However, pointing out that Chapter 4 is about interaction among human beings who can evaluate the reciprocity and respond to it rationally, he argues that such understanding by the participants is not really necessary for cooperation to emerge and prove stable.Therefore, he argues that (1) cooperation is possible without morality or foresight as shown in the relationship between crocodiles and crocodile birds (2) the patterns of unconscious responsiveness of bacteria or organism might lead to the cooperation based upon the reciprocity (3) the evolutionary process depends upon individual advantage (not benefits to whole group), which unintentionally leads to the cooperation based upon the reciprocity.In addition, he suggests four advices on how to choose effectively under a given strategic setting: (1) Do not be envious; TFT never wins head to head, so players must realize that an IPD is not a zero-sum game (2) Do not be the first to defect so long as the future remains important, based on Proposition 1 (3) Reciprocate cooperation and defection but begin with cooperation (4) Do not be too clever; be clear about your strategy so others can figure out what you are doing. Again, TFT is the strategy which satisfies all of the advices.Especially, five ways on how to promote cooperation is discussed in aspect of changing the strategic setting: (1) Enlarge the Shadow of the Future by making the interactions more durable and more frequent (2) Change the payoffs; The change of payoffs determines the incentives of behavior (3) Teach people to care about each other (4) Teach reciprocity; Do not forget the negative effect of All C that might spoil the other players (5) Improve recognition abilities; Accumulate the credibility of reciprocity through good history of interactions.Finally, the social structure of cooperation is discussed. The social structure influences on how the evolution of cooperation can begin. The influence might constrain or facilitate cooperation, or make the evolutionary process of cooperation dynamic. Namely, the relationship between the social structure and the cooperation in IPD can be understood as being equal to the relationship between the culture and the institution.As the institutional performance depends largely upon culture, so the speed and the range of the evolution of cooperation is determined greatly by the social structure such as labels, reputation, regulation, and territoriality. Fist, labels (i.e., stereotype) might decrease the importance of the benefits due to mutual cooperation. This is related closely to the debates on the distributional effect of collective interest.Second, the importance of reputation as a bully might delay the speed of cooperation. Third, relating to regulation, the government in here is not Leviathan, but a player interacting with the governed on compliance and flexibility. In this case, the efficiency of the exchange of flexibility with compliance determines the evolutionary process of cooperation among them.Finally, in that the territorial system (i.e., positional picture) influences the way the players interact with each other which determines the course of the evolutionary process, territoriality as the social structure matters.Axelrod concludes: (1) Cooperation has staying power but the biggest problem is getting cooperation started (2) Ratchet effect: Cooperation is successful incrementally, as clusters of cooperation build upon clusters cooperation (3) Cooperation is a rational possibility, even without a central authority, as long as the future is sufficiently important (4) Reconciling individual interest with collective interest is possible by TFT.Recently, Fearon (1995), Morrow (1999) and Powell (2005) argue that one of the reasons why the Pareto-inferior outcomes such as ex post costly wars have recurred is due to the commitment problem. Morrow (1999: 92) maintains, Commitment is a problem when actors' incentives change over time.Although Axelrod and they consider the concept of time seriously, their conclusions are totally different. While they focus on explaining the cause of war in PD (i.e., In PD, one player's commitment to C can not be believed by other player), his interest is placed on explaining the cause of cooperation in PD (i.e., what matters in PD, is not unilateral commitment, but mutual learning effect by TFT).However, Axelrod seems to be superior to them, because he might explain both war and cooperation with the level of w. But, Fearon, Morrow, and Powell might suffer from selection bias, because the commitment problem explains only wars.ReferencesAxelrod, Robert (1984). The Evolution of Cooperation.

(Penguin Press Science)","review":"Robert Axelrod's \\"The Evolution of Cooperation\\" is a classic in our understanding of why cooperation occurs in humans. The book begins with a simple question (Page vii): \\"When should a person cooperate, and when should that person be selfish, in an ongoing interaction with another person?\\" The ultimate explanation for the choice, according to Axelrod (and evolutionary theorist William Hamilton) is evolution. This is thoroughly discussed in Chapter 5, which outlines how cooperation could evolve as an adaptive behavior within a species.One key part of this book is a round robin tournament in which a variety of strategies are tested in an \\"Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\\" game. Prisoner's Dilemma is a game among the variety of those used in what is called Game Theory. The premise is simple: two thieves have been caught by the police. The policy offer a deal: Rat out your partner, s/he gets a tough sentence and the turncoat gets off. If both rat one another out, they both get a tougher sentence (although not as bad as if one person keeps quiet and the other one squeals). The assumption is that neither trusts the other; they rat one another out; they are both worse off than if they had kept their mouths shut.One approach to Prisoner's Dilemma that did the best was Anatol Rapoport's entry, \\"TIT FOR TAT.\\" Here, one keeps one's mouth shut, for example, as long as one's confederate does not rat him/her out. If the other person rats one out, you turn the tables and rat him/her out. If the other player quits ratting out, then one ceases ratting the other out. This was the simplest of the entries, according to Axelrod. But it is the one that worked best. In short, cooperate as long as the other player cooperates; be nasty when the other player is nasty; don't hold grudges and keep punishing if the other person begins cooperating.Of course, things are actually more complex than this, but the above gives a sense of the nature of the winning strategy. It does raise questions about the common assumption that everyone is selfish and will always do what is needed to advance one's interests at the expense of others. It begins to raise approaches to understanding \\"altruism,\\" self-sacrifice that benefits others (and would also benefit the altruist in the long run).At any rate, this is a thought provoking book and a genuine classic, with many applications in public life and in our own daily lives."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"In his book, \\"The Evolution of Cooperation,\\" Robert Axelrod states that cooperation can be achieved by all parties and he further explains how cooperation may emerge between enemies in unfavorable conditions. Axelrod uses historical examples to demonstrate his thesis as well as supports his examples with variables such as cooperation theory, game theory, and reciprocity discussed throughout the book.The international system level of analysis is featured significantly throughout his book, and he employs its basic characteristic of posing general questions to effectively describe patterns of outcomes, although not determine specific outcomes. For example, Axelrod inquires how the live and let live system emerged, how it was/ is sustained, when might it end, and what are the limitations of its use? He then examines how each concept and theory can be further elaborated. By varying the focus of his analysis, he is able to study elements of cooperation between both protagonists and antagonists.Axelrod's proposition is empirical in its purposes and is meant to explain how cooperation may emerge. He suggests that cooperation can be as simple as acting offensively but in a predictive manner, and that cooperation between opposing forces does not imply that either side must surrender physically, morally, or in principle (to any demands) by the other side. Axelrod states that cooperation may emerge in situations which, at first glance, probably would not naturally elicit cooperation.International relations theory is essentially, an analysis of different states to determine how each may cooperate with another and the relationships that develop when states decide to cooperate with one another. Whether referred to as diplomacy, reciprocity, crisis management, live and let live technique, or otherwise, cooperation and cooperative resolution equals success."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"It's perhaps one of the most fasicinating quirks of psychological research that one of the most ground breaking findings in human psychology was achieved by means of a computer tournament.That tournament was sponsored by Robert Axelrod of the University of Michigan who developed a computer environment that would different game programs against each other to determine which survival strategy was best adapted to survival.For those believers of life, nasty, brutish and short, the findings were nothing short of astonishing: specifically that when actors were invovled in situations where they would be repeatedly interacting with each other, survival was best enhanced by cooperation.Otherwise known as \\"the golden rule\\" of doing unto others as you would have done unto you, a computer program known as Tit for Tat outperformed all other competitors by first seeking cooperation and then narrowly mirroring the actions of its counterparts.In other words, if Tit for Tat met a competitor it would first seek cooperation. If the competitor cooperated, Tit for Tat would thereafter cooperate. If the competitor defected, Tit for Tat would itself immediately defect but thereafter again seek cooperation by cooperating whenever the competitor thereafter chose to cooperate.Since the publication of the original article detailing Axelrod's findings twenty five years ago, the study of cooperation or reciprocal ultruism has found applications not only in human behavior but also in genetics and evolution itself.Inside every cell of your body are anywhere ranging to around 1000 mitochondria. If the test for different life forms are organisms which have their own DNA, mitochondria qualify. Yet, they have always been a part of human biology. And they have been there own life domain for the better part of two billion (or more) years.Mitochondria's ability to productively work with their host cells is an example of both genetic and biological reciprocal ultruism.Like any ground breaking work, like Newton's Principia or Darwin's Origin of Species, I was attracted to this work so I could better witness the original flash of genius. And like with Newton's Principia and Darwin's Origin of Species I was not disappointed but found many instances in which the original researchers had advanced speculations that frankly would remain fertile areas for further research. In the case of this book, I would include Axelrod's discussion of how to better take advantage of the benefits of reciprocal ultruism and also how systems can be more reciprocal ultruism friendly.Interestingly, the places where reciprocal ultruism has tragically broken down are places that would easily be predicted by the over arching theory.For students of genetics, biology and even behavior I can't recommend this book highly enough. In fact, in addition to this book I would also recommed the following:Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley which discusses the genetic aspects of reciprocal ultruism;Prisoner's Dilemma by William Poundstone which discusses game theory as a branch of theoretical mathematics;Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins which is just fun; andOneness by Jeffrey Moses which provides verbatim quotes of the golden rule and other doxology by means of direct quotes from the world's leading religions.

(Penguin Press Science)","review":"As the title indicates this book explores the topic of cooperation, particularly how it can emerge in a decentralized population that seeks individual maximization of self-interest. The book is split into two main sections. The first discusses cooperation through game-theory analysis of computer tournaments played. This includes the various strategies used, and the ones that enjoyed the most success. The second discusses the implications of the findings from the first section, and real-world applications in the fields of biology, politics, sociology etc. While the first section is somewhat dry and abstract, the second section anchors the concepts and is very applicable and practical.Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- \\"The analysis of the data from these tournaments reveals four properties which tend to make a decision rule successful: avoidance of unnecessary conflict by cooperating as long as the other player does, provocability, in the face of an uncalled for defection by the other, forgiveness after responding to a provocation, and clarity of behavior so that the other player can adapt to your pattern of action.\\"2- \\"What accounts for TIT FOR TAT's robust success is its combination of being nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear. Its niceness prevents it from getting into unnecessary trouble. Its retaliation discourages the other side from persisting whenever defection is tried. Its forgiveness helps restore mutual cooperation. And its clarity makes it intelligible to the other player, thereby eliciting long-term cooperation.\\"3- \\"Thus cooperation can emerge even in a world of unconditional defection. The development cannot take place if it is tried only by scattered individuals who have no change to interact with each other. But cooperation can emerge from small clusters of discriminating individuals, as long as these individuals have even a small proportion of their interactions with each other.\\"4- \\"The live-and-let-live system that emerged in the bitter trench warfare of World War I demonstrates that friendship is hardly necessary for cooperation based upon reciprocity to get started. Under suitable circumstances, cooperation can develop even between antagonists.\\"5- How to Choose Effectively: \\"The advice takes the form of four simple suggestions for how to do well in a durable iterated Prisoner's Dilemma: 1) Don't be envious. 2) Don't be the first to defect. 3) Reciprocate both cooperation and defection. 4) Don't be too clever.\\"6-\\"...not being nice may look promising at first, by in the long run it can destroy the very environment it needs for its own success.\\"7- \\"Keeping one's intentions hidden is useful in a zero-sum game (e.g Chess) where any inefficiency in the other players behavior wil be to your benefit. But in a non-zero-sum setting it does not always pay to be so clever.\\"8- \\"So to promote cooperation through modification of the payoffs...it is only necessary to make the long-term incentive for mutual cooperation greater than the short-term incentive for defection.\\"9- \\"The ability to recognize the other player from past interactions, is necessary to sustain cooperation. Without these abilities, a player could not use any form of reciprocity and hence could not encourage the other to cooperate.\\"10- \\"The ability to recognize defection when it occurs is not the only requirement for successful cooperation to emerge, but it is certainly an important one.\\"11- \\"This kind of stereotyping has two unfortunate consequences...the obvious consequence is that everyone is doing worse than necessary because mutual cooperation between the groups could have raised everyone's core...while both groups suffer from lack of mutual cooperation, the members of the minority group suffer more.\\"12- \\"The trick is to set the stringency of the standard high enough to get most of the social benefits of regulation, and not so high as to prevent the evolution of a stable pattern of voluntary compliance from almost all of the companies.\\"13- \\"In an organizational or business setting, the best way to secure this accountability would be to keep track not only of the person's success in that position, but also the state in which the position was left to the next occupant.\\"14- \\"The core of the problem on how to achieve rewards from cooperation is that trial and error in learning is slow and painful. The conditions may all be favorable for long-run developments, but we may not have the time to wait for blind processes to move us slowly toward mutually rewarding strategies based upon reciprocity. Perhaps if we understand the process better, we can use our foresight to speed up the evolution of cooperation.\\""},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

It is a small and readable book which every chapter left me thinking, \\"Of course, why didn't I think of it like that?\\"The core of the book focuses on a computer simulation tournament of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The Prisoner's Dilemma is a simple game as follows: two convicts have been arrested and are interrogated separately. If they both remain silent, they only get three (or some other nominal amount) years of prison. But if one snitches on the other, he goes free and the other serves ten years. This gives both of them the incentive to snitch, however if they both end up snitching on each other, then they both get life sentences.This simple game has many parallels in the real world where there is an incentive to \\"defect\\" but it would be mutually beneficial if both parties \\"cooperated\\": nuclear proliferation, bipartisan cooperation, arms races, and the relationship between rule enforcers and the ruled. In this book, Axelrod details the results of the computer tournament and the properties of the computer players' algorithms that did well (along with the algorithms that did not do so well).From these computer experiments as a baseline, Axelrod extrapolates to the real world using examples from \\"Live and let live\\" situations that naturally occurred between enemies in World War I trench warfare to practical advice for those who seek to foster cooperation. \\"The Evolution of Cooperation\\" provides a refreshingly optimistic (while still realistic) view of cooperation that can be cultivated even in ruthless environments.This is a quick read and a must read introduction for managers, politicians, social workers, teachers, or anyone who seeks to lead the world by bringing out the best from people."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

Axelrod based his book on the famous Prisoner's Dilemma, a classic game created in 1950 by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher of the Rand Corporation. Canadian mathematician Albert W. Tucker added the prison sentence payoffs and gave the game its colorful name. Players have two choices: cooperation or betrayal. Axelrod organized two repeating Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments played by computer programs devised by game theorists, scientists and other experts. His analysis of the tournaments' results confirmed that cooperation is always a better long-term strategy than betrayal and, thus, evolution has favored it. This book, based on that analysis, has become a true classic. getAbstract suggests that anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of cooperation should start by reading this pivotal, illuminating study."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"Book review:Axelrod, Robert. (1984) The evolution of cooperation. New York: Basic BooksCooperation at the long runThe question Robert Axelrod poses in his book \\"the evolution of cooperation\\" relevant for all social sciences is; under what conditions will cooperation emerge in a world of egoists without central authority? Axelrod explores this question by the establishment of two tournaments of the prisoner's dilemma game. In this game two players are competing against each other to get the greatest pay off. The game is characterized by four mechanisms. The unavailability of mechanisms to enforce threats or commitments, reputations of other players are unknown, there is no way to eliminate other players and there is no way to change the players pay off. If both players cooperate in the prisoner's dilemma game they get rewarded with payoff's R = 3 (reward) points. If one of the players cooperates while the other defects the player who defected gets T = 5 (temptation to defect) and the other player receives S = 0 (sucker effect). Finally, if both players defect they will be rewarded with P = 1 (punishment).During the two prisoner's dilemma game tournaments the simplest strategy, and the strategy which only could reach a draw as the best result, won from all the other strategies. TITFORTAT was this superior strategy, TITFORTAT cooperates in the first move and than does whatever the other player does in the previous move. The TITFORTAT strategy was superior over other strategies due to its characteristics. TITFORTAT is a strategy that is nice because it cooperates in the first move. The strategy is forgivable if the other player decides to cooperate again. Furthermore TITFORTAT is a clear strategy that makes it easy to identify and finally it is retaliatory, because it retaliates if the other player defects. These features make TITFORTAT a robust strategy.Due to this robustness TITFORTAT won the strategy, because other strategies, for example TESTER, where unsuccessful and did not survive during the development of the game. TESTER defects on the first move and in this manner tries to identify the other player's repose. After a defect from the other player TESTER is forgivable and cooperates and than plays TITFORTAT. No other strategy was able to win from TITFORTAT in the long run, which makes the TITFORTAT strategy collectively stable and thus unable to be invaded. This brings Axelrod to the conclusion that in a world of unconditional defections cooperation can emerge.Axelrod links his findings to empirical evidence, from, for example, WO 1 and from cooperation in biological systems. Axelrod describes the live and let live strategies during the warfare in WO 1. The live and let live strategy is consistent with his theory of the evolution of cooperation. Together with William D. Hamilton, Axelrod discusses several biological systems. Biological systems seem to be consistent with the theory of cooperation as well. Biological evolution is determined by natural selection, which is marked by cooperation rather than competition. Cooperation is thus the outcome of a slow process, which according to Axelrod needs to speed up.In short this book is accessible for people who are not familiar with game theory due to the simplicity of the game and the clear structure of the book. Through the interesting empirical insights, applications and relevance of the theory of cooperation this book is enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation.

(Penguin Press Science)","review":"If you read this book as long ago as I did, you probably first heard about it from Douglas Hofstadter's \\"Metamagical Themas\\" column in _Scientific American_, or the book in which his columns were collected. (If you're just now being introduced to this book, check out Hofstadter's too; his discussion of it is very helpful and insightful.)What Robert Axelrod describes in this book is a novel round-robin tournament (actually two such tournaments) in which various game-theoretic strategies were pitted against one another in the game known as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Each strategy was scored, not according to how many times it \\"beat\\" its \\"opponent,\\" but according to how many points it accumulated for itself. The surprising result: a strategy dubbed TIT FOR TAT, submitted by Anatol Rapaport, cleaned everybody's clocks in both tournaments.Why was this surprising? First, because TIT FOR TAT was such a simple strategy. It didn't try to figure out what its \\"opponent\\" was going to do, or even keep much track of what its \\"opponent\\" had _already_ done. All it did was cooperate on the first move, and thereafter do whatever its \\"opponent\\" had done on the previous move. And second, because this strategy can _never_ do better than its \\"opponent\\" in any single game; the best result it could achieve, in terms of comparison with the other player, is a tie.So it was odd that such a simple strategy, one that went up against all sorts of sophisticated strategies that spent a lot of time trying to dope out what their \\"opponents\\" were up to, should do so much better than all the \\"clever\\" strategies. And it was also odd that a strategy that could never, ever \\"beat\\" its \\"opponent\\" should nevertheless do so much better _overall_ than any other strategy.As Axelrod is careful to point out, this isn't always true; how well TIT FOR TAT does depends on the population with which it's surrounded, and in fact it wouldn't have won even _these_ tournaments if certain other strategies had participated. But TIT FOR TAT is surprisingly robust, and its success does offer some tentative political lessons.Axelrod spells them out, in the form of principles like \\"Be nice and forgiving\\" -- which means: never be the first to defect; be quick to forget what your \\"opponent\\" has done in the past. And in a follow-up computer simulation, he shows that it's possible -- under some conditions -- for a little cadre of \\"cooperators\\" to increase their numbers and \\"take over\\" a population that practices other strategies.Axelrod's research was and is important for several reasons, one of which has to do with evolutionary theory: it shows that, under the right conditions, natural selection can tend to generate cooperation rather than competition, even among actors who act solely out of self-interest. Another has to do with the spontaneous growth of cooperative behavior in predominantly competitive or hostile environments (Axelrod's examples include holiday cease-fires in the trenches during the First World War). Yet another has to do with the need (or otherwise) for external authorities to _enforce_ cooperative behavior -- a point not lost on Axelrod's libertarian and/or Hayekian readers, including myself.Nevertheless, as groundbreaking as this work is, the results are modest and Axelrod states them very cautiously. TIT FOR TAT doesn't _always_ \\"win,\\" and in any case not all of our social interactions can be modelled as Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas. It's a _very_ hopeful book, but readers will want to be careful not to claim more for Axelrod's results than he claims for them himself.In short, this volume is a solid piece of political-sociological-mathematical research that has stood the test of time and stimulated all sorts of follow-up work. I expect it will be read for a long time to come -- this conclusion being a simple extrapolation from the fact that I've been reading it for almost two decades now myself. It's fascinating."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"This book has information for military theorists, biologists exploring gene regulation, antitrust policy-makers, and Miss Manners. It is a wonderfully clear explanation of how almost any two entities, interacting over time, develop a mutualism more profitable than greed.The experimental support for these claims comes from a series of contests. Dozens of authors provided computer programs to play in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma - a simple model, but one that describes a surprising number of real-world phenomena. Most importantly, it's a testable model. It almost puts a common aspect of social interaction into a test tube. What came out of that test tube was startling in its clarity and simplicity.The book is very readable. Axelrod segregates the mathematical and non-mathematical discussions with some care. Math-free readers see the whole set of experiments and conclusions, clearly explained, and need to skip only a few paragraphs during the main discussion. The last few chapters reward math-positive readers with additional precision and rigor. Even then, the math is accessible to someone with good high-school algebra skills.Axelrod's discussion truly timeless, except for references to the Cold War as current events. I can accept that. Even though that un-war is mostly over, it's a critical part of modern history and it still informs current policy. Any insight into that madness helps, and Axelrod is very helpful.This book stands above any one category. It's one of very few that I recommend to the bookshelves of every educated person."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"Sometimes, the individual benefit seems to conflict with the benefit of the community as whole, even though the community includes this very individuum. One such example has been formulated as the Prisonner's Dilemma: two suspects, A and B, are arrested, and kept separated so that they cannot communicate. If they continue to cooperate, they will be both sentenced to one year. However, if suspect A cooperates, but suspect B defects, A is going to be sentenced to five years, and suspect B will be released. Vice versa, if B cooperates and A defects, A will be released and B sentenced to five years. Finally, if both defect, they will both be sentenced to three years each.It is clear that the best solution for both of them is cooperation. On the other hand, each individual is also tempted to maximize his own individual benefit. And each of them benefits most if he decides to defect, which in turn brings the worst possible outcome for both (six years total). So one-shot Prisonner's Dilemma rarely leads to cooperation. Now, what if the very two chaps are later arrested again? Will they cooperate when given another chance? Or if they know they will face the same situation every five years? Professor Axelrod tested the iterated Prisonner's Dilemma with computer programs, and investigated under which circumstances cooperation can emerge.The book is nicely scattered with fragments of game theory and examples from world politics. All in all, as Richard Dawkins has commented in the foreword to its British edition, in breathes with optimism, and is a delight to read. Still, it has one problem, and actually shares it with Dawkins: the book reaches its climax right at the beginning.

How can you miss a book with such broad applications."},{"Title":"Evolution of Cooperation. (Penguin Press Science)","review":"Amidst the glowing 5-star reviews I feel the need to interject some concerns and outright criticisms of this book, although I do recommend its reading. Certainly the book provides a relatively good starting point in a very complex area, but it should not be construed as the final word on a much more complex subject. I do think that R. Axelrod provides an excellent, if at times overbearing, presentation of how game theory, specifically in the realm of an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) scenrario, can explain a number of historical as well as daily situations. He goes on to expound on some good generalizations on how people might act to inspire more cooperation and these generalizations, if implemented by people (groups, governments, etc.), might result in a more cooperative world. For this, there are good things to say. But I would caution not to create from this any utopian potential for the real world.The \`winning strategy' of TIT FOR TAT (TFT) works because it starts out \`nice' but it retaliates immediately if someone else does not \`play nice', too. So this is not vision of world cooperation. It is a realistic vision of maximizing cooperation under specific conditions which he covers relatively well towards the later chapters. Ultimately, the natural take away is a hopeful view of a potentially more cooperative environment, with perhaps a bit of forgetting that unkind retaliation is an integral part of his winning \`cooperative' strategy.Here are some aspects which Mr. Axelrod alludes to but somewhat minimizes, in my opinion, in their impact on TFT's potential for success in real world interactions:a) The IPD strategies, which were submitted by experts from around the world, were submitted to computerized testing to determine which strategies \`win' the most. This is based on an established point system that awards different points for different actions by two players. (This is summarized in one review already, so I will not repeat it here.) While this makes the playing of the game easy and consistent, it does not reflect the real world conditions which often exist. For example, if, in one turn, one player \`defects' and the other \`cooperates', the point system says the defector \`wins' 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. Are all defections \`equal' in the real world? Or are some interactions far more important than others, so therefore cooperating on small things but defecting on bigger things might result in different outcomes than would ever be accounted for in the point systems used in these studies? Intuitively, a major defection may have far more significance (i.e. point value) than a minor one, but to accomplish his analysis, Axelrod's point structure is always the same.b) Related to the above, are all joint cooperative efforts or joint defections \`equal' as implied by the point values? (When two strategies cooperate, each is awarded 3 points. When each defect, they each get 1.) At the time this book was being published, an interesting \`real world' example was playing out which would question this very assumption. At that time, Reagan was building up the military and the Soviet Union was \`matching' the build up. You can either view this as mutual defection or mutual cooperation, depending upon whether you view cooperation as always a \`positive' thing. In any event, the results of these mutual actions were NOT equal. The US had far more resources to invest in the game so each time \`points' were awarded, the US actually gained more than the Soviets who eventually had to stop playing. Consistent point values simply do not account for this, unless one wants to interject additional elements not presented in Axelrod's work.c) Related to point b), the IPD study presents things from a vantage point that each actor starts out from an equal footing and therefore the only functional question is whether one strategy consistently wins in such a way as to keep near the top of the point standings. In reality, rarely does any person or group begin interaction on an equal footing. What I am trying to raise is not the same as his discussions in Chapters 8 and 9 on the strength and growth of various strategies in a world starting out with many different strategies. In those scenarios, some strategies die out because they stop having sources of points to take from others. But what if each strategy starts out from an unequal basis, some having significantly more \`capital' to expend and coupling this to a more realistic scenario where each interaction is not free, but each has a cost to the participant (somewhat like putting your bet down before you play poker - you may win or lose, but if you lose your position is not the same as when you started, it is less than when you started). In such a scenario, which is more realistic in terms of how companies, governments and even people interact, the results would be materially different. So the starting premise of Axelrod's IPD scenario and point schemes may be so well constructed as to make for interesting descriptions of some specific and even common interactions, but it may be too well constructed to be able to be extrapolated to many more complex situations.d) Another weakness is the assumption that all defections are of the same magnitude. If, in an otherwise nice political campaign (ever seen one of those?) a small, third party candidate launches an attack ad and the attacked major party retaliates, is the retaliation equal? Or, again, does their starting point allow them to annihilate the attacker? (Since I have never seen a positive political campaign, you can interject any other similar scenario which might actually come up in real life!) The \`equal points for equal actions' premise is inherently flawed. Yet this is the basis of much of the book's conclusions.e) What is the end result of a universe where everyone uses a TFT strategy? This is only marginally considered, at best. While the issue had been in my mind throughout much of the book, it was not until fairly late that Axelrod makes clear, albeit briefly, that in any set of two player interactions, TFT will at best result in the same total number of points as the other player and, for a number of reasons, probably slightly less. In other words, the person, company, group or government using a pure TFT strategy must be happy being close to the best in whatever the interaction. Personally, I am fine with that, thank you! But to assume that everyone is and that nobody will come up with a disruptive strategy that, perhaps only for a time, garners more points but winds up putting them on top of the heap in whatever competition may be in play. If the end game is the Superbowl, being second is not gratifying. Ask Philadelphia.f) Finally, I found some of the descriptors attached to the strategies interesting, especially in light of Axelrod's ending recommendations on cooperation. Some strategies which attempted to use planned defection as part of their strategy were labeled as \`meanies' while other strategies that started their initial moves with cooperation were labeled as \`nice'. I find it interesting that a \`scientist' would use such descriptors to classify things given that they bring with them connotations. Even TFT could be construed as a \`meanie' since one of its logical outcomes is that it cooperates once, and once only, only to defect from then on based on the other parties action. Are all non-cooperative interactions except one inherently more \`nice'? This is not important in the scope of my real concerns, but I always sense a red flag rising when an otherwise objective presentation resorts to affect-linked labels to make part of its case.All of the above is NOT to imply that I think Axelrod's work is wrong and should be thrown out. I simply felt that, unlike the rest of the glowing reviews, Axelrod's work does not go far enough and leaves some gaping holes yet to be explored.

I read it twice, and I've bought three copies so far, and have given all of them away.Basically it has to do with: what's the best general strategy for dealing with the awful, horrible so-called \\"real\\" world?Paradoxically, it is always in everyone's interest to cooperate, but it seems like no one does. I always thought I was the last \\"good person\\", and so I abandoned so-called \\"humanity\\". Guys *certainly* can't be trusted, and neither can most girls, it seemed. But it turns out that everyone appeared treacherous only because the density of good people is so low. We're dissolved in a sea of evil.If the good-people-density drops below a mathematically-definable level, it is in everyone's interest to be evil, otherwise you're a sucker. (Or you live naked in a cave in the woods and steal electricity for your wireless broadband, which I do).Well there IS a simple heuristic which not only works, but it's optimal. It's provable that the most effective general strategy for dealing with a world which contains a mix of good and bad people is to:1) Be the first to act2) Be good and kind and giving, just like Jesus3) Until you get f***ed over, then:4) Punish the person way disproportionately5) Wait for their next move6) Then, for your next move, be exactly as good or evil as they just were7) Go to step 5Note that if the other person cooperates, you will both cooperate forever, starting from the first encounter. This strategy is both optimal and adaptive, and unlike some other strategies, is stable (some others episodically try to gradually lower cooperation, add new costs to the other party, or cheat to see if you can get away with it). It also adapts immediately to someone turning republican, and forgives immediately if they show by their behavior that they repent. It requires no memory of past behaviours except the most recent one, it is almost the simplest possible strategy (\\"always forgive\\" and \\"always cheat\\" are simpler), and it has never been beaten in computer simulations even by immensely more complex strategies.I also like this strategy's name: tit for tat. It sounds like breast spanking!Its only flaw is that it only works for people who know WTF is going on. That is, it becomes unstable if information isn't perfect, and when it does, it can't recover, even if the other player is using the same strategy.For example, if you think your boyfriend cheated on you, or that an employee stole money, or that the country next to yours attacked your ship--and you're WRONG, not only you will punish the other party for something they didn't do, but you'll blithely ignore their assertions of innocence (pissing them off more) and, from their point of view, you viciously attacked for no reason.That can (and has) led to an unending death spiral of recrimination in which each punishment by A is taken by B as an unprovoked attack which must be itself punished.It has been proven that there is no general strategy which works optimally all the time under conditions of imperfect information. It HAS been proven though, both theoretically and empirically, that this is the best general strategy.It sounds easy, but it's not. For one, it involves blithely punishing people viciously and cruelly. You normal people generally have no problem with that part. But much harder to do (for non-autistics) is completely forgetting about revenge and dealing with what IS, right now. Your revenge happens exactly once, then after that, you forget that it ever happened. People don;t ever want to do this. Their egos get all involved, and they f**k everything up.Read the book; it's great.

It thoroughly demonstrates, with clear and rigorous logic, what Marx realized far too late in his life -- that the monopoly of capital was not a natural phenoenon, but the result of the state-created monopoly of land, through titles that allow landlords to usurp community-created rents.George's prescription, to fund government from land rents, or land value tax, had been espoused by many classical liberals, including Locke, Smith, Mill, Jefferson, Penn, Franklin, and the French &quot;laissez faire&quot; physiocrats. The most concise argument predating George was put forward in Tom Paine's essay, &quot;Agrarian Justice.&quot; George's contribution, then, was not the idea of taxing land, but the economic analysis and compelling arguments for doing so. Similarly, many subsequent leaders and economists have agreed that land value tax is the best tax (and are listed on the earthharing website), but have not pursued the issue with the vigor shown by George.George debunked several myths that are still propagated today, such as that population growth causes of poverty, that it is natural for capital to employ labor, that government control can effectively remedy poverty, and, most of all, that the economic dynamics governing capital can be blindly applied to land and natural resources.Although it is clearly and logically written, the sentences are sometimes long and complex, requiring the reader to go back and parse them carefully.

The Remedy -- describes it beautifully: why we have the ups and downs of our economy, which cause incredible human misery, and why we have increasing poverty at the same time that there is hugely increasing wealth.And Henry George provides a logical and workable -- even elegant -- remedy, one which will untangle many of the perverse incentives we cope with today: we say we value work, but we tax it. We say we want to promote sales, but we tax them. We say we want to encourage entrepreneurial effort, but we allow huge barriers designed to discourage the person with an idea from being able to execute it. We say we want a society that naturally creates more jobs, but we allow a relative few of us to pocket the funds which would create those jobs. We say we value initiative, but we reward the \\"dog in the manger\\" far more than we reward the laborer. We say that urban blight is a bad thing, but our tax code encourages it. We say we dislike urban sprawl, and long commutes, and low wages -- but we've failed to implement the simple tax reform that will correct these ills. We work longer hours than our counterparts in other countries, and have less to show for it. We allow a relative few to own our airwaves, and resell them at higher and higher prices, collecting advertising revenues from all who would run for public office or advertise their products.If we truly mean to end poverty, to reward initiative, to ensure that the next child born in America is truly the equal of all who are here today, to ensure that our environment is protected for the common good, George's framework for understanding provides the missing puzzle piece.And as we consider what sort of country we'd like Iraq to be, it is worth considering that if we only give them a constitution without giving them an economic system that considers all people equal, truly equal, we've not accomplished much with the American lives we've lost there.If we can figure it out for Iraq, with all its oil wealth, maybe we can figure out how to share America justly among Americans, too.George lays out simply and elegantly what the underlying problem is and how to solve it.He dedicates the book \\"To those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.\\" Might you be among those who see and feel, and would strive, if only you could see the source of the problem?Churchill, Twain, Huxley, Shaw and many others came to see what George was pointing out.

The only alternative to his sollution which he said would also work to reduce the difference between rich and poor was the use of government regulation. This has to some extent been taken up in all countries of the world, and while it has indeed slowed the processes which Henry George described, it has led to exactly the problem he predicted. &quot;For instance, to take one of the simplest and mildest of the class of measures...--a graduated tax on incomes. The object at which it aims is good; but this means involves the employment of a large number of officials clothed with inquisitorial powers; temptations to bribery, and perjury, and all other means of evasion, which beget a demoralization of opinion, and ptu a premium upon unscrupulousness and a tax upon conscience...&quot; That seems to be a pretty good descrition of civic life today.When I have mentioned Henry George, the usual answer has been &quot;Who?&quot; Those who had heard of him mostly thought that his ideas only applied to agrarian societies. In fact, he recognized that land was only one (though the most fundamental) form of monopoly, and he makes it clear that he included all monopolies, not just land, into the realm of the rights of the community rather than a private owner. In this day, he would certainly hhave comments about how the airwaves have been distributed, for example.The main surprise to me about this book is how completely unknown it has become. Anyone who reads this with an open mind will be convinced by Henry George's arguments."},{"Title":"Progress And Poverty (Notable American Authors)","review":"I won't go into too much detail - the other reviewers have said it so eloquently and accurately. I believe this is one of the best books ever written and ranks up there with Shakespeare, the bible and Mozart in the sense that it is almost perfect in both artistic and literary form, yet it is a book aimed at solving the economic woes faced by modern civiliasations.

As George puts it in the closing pages: &quot;Beauty still lies imprisoned and iron wheels go over the good and true and beautiful that might spring from human lives.&quot; Humanity's real hope lies in our acceptance of the truths so articulately espoused throughout the pages of Progress &amp; Poverty."},{"Title":"Progress And Poverty (Notable American Authors)","review":"Reviewing classics is always an iffy proposition. I've certainly learned more about the land tax from other sources than from this book. The book also can't give you any idea of how his ideas are being applied today, and the fact that modern Georgists talk about taxing pollution and other \\"economic bads\\", in a natural outgrowth from George's ideas. Similarly, reading John Locke won't give you an idea of what the United States government is like. Still it's worth reading for seeing where the ideas come from. And on that basis, this is a great book.Although the point of this book is the ideas, George's florid prose and tendency to offer a dozen analogies to drive home each point make currently available abridgements of Progress and Poverty a reasonable alternative."},{"Title":"Progress And Poverty (Notable American Authors)","review":"The book is fantastic, but it's a bit of a rip-off to pay $4.95 for a kindle edition that hasn't even been edited.

He argues that the private ownership of land should be the sole source of government revenue, releasing trade from the shackles of corporate taxation, individuals from income and other indirect taxes and shifting the burden to the landed classes. It seems a justifiable premise to charge landlords for the land they occupy as inevitably land values rise only as a consequence of society as a whole and not due to anything the landlord contributes. Businesses pay ever increasing rents to a landlord who cares little whether that business is profitable or not. George proposes a single land tax but fails to answer the socialist question about industrial democracy and worker's particpation and control."},{"Title":"Progress And Poverty (Notable American Authors)","review":"While I have minor quibbles with a few topics, overall the book clearly and preciently explains a powerful analysis of industrial society, with an elegant remedy. Both mindful of the wisdom of markets and the unfairness of typical industrial cities, George first details the analysis, then passionately advocates for his thoughtful 'cure'.I quibble a bit with the postulated benefits of increased population on the quality of life, which seems to conflate the effects of better technology with simple increases in population at one point. This part of his two-pronged poke at Malthusianism seems off.This is more than made up for by the intriguing discernment that perhaps capital and labor are united in their susceptibility to the landed, and share a common interest, instead of being set against each other.Overall, a very important and well-written book."},{"Title":"Progress And Poverty (Notable American Authors)","review":"People do not argue with the teaching of George, they simply do not know it.

But the Kelley's book is the one I look up more often. It stands out, since it gives you the broadest and deepest clinical coverage of the internal medicine you can find in a two-volumes textbook. The forthcoming 4th edition, which is scheduled for 8/2000 and will be edited by Humes, will expand furter the coverage, reaching an unprecedented range, at least as can be judged by the anticipated index. For the sake of clarity and completeness, each subspecialty (cardiology, endocrinology and metabolism, and so forth) is divided in three parts: the first group of chapters is devoted to the pathophysiologic foundations, the second to diseases and the third to the diagnosis and treatment. This format is clever, because allow you to study each section separately without being overwhelmed by the astonishing amount of information it contains. A lot of chapters are devoted to the approach to the patient with different symptoms, to the interpretation of instrumental data and to the treatment: they are another distictive feature of the book, making it invaluable. If you are a physician or a serious student searching for an authoritative, encyclopedic textbook with broad pathophysiologic coverage and wide sections about the management of the patient, the Kelley's textbook will not disappoint you. For many of us, it is a must buy. For all, it is a bargain.

Now Willow has a parade of older men following her around, which is ridiculous in Brittany's mind especially since Willow is only a junior in highschool (two years older than herself).

Indeed, can you imagine a gay tough guy detective even today with all the attacks on Sponge Bob and and other stupidities.But it's true. In 1972 Joseph Hansen published the first of what would grow to twenty five novels, twelve of which featured Dave Brandstetter the openly, contentedly gay thinking man's tough guy.Dave is an insurance company investigator in charge of looking into false claims. In Fadeout, pop star Fox Olson's white convertible plunged off a narrow wooden bride and killed him. But where's the body.That's enough of the story, you can guess what happens from there. It's a good story, well written as any novel that starts a series of twelve mysteries has to be. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"In 1970 Joseph Hansen single-handedly changed the face (or at least the sexual orientation)of the mystery genre forever with FADEOUT and Dave Brandstetter, Hansen's openly and comfortably homosexual sleuth.Brandstetter was not the first gay detective, but he was the first healthy, &quot;normal&quot; gay detective. Brandstetter is handsome, urbane yet ruggedly masculine, and straight in all the essential ways. He is as real a person as a character in a novel can ever be. The same is true of all the series regulars. No one ever--with the exception of Cecil Harris' unconvincing marriage to Chrissie Streeter--steps out of character. Right down to the series somewhat melodramatic conclusion.Besides providing a positive homosexual role model, Hansen's Brandstetter series is remarkable for setting the standard against which 90% of all other gay mystery writers fail to measure up. The writing is superb. Hansen has been compared to Hammett, Ross MacDonald and Chandler. All genre writers following Hansen are compared to Hansen. With good reason.In the first of the twelve book series insurance investigator Brandstetter, still grieving over the death of his longtime lover, sets out to discover what happened to singer Fox Olson. Olson's wrecked car has been found minus Olson. Where's the body? Is the accident an accident? Did Fox committ suicide? Did someone murder him? Or is Fox alive and faking his death? And how does all this relate to the sudden reappearance of Olson's boyhood lover, a man Brandstetter feels queerly connected to--a man now also missing?Read this novel and you will have no further need of reader recommendations. You will hunt down each and every book in the entire series--as relentless as Dave Brandstetter himself."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"When Pima, California&#65533;s local celebrity/singer/radio show host Fox Olson turns up missing and his T-Bird is found in the arroyo after a fierce storm, his wife, daughter, friends, and fans expect his body to wash up any time. It doesn&#65533;t happen. Dave Brandstetter, claims investigator for Medallion Life Insurance Company comes to town. As he interviews family and friends, Dave discovers that all was not well in Fox Olson&#65533;s charmed life after all. Did Fox commit suicide? Or kill himself? And if he&#65533;s dead, where is the body? Dave thinks Fox disappeared on purpose, but in order to prove it, he&#65533;ll have to find the man.Detective Dave Brandstetter is not only an appealing, sympathetic character, he is also a rugged, hard-drinking, relentless investigator with his own secrets. He&#65533;s just lost his lover of 20+ years to cancer, and he is well aware that he is not in good shape emotionally. Against the backdrop of his loss, Dave talks to the people of Pima, noses into old issues, and gets a possible lead on Fox&#65533;s whereabouts. But there is more than one person in town with something to hide, and some of them may just be ready to kill to keep things quiet.Author Joseph Hansen writes clear and delightful prose: &#65533;the rust from the nailheads had written long, sad farewells down the salt-silver planks.&#65533; Alternating captivating description with classic hard-boiled narrative, the author brings Brandstetter&#65533;s world alive, both inside and out. No wonder Hansen has been compared to classic mystery writers such as Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald.Originally published in 1970, FADEOUT is remarkable in at least three ways: 1) the mystery features the first openly gay private detective, Dave Brandstetter, who is unapologetically homosexual and displays a solid strength and confidence that seems ahead of its time; 2) the writing is crisp, exciting, and exudes style beyond the level of the typical mystery; and 3) after over three decades, every aspect of the story and the writing holds up marvelously. Hansen&#65533;s work is destined to be deemed classic. The fact that Alyson has reprinted this debut novel and, so far, two of the eleven subsequent installments of the Brandstetter series bodes well for Joseph Hansen&#65533;s revival.Lori L. LakeMidwest Book Review"},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"Joseph Hansen was the second author to construct a series around a gay detective--George Baxt preceded him--and the first to make his gay detective absolutely &quot;normal.&quot; And by &quot;normal,&quot; I mean &quot;average.&quot; Dave Brandstetter is a decent, reticent, often rather icy human being. No genius, he solves cases by patient sleuthing rather than Holmesian leaps of logic. And Brandstetter, who eventually ages in &quot;real time,&quot; ultimately comes apart at the seams in realistic fashion: in the last novels, when he is close to 70, Brandstetter forgets things, needs reading glasses, and loses the stamina he needs to think straight. In this, the first novel, he is just beginning to emerge from profound, paralyzing mourning for his companion of twenty-two years; as the series progresses, he will acquire two more partners, one a misfire and the other more permanent. Hansen's characterizations are sharp throughout, and his prose style--short, snappy sentences, with the occasional quirky metaphor or simile thrown in--is deceptively simple. Both this novel and the series as a whole are worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"Joseph Hansen manages to fit a remarkable amount of storytelling in this relatively short novel. Fadeout is the story of an intriguing investigation. Yet it is so much more than that. Seemingly without effort, Hansen also succeeds in giving the reader a very revealing look into the inner life of the investigator.Fox Olson of Pima, California has disappeared and is presumed dead. Mr. Olson is many things. Husband, father, local radio personality, writer, painter and erstwhile politician. He also owns a $150,000 insurance policy from a company known as Medallion Life.Dave Brandstetter is a claims investigator for Medallion Life and it is his job to find out what really has happened to Fox Olson. As Brandstetter interviews the policyholder's family and acquaintances he learns that things are not as they appear. The ostensibly happy life Fox Olson seemed to be enjoying was anything but that.All is not well with Dave Brandstetter either. You see, Dave is a homosexual and his life partner of more than 20 years has recently died of cancer. Dave is just now trying to learn how to live again.In giving us the Dave Brandstetter character, Hansen has done a very remarkable thing, at least as far as detective fiction is concerned. Though proudly gay, there is nothing about Dave that would lead anyone meeting him in a professional setting to suspect he is anything other than heterosexual. His speech, his clothes, his mannerisms, everything about him speaks to a mainstream orientation. But since the reader is aware of Dave's homosexuality, the way in which Hansen has him relate to women, other gays and homophobic individuals he encounters in the course of his work is quite interesting indeed. Moreover, Hansen includes a number of scenes between Dave and the people in his own life which very tellingly expose the pain and anguish he carries within.One cannot help but notice the similarities of Hansen's writing style in Fadeout to much of the work of Ross Macdonald. Both writers use a highly descriptive type of prose that is very effective. Both delight in exploring the geographic and sociologic diversity California has to offer. Both make use of long held family secrets to provide key plot twists. And both feature toughminded protagonists who steadfastly seek out the truth.Fadeout is truly an impressive literary effort. Word for word, this book delivers as much value to the reader as any work of fiction out there."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"I picked this up on the recommendation of an author I respect, and while I was expecting a good read, I wasn't expecting to be so utterly shattered. On its surface, it's just a straightforward mystery about a guy who may or may not be dead, and the insurance investigator who needs to find out for certain. But just like the brittle prose, there's much, much more to it than that.While I can appreciate that this is an important hallmark in gay fiction, portraying a gay man as normal as normal can be, the reason this now holds a place on my keeper shelf is the skill with which it hooked me into the wide range of emotions and never let me go. Brandstetter is mourning his 20+ year relationship, and his palpable grief permeates every page, every interaction, every word. The mystery might not necessarily be all that groundbreaking for readers of the genre, but in light of the characters the author creates, and most importantly, the protagonist who guides us through all of it, that doesn't matter. It's just that good."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"For years I had read about Joseph Hansen's \\"Fadeout\\", the first in a series to feature gay insurance investigator Dave Brandstetter.

Hansen's writing style is stylish and unique with vivid descriptions of California. His characters are fully developed and the character of Dave Brandstetter is one that readers can identify with and care for. Although often billed as a \\"gay mystery\\" it is really just a regular mystery story that happens to have a gay character.

Fans of gay men's mysteries will certainly love this classic tale!"},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED AT JESSEWAVE'S BLOG, I PURCHASED THE BOOK ON MY OWN HOWEVERFirst and foremost I would like to say that I think the blurb is perfect. It gives you the initial set up of the mystery, briefly reminds the readers that those books are well known and that's about it. I liked it.I discovered these books from Teddy Pig's blog. I bought the first book in paperback, realized that there is a complete collection in one book, quickly bought it for a very decent price on Amazon. Now the complete edition seems to be out of print, and of course third party sellers charge crazy prices, but the separate books are available in paperback on Amazon. The first two books are also available as ebooks directly from the publisher and apparently on Nook and Cobo as well, but not on Amazon. I hope the whole series will be reissued for Kindle one day, I really do.I actually did not start reading this book for a very long time. You know how you have heard so much about a book and you are afraid to be disappointed? Well, needless to say I was not disappointed at all. The book sucked me in from the very first passage, literally.\\"Fog shrouded the canyon, a box canyon above a California ranch town called Pima. It rained. Not hard but steady and gray and dismal. Shaggy pines loomed through the mist like threats. Sycamores made white, twisted gestures above the arroyo. Down the arroyo water pounded, ugly, angry and deep. The road shattered the arroyo. It was a bad road. The rain had chewed its edges. There were holes. Mud and rock half buried it in places. It was steep and winding and there were no guard rails.He drove it with sweating hands. Why? His smile was sour. Why so careful? Wasn't death all he'd wanted for the past six weeks? His mouth tightened. That was finished. He'd made up his mind to live now. Hadn't he? Live and forget - at least until he could remember without pain. And that would happen someday. Sure it would. All the books said so. The sum of human wisdom. Meantime, he was working again\\".I do not know about you, but these introductory passages transported me right away into this bleak landscape and portrayed a strong person who is almost overwhelmed by grief and still fights hard to not be completely overwhelmed to the point of no return. I could not stop reading.I am sure you understood when you saw the grade that this whole review is not a critical one, but I just cannot help myself, with every introduction of new characters, with every twist and turn in the plot I could not help but think - this is one of the best executions of this thing and this thing, and this one again. Of course by now I have read enough gay romances, gay romantic mysteries and other subgenres with gay protagonists, so some ideas felt familiar, but as I said I just felt that Joseph Hansen wrote pretty much a perfect story and I had to keep reminding myself that as blurb stated he wrote it more than thirty years ago.For example, when we meet Dave, we are not treated to a long and boring exposition as to how he looks and what happened in his past, instead the passage I quoted previously already sets up his mood and actually an overall bleak mood for the whole story very well. When Dave interviews one of the witnesses, we are given some details of his appearance and age and some things which come up during the interview make his mind wander and we learn something more about his past. I thought it was really well done.I really liked how his character was revealed more and more throughout the investigation, throughout his actions, not just through his thoughts. I liked how we slowly learned how strong he is, how very compassionate he is and I really liked his sense of humor in those few situations when Dave actually showed it to the reader. I also thought that while the story is of course a mystery first and foremost, the love story in his past is one of the most beautiful and poignant that I have ever read about in this genre, period. Unfortunately I grew to think that when in a mm book protagonist recalls the love story in his past, I would be bound to feel emotionally removed from the story. Boy was I wrong here, because emotionally removed from what Dave was remembering was so NOT what I was feeling. I was so very sad for him, but also happy that he had such a great love in his past.The mystery he investigated seemed simple enough, but it was not predictable at all, not for me anyway. It was very well paced and I could not guess the villain or the result of the investigation. I thought that each and every one of the characters no matter how secondary they were in the story were acting believably and realistically, close to how I thought real people would act in those situations. I also think that in a sense the mystery went a little bit off the given path, because while Dave managed to catch the killer, in a sense he failed; without talking spoilers here, he fell to achieve the goal which he had when he just started his investigation. Those of you who have read or will read the story will know what I am talking about.I also really enjoyed that despite the overall bleak atmosphere, things ended on somewhat hopeful note for Dave and cannot wait to read a second book.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"Originally published in 1970, this first of twelve books to feature insurance investigator Dave Brandstetter takes place in the late '60s California. Popular small-town radio personality Fox Olson appears to have crashed his car into a storm-swollen arroyo -- however his body hasn't been found, and Medallion Life Insurance doesn't pay up without a body. So Brandstetter drives from L.A. out to Pima to take a look at the accident scene and talk to Olson's friends and family. Of course, all is not what it seems, and beneath Olson's seemingly happy life (pretty wife, plenty of money, dream house) lie a less happy past and a secret or two. One of the bigger secrets is telegraphed pretty early on with some pretty obvious clues, but Brandstetter has to figure what it means.Much of the book is taken up with the mystery of whether or not Olson is alive or dead, and if dead, whether by his own hand or that of an enemy. The threads of this mystery get awfully tangled, and by the end the real culprit's identity comes as a bit of a surprise. Meanwhile, a running subplot is Brandstetter's grief over the recent death of his longtime lover and his attempt to grapple with moving on. (Part of this includes a romantic interlude involving a Hispanic teenager that adds absolutely nothing to the story or to Brandstetter's character development and feels quite totally superfluous.) Brandstetter is gay, an anomaly for crime fiction of the time, but this never feels false or gimmicky. Hansen makes him a completely normal guy, a classic rugged, tough, cynic with a heart of gold genre detective who gets the job done by patience and persistence, rather than genius.The story is pretty solid and fits well into the tradition of California noir (Chandler, Hammett, MacDonald). What makes it stand out is the writing -- most of the time it's clipped and straightforward, and then every now and then it diverges into a more lyrical moment, such as this: \\"Windows were broken. Where not broken they were boarded up, had been for years: the rust from nailheads had written long, sad farewells down the salt-slivered planks.\\" On the whole, a solid series debut that whets the appetite for more of Brandstetter."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"The insight and human empathy of Joseph Hansen's sleuth Dave Brandstetter equals that of sam spade. There's a deepness of thought seldom found in the epigonesof hard-boiled genre. Dave is a warm,gentle soul, understanding human frailty, even when it leads to unsavoury cinseqyuences, And he's justly severe to real miscreants. A refreshing read in mystery literature. He was also a pionieer, in a genre whhere, thanks to Chandlers, homosexuals were less more than effete degenerates. Hansen restored homosexual people's dignity."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"I was in my early 20s when I first read Fadeout. Because I'm not a native speaker of English, I found Hansen's straightforward language, the unadorned eye and the spareness of emotion rather dry and uninteresting. I was still neck deep into the convolutions of Henry James and whatnot (I even asked people what's the big deal with Hemingway). In rock n' roll terms, Hansen, like Hemingway, was just two chords going back and forth. Twenty years and an extended stay in the hard knocks school of life I now treasure my two-chord Bruce Springsteen classic Jungle Land, my one-chord-and straight distortion Velvet Underground vynils and my no-frills-no-fancy-posh language Brandstetter collection. At 40 I understand why you have to be of a certain age and length of stay on earth to recognize just how ahead of his time Joseph Hansen was in 1970."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"I am a huge mystery fan. Written in the late '60s and published in the early '70s, Hansen crafted a story that could take place just as easily today as it could 50 years ago. Yes, the protagonist is gay and is cut from the same cloth of other famous detectives (TV, book, and movie). His previous relationship is shown with empathy, it just doesn't dwell on it.The main lure of the novel is how quickly it moves. The down part is that you have to be paying attention as the way Hansen shifts scenes is rather clever. You see, he'll start a chapter without telling you who he is describing or writing about. It's no wonder that those who have read the novel tend to like it.If you're looking for a great mystery to occupy your time, then go check this book out."},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"I have been disappointed with the current gay novels and mysteries. They're poorly written and heavily peppered with sex. Sex is alright but not when it is nothing but sex and this is supposed to be a gay mystery?!?!I guess sometimes we need go back to basics. I picked up a copy of Hansen's \\"Fadeout\\", a Dave Brandstetter mystery series. At first, I had reservations since it was first published in 1970. For me, gay classics are an acquired taste.However, Fadeout was an enjoyable whodunit book that didn't drone on and on with useless details. Dave Brandstetter is an insurance investigator looking into the disappearance of Fox Olson. His car was found crashed but there is no body. The search for Olson soon leads to disappointment, betrayals, affairs, lovers, and secrets that connected everyone to each other. Meanwhile, Brandstetter has some of his own demons to face.It was interesting to note that it wasn't \\"gay, gay, gay\\" throughout the book as you seen in current gay books. It could be because of how it was in the 70's. The Stonewall Riot just occurred the previous year before this book was published. It could be it wasn't that big of deal to flaunt gayness as it is now.I'm definitely going to check out the other books of this series!"},{"Title":"Fadeout","review":"Have seen many reviews of books that were supposed to be great and entertaining.

[...] For the subject, the advantage of this projection is that it disposes of the affects and anxiety that otherwise inhibit his ability to follow a train of thought, and/or linguistic chain of association; the disadvantage is that this ability depends on maintaining critical blind spots.\\" ( p 233)Here we have an example of the way that psychology can assert itself into the realm of the political. Brennan certainly sees that there are cultural-historical influences that determine how masculinity and femininity are constructed in the society, but she does not go so far as to label these constructions as being also political.That does not mean that these projections onto the other of a state of \\"castration\\" -- which we can understand as mental and political helplessness -- are not facilitated by political mechanisms, making them profoundly political. Rather, Brennan is writing in 1992, and advancing a novel thesis about psychological intersubjectivity, that was hardly recognised at that time. Seventeen years later, we are more familiar with post-Kleinian theory, and we are able to draw more conclusions concerning the interlinking of the political sphere with our inherent psychological mechanisms.It becomes clearer after reading Brennan's book that the projection of \\"castration\\" onto an other -- which, as Brennan points out, can be one who is biologically male or female, but for psychoanalytical reasons, is generally a woman -- is a political feature of the psychological division of necessary labour.This is because, as humans, we are all physiologically complex -- which is to say, made up of both rational and irrational drives. So it is that if one is to politically represent and uphold exclusively the rational side of one's identity, it is necessary for one to somehow do away with the irrational side of one's self (both as representation and as, far as possible, as conscious experience).To maintain a rational self-image, the inherent irrational aspects of human psychology -- (those which intrude at times to seem to prevent the work of narrow rational thinking) -- will be denied, or sublimated of projected, depending on the level of the level of the psychological resources and skill of the subject.Brennan deals with the issue of projection in the last few pages of her book, and it is fortunate that she does so, since these days it is tacitly acceptable, within the Western socio-political complex, for projections to flow from male to female, but not for them to flow the other way around: That is, the political rhetoric that maintains ideologies imputes that \\"it is irrational to impute irrational characteristics to men.\\" It does not seem to be irrational to impute them to women, however. So it is that individual men are lifted above the possibility of criticism, by virtue of the tacit acceptability of the logic of projection.But projection isn't merely rhetorical: that is, there is more to it than expressing the idea that \\"it isn't me, its you!\\" as a way of putting women back into their (traditional) places. Rather, at a deep psychological level, the subject who projects also actually believes that it is not he, but her, who is responsible for a disruption of his chain of thought.Consider the nature of the political divide in terms of this tacit division of psychological labour: Phenomenologically, those positioned as \\"masculine\\" (which can be upper division women as well as men, in the managerial classes) experience only annoying interruptions to their rational train of thought, which seem to come from the outside of their own psyches, and need to be crushed or put down. Meanwhile, those positioned on the alternative side of the political divide, those allocated to do \\"feminine\\" work, will have a variety of experiences depending on their degree of psychological and political awareness.Those who find themselves positionally on the \\"feminine\\" side of power systems will not have the same view of the world and of established systems of morality as those who find themselves on the \\"masculine\\" side (due to factors dominated by psychological symbolisations of gender and social status). At the lowest level of consciousness, women who are projected upon will find a certain need fulfilled, in that an identity -- albeit a weak and shaky one -- is projected upon them. Their narcissistic sensibilities (whether weak or strong) are enhanced.At a higher level of consciousness, one encounters the male projection of \\"castration\\" as a constant assault on one's processes of thinking, as well as on one's capacity to maintain a sense of identity. The males who project are inclined to expect women to identify with all of their failed processes of thinking, as if they had originated from the women themselves. In the case of ongoing assaults of this projective sort (which I have experienced), which sometimes appear to be specifically designed to weaken one's resolve, I find the only solution is to get away from the situations that allow for these power dynamics, and to take refuge as a hermit. Otherwise, one will not be able to think very much, if at all.When one has no choice but to associate with those (including organisations and systems) which engage in this process of projection, it does feel masochistic, despite the fact that one is on red alert for combat, and is not masochistic at all. This is because these projective attacks work against one's inner ontological awareness -- the part of the self that governs a sense of identity."},{"Title":"The Solar System and Back","review":"This is a collection of seventeen Issac Asimov essays that he published as part of a monthly column for a sci-fi magazine.

I guess it's because they're more private and conceived on a less grand scale. But they're literary gems--with a style and intelligence that's on par with the best writing of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Corrida at San Feliu","review":"BURIED TREASURE ALERT: the works of Paul Scott. he is perhaps most famous for his excellent The Raj Quartet and its 1977 Booker Prize winning follow up novel Staying On (in my opinion, a gentle and wise novel but clearly a lesser work). outside of those classics, it feels like he is practically unknown. i never come across references to him and reviews for his other novels are rather impossible to find. this is a real surprise; his novels are filled with expert characterization, topical & timeless themes (particularly in terms of class conflict, racial tension, and i suppose the always relevant What Makes A Man? and Can Men Ever Truly Be Brothers?) and - because they draw upon his years of experience in India - they are filled with absorbing historical detail. maybe i am making a mountain out of molehill; although i often feel like i am living in my own personal version of the UK, i actually am not... so maybe his name has more currency over yonder.The Corrida at San Feliu is written with the seriousness of intent and all the confidence, depth of emotion, and ironic humor of a master-class writer. it is a rather short novel, and overall may be considered a minor work. but ah, the riches buried within!i've been avoiding giving a synopsis of Corrida because it is hard to give a quick description of all the things going on in this little book. its size is compact - but it is larger on the inside than the outside. i suppose, in a long-winded nutshell, you could say it is about some of my favorite literary themes... the gap between reality and true understanding, the distance between individuals, the way we humans mold our memories and perceptions to better deal with the troubling things in our lives, the way we fool ourselves, how the past will always haunt the present and impact the future. it is about a man who is not just at an impasse in his life, he is breaking down, a slow-burning kind of collapse. it is about the power of storytelling and its dangers as well. it is the story of a man and a woman and all the possible, potential permutations of that relationship. it is about a relationship ending. it is about new ways of seeing old things and the flexibility of perspective. it is a tale of death and of love. it is about how you can't go home again and how that home - whatever \\"home\\" even means - maybe never existed in the first place.the structure is purposely distancing. it forces the reader to pay attention, to take their time in getting to the heart of this novel's reason for being. the first section is a straightforward biography of an imaginary writer. that is followed by four very short tales: the first appears to be a little fable about an ill-conceived leopard hunt in africa, the second is about an ill-fated romance in India, the third is about an arrival of a couple at a Spanish villa, the fourth is about a version of that couple arriving at an Indian estate. the second half of the book (sequentially, the sixth \\"tale\\") gets to the heart of the matter. a man and his much younger wife are in Spain. he is a writer and she is a trophy. he feels distance between them; he is obsessed with a possible affair she may be having. he thinks upon his life and loves, his family, his wife's past life, the people who have haunted them both. full of dread, he thinks upon the bullfighting at the San Feliu Corrida. characters appear and reappear, they live throughout all the tales in the book, they change and transform and are given different motivations, different outcomes, different perspectives. the narrator's grasping & unimaginative uncle becomes a vindictive leopard hunter in one tale. a virginal young woman is a cold but rather sad object of lust in one story and then her story is retold in another tale... we get to understand her frustrations and anger from different angles, her motivations become clear, her story becomes a genuine tragedy. we see the main couple in question in different forms: young, old, full of hope, full of fear & resentment, glamorous & beautiful, sad & deeply flawed, haunted by their past, looking to their future, locked in stasis. we see all the possibilities of a relationship ending, of life ending - and why this must inevitably come to pass.the novel ends with a long passage regarding a bullfight at the Corrida. i must admit to having a good deal of trepidation about this sequence. personally, i'm of an opinion that bullfighting is about as tasteful & interesting as fox-hunting. or hunting children. but nevertheless, i stuck with it, and was rewarded with profundity. the narrator imagines the confrontation between bull and tormenters from all angles: from a young bullfighter, from an old one, from the lady that the bullfight is dedicated to, from the bullfighter's assistants, and - most tragically, most empathetically - from the bull itself. and it not all about supplying multiple angles, telling different tales. everything exists on both the level of story and in how these perspectives reflect the lives of the novel's characters. this passage - well the novel itself as a whole, the way that actions and perspectives and meaning change, flow into each other, become interpreted as story, become transformed... it is all such a remarkably multi-leveled accomplishment.here is a relatively minor passage concerning a relatively minor character... note the fluidity of perspective, the collapsing of time, the startling movement from a life about to happen to sudden death and finally a terribly unknowable portrait of futility and sorrow:Alone with Leela he said, 'Will you be my wife?' And she replied, 'I will be whatever you want me to be,' and knelt in front of him so that he experienced a sensation of being both mocked and worshipped, and wondered whether God too was alive to the ambiguity of such gestures. She had her mother's, not her father's bones. The creamy, only slightly tinted flesh was stretched fine, almost transparently over them. It seemed to Craddock that like so many Indian women she was built for burning. Dry and brittle in the body she would be gone in the first lick of flame, all except her eyes through which so far she had seen nothing of the world; through which, now, looking up at him, she conveyed to him something of her great, untapped capacity for living. Through those eyes he was aware of a similar capacity in himself and of immense reserves of energy.\\"All my life, he thought, I have conserved, stored up against an occasion of expenditure on some act I could be proud of and thankful for. He made her rise and keeping hold her small hands kissed them, as six months later, far away in their place of exile of their short marriage he kissed them as they were clenched, cold, sickly-sweet smelling, in the room where she lay dead of a cup of milk into which she had poured powdered glass, as if only the most agonizing end could adequately settle the reckoning of her brief encounter with the cruel world beyond the walls and garden of old Lady Brague's embattled, haunted bungalow. To die she had put on a simple cotton saree, made a pyre of the European clothes she had tried so hard to grace, and set light to them. The ashes, like her body, were cold, the bungalow deserted, the servants fled, the Mahwari Hills silent behind veils of mist that had melted on his eye-lids as he climbed the path calling her name and getting no answer, so that entering the darkened room he was already aware of the need to weep.\\""},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"All of Burgess' books are fabulous!

Teachers took their classes to the library and acted as librarians in those days, so she recognized my obsession from second grade. She declared I could read any book from any grade level of the library, but NOT Thornton W. Burgess books.I lived without Reddy Fox for a year, reading Black Stallion books instead.

Burgess' Bird Book for Children so I was already familiar with this author's style.Burgess creates animal characters and a storyline for his creatures.In The Burgess Animal Book for Children the woodland animals gather each morning to attend school with Old Mother Nature, who serves as the teacher for both the animals in her school and for the readers of the novel.Each of the forty chapters covers several animals in the same family group and describes the habits and characteristics of those animals in a story format.At first read, I thought the narrator's tone came across as too formal - too \\"teach-y\\".But my young listeners did not think that at all - and as they were the target audience, I set aside those first misgivings.And I am so glad that I did.I used this book as a large part of our nature and science study curriculum this year.Twice a week I would read one chapter of the book to the children.While they listened, London, Mosely and Bergen would draw the animals in their personal nature notebooks.One of the main animals attending the school with Mother Nature is Peter Rabbit - a curious, outspoken rabbit who has loads of questions for his teacher.(Apparently, he also has a lame British accent. Or at least - that's what my kids will grow up remembering I guess.)I am always surprised by how much detail the kids put in their drawings, just by listening to the descriptions given in the writing.And I think by hearing about the animals in a story format they are able to retain so much more information than a list or a textbook would have offered.After each reading I ask the kids to narrate what they remember about the animal.Mosely drew the grizzly bear from the reading but asked to narrate about the polar bear we read about instead.Although I recorded the words for her - I added nothing.This is just what she remembered on her own.(I love fact number four - \\"The polar bear can actually blend into the snow and it doesn't mind attacking people.\\")Since London can write, she usually records the narration on her own.The stories have certainly stuck in the kids' minds too.They frequently talk about the subtle differences between certain similar animals - such as the sheep and the goat or an antelope and a deer.Bergen is often asking, \\"What family is that animal in?\\"After almost every chapter they invent games of \\"polar bear\\" or \\"fox\\".My favorite is the game of \\"possum\\" where all the baby possums (Piper, Bergen, Mosely) try to ride on the momma possum's (London) back as long as they can before they fall off and play dead.And Piper has even taken to addressing me as \\"Old Mother Nature\\" whenever I begin to read a new story.Based on the popularity of the first two Burgess books we have conquered, I am already scouting out Amazon for a few more selections.I think he has written a series of additional books featuring some of the animals in this particular novel as well.Bergen requested more stories from Unc' Billy the possum, so I guess I'll make that fella the next priority."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"As a homeschooler, I've seen this book listed on many book lists for those who prefer the use of 'living books' over textbooks. The book uses story form to convey facts about animals, a method which can sometimes be effective, and sometimes be too dry. In this case, it was the latter. There were simply too many facts crammed in, to the detriment of the stories. My then-6yo daughter and I very much enjoyed Burgess' 'The Adventures of ....' (e.g. Bobby Coon and others) series, and I had expected this book to be similar stories, but these lacked the adventure that we had enjoyed in his other books.

Your story starts out with a queen writing to her unborn child about her difficult life. She writes about her grandparents being assassinated by an evil usurper when her mother was a baby, and the same usurper assassinated her own mother and father when she was a baby.Until this Queen was ten years old she lived in the mountains as a simple country girl who barely knew a soul. Her tutor, or as she knew him growing up \\"Grandfather,\\" told her about her real history when she was almost ten years old. When she discovered her history, she set out to find and free her rightful kingdom from the evil usurper who rules her people cruelly.When she reached her kingdom she became a yam sorter in the palace that the usurper had conquered. In the middle of her time there her tutor came to her and gave her the message that the scholars in her kingdom had been waiting for a sign of her existence for ten years. The sign would be \\"a burning angel through a darkening sky.\\" This sign would alert her Damavand army generals that they should assemble and it would give the people courage to rise up against the usurper. At the end of the book the Queen opens a door and looks out over her assembled troops, but what will happen to her next? Have you written or have you considered writing a continuation of this book?

Wait until y'read what he's done."},{"Title":"A City in Winter","review":"This book is charming and imaginative, it is worth the cover price based upon the beautiful illustrations which perfectly compliment a very wonderful story for children that will enrich their reading experience. I will place it on the top shelf at home, and can heartily recommend this read for all elementary aged school children. I think teachers will like it too."},{"Title":"A City in Winter","review":"This i must say is one of the most kickin books i ever read. the themes of good and evil are represented so fully in this book.The sequel to this novel is just as well recieved by me.

But while we may recieve endless descriptions of yams and yam kitchens we do not recieve any details of what is actually occuring in the story. I felt it was very much like listening to Swan Lake as opposed to watching it. Doing one without the other is only half the experience."},{"Title":"Unmasking Satan","review":"Dr. Mayhue unmasks Satan and allows us to biblically see our Adversary. The book does not deal with demons or the demonic realm as much as he deals with the person of Satan. The book covers nearly every Scripture on Satan and exposes his lies, his tactics, and how to defeat him through Christ.One of the best things about this book is that Dr. Mayhue does not spend time chasing dreams and men's ideas about Satan. Too much confusion exists about the Enemy and most comes from strange (even unbiblical) ideas about Satan. Dr. Mayhue avoids this and simply gives us a biblical view of Lucifer."},{"Title":"Unmasking Satan","review":"This is a resourceful tool for any pastor or teacher in that it brings awareness to the strategies Satan uses to attack believers. Richard Mayhue unmasks the disguises of the devil in a practical, biblical manner by exposing the common schemes and twisted lies used by the enemy to destroy individuals. The author teaches that God's truth is our protection and way to sabotage Satan's strategies. In reading this book, one discovers that Satan is a real present danger in everyday life. I will share the contents of this information with others to warn them of this well thought out battle plan. My prayer is that others prepare themselves for spiritual battle by practicing the defensive postures revealed in this study."},{"Title":"Unmasking Satan","review":"Richard Mayhue is an excellent writer and in this book teaches us how to be aware of the schemes of Satan"},{"Title":"Unmasking Satan","review":"Unmasking Satan is a simple task of sheddng the skin of mythology and getting on with your life.

Well laid out with easy-to-read type, it takes up where volume 1 leaves off. Even those folks not connected with the world of acting can have fun with these scripts. Reading/acting the plays aloud with your family, each person assigned a different role, can be a great activity for quality time -and will hone your comedy timing. Special nuggets include 'Prisoner of second avenue' and 'Chapter Two'. Reading Simon's work reveals greater depth beneath the priceless one-liners that he supplies. That, in fact, is his genius; like Woody Allen and Joseph Heller, Simon first draws you in with laughter only to move you with great humanity. These plays are among his deeper works, as life-experience go into the mix. The stories on these pages are our own, and youll have a ball!"},{"Title":"The Collected Plays of Neil Simon, Vol. 2","review":"As a speech and debate coach, I'm always looking for pieces for my competitors to perform at tournament. Neil Simon has always been one of my personal favorite authors, because he does such an amazing job of meshing comic gold with poignant social commentary. The second volume of his collected works has some great material that takes very little effort to adapt to whatever presentational format you might need."},{"Title":"The Collected Plays of Neil Simon, Vol. 2","review":"Great book in perfect condition. Made a great Christmas present for my boyfriend who loves books and plays thank you"},{"Title":"The Collected Plays of Neil Simon, Vol. 2","review":"It is nice to have so many of Mr. Simon's plays in one collection (four or five collections ultimately). I bought this one for the musical \\"Little Me\\". The book has a rather depressing, self-depreciating introduction by Mr. Simon and then gets to the plays (I won't list them here). They are easy-reading, contain many stage directions that help the reader picture what is happening on stage, and intelligently written. My one gripe is that there are no credits at the beginning of each one - cast lists, opening date and what theater, how many performances, etc.This is a good one for studying excellent play structure, character development and motivation, and how to build upon jokes and lines spoken as far back as a previous scene. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Collected Plays of Neil Simon, Vol. 2","review":"Most Neil Simon plays are wonderful and I enjoyed reading them.

Birmingham.The book is written in straight forward English. It is written in a way that conveys information in a natural manner - I found it an easy read. The writer knows his work, explaining the historical background behind the derivation of physical constants etc (example Plank's constant).There is plenty of maths to entertain you with. Its written at an elementary level - the stuff that a basic engineering background can cope with. There is a good sprinkling of graphs and circuits, to back up the maths, as well.This book is an example of good technical writing , written with clarity and grace."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"Zeckendorf pioneered the way for many real estate transactions that are now common. What he did with parcelling out the Empire State Building is a fantastic thing to read about. The book is a great read. I'm trying to copy much of his philosophy. Hey if a baker can bake the same piece of bread in NYC as he can in Denver, CO, I should hit paydirt! I'm a small-time Realtor compared to Zeckendorf. This autobiography deals straight with the man and how his mind functioned so he could become incredibly wealthy. And he worked hard AND smart during his career. This book will make you think. You will get understanding in the game of negotiating. You will learn how to pick the right friends and business associates. You will learn lots and lots of stuff that will help you in your real estate career."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"This little book provides a very personal and sometimes colourful account of the chronicles of the rise and fall of Webb &amp; Knapp, with particular emphasis on Zeckendorf's companies role in the early years of urban redevelopment. Some extracts:- On travelling: &quot;We travelled in high style in a chaffeur-driven car through France, across Switzerland, and down to Italy, sampling wines, museums, cathedrals and vistas&quot; (p.25)- On socializing: &quot;...the Rocky Mountain News gleefully produced a picture of me a la cowboy and some of the wedding guests al fresco&quot; (p.130)- On leverage: &quot;I was often in debt, sometimes little more than two jumps ahead of the sheriff, and forever scrambling for some way to turn an extra dollar. Whenever I did get a little money ahead, I tried to put it to work&quot; (p.32)- On ideas: &quot;That night I could hardly sleep as I chased my own ideas, tied them down with facts and figures, altered them, made compromises, returned to original notions, and finally realized I was no dealing with fantasy but with genuine possibility&quot; (p.66)- On testosterone: &quot;...with our great, masculine building standing up against the Montreal skyline like a man surrounded by boys...&quot; (p.195)- On attitude: &quot;We hereby offer to the UN approximately 17 acres...for any price they wish to pay&quot; (p.69)Many more interesting accounts. A good read. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"Not since the days of the Louisiana Purchase has America seen any bigger real estate transactions than those executed by William Zeckendorf, the derring-do head of Webb & Knapp. Figuring with supersonic speed and an uncanny flair for making money, the flamboyant impressario bought and sold property, remodeled whole sections of New York, Denver, Washington, Montreal and Dallas, and moved the UN, the capital of the world, to New York. At the peak of his power, he was a man with the Midas touch in an age of computers.He played a real life game of Monopoly and won the largest real estate empire in the world...so large, in fact, that Wall Street tottered when he went bankrupt. And bankrupt he was, but never in spirit.An autobiography bursting with vitality, enthusiasm, and financial know-how, he reveals himself as a visionary whose creativeness and sense of adventure are matched only by his unalloyed joy at being able to successfully juggle a dozen incredibly complicated transactions at once.Zeckendorf's grandfather was a German immigrant and Indian trader who, in 1868, established a store in Tucson, Arizona (Steindorf's). William was born in Paris, Illinois, in 1905."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"William (Big-Bill) Zeckendorf came up with ways to slice and dice real estate transactions that were revolutionary in his day. He started out as many empire builders had as a rent collector in 1925 for his uncle but quickly moved on to successfully renting office space then to brokering deals. The book shows how real ingenuity and creativity can create fortunes in the real estate business. The one thing you definitely get from this book and it's probably the most important concept in real estate, is to think outside the box when looking at a deal.The book gives a very interesting history of NY City real estate. Talking about how people were flipping properties, sometimes several a day in the roaring 1920's and how during the depression trophy properties were selling for as low as a tenth of there value. As an example, Mr. Getty paid $2.5 million for the Pierre Hotel and sold it ten years later for almost ten times that.In 1942 fate intervened with Zeckendorf. Winning the opportunity to manage Vincent Astor's $50 million debt free portfolio (which was showing a slight annual loss at the time) he showed what aggressive management was all about. In three years he has done 152 transactions, increased the estate by $15 million and increased Astor's cash flow by $2.5 million. By the way, $50 million in 1942 is worth approximately $621 million today.{ See - minneapolisfed.org/research/data/us/calc/ for an inflation adjusted calculator)From then on in its deals galore; William hot tails it all over the world doing deals with flair and flamboyance. Deal after deal, sometimes several at a time. Working out financing that will make your head spin. Syndicating deals, cross collateralizing properties and leveraging the house for the next irresistible deal.Real estate operator's in this day and age can learn lots of lesions from this book and others mentioned on my other reviews and my blog - www.bloglines.com/blog/KevinKingstonBy Kevin Kingston, Author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"William Zeckendorf was a real estate developer from New York City during the fifties and sixties. He published in 1970 an account of his life. Zeckendorf was a marvellous and ingenious maker of money and real estate deals. He established his fame by handling the famous Astor properties in New York. In later years he had a portfolio all over the United States, even in Canada, especially Montreal. A well known deal is the buying and selling of the site along the East River between 42nd and 48th Street. It was a site where slaughterhouses were located. The replacement of these slaughterhouses was since long projected, but no action was ever taken. Zeckendorf bought the site and kept it off the market for a while In the mean time he acquired by brokers surrounding parcels of land. In the end this site became the seat of the United Nations Head Quarters. Zeckendorf is a wonderful storyteller. In 1965 he went broke in a way that vaguely reminds us of recent Wall Street disasters. Zeckendorf is a delightful biography."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"I read this book about 20 years ago when a friend lent me a copy. To this day I have never found any other creative real estate book that was so informative and motivating. I credit my own financial success to Mentors who I have learned from personally and by books like this.Mr. Zeckendorf truly believed in Arbitrage Real Estate; the ability to control and remarket real estate quickly for immediate profit. He used the Lease Purchase/Lease Option technique for control without heavy investment and liability. He was also able to generate multiple streams of income and lived the good life but was not ostentatious. He was a doer not a whinner. He didn't wait for things to happen he made them happen.The only shame is that this book is not more widely available for seasoned and neophyte investors. $300.00 is a great deal for one book.Would I pay for it ?You bet :-)Claude Diamond"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of William Zeckendorf","review":"Consider this and Nickerson book to be the best to get &quot;the feel&quot; of real estate.

Here it is Mr. Perry : )I am under 14 (this book is written for 10 - 14 year olds) and enjoyed this book very much. It is a thrilling mystery that I could not put down! (i stayed up till 3am reading it)Kelly McCabe is quite a role model, she is adventurous, daring but carefully thinking things through, and is an eleven year old detective, which will appeal to kids.For all girls (and possibly boys) who enjoy the Nancy Drew series, the new Kelly McCabe series will surely delight them.After reading this book, i thought to myself that there was something slightly peculiar about it. I couldn't figure it out, but after myself thinking, \\"This would make a great movie\\" i found it. Mr. Perry is an award winning screen writer, and his books are very visual and audible. They make you imagine you are really there. (it would, in fact, make a fantastic movie)However, Kelly's father in the book passed away a year ago, but she can hear him talking to her in her mind (giving her advice about clue's) which may bother some parents. There was one \\"D\\" word in the book when someone got mad.But I would reccomend this boook to my friends and family. I can't wait for the second in the series. Nice work Mr. Perry!!!!M.R.W."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"Growing up in Oklahoma in the 1960s could be like a ride on a rollercoaster. Girls, cars, sports, even bullies - all the things that we teenagers were so involved with. Alan B Hollingsworth has managed to capture every sudden swerve and rolling upturn in his first novel, Flatbellies. Richly populated with characters drawn from his high school years, Hollingsworth has recreated in the not-so-mythical hamlet of El Viento the world as he knew it. I found myself drawn into the lives of his characters, heroes and villains alike. This became one of those books where you say, \\"I just have to read another chapter, even if I do have to get up in the morning to go to work!\\" You too will find it was worth it."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"What a great weekend read! The struggles of golf do recapitulate the struggles of life, so in slight contradistinction to the subtitle, this book is about golf AND it's is about life. Reminiscent of Dan Jenkins' Baja Oklahoma, but somehow with a more poignant side, A. B. Hollingsworth spins a great story about a small town Oklahoma high school golf team set in in the 1960's. For me the book evokes memories of the hormones, the love, cockiness and the fear that surrounded adolescence. Perhaps it is solely because I grew up in small town America during that era; perhaps because I can identify with several of the characters, but its pages held me close. At times it made me laugh, and at times made me stare right into a passing rain storm. Any book that can do that is wonderful. If A. B. Hollingsworth can find more stories to tell, I'll find time to read them."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"Flatbellies is a brightly lit trip back to the best side of your last smooth ice. Hollingsworth weaves together the innocence and awakening of a group of friends on the brink of fun, heartbreak and life its ownself. Golf is a great backdrop for a coming of age story that is more about love and faith than a white knuckle six iron from behind the trees. I am no night owl, but I could not put this down until I finished it at 2:58 a.m."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"This is just a well-written book on adolescence in small Oklahoma community. I as the other reviewers was entranced by the book, couldn't put it down. Devoured it in two days. Great finish, and one that didn't leave me cold or wandering or even wanting more about the characters lifes, due to the Epilogue.It's about a group of guys who grow up together and eventually happen to win the state golf tournament. Intertwined in this is their love life, expectations, and the fluid-raunchy mouth of one Peachy. Fascinated by the interjection at many points of faith or lack of towards God, and ending up of Jay.Loved every minute. I too hope Hollingsworth writes more like this."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"I bought this book because I am a golfer, but the memories it stirred up of the glory days of high school in a small town are what kept me from putting it down. Hollingsworth developes the characters so vividly that you feel like you know, or know someone like each one of them. Golfer or not, you will love this book. The stories of the coming of age of the &quot;Flatbellies&quot; are something in which everyone can relate. This book is &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;Hoosiers&quot; rolled into one. &quot;Great job Alan.&quot; I hope to see more from this guy."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"Even a female, non-golfer like me found this book delightful. The fun, fear, eagerness and poignancy of growing up is common to us all. Hollingsworth has combined the innocence of a time gone by with a generation who believes nothing is impossible. The ending will astonish you!"},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"I could not put this book down. I felt like I knew each and evry one of the characters in this book. Hollingsworth has written a masterpiece. I can only hope he will produce more fiction as great as Flatbellies."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"As a golfer who was once part of a high school championship golf team myself, everything about this book brings back memories. They are of simpler times, of days when a guy's only worries were about who to ask to the prom next month, a C-minus in Physics, and a hooking 6 iron.But Hollingworth's Flatbellies, as anyone who has read the book can attest to, is as much about life, love, and the pursuit of a dream than the game of golf.Written with true character and passion, Flatbellies is example of a unique sports novel- a compelling page-turner that is a challenge to put down!"},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"This story reminded me to Stephen King's Stand By Me or Lorenzo Carcaterra's Sleepers. All are stories about a group of four teenagers who use their relationship with each other to survive the pains of growing up in the 1960;s. Where Stand By Me was grounded upon the kids' search for a dead body and Sleepers was located in a juevenile detention facility, Flatbellies is located in a sleepy Oklahoma town and the boys are the members of the local golf team.I found that I could sympathize with the storyteller, Chipper DeHart, who cares less about his own scores than whether the team can progress to the championship. You definitely want to see both the team and Chipper succeed, both on and off the course.The only real problem that I had with the book was that some of the characters seemed a little bit too stereotypical, particulary the teen wonder, Jay Justice, who combines good looks, athletic ability, and a photographic memory into a package that is just a bit too good to be true. If asked whether I wanted to spend a round golfing with Jay or the rebel from the other town, Smokey Ray Divine, I guess I'd have to take the later.Overall, I really liked the book and look forward to see if Hollingsworth has another story to tell."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"What a joy to read! I picked this book up based on a recommendation from a friend who knows I'm both a reader and a golf fan. Boy, this couldn't have been better - a great weekend read. This book grabs you from Page 1 and doesn't let go. Even after completing the book, I found myself curious about what would come next for these boys and their dreams of Sooner Magic, medical school, and the PGA Tour. Chipper, Jay, Peachy, L.K., and Buster comprise an unlikely high school golf team and the book chronicles their adventures on and off the links. Golfer or not, all readers will find something in the book to which they can relate, whether it be the mysterious Gail, the athlete L.K., or the colorful Smokey Ray Divine. I raced through this book and was sad to see it end. Could there be more from Hollingsworth and the El Viento golf team? I sure hope so!"},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"A.B. Hollingsworth, where have you been? I can scarcely imagine that this richly entertaining \\"coming of age\\" story is Hollingsworth's first novel. What a gem!The antics and adventures of Chipper, Jay, L.K., Buster and irresistibly dysfunctional Peachy are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Yet Hollingsworth also provides us with a plethora of poignant, dramatic moments: scenes that will suck the wind right out of you. The pace and flow of this book are masterful, the writing extraordinary, the ending tender and wrenching.Kudos to Sleeping Bear Press for bringing out this wonderful book from a first-time author. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"I have never golfed, nor have I any interest in the sport. However I must say this is one of the best books I have ever read.

It is not a page turner for sure, but weaves a tale that keeps one interested to seeing through to the end. The author tries to make a look at life, relationships, and character centered around golf.

I agree with others that it is a very breezy novel and was able to plow through it in two days. Unfortunately, this book fell well below my expectations. The characters were rather one-dimentional, the plot was predictable, and the conclusion flat. I'd recommend this as good adolescent fiction, but simplistic and formulaic for adult readers."},{"Title":"Flatbellies","review":"Yes, these kids play golf, but it has nothing to do with the spiritual side of golf at all.

What amazed me about this book, page after page, was Belva Plain's vivid choice of words. I felt moved by every scene, however significant, through the book. Belva knows her characters intimately and draws you into their hearts. I read paragraphs over and over again because I was so moved by Belva's ability to bring the 1800's South to life and the emotions of love, commitment, duty, religion, and heritage. This is a book that will be cherished on my shelf forever and I will surely re-read when I want to escape to power that it offers."},{"Title":"Crescent City","review":"I found this book to be extremely poignant, with well defined, strong convictions, right or wrong. Family loyalties in the face of extreme differing opinions.. overcomed inner strugles.. unfulfilled affairs of the heart.. the whole gamut of what makes a readable story with heart pounding and mind absorbing.. I will make a point of reading more of Ms Plain's books."},{"Title":"Crescent City","review":"Belva Plain has created a story that is historically accurate and completely believable as you are reading it....but there is something that she just fails to capture in writing this book. As you are reading it you are not drawn to the characters and they really aren't deep characters at all but rather shallow and superficial. The plot, while interesting, is not a page turner and it is mostly concentrated on the love aspect. Also the ending in my opinion was rather disappointing."},{"Title":"Crescent City","review":"Crescent City by Belva Plain is a historical family saga set in nineteenth century New Orleans.The story begins in 1835 when Ferdinand Raphael returns to Europe to get his children from the grandfather's home in a depressed Jewish ghetto. He takes the children David and Miriam--who is the primary point-of-view character--to New Orleans, where he has become a rich and successful businessman.As the story follows the family through the Civil War, with it's destruction of the South and the lives of the family, Miriam grows from a shy child into an effective, determined, and powerful woman. Not an easy task during those years when women were married off by their fathers and then possessed by husbands that they had not part in choosing.I found the story captivating and recommend it to anyone fascinated with the subject matter or with historical family stories.Imperfect Daddy (The Imperfect Series: A Sophia Burgess and Ray Stone Mystery)Imperfect Contract (A Sophia Burgess and Ray Stone Mystery)Illegally Dead"},{"Title":"Crescent City","review":"Did not read - saving it for long winter night.

This great novel gave me a version of how this might have turned out."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Finally we see the other side of the story!I think the main problem with the book is that it goes against what so many people round these parts believe in - that the Russian of 1980s was a Marxist, vodka-drinking, uneducated barbarian.It is good to see a book that doesn't show NATO throwing sixes on their dice and the Soviets finally getting it their own way - things go according to plan (while in Clancy's books NATO's plans always work, so why not the 'bad guys' one working too?).Although the ending is a bit implausable - I think the Soviets could have feasibly won this engagement, but NATO does give up a bit too easily.Still, it is a good book that finally shows the other side of the 'wall'."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"&quot;I am not a not a marxist and definitely hate communism. Ralph Peters however, made me root for the Russians. Beyond the weapons detail babble of technothrillers, he was able to convey the Russian soldiers as humans, not just as parts of a faceless horde. Indeed my favorite character is the Russian tank battallion commander, Major Bezarin."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"When I first picked up this book I thought I might try my luck once more and NOT find something nearer to Clancy's Red Storm Rising, but, indeed, I found it just as disappointing. Considering the intended audience, the premise of depicting a third world war from a Russian context will probably not draw much popularity but from the least jingoistic techno-thriller fan (if there are any to be had).If you adore Tom Clancy or revel in Larry Bond or Harold Coyle, this story should captivate your attention. Considering strictly the qualities I think the genre's hard core fans merit I give it a four star rating."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"A book showing the possible cold-war engagement from the Russian view? How can an author know what is in the minds of the average army soldier in the modern Russian armed forces? Ralph Peters conveys a view of the foot soldier, through a aging colonels eyes, up to the commander of all the red army forces in the conflict. A view that is sympathetic (they think and aspire for things like us), they are not brainwashed and subversive. The story is fast, detailed (without too much techo words), and very frightening. Yes, this is the main concern of this book, is its truth, its clarity, and the cold belief that if the Russians wanted Europe, they could have it. The only criticise of this book, as any by similar authors (see Tom Clancy et al), is that the ending feels short, and like the author is forced into completing the story in a single chapter."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Good book, however, Peters overestimates the Soviets and underestimates NATO. In '79 the Army of Jimmy Carter could not have stopped the Warsaw Pact. While it still would have been a hellacious fight for a while, we would have drubbed them by '89.The success of British and American forces in the '91 Gulf War against Soviet weaponry shocked them out of any comfort this book gave them."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"RED ARMY is an excellent book written by a professional tactical intelligence officer. It clearly showed the strengths of the old Soviet war fighting doctrine in an easily readable presentation.This book shows how 1) the enemy gets a vote, and 2) isn't foolish. By the former, I mean that war favors those who take the initiative, by the latter, I mean that America's enemies will always try to play to their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses - in equipment, in training, in doctrine, and in operational art.Ralph Peters got it right back in 1990 and I wish him continued success.Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a candidate for U.S. Senate in 2010, a California State Assemblyman, he served as a Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Defense from 1986 to 1988, retired from the Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel, and is the co-author of \\"China Attacks.\\"Those interested in an update to this general theme may want to check out the book I coauthored: CHINA ATTACKS."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"every time you read a war book, american(or western) troops are supermen , one soldier blows away a tousand russians with one hand grenade! it makes you sick , not that i hate americans, on the contrary, but that's just not real modern war is a massacre and this book shows that very well, it's realistic , people die a lot on both sides there is blood , steel and real war . i hate ralph peters , but hats off for being objective and giving the other guys a chance ."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"If you like military fiction at all, get your hands on this one.&quot;Red Army&quot; starts off telling of a swaggering, make-out-artist Russian infantryman paired with a timorous recruit who only wants to get back to his collective farm and listen to his rock-and-roll tapes. This puts you on notice that this is one book where the Soviets are not going to be an abstract horde. While it tends to abandon characters in the length of its text, I didn't mind too much.I work a taxicab on weekends, and I can tell you the best praise I can give a book is that it made me pick it up again and read it when stopped at red lights. &quot;Red Army&quot; was definately a 'red light book.' Don't be detered by the fact the collapse of the Soviet bloc has made these Red-Army-in-Central-Europe scenarios obsolete. This could have happened in the 1980's, and the vivid description of the battles has relevence to today.Points it makes:--a NATO-Warsaw Pact battle would have been violent in the extreme. The chances of a front line soldier on either side surviving would not have been good.--The Soviet Army never thought in terms of a stabilized front. Constant, forward movement at the highest possible speed was everything, a concept their NATO opponents had not completely grasped.--The Soviet system still was suspicious of individual success in its military officers.--This book takes place in North Germany; and depicts the Dutch, West German, and British forces as the shrimp that get hurt in the battle of the whales, i.e. the Soviet and the U.S. Army, the latter depicted as the hard-hitting machine it was in the Gulf.The book seemed to end on a sequel possible note. I can only say, it's a pity Peters never wrote one."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"When I first got this book in the early 90s, I was an Army ROTC cadet. I had serious reservations about the book then. Not because I thought it was a bad book. No. It seemed decent enough. It was the fact the Bad Guys win! Just couldnt handle it. I eventually got over my prejudices and read it through. Glad I did as its a great story.Peters gives us a picture of the Soviet Army much different than the mindless horde of barbarians we are used to. He humanizes them. We see an Army filled with competent leaders and brave soldiers who are not necessarily inclined to spout off Marxist rhetoric. We also see incompetants and cowards too. I actually found myself sympathizing with the Soviet soldiers! Peters also reveals that Soviet fighting doctrine may not have been so wrong. Just different. With Peters' military intelligence background, his portrayals carry lots of weight.While I now dont mind the author writing an outcome where the Red Army prevails, I dont necessarily agree with how he gets there. The Soviet attack on NATO is primarily focused on attacking Northern West Germany defended by Dutch, Belgian and British forces Peters believe to be weak. Ultimately the victory comes from psychological warfare. In particular, the USSR releases a tape showing what is supposed to be a West German city (its really an accurate make up of one) utterly destroyed that frightens the West German government into a cease fire. Also, they send paratroopers into the UK/Dutch/Belgian zones to commit atrocities which causes these NATO forces to expend time in mop up operations. Given the German/Russian historical record, I dont think this is enough to get the Germans to sue for peace and the Dutch, Belgian and UK military are certainly smart enough to not fall for the paratroop diversion.Despite this, Peters makes a compelling case for the fighting prowess of the Red Army. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"As a crew member on an M1 tank in Germany, in the closing days of the Cold War this was one of my Fav books. Read by everyone in my platoon, it was a facinating look at how the guys we were tasked to turn back might crash across the border and wage war. A real page turner full of combat, but with a human side to it."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Outstanding. The characters are as 3-D as they can possibly get on paper and the action never stops. I've read this book twice and it never got old."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Riveting. Could not put it down. I read the book, in 1989 when first published, after having served as an armored cavalry troop commander along the East German (yes, there were two Germanies back then) and Czech borders some years before. (M-551 and then M-60A1E1) In West Germany we studied, planned, war-gamed, and rehearsed the Fulda and Meiningen Gaps. The book, with the weapons capabilities and limitations, human dimensions of the nationalities, weather, terrain, politics, tactics, and operational art all surely did have the ring of authenticity when reading it back in those days--authenticity for me and other members of the faculty of the Army Command & General Staff College and the 3rd Infantry Division (Mech)/7th Armored Cavalry who had also served in West Germany. Emotionally, I may or may not have liked the ending; professionally, I had a hunch that it was entirely plausible. One of my favorites. Have enjoyed it several times since first purchased.
