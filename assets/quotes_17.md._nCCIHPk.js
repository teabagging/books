It is very clear, that by allowing the strategy to vary, one can get optimal (at least stationary) values. The strategy dynamics are introduced in a rather confusing way, without much of an explanation.For the rest, it seems, that 80% of the book are numerical examples, which seem to prove mostly, that with nonlinear differential equations, the behaviour of (e.g.) stationary points can vary quite a bit, if the coefficients in those equations are changed.Maybe a professional biologist gets a lot out of this book, but for the interested layman it offers little (except upteen numerical examples, see above)"},{"Title":"EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY, NATURAL SELECTION, AND DARWINIAN DYNAMICS","review":"First, full disclosure: I am a colleague and friend of the authors, Thomas L. Vincent and Joel S. Brown, and I reviewed the entire book during its writing.Game theory is a fairly recent development in mathematics, having been introduced in the 1940's. Evolutionary Game Theory is more recent yet - Maynard Smith and Price put it on the map with their publication in Nature in 1973 on the Logic of Animal Conflict. Maynard Smith then more fully elaborated the application of matrix games to evolution with his 1982 volume, Evolution and the Theory of Games. Vincent and Brown trace their contribution to the pioneering developments of Maynard Smith, but in this volume, they go much further. As I reviewed the eleven chapters as they were first written, I felt the privilege of observing, first hand, the construction of a great edifice. In this edifice, the dynamics of ecology is dovetailed with the dynamics of heritable strategies. The tool that accomplishes this is the fitness generating function, known as the G-function. Particularly brilliant is the invention of the virtual strategy, a scalar or vector \\"place holder\\" in the G-function. The great virtue of the virtual strategy is that it represents any focal individual taking on any strategy within the entire strategy set of the species. The fitness generating function then determines the fitness for that virtual strategy within the biotic and abiotic environment defined by the set of arguments (e.g., resident strategies, their population sizes, abundance of resources, etc.) defining the G-function. With G-function in hand, Evolutionary Game Theorists now have a mathematical Darwinism - a formal mathematical expression of Darwin's three postulates: a) like begets like; b) organisms struggle for existence; c) heritable traits help determine the outcome of the struggle. With the G-function, we can predict both the dynamics of heritable strategies and the adaptive outcome of natural selection.Vincent and Brown begin, in Chapter 1, with an historical and philosophical overview of Evolutionary Game Theory and its relationship to the more traditional approach of Evolutionary Genetics. They then proceed to lay the mathematical foundations (Chapters 2 - 7), constructing the theory of Evolutionary Games and the G-function. These chapters each contain useful examples, teaching the student of evolutionary games how to apply the G-function. Noteworthy is that most all of the examples in these chapters represent continuous, as opposed to matrix games. In matrix games, which constitute the bulk of early development of Evolutionary Game Theory, and with which most readers are probably most familiar, strategies are discrete rather than continuous. However, the continuous games elaborated by Vincent and Brown (and now, many others) are of far more useful application in Evolutionary Ecology. Key contributions here are the precise mathematical definition of Maynard Smith's seminal Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) in Chapter 6, and the formulation of the ESS Maximum Principle in Chapter 7. This principle establishes the well-recognized properties of the ESS of invasion resistance and convergent stability, but also the fit of form and function - the ESS strategy is an adaptation - it maximizes individual fitness given the circumstances.Chapter 8, which treats species concepts, speciation, and extinction, is particularly enlightening. Here the G-function shines! Under traditional approaches, a huge chasm, conceptual and methodological, separates microevolution and macroevolution. Vincent and Brown, armed with the G-function, unify the two: Microevolution is repeatable and reversible evolutionary dynamics within a G-function. Macroevolution is the production of novel G-functions. They demonstrate the versatility of the G-function approach to Evolutionary Game Theory in their discussion of three contexts for extinction (which is as integral to evolution as is speciation). Vincent and Brown introduce many key concepts in Chapter 8. Perhaps most important is their strategy species concept, which relies on their definition of the species archetype. They provide a particularly cogent definition of a species that is ecologically keystone (its presence promotes the persistence, in ecological time, of other species in the community), but they also point out that a species can by evolutionarily keystone - when its presence increases the numbers of species at an ESS. Using these developments, Vincent and Brown investigate mechanisms of speciation, including sympatric speciation, allopatric speciation, adaptive radiations, coevolution, Wright's shifting balance theory, and incumbent replacement. They conclude with a tour de force: a concise and brilliant discussion of the Procession of Life. As they aptly demonstrate, with the G-function approach to the Game of Life, theories such as Punctuated Equilibrium, oft cited as a contradiction of Darwinian Evolution, instead result naturally from Darwin's three postulates!Chapter 9 is perhaps the least exciting chapter, but it serves the utilitarian purpose of melding the matrix approach to Evolutionary Game Theory with the G-function approach. This is, indeed, required reading for those who think matrix games are the only game in town.Chapters 10 and 11 are well worth the wait and development. In these chapters, Vincent and Brown apply the G-function to an impressive diversity of problems arising in the beautiful metaphor of Hutchinson, the Ecological Theater and Evolutionary Play. Though the diversity of topics covered in these two chapters is impressive, as Vincent and Brown state, it represents only a subset of the problems that can be investigated with G-functions. Chapter 10 addresses \\"basic\\" issues of Evolutionary Ecology - a who's who of fundamental subjects. These include: Habitat selection and the ideal free distribution; Consumer-resource games, with examples on plant competition and root-shoot ratio; Carcinogenesis (a must read for all interested in Darwinian Medicine); Flowering time for annual plants; Root competition; and Foraging games.Chapter 11 turns to the G-function as a fundamental tool for Applied Evolutionary Ecology. Here Vincent and Brown examine: Evolutionary responses to harvesting; Resource management and conservation; and Chemotherapy-driven evolution. They contrast management based on ecological enlightenment with that based on evolutionary enlightenment (prescriptions based on each emphasis are not always identical!). They point out the resemblance of control of a cancer with chemotherapy with control of a population through hunting. The analysis is striking, with the main message that if all cancer cells are not destroyed by a chemotherapy session, the survivors will evolve as the first step of what they call chemotherapy-driven evolution. If ever Evolutionary Ecologists were looking for a raison d'tre, here they have it!"},{"Title":"EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY, NATURAL SELECTION, AND DARWINIAN DYNAMICS","review":"&#65279;Evolutionary Game Theory, Natural Selection, and Darwinian Dynamics by Thomas L. Vincent and Joel S. Brown is a book that not only belongs among the classics of evolutionary theory, but should have pride of place on the shelf right after Darwin's Origin of Species and Maynard Smith's Evolution and the Theory of Games.This book makes a novel, interesting and readable contribution to the proper understanding of Darwinian processes in evolution. Based on more than twenty years of collaboration between the authors, the book is a comprehensive review of Darwinian theory newly cast in an over-arching mathematical framework. Unlike Stephen Jay Gould's recent overview of evolutionary theory (The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, 2002, 1433 pages), Vincent & Brown's book is concise (382 pages), uncluttered, and supported by an elegant skeleton of mathematical theory.Don't let the math dissuade you however. If you have read Origin of Species and have a familiarity with classic evolutionary games, you won't have trouble understanding this book. Text and numerous examples provide a clear conceptual explanation of equations throughout.The book's premise is that life is a game and its players have strategies. Understood as such, the authors present fitness-generating functions (G-functions) that encompass strategy, population, and Darwinian dynamics to model evolutionary outcomes. The first chapter introduces this philosophy; the next six chapters develop the theory, presenting classic population models (Ch. 2) and evolutionary games (Ch. 3), then forging new theory through deriving G-functions (Ch. 4), modeling Darwinian dynamics (Ch. 5), finding the evolutionary stable strategies (ESS, Ch. 6) and developing their general ESS maximum principle (Ch. 7).The authors are able to side-step population-genetics models (and notably, are able to explain WHY this is possible), and build a general model of Darwinian evolution. An immediate insight of their general model is the concept of flexible landscapes, which re-envisions the notion that natural selection cannot cross valleys on evolutionary landscapes, one of the fundamental criticisms of Darwinian theory since the New Synthesis. Exploration of Vincent & Brown's model illustrates that flexible landscapes can shift under evolving populations so that \\"valleys\\" are spanned by continuously uphill routes, re-forming behind evolving populations after they have passed. Further, Vincent & Brown derive the general conditions where flexible landscapes will or will not occur (frequency-dependent vs. -independent evolution respectively).Armed with their general theory, Vincent & Brown are not content to stop after illuminating the valley conundrum, however, and go on in subsequent chapters to apply their theory to classic problems in evolution (Ch. 8; sympatric and allopatric speciation, co-evolution, the difference between micro- and macro-evolution) and ecology (Ch. 9 & 10; sex ratios, cooperation, ideal free distribution, consumer-resource competition), and even medicine (Ch. 10; the ontogenesis of cancer, chemotherapy) and ecosystem management (Ch. 11, evolutionary stable and ecologically enlightened resource management).In short, Vincent and Brown have written a marvelous book; and from the day it was published, any evolutionary scholar who has not read it has been behind in the field, and has some catching up to do. It should also be read by ecologists, behaviorists, medical researchers and resource managers interested in evolutionary aspects of their work."},{"Title":"EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY, NATURAL SELECTION, AND DARWINIAN DYNAMICS","review":"Charles Darwin published his primary thesis 'The Origin of Species' in 1859. It was a masterpiece of logical deduction based on the observations he had made while serving as a naturalist aboard the H.M.S. Beagle on a scientific expedition around the world. His views were both orthodox for the day and flawed.Only seven years later Mendel published the results of his research on genetics. Over time these sciences were merged together into what is now called the 'Modern Synthesis.' Genetics explains the why and the how of species begetting species, and how changes in the species are made when a change is made in the genes.In 1944, with the advances in mathematics, von Neumann and Morgenstern published 'Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.' Over time the modern synthesis of the genertic approach to evolution has been fit into game theory to help understand how the randomness of genetic evolution can be predicted using game theory.This book gives a rigorous introduction to the mathematics of game theory as applied to Natural Selection. The book presents the tools necessary for understanding many of Nature's mysteries."},{"Title":"The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging","review":"Dr. Andrew Weil provides an endorsement on the back cover saying \\"This is by far the best book I've read on the science of aging.\\" I wonder why. It is definitely NOT the best book I've read on the science of aging. Better are: Austad, Steven N. Why We Age: What Science Is Discovering about the Body's Journey Through Life. (1997); Clark, William R. A Means to an End: The Biological Basis of Aging and Death (1999); and Hayflick, Leonard. How and Why We Age (1994)--see my reviews at Amazon.com. All three of these books explain aging and the evolutionary necessity for death better than Olshansky and Carnes.I think what Andrew Weil liked about this book is the authors' endorsement of alternative medicine and their mention of Dr. Weil as \\"a leading proponent of this approach...emphasizing the importance of the natural healing and protective powers of the body in a way that is identical to that of evolutionary medicine.\\" (pp. 146-147) It should be understood that while the authors endorse the principles of evolutionary medicine they do not endorse the use of many popular food supplements as a means of gaining longevity, including some advocated by Dr. Weil. Of course, Weil advocates their use for \\"optimum health\\" not as a means to anything like immortality. See his engaging best-seller, Eating Well for Optimum Health: The Essential Guide to Food, Diet, and Nutrition (2000).What this book has going for it is a clear statement of the demographic facts about aging and death, and some good arguments explaining why the facts are as they are and not as we would like them to be. In particular, we are warned about the \\"Prolongevists\\" who make unsubstantiated claims about the possibility of living very long lives or of attaining immortality. They begin with the Taoists and the alchemists, through Roger Bacon and Luigi Cornaro, to the unnamed \\"advocates of extreme prolongevity\\" who, it is implied, believe that \\"meditating and eating fresh fruits and vegetables\\" will lead to \\"an ageless body and timeless mind,\\" (p. 235), and they debunk them all. In a sense, theirs is an extended argument against buying any snake oil (in bottle or book form) that promises anything beyond the actuary tables. Clearly Olshansky and Carnes see their book as a clear-eyed \\"answer\\" to authors like Deepak Chopra , the mesmerizing author of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind (1993) and many other books, who would have us believe in pollyannaish possibilities.While I agree that some kind of counter balance to the feel-good fuzziness of some New Age authors is necessary, I think that Olshansky and Carnes may have hurt their cause by not emphasizing the fact that humans need hope perhaps as much as they need factual knowledge. Furthermore, I think the authors may have aimed a little below their readership; witness the fact that the word \\"senescence\\" virtually does not appear in the book and is not in the index. Also, do they really think that their readers need to be advised (see page 35) that Tao is pronounced \\"Dow\\"?Nonetheless, this is an attractive book and an easy read. I particularly liked the chapter on antioxidants, which makes it clear that such supplements are unlikely to be of any value in fighting senescence. Also excellent is the Appendix which is a \\"Life Table\\" giving years and days of life remaining for males and females at any age from 0 to 110 along with the probability of living to the next birthday. If you're male and a year old all the way up to being 29-years-old, you have a 99.9 percent probability of living to your next birthday. If you're a female, extend that to age 41. If you're a fifty-year-old woman, you have, on average, 11,651 days of life left."},{"Title":"The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging","review":"This is an extremely disappointing book. It is superficial, repetitive, padded, sometimes illogical, and could be boiled down to a magazine article with no loss of content. The main point is pretty simple. Now that we have mostly conquered infectious disease in rich countries, what kills us is accumulated genetic damage, and there is no magic potion to treat it. Vitamins, herbs, dietary supplement, etc. are a waste of money. Basically, the authors wrote this book to warn against exaggerated claims about products purporting to prolong life. I have no quarrel with this point, only with the black and white nature of their thinking.What I was hoping to find, and didn't, was practical advice, based on current scientific knowledge, on what I (or anyone) could do to live longer and healthier. What about diet? Avoiding toxins in the environment? Reducing stress? The authors mention that a healthy life style can add about 900 days to the average life span. Explain that to me in detail and I'll be delighted. But they don't explain it, and what little advice they offer contains nothing new.The authors are research scientists interested in the possibilities of genetic engineering to further extend the human life span. They strictly believe in science and the medical model. They provide some information on why our genetic inheritance limits the human life span and where breakthroughs in genetic engineering might soon occur. Their science is quite watered down, however, below the level of Scientific American. They often refer to ethical considerations, but take no stand. The possibilities for genetically altering pigs to produce internal organs for transplant into humans seems to enthuse them, for example, but there is no sign of concern about the ethical treatment of other living creatures.One of the important topics in the book is the discussion of how free radicals damage genetic material in our cells and whether taking antioxidants can help. Even here they are sketchy, illogical and, therefore, misleading. I'll illustrate with only one point. Stripped to its essentials, the authors argue that no one should spend the money on vitamins, herbs, or any alternative medicine product because the results differ greatly among individuals, and relatively few individuals would receive the greatest benefit. But what if you are one of those people who would benefit?The authors are rightly concerned that a lot of wrong information is besieging the public, but they are unfocused on who their target audience might be. I think they missed all their potential targets and can't imagine who would gain much from this book."},{"Title":"The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging","review":"I read The Quest For Immortality last spring with some expectation that my preconceptions about aging research would be seriously challenged. Instead, afterward I had the impression that, if this is the best these authors can do to debunk the claims of &quot;prolongevists,&quot; then I'm more confident than ever that substantial life extension will be a reality in the near future.Olshansky and Carnes agree with a variation of the commonly held &quot;wear and tear&quot; theory of aging--a version which holds that accumulated, random unrepaired damage, over time, causes aging. In their view, aging is not programmed by evolution, but results because our cells, though remarkably good at repairing random DNA damage, still do not do so perfectly. But in stating this, Olshansky and Carnes have to ignore some fairly obvious things.First, somatic cells have, in vitro, been brought from a senescent state back to a more youthful state. So it is clear that not all somatic cells suffer from degraded DNA that induces senescence; it is also clear that the senescence of at least some cells is not the result of random DNA errors, or it could not be so easily reversed.Second, nowhere is this supposedly critical random DNA damage quantified. Nowhere do they tell you how prevalent the accumulated damage is, how many or what genes it affects, or what tissues suffer most from it. In contrast, adherents of other theories can at least quantify certain aspects of things such as hormone levels or telomere shortening.Although this book is written in an entertaining style that is well-targeted to the lay reader, I cannot give it more than three stars, not only because I think their reasoning is not persuasive, but also because I think their writing has been deficient in several places. Some examples:(1) On p. 187, they start a chapter by saying that telomerase was discovered in 1998, and reported with great fanfare. This is not true. I have not been able to find the exact date of discovery, but telomerase was discovered no later than about 1989; this appears to revolve around work done by Carol Greider and Cal Harley at Cold Spring Harbor NY. The 1998 discoveries involved consequences to cells (renewed ability to divide) when telomerase was activated in those cells.(2) One of the authors starts the book with a foreword in which he heaps scorns on the misguided health concerns of his in-laws--not a high note on which to begin a supposedly serious discussion!(3) In a similar vein, another chapter starts with several derogatory remarks about the work of Michael Rose with fruit flies. Later, they speak of him in a more complimentary way. If the authors don't think much of Rose's work, fair enough; but they should just say so, and forthrightly tell you why. There seems a puzzling contrast between the different comments made about Rose's work.(4) Around page 192, in discussing caloric restriction experiments with animals, they suppose that the control animals were allowed to &quot;lay around and get fat,&quot; so that the findings would not be generalizable to other normal (not obese) animals. The usual assumption would be that the caloric intake of both groups would be regulated, at different levels. There is no confirmation that this was not the case. Some clarification could be helpful here.Olshansky and Carnes have used questionable reasoning elsewhere as well. In an article in Scientific American around the time of the book's release, they paint a whimsical picture of what humans would be like if we were designed by nature to live decades longer than we do. Knee joints would be equipped for durability, not speed. Throats would be shaped to prevent choking. And so on. But nature does not design animals to hang on during an extended period of decline; and the aim of prolongevists is likewise not to extend a terminal period of decline, but to preserve youthful functioning. So it's not clear what their purpose is in putting forth this fictional scenario.Aging research is a field sorely in need of clarification of important questions that are not adequately addressed by this book."},{"Title":"The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging","review":"I picked up a copy of The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging after watching Dr. Olshansky discuss his book and issues associated with human aging on Orange County Television in early January. Having been intrigued by the changes I've seen in my own body through the decades, I found Olshansky's perspective on aging to be fascinating and refreshingly honest. With a copy of his book in hand..., I flipped it over to find endorsements from what I have since discovered is a powerful set of authorities on aging. I was most surprised to find a glowing endorsement from Dr. Andrew Weil, who suggested that this was the best book on the science of aging that he had ever read. Over the years I have come to admire, respect and trust Dr. Weil, and now having read the book he so heartily endorsed, I can see why Dr. Weil and this authoritative group would provide such laudatory comments. What these authors did was, perhaps for the first time that I've seen, provide the general public with a scientifically accurate view of human aging that is easily digestible by everyone. None of the hype; no lies about how we can all stop or reverse aging or achieve an Ageless Body and Timeless Mind as suggested by Deepak Chopra (I've read all of his books); none of the exaggeration or lies about stopping or reversing aging by eating vitamins or antioxidants; and none of the hoopla like that coming from the world of anti-aging medicine where they would have you believe that aging can be reversed with the use of hormones or mind control. Olshansky and Carnes use the first chapter to take the reader on what I found to be a fascinating journey through the history of thought on aging and death. I discovered that the 120 year lifespan thought by many to be the scientific view of how long we can all live, actually comes from a passage in the Old Testament. The origin of alchemy came not from any great desire to transmute lead into gold for aesthetic purposes - gold was sought after because people thought it would make them live longer if they ate it. What I found most fascinating was the description of the legends passed down through the centuries designed to convince people that much longer lives are possible, legends that have made their way into contemporary literature and the ommercialization of anti-aging products (which are described in some detail later in the book). Olshansky and Carnes avoid criticizing directly any of the modern longevity salesmen. What they do instead is let us look at the historical and contemporary world of aging through their eyes, which then makes painfully obvious how those who know very little about aging, are trying to exploit the general public for profit. Not surprisingly, this shameless exploitation has been going on for thousands of years. In later chapters, Olshansky and Carnes explain why life expectancy cannot rise to the levels claimed by many scientists; why there is a scientific reason to expect a link between when sex and death occur; how medical technology contributes to our longer lifespan; the true story behind antioxidants and how scientists may be closing in on a genuine pharmaceutical fountain of youth; the frontier of genetic engineering that will change life and death as we know it; and how the modern approach to medicine may not be the best approach we need to take when it comes to the diseases and disorders associated with growing older. It is also obvious now why Dr. Weil so heartily endorsed this book, because Olshansky and Carnes echo Weil's perspective that one of the best ways to deal with health problems associated with growing older is to enhance the body's ability to heal itself. The Quest for Immortality deserves the accolades it has received. I anticipate that the anti-aging industry is going to be very upset about being exposed for having perpetuated a three-thousand year old legend about human aging and longevity. The authors of these anti-aging books are going to be even more upset for having been exposed as either frauds, or trying to make the public feel guilty about aging in order to persuade them to buy their worthless or unproven products. Ignore them all. Olshansky and Carnes know the science, they authoritatively inform us that the most important elements of aging are within our control, and they explain in simple and clear language why most people have the opportunity to enhance the quality of their life, no matter how old they are, and how such improvements can be achieved.

Once you get to the end of this book you'll understand what aging is really all about, and why many of us (myself included) have fallen into a trap of false hope about the so-called health benefits of products touted by their proponents as ways to stop or reverse aging. These authors obviously know what they're talking about, and perhaps more important, they found a way to tell us about aging in way that is interesting and understandable. Will I live my life differently as a result? Absolutely! I'm going to stop obsessing about aging and do my best to follow the author's tongue-in-cheek recipe for health and longevity contained in the last chapter. I'll also look at the daily stories about anti-aging products with a healthy dose of skepticism.

And, as with any fully developed language, regardless of how dead it may be now, Latin is awash with declensions and tenses and conjugations and idions, so that even the simplest words have dozens of different forms, and it takes years to learn them all with proficiency. But I don't need that. What I need is something to look up stock phrases and give their meaning as used in situ.There, for example, I used a common Latin phrase used in all sorts of situations. This dictionary gives just the right amount of explanation and just the right number of examples. \\"Eleven Stonehenge stones are standing in situ.\\" My favorite Latin expression, which shows up so often in reviews of stories, is \\"deux ex machina\\". Many have come to know this as a way out of a tight spot for the heros of a story. Tom Bombadil in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is my favorite example. What we may not know, and what this dictionary supplies, is that the term from stagecraft, where a machine above the open stage, allows \\"God\\" or an angel or whatever, to be lowered to do some business in front of the audience. Not necessarily a rescue, but certainly an \\"unexpected intervention.\\""},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Latin Words and Phrases","review":"This is an excellent quick review of Latin words and phrases.

We'd spend nights after dinner reading through our names (I have 7 siblings). What was so amazing was that even though I come from an asian ethnicity/background, this book profoundly describes each and every one of us (even my parents) to the dot!!! I cherished this book a lot and it gave me hours of entertainment --- I'd even take it to school and my grade school best friend and I would check out teachers, classmates, etc... It amazes me how Mr. La Rouzic was able to connect all those names to those traits related to personality types and be pretty accurate about it to this day. I hope they publish more of these --- maybe then we'd get a better understanding on how to mix and match names so there won't be a &quot;clash&quot; of personality types (might be the source of the so-called 'split-personality' theory) and there'd be a lot less oddly-named people in this world. To date, nothing i've read on name books come close to this. I highly recommend this.Good luck finding it!"},{"Title":"Name Book","review":"I recently discovered \\"the secret meaning of names\\" and am, to say the least, absolutely amazed!

My family members have read about their names and have been in complete awe. If not for your baby, buy it for yourself!

What a treasure! I was stunned to find my unusual (self-chosen) name included, and the name I was given at birth, but most of all, to discover the REASON my birth name never fit! Why it always gave me the willies to speak it aloud! And to learn that I'd chosen a name for myself that not only fits my personality, but my highest aspirations, all the qualities in myself I wished to reinforce and none of those I'd rather do without.I highly recommend this book for sheer fun and enlightenment! Not much explanation for how Mr. Le Rouzic determined all these things (sadly, because I'd love to know); I wish it had a companion volume explaining this. But I do know that the frequency or resonance of the names we bear does indeed have an important impact on our lives. Must have been his life's work and it must have been inspired.I think everyone should own this book for better self-understanding and improved relationships. It's costly, but your name is with you every moment of every day. Isn't a better knowledge of what it's broadcasting, both to you and about you, worth the steep price? And if it's all wrong for you--it's not too late to choose a better one!"},{"Title":"Name Book","review":"This book has a ton of girl's and boy's names.

Unfortunately, this book gives no in-depth explanation of any basis associated with names but rather assures the reader that the author has studied names for over 50 years and knows what he's talking about. The beginning of the book attempts to explain some things but only a paragraph or so is offered for each topic, certainly no real in-depth information. The whole book was terribly disappointing and the numerous typos are surprising - someone did not proof this book.I highly recommend \\"The Hidden Truth of Your Name - The Nomenology Project\\" over this book. Fewer names are included but the principles are explained so much better. I also feel the attributes for each name are much more accurate than the ones in \\"The Secret Meaning of Names\\". The secret is to start with the right book first and to learn why there is meaning to names."},{"Title":"Name Book","review":"This is a great book anyone who is interested in the vibration of names and how it affects your personality will be interested in this book.Donna"},{"Title":"Name Book","review":"I have had this book for a many years.

The more common names have several different personality types to choose which describes you or someone else best, such a Lisa had two different types, number 7 and number 34, number 7 is 100% me, The Seeker of Experience. It has so many names and they match up really well to so many people. Naming is an important thing and it does effect who you are, and this helps you know yourself a little better.

It is is good in one way, it gives descriptions of names like Robert and Barnaby, as to what each name will give that person the most in resources. I found this book many years ago and thought if I ever had a child, I would name him Robert.This book, of all that I have ever seen, needs a \\"look inside\\" because you really don't know what your are getting here. This book is divided into numbers for a \\"pilot\\" name that encompases other like names, defined by color. Dominique is a certain color, yellow and under that number 31, and color (such as blue or yellow etc) is group of names which also have the same qualties such as Camille and Darlene. Why is Dominique a yellow yet Beatrice is a blue? Not explained.And that is where I part company with the 5 star reviews. For instance, the name \\"Lee\\" is under four different numbers. The name Lana is under two different colors. Which is it? Also, the name Pat has a different total value for a woman, hey guess what, less! than Pat for a man.The author takes a wheel then divides it up into pie sections such as business, social, marriage. A name is a name if it is Pat, then the pronology is what it is, irregardless of the sex. It society that colors the meaning.The wheel is shaded to show which parts of the name are the strongest. Again, Pat in the men's section had more shading than the woman's section.I felt the author was sexist, to say the least. If you had to score a paper and it was written by a Lee or a Pat, and didn't know the sex, you would probably rate it where it stood. HOwever, I read of any interesting report while studing for my sociology degree. An experiment was done where the same report was give to students in classes all over the world. One had a male name and one had a female name. In most countries students rated paper written by women less, except for Israel where they rated the reports the same.That pretty much sums up this book too. I also agree with the other reviewer that the author gives practally no detail about how he arrived at the varoius colors.Finally in looking at the names of people I know, they are somewhat accurate. This is a good book to get if you are going to name your baby. This edition has a lot of european names as well as names I have never heard of. So if you are nameing your baby a current popular name it might not be included."},{"Title":"The Skull of the Waltzing Clown","review":"This is one of the best of the two dozen or so Keeler novels I've read so far. It is basically a wild circus of false identities, since pretty much all the characters except the crooked millionaire who sets the plot in motion (and who's of course running for Mayor of Chicago!) are sailing under assumed names and even assumed identities.The basic plot involves a complex insurance scam which is made possible by a mix-up of anthropometric records, and the fact that one plotter, an undertaker, has undetectable access to a buried coffin and the body it contains. The astonishing revelation that Keeler typically reserves for the final sentences is certainly one that no reader will see coming, and sort of turns the entire framework of the novel sideways at the very last possible instant... highly unsettling, and I actually had to go back and reread the last three or four pages carefully to take it all in.Revenge is also a running theme in the novel, in that several characters, some good and some evil, are looking for a chance to exact revenge or retribution on evil(?) characters who did them great harm in earlier years, and who are now very difficult or impossible to identify (false identities, remember).There are all the usual Keeler decorations, such as a strange drug that puts the taker into a coma for weeks, and then acts as a kind of truth serum when the taker regains consciousness. There's a pulp magazine (the evil millionaire is the publisher) which is very unlike any actual pulp magazine ever published, but which also has eerie similarities to the pulp Keeler himself edited at one time... and its presence as a minor plot device gives Keeler an opportunity for a mini-lecture on the pulp industry as it existed in those days. There are so many good things to find here that I turned over each new page with high expectations, and I was generally not disappointed."},{"Title":"God, Dreams, and Revelation: A Christian Interpretation of Dreams (Revised and Expanded Edition)","review":"I was rather disappointed by this book. Actually it is very well written and researched, but the title \\"...A Christian Interpretation of Dreams\\" is very misleading. It gives the impression that this book would address the art of interpretation and explain how to understand some of the rich symbolic language of dreams. The book elaborates in depth on the history of dream interpretation but has extremely little to offer when it comes to interpreting the symbolic language. Every time I got to a new section heading that sounded promising I was disappointed because all the writer does, is that he keeps emphasizing and illustrating that God does speak through dreams and how important it is to interpret and take them seriously, but for a book that size he offers next to nothing on how to interpret the symbolism.If you want to read about the biblical and Christian history of dream interpretation, (like who took dreams seriously and who didn't), then this book is for you. But if you want a practical guide on how to interpret dreams from a Christian perspective you will be very disappointed."},{"Title":"God, Dreams, and Revelation: A Christian Interpretation of Dreams (Revised and Expanded Edition)","review":"A broad look at the biblical reality of God speaking through dreams. I started reading Morton Kelsey in the mid 70's after experiencing very potent dreams on the after life. What a blessing to realize that I wasn't alone, that since the beginning of time God has spoken and visited many in this way. This book does give many answers to the questions of God speaking through dreams. Morton Kelsey not only gives you details on scripture but also gives us a history of lives that have been transformed by paying attention to dreams. Other author's to explore on the gift of dreams are John Sanford and Carl Jung."},{"Title":"God, Dreams, and Revelation: A Christian Interpretation of Dreams (Revised and Expanded Edition)","review":"This book was extremely helpful for me personally. The first part of the book is a survey of the Old Testament, where Kelsey discusses the dreams of Abraham, Joseph, Daniel, and others.There is also an extended discussion of the dreams and visions of the New Testament, featuring Joseph (the stepfather of Jesus) and Paul. Kelsey also notes that there is no indication anywhere that God has stopped communicating to us in this way.He also surveys the history of dreams and dream interpretation in the history of the church. There are also brief discussions of dreams as they are understood in Islam and in other faiths.He suggests near the end of the book that one way to interpret a dream is to see your own situation in each character of your dream, as our feelings and experiences are often projected onto others in our dreamsMorton Kelsey is a counselor and an Episcopal priest, and he is well qualified to write this extensive study. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"God, Dreams, and Revelation: A Christian Interpretation of Dreams (Revised and Expanded Edition)","review":"This book explores the question of how God communicates with man through dreams. Kelsey reviews the history of both philosophy and theology regarding dreams and visions. He correlates the Scriptures with the sophisticated modern insights of Freud and Jung.This book is thorough enough for the scholar, yet easily readable by the layman.

It is written in an extremely lucid and direct manner, and it is more of an introduction to the art, or process, of philosophising rather than to philosophy itself as a discipline. In this book existential philosophy, the brand of philosophy so successfuly cultivated by Jaspers, is described, so to speak, &quot;from inside&quot;. There is hardly any analysis of philosophical terms, but rather a presentation of the inner process of approach to the metaphysical questions confronting the individual person. Jaspers belongs to the great idealist tradition, initiated by Plato, developed further by the medieval schoolmen, and lastly by Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schelling, Soeren Kirekegaard and others. According to Jaspers the core-meaning of man's identity is his sense of freedom. Freedom is presented as an immediate datum of consciousness, as that part of man's personality which &quot;evades all object knowledge but is always present in him as a potentiality&quot;. Irrespective of what is omitted, this book offers a subject-matter of impeccable honesty and undiluted spirituality. This is a great book superbly well written. Also, the translation by Ralph Manheim is quite masterly. It is an out and out example of what every translation should actually be: a representation in another language of the meaning and style of the original text."},{"Title":"Way to wisdom;: An introduction to philosophy","review":".This is a great, practical and user friendly book in the basics of what philosophy is, the history of philosophy which includes the idea of the axial age, the difference between absolute and relative knowledge, the idea of nonknowledge and the connection of philosophy with science.Jaspers, like Plato, tells us that philosophy is the direction we take, the idea of the whole picture. While science is the measurable analysis and empirical observation, philosophy is the direction behind such, the idea of why we are learning the what. This is very much like Plato's Meno, where Socrates and Meno decide that virtue is beyond knowledge and is instead the direction of opinion, or as Jaspers calls it &quot;nonknowledge.&quot;On page 127, Jaspers writes:&quot;By technically applying my knowledge I can act outwardly but nonknowledge makes possible an inner action by which I transform myself. This is another and deeper kind of thought; it is not detached from being and oriented toward an object but is a process of my innermost self, in which though and being become identical. Measured by outward, technical power, this thought of inner action is as nothing, it is no applied knowledge that can be possessed, it cannot be fashioned according to plan and purpose; it is an authentic illumination and growth into being.&quot;Philosophy must reside in uncertainty, waywardness towards the unknown, never absolute like science. On page 129,&quot;Philosophy must even leave the possibility of full communication in uncertainty, though it lives by faith in communication and stakes everything on communication. We can believe in it but not know it. To believe that we possess it is to have lost it.&quot;We must have philosophy to direct our science (virtue) and remove us froe scientific superstition and we must have science to have substance to our philosophy and remove us from philosophical superstition.Pages 159-160:&quot;Any philosopher who is not trained in a scientific discipline and who fails to keep his scientific interests constantly alive will inevitably bungle and stumble and mistake uncritical rough drafts for definitive knowledge. Unless an idea is submitted to the coldly dispassionate test of scientific inquiry, it is rapidly consumed in the fire of emotions and passions, or else it withers into a dry and narrow fanaticism . . . rejecting superstitious belief in science as well as contempt of science, philosophy grants its unconditional recognition to modern science.&quot;Jasper ends his book with a short outline on the major thinkers and writers in philosophy and our personal decision of who to study to build up our knowledge. But can virtue be taught? He endorses what an old counsel to study Plato and Kant since they cover all the essentials. An overall good read, a substantial subject in a modern society devoid of substance and profound meaning.&quot;Today independence seems to be silently disappearing beneath the inundation of all life by the typical, the habitual, the unquestioned commonplace.&quot; - 1954, KARL JASPERS, Way to Wisdom, An Introduction to Philosophy, p. 110"},{"Title":"Way to wisdom;: An introduction to philosophy","review":"Here is a short work on philosophical thought, that although condensed, and compact, still manages to explore and lay out, alot of food for thought that touches on alot of philosophical ground.

It's more than a book about gardening, although gardeners everywhere will love it. This book celebrates the human spirit. It shows us the power of a dream, the ability of one person partnering with others to transform her corner of the world. These stories remind us that we all have the power to bring peace and harmony into our world.Debra Engle writes in the best tradition of personal essayists. We travel with her as she crosses the country. She transports us to these gardens, evoking their sights, scents and sounds. We sit with her as she talks to an elderly gardener in Huntsville, Alabama, or stride with her through an amazing urban farm in downtown Milwaukee. We feel the individual energy and spirit of these remarkable gardeners who are truly changing the world one garden at a time. And we see those changes through the lens of Engle's understanding of the world as a place where miracles happen every day if we let them.I loved this book and highly recommend it.

The book is a series of articles starting in the 1600's and progressing to recent times. Gives perspectives of people &quot;dealing&quot; with the Jews and perspectives of Jewish people.

Both will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History","review":"This book is a collection of articles and excerpts from many of the main sources of Jewish History from the 1700's until present. The articles are grouped by topic. The topics start with emancipation and end off with Zionism and the Holocaust. Each article has a nice mini-biography at the end telling who the author of the article was ( or is ), and includes explanatory notes for those who aren't familiar with that era of Jewish History. The editors were quite even handed and give all sides space in their book, the only group over represented is converted Jews. After all less than .25% of all Jews converted in the 1800's. My only complaint is that they neglected two subjects. One, the Tshuva movement of the 70's to present and also the Shas phenamana of the 80's and 90's."},{"Title":"The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History","review":"This is an excellent supplementary reader for a Jewish studies course at the undergraduate upper division or graduate level.

Why would Amazon publish an outdated edition?So do not buy the Kindle edition because you will not be getting what you think you're getting. I believe this technically constitutes false advertising.

I can't imagine what it might be, unless it was Christmas dog stories and kids' books. With that in mind, Latchkey Dog seemed like a no-brainer to me!Sam has a dog named Amber who loves people so much that being left home alone is too much for the pup, who barks relentlessly when she's left alone. Amber is left alone quite a bit now, because Sam's mother, who recently became a single parent when she got divorced, has to work. When their neighbor, Mrs. Watson, complains, Sam's mother decides that Amber will have to go to a new home. That's not even the end of the bad news. It's beginning to look like Amber will be going to live with Meredith Rumsey, the rottenest person in the world. Sam's got to find a way to keep Amber quiet or face losing her for good.The illustrations inside, by Cat Bowman Smith, remind me vaguely of the Dennis the Menace comic strip, although not as good. Sam's efforts, both botched and successful, to solve his problem are amusing and send a good message about persistence- and a bit of a bad message about the lines you shouldn't cross (sneaking out at night, leaving his little sister home alone, etc). Amber's connection to the old folks at Happy Days is touching and Sam's relationship with his sister is realistic most of the time. My only real gripes are that the resolution felt incomplete because grouchy, complaining neighbor Mrs. Watson should have been mentioned and wasn't and Sam's parents' divorce, while mentioned, didn't rate much more than Sam's periodic sorrow that he could no longer play one parent against the other.

He had clearly read deeply about the religious traditions of the ancient world, not just Judaism, and it shows here. The result is an interesting version of the story of Jesus, which stresses his Jewishness, and explains his philosophy entirely in the context of Jewish belief. There is also a back story on his parentage which puts the title \\"King of the Jews\\" in a very different light.Our fictional narrator is one \\"Agabus the Decapolitan\\", writing ca 90 A.D., who briefly met Jesus, when he, Agabus,was a child, and has been fascinated with him ever since. Historically, this was a time when Christian doctrine was very unsettled, somewhat exacerbated by those gentiles who wanted to become Christians without being subject to Jewish law. Agabus has some critical comments about \\"Gentile Chrestians\\" (sic), and the ways in which they distort the teachings of Jesus.There's something here to offend everybody who is inclined to take offense at a discussion of ideas. Believing Christians may well object to the demystification of many of Jesus's actions, the natural explanations for such occurrences as the miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example. They may also object to the narrowness of his mission, since he is clearly concerned primarily with the Jews, not with all mankind.On the other hand, resolute non-believers may lose patience with the failure to provide a natural explanation for other supposed miracles, and the implication that there are some actual supernatural goings on. Of course, one could point out that the narrator does not claim to have witnessed most of the story himself, but is relying on the best information he has been able to get from others.Some Jews, Christians, and for all I know, Muslims, may take exception to the way Judaism is tied to earlier pagan beliefs, and pagan remnants are found in Jewish practice.There is, then, the material here for an interesting take on the foundation of one of the \\"great\\" religions. Unfortunately, it does get rather tedious at times, with extended discussions on mythology, religious traditions, and mysticism. Although I did not take offense at anything, there were lengthy passages that I found rather a hard slog. The philosophical maundering might be easier to take if I could convince myself that anything of actual importance was being said.Recommended then, mostly for those who have enjoyed Graves' other work, and want to see what he's done with this story. Probably not the best book of his to start with."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Martin Scorsese originally wanted to film King Jesus until Barbara Hershey put a copy of the extraordinarily beautiful and moving Last Temptation of Christ into his hands.And he would have had his work cut out for him had he tackled Graves' astonishing novel, for it is so thick with archeaological information, as well as Biblical scholarship, that the result is a beguiling combination of hard-nosed history book and old-fashioned sandal and robe epic.Devotees of the Galilean Jew who caused all this need not worry, Jesus stays a virgin and is never shown having sex with anyone. But he does indeed set up his own betrayal, with the help of Judas (\\"what you must do, do quickly\\"), and the most potentially damaging angle is the fact that Graves asserts that Jesus was indeed the heir to the throne of Jerusalem; hence Pilate's sign, INRI, placed over the Cross is no longer a bad joke, but a crime and slap in the face to Jesus' ancestry.Ultimately, though, the novel's main theme is the conflict between Monotheism (masculine) and Polytheism (feminine) and in the end, Monotheism wins out... or does it? With stories of Jesus walking on water and healing the sick and raising the dead, and being raised from the dead himself, just as if he was one of the many other magical pagan gods running about the Mediterranean at the time, did Monotheism really win after all?Great, but difficult, stuff. I've read it five times in order to fully get Graves' strange vision. King Jesus is like unearthing a golden treasure from the dusty caves of Qumran. Mysterious, and probably retaining all of its mysteries, but valuable nonetheless."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"So used are Christians to think of Jesus' words as revolutionary and idiosynctratic that Graves won me over instantly when he points out the truth: Jesus was a Pharisee, a follower of the great Hillel. Jesus preached the Pharisee-an doctrine of \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\" No, that wasn't an invention of Jesus'. Jesus did call those Pharisees who didn't act as they preached, \\"hypocrites.\\" That is no surprise. Pharisees were human, after all, and hypocrisy is an all too-human failing. I know when I first read the Gospels, I was struck by the fact that everything Jesus said had been taught to me in Hebrew school. I also note that Jesus himself is not quoted as claiming to be more divine than other people. The Gospel writers and Christian commentators make such claims, but Jeus doesn't. Graves does present Jesus as a human conceived via the usual channel, but Graves is, as I am, reverent towards Jesus. This is no icon-smashing work.Two passages stand out for me. One is the hilarious send-up of pagan scholars, all of whom claim to be sons of Abraham, \\"proving\\" to Jesus that all the prophets and women in the Jewish Bible are actually dervived from Middle Eastern and Greek mythologies. Their reasoning is baroque, tenuous, and spurious. They make analogies where none can be made. How like many scholars, then and today.The other is the marvelous (in the literal sense of that word) passage in which Jesus recites an arcane passage from Ezekiel and then proceeds to interpret it in a fascinating and, to me, innovative way. I must admit I haven't delved into the extant literature on the exegesis of Ezekiel, but Graves blew me away. Those more familiar with religious interpretation may tell me I was wrong, but I still found the entire passage breathtakingLess believable to me was the celibate marriage between Jesus and Mary, Lazarus' sister. I don't know what sources Graves had for such a marriage or if he just made this up. That's one of the problems with getting your facts from a novel. Within the novel, the marriage makes sense and fits in with the theme of the Three Mary's. As history or theology, however, I need some footnotes.Again, Graves presentation of Jesus as the rightful descendent of Herod, therefore, the rightful heir to the throne of King of the Jews, is novelistically sound, but historically? I have no clue. Again, someone more versed in 1st century history might be able to shed light on this.Overall, I found this an awesome, sometimes difficult read. It raised many provocative issues, and many fascinating descriptions of the times, which were dreadful. Graves's presentation of Jesus as a brilliant preacher who should not be considered a magician fit into my own concept of Jesus who is, after all, the most influential personage in the Western world. If people have spent time reading The DaVinci Code, they certainly should be willing to invest time in reading King Jesus. It's based upon Graves's considerable scholarship and his vivid imagination.I wish someone would undertake an annotated version of this novel on the model of the Annotated Alice or the Annotated Sherlock Holmes. The annotator(s), however, should be Classicists and Religious Studies scholars with expertise in the 1st century CE. I envision such a work as a collaboration between Christian and Jewish scholars."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Definitely not the easiest read I've done, and I confess that before starting the book, I was a little skeptical about it, specially because of being a Faith-related novel. However, I found it to be just that: a novel.

Of course, English not being my native tongue made this book a bit harder. The book made this past month a very reflexive one for me, even though I'm not that into... let's say I've had phases in life in which I've been more religious than others."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"King Jesus: A NovelThis book, though a novel, is a stunning tour de force on history of the time of Jesus. Robert Graves presents a detailed history derived from multiple sources including Jewish and New Testament scriptures, contemporary historians (particularly Josephus), and lesser known works such as the Nag Hammadi gospels which had been recently discovered when the book was written. In doing so, he derives a plausible and very human historical Jesus, including his lineage as a legitimate heir to the throne of David.The book held my interest from beginning to end. To me was very readable, and brought the era to life. It would be more difficult to come to grips with, however, for someone who did not have prior interest in and knowedge about the times.The only fault with the book is that it was published 60 years too soon, at a time when its contents were probably widely seen as heretical. Now that the historical Jesus is better known outside of specialsed academic circles, the book should be better appreciated.Janice Nelson"},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Graves begins by giving us a wide panoramic vista of society, geopolitics, and the religious context of the world in which the Jesus myth was born. With his great erudition about the Ancient world, its religions and myths, it is much easier to understand the real background of the Gospels. A Jewish world profoundly divided, with plenty of sects and cults, in a Palestine dominated by the Romans. The Jews yearn for the arrival of the Messiah, who will free them from the Evil Empire. From there, Graves develops a bold thesis: given the political and dynastic conflicts facing the Jews, a conspiracy is devised in order to beget a totally legitimate heir to the throne, one who has all the credentials to lead his people to freedom. As other reviewers have pointed out, Graves's thesis is based on the myth of the Triple or White Goddess (about which Graves himself was an erudite, as shown in his complex book \\"The White Goddess\\").The said heir must be the husband of the youngest descendant from the maternal lineage of Michal, which represented the maternal continuity of King David's lineage. This would be the truly legitimate succession. That young woman is Mary, the youngest daughter of Joachim and Hanna. Simeon, the Supreme Priest, convinces Antipater, Herod's eldest son, to secretly marry Mary, so that he may legitimately claim the throne of Israel after the death of his ruthless father. After the secret wedding, Mary is then officially given in marriage (a mock one) to an old widower called Joseph, who agrees to the farce. Herod learns something about this conspiracy and plans to kill every boy under four from the Davidian lineage. Of course, Joseph and his family flee to Egypt. There, the future Messiah spends years of deep learning under the guide of Simeon. The script of the Gospels follows, but according to Graves's thesis. Jospeh and his family return, not to Judaea, but to Galilee. In order to fulfill the requisites of the Triple Goddess's myth, Jesus is married to another Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, and he is formally anointed as King of the Jews (since Antipater has died also). So Jesus begins his ministery, gathering followers and provoking the establishment. He suffers persecutions. But turns out Jesus, at the beginning, is not really preaching anything much new: his novelty consists in a radical return to original Judaism, updated to a different society, but free of all the rigidities, pomp, and hypocrisy of Pharisees and Saducees. Jesus inherits the religion of the Essenes, radical conservatives who preach austerity and the simple life. Little by little Jesus alienates and infuriates the Jewish leadership and his perception of his ministry and mission changes.This is where the story really changes from the Gospels: according to Graves, the original intention of the plot is changed: Jesus will no longer be a political, religious, and military leader who will overthrow the Romans and preside over a new Jewish Golden Age, but he will be the sacrificed offering to the White Goddess, so that her cult might reign. This also won't happen: Jesus's sacrifice will not usher in the religion of the goddess, but Christianity. Strange are God's ways. It is precisely this change which alienates some of Jesus's original followers, like Judas, a man totally committed to the overthrowing of the Romans. When Jesus starts changing from leader to redemptor, the plot becomes sort of like a Greek tragedy, until the well-known and bloody end.This book is a great novel about the deepest-rooted myth of humanity: the birth of Christianity. Graves's Jesus is a very complex character, rude, disconcerting and little likable. His theology sounds simple but is in fact confusing. When this confusion is added to the already complex web of cults and sects existing in Palestine, the end develops in an inevitable way. Sharp, bold, and provocative, Graves points to a fictional but believable theory of the story whose History will never be known: where, how, by whom, why, the powerful myth of the Jewish Messiah become Universal Saviour was created."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"I didn't plan on reading this book (and the thematically related Eve: A Novel of the First Woman) around Easter but that's how things worked out. Graves always enjoys turning readers' perceptions upside down in his historical novels (I'm afraid my recollection of the Julio-Claudians will be forever colored by I Claudius and its sequel). And his erudition is astounding. You may not accept his interpretations of Greek myth (The Greek Myths) or of the pre-Indo-European goddess cults (The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth) but you have to grant him a mastery of the sources common and obscure that few can equal.In King Jesus Graves exploits every contradiction in the canonical Gospels, the Apocrypha, Jewish tradition and Gnostic writings and combines it with pre-Hellenic religious traditions to write the \\"real story\\" of Jesus' ministry. Graves makes no concession to later Christian mythology. Jesus believes he is a Jewish Messiah sent to \\"destroy the works of the Female\\" (more of that later). Other nations may be saved but it would be under the hegemony of a Jewish savior of a restored Israel.The book purports to be written by Agabus the Decapolitan during the reign of Domitian (AD 81-96); a pagan who once succored a follower of Jesus during one of the persecutions. This source vouchsafed to Agabus the real story because he believed himself to be the last survivor and wanted to preserve the true tradition of who Jesus was and why he acted as he did. I don't know if Agabus is a historical figure; knowing Graves' exhaustive research into obscure texts, he may very well be but he's a believable narrator for the story: disinterested but sympathetic. Graves also makes it a point to relate the story through the eyes of a first century AD, educated citizen of the Roman Empire. Agabus is not an atheist or skeptic, he worships his gods and accepts that Jesus could, for example, raise a man from the dead by uttering God's true name or heal people based on his own strong faith and the faith of his followers.The first part of the book recounts the birth of Mary, her life and Jesus' birth. It would be too confusing to recount all the background but suffice it to say that Mary is the scion of the matrilineal line of high priestesses displaced by the patriarchal worshipers of the Sky Father who overran the Middle East and among whom are the ancestors of the Jews. This displacement was not total, however. For millennia, the invading patriarchs have had to win legitimacy by marrying the priestesses and honoring the goddess (in her many manifestations). This is where Christians may get \\"nervous\\": In order to legitimize the Herodian dynasty, the Jewish High Priest of the time (Simon) concocts a scheme whereby Herod's first son, Antipater, weds Mary and their issue will reign as a king acceptable to the entire Jewish nation. The first half of the plan goes well: Mary and Antipater are secretly married and he manages to get her pregnant with Jesus. Publicly, Mary is wed to the septegenarian Joseph of Emmaus. After this, alas, things fall apart. Antipater is not the most politically savvy operator and falls afoul of his father's raging paranoia, forcing Joseph, Mary and Jesus to flee to Egypt.Part two of the novel recounts Jesus' childhood. Here Graves follows the traditional narrative fairly closely but motives and reasons are very different - Jesus' mentors are grooming him to become the Messiah and he's fully cognizant of the role he's destined to play, if not it's exact form. This section ends with Jesus' marriage to another Mary, also an heiress to the ancient priestesses, and his laming, symbolic of his position as the Goddess' consort. There's also an extended scene with yet another Mary, the Hairdresser (aka the Magdalene), an old priestess, where she and Jesus debate radically different interpretations of the ancient tablets on which the Jews base their Law:\\"Mary said: \`See where my Mistress, the First Eve, is seated on her birth-stool under the palm-tree. The people are awaiting a great event, for the pangs are upon her.'\\"Swiftly, Jesus answered her: \`No, witch, that is not the First Eve: that is Deborah judging the Israelites under the palm-tree of Deborah. For so it is written.'\\" (p. 251)Denied political power, Jesus comes to see his Messiahship in a far more symbolic and important light: Rising beyond the flesh (the Female) and bringing an era of spiritual enlightenment that will free men and women from carnality and the snares of the flesh. Women aren't to be excluded from the Kingdom but they and men can only enter by denying the flesh - becoming neither male nor female.In reference to the Yahweh cult's accomodations with goddesses, there is a growing body of archeological evidence confirming it. The God of the Jews and the New Testament we're familiar with - alone, transcendant, omnipotent, etc. - wasn't created until the Deuteronomic reforms of King Josiah in the 7th century BC (The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts).Part three follows Jesus' ministry as he preaches to the Jews. Again Graves follows the traditional narrative on the surface but motivations are very different. From confidence in the success of his mission and the coming of the Kingdom, Jesus knows despair and realizes that he has failed - he tried to \\"hurry\\" God's dispensation, the sin of pride and presumption. He tries to redeem the situation by getting Judas (the most perceptive of the Apostles) to slay him as the traditional sacrifice but Judas doesn't want to kill Jesus, his friend and teacher, and betrays him to the Jewish authorities on the understanding that Jesus' supporters in the Sanhedrin (Pharisees, mostly) will save him. Again, plans go awry and it's a Sadducee-dominated quorum that turns him over to the Romans. Peter is Jesus' last hope but he can't understand what Jesus wants and uses his sword to try and defend him in the famous garden scene where he cuts off a soldier's ear. (Of course, it doesn't help that Jesus is less than straightforward in asking his disciples for help.)Hopefully, this barebones account of this remarkable book will encourage readers to check it out. Beyond its provocative subject matter, it's a good novel in its own right. And I'll take this opportunity to highly recommend Paula Frederickson's Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews: A Jewish Life and the Emergence of Christianity. It's a nonfictional perspective on \\"the greatest story ever told\\" that tries to make sense of Jesus' life in the context of 1st century Palestine and does so in a very persuasive argument."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Take any of his published works and there is no doubt that Robert Graves is a thorough scholar. King Jesus is unusual in that it is a novel filled with scholarly references from the canonical books of the Bible, Gnostic gospels, Apocryphia and Semitic mythology that tries to convince the reader of Grave's view of the significant relevance of the Triple Goddess mystery religion in the culture of ancient Israel.Following the theme set out in his work White Goddess, Graves retells the story of the gospel(s) with more than a little literary license I found both fun and interesting.It turns out that Christ's message was completely misinterpreted. And yet, in the end, Christ won in the sense that were it not for his death and resurrection and the subsequent growing popularity of his cult, we might be going to the sacred grove on Sundays to worship the Goddess instead of Church to worship the God.Despite some insightful gems such as &quot;The Three Marys&quot; -- WOW! I never realized the connection before! -- overall his thesis doesn't seem very convincing. Anyone who has read the Bible and standard Apocryphia cover to cover can see that there were clearly defined messages for both the Old and New Testaments that had nothing even remotely to do with Goddess worship. Moreover, his argument for a more prominent role of a matri-centric mystery cult in the patriarchal dominated culture of ancient Israel is very weak. Graves confuses the dualistic concepts of the Gnostics with Christ's goal of destroying the supposed feminine influence in Judaism.Still, it was a fun read if you don't take it too seriously"},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Robert Graves knew that the Gospels were essentially historical novels with a religious subject & themes. Like historical novels, they were a blend of history & myth, fact & fiction. But Graves' novel about Jesus is more than just another fairy tale or Homer's Illiad. It is a history of myth that explains in much detail the pagan origins of Christianity. However, the picture that Graves paints is different in detail from the picture of Jesus given to us by Pauline Christianity. Rather, Graves tries to give us a portrait of the Herodian era that existed before & during the life of Jesus. This was an era in which a pre-pharasaical, virulent, pagan-hating (despite it's own pagan roots), caste system of Judaic monotheism promoted a single, masculine, deity to the exclusion of all others (in particular, feminine deities) & was forced to accomodate the old paganism of the Greeks (which they tried to destroy, but failed) & the new paganism of the Romans (Greco/Roman) while under the control of an unpopular vassal state. It is a colonial Rome that became the protectors of this Gentile population which resented their forced Jewish conversion under the Maccabees & the Hasmonean Jews. Much of this Greek ethnic population, both pagan & converted, resided in protected areas directly administered by Rome called a decapolis where they could worship in freedom & prosper economically without being subject to second class status & Jewish religious authority which predominated in the Jewish tetrarchies. Hence, the narrator of the story, Agabus the Decapolitan, is a supposed metropolitan administrator for one of these \\"pagan\\" enclaves. Ironically, Jesus' ministry begins & grows in the decapolis around the Sea of Galilee where he is protected from rival Herodian rulers. But the rivalry, in question, stems from Jesus not only having been an ancestor of King David, on his mother's side, but also from having been born into the Herodian royal family & it's intrigues, on his father's side. In other words, Graves rejects the so called virgin birth of Jesus because the immaculate conception was a view that was not held by the early Jewish Christian followers of Jesus & his divinity was not \\"universally\\" proclaimed until the Roman Emperor Constantine & the Council of Nicea formulated the nature of that divinity, i.e. the Trinity (itself derived from Egyptian/Sumerian paganism & Greek metaphysical philosophy). This is essentially a book about the politics of religion. But it also tries to show the character of Jesus at the crossroads of the politics & religion, of his time. Jesus isn't just a Jewish scholar par excellence or a rabbi who's job (unlike the Sadducees) was to preach in synagogues set up to minister to those excluded from the temples, i.e. converts & patrilineal Jews (like Herod the Great). He is also a man on a mission with a rightful claim to being the high priest/king that is the Jewish, as opposed to the Christian, messiah who is \\"a\\" son of God & not \\"the\\" son of God & who's divinity is achieved through the inseparability of his word to his works & deeds."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Robert Graves provides an intriguing hypothesis about the background of Jesus. In order not to spoil the suspense, I will refrain from stating the core hypostheis. But he has provided a very interesting historical backdrop to make his idea plausible. It is a very interesting book to read."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Graves was arguably the best author of historical fiction in the 20th century. King Jesus didn't have the legs that Claudius or some of the others (I'm partial to Count Belasarius) but it's a powerful offering. More than Graves' other works, this one really requires some knowledge of the period. Graves was a fine classicist and it shows here: this is very far from Anne Rice. That said, if you don't have a feel for Temple Judaism (probably better understood today than in Grave's time) you might find King Jesus a hard read. If you like the idea of recreated dialogue between Jewish scholars, buy two copies of this book. It hardly \\"shocks\\" anyone today. Perhaps it did seventy years ago. The historical profession, for good or ill (I'd argue ill) has gotten into the historic Jesus debate again twice since \\"King Jesus\\" was published. Many of these scholars have tried to find a \\"useful\\" Jesus that fits more easily into our enlightened era than the one portrayed in the New Testament. Frankly, I'd rather hear this message in fictional form because that's where it belongs. No matter how you dice it, the only real sources we have concerning Jesus were composed by people who considered him fully divine. And as scholars like Larry Hurtado have shown, this idea appears to have been present well before Paul started writing letters - in other words, as soon as someone found the \\"empty tomb\\". Naturally, no historian can prove there was an empty tomb, but that reflects all of the testimony we have. (The Babylonian Talmud argues that Jesus' followers stole his body. The odd thing here is that when the \\"Jesus Movement\\" started, it's very unclear why some hostile witness to the execution didn't simply come forward and say \\"I saw the Romans dump his body into a ditch, the way the Romans always do.\\" This rendition does imply that there was a tomb in the first place and that someone thought it was empty. It is also yet another reason to dismiss Tabor's silly claim that someone has found Jesus' family tomb. History isn't easy.) Ironically the best Jesus novel I know of, Christopher Moore's \\"Lamb\\" accepts it indirectly. (I'm not comparing the two books other than they are both masterful works.) So if you want your Jesus to be a Jewish sage, here's a splendid picture of how he might have looked. Just remember, that Graves, just as much as Bart Ehrman, rejects the only evidence we do have creating this picture. Graves just admits to writing fiction.Eric Bergerud"},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"This re-telling of the incidents around the Nativity, the life of Jesus, and the state of very early Christianity, is unlike any other version of the New Testament I have ever read. The setting of the novel integrates a startling and heady recreation of Palestine at the time: the pagans with their Olympian gods; the older Mediterranean/Semitic Palestinian tribes with their mysterious gods; the orthodox Jewish society; those Jews whose beliefs straddled both the Jewish and the Graeco-Roman world; the Essenes; the Samaritans and many others. The book orchestrates how each of these groups interacted with resignation and suspicion to share in some power and belief. It is a rich, provocative and explosive mix. Each of these strands of society influence the young...and clearly not divine...young man born to Mary, who exhibits a religious genius and charismatic humanity that finally entangle and torment him until he is killed by these external forces, perhaps even sacrificed by them. There are several implausible incidents, but the brisk writing, the astounding backround of cultures and the sheer originality of this book are always compelling. Beware. This is not a book for traditional Christian believers. Nevertheless, it is a reverent but unorthodox take on the origins of Christianity and how it developed. Graves is a genius, with some unusual ideas that he uses well to illuminate and bring down to earth a series of events that has been scrubbed and idealized and overthought for centuries. While no one can know if Graves is close to the truth, he is always compelling and ingenious. Stay with this one. You will remember it."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Robert Graves's novels always take one expected places and this one is no exception.

I had forgotten that as good as I, Claudius was, the original Suetonius from which it was taken was better. So Graves dragged in everything he could to the Jesus story, including a lot of Frazer's Golden Bough Myth of the King crap. Then he (Graves)hammered his square pegs into the already-rounded holes of New Testament historic anthropology. Even the absurd notion of Jesus having his left leg ceremoniously disjointed so that he could be a lame king, according to the Greco-Dionysian formula. Sure, there was a lot to learn from Graves rendition, and I appreciated his rational explanations for the so-called miracles, but he stretched the story of the Life of Jesus to unbelievable limits and conjectures, and that's even AFTER accepting the remote possibility that the eldest of Herod the Great's kids, Herod Antipas, MAY have been the true father of Jesus. I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this, and I'm a big fan of Graves usually, but if there is a justification for this book, it's the fact that it's clearly described as a novel, and that's how it should be cataloged, as fiction. To get closer to the true and accurate historicity of the new Testament stories, I would heartily recommend Schonfield, even though he has his own detractors."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"The book has some interesting ideas.

It's weird, esoteric, and somehow simultaneously iconoclastic and reverent. As is often the case with Graves, it's clear that he's done a lot of serious research, and from there has gone off on his own curious tangents. (It looks like he got some material from Robert Eisler's book from the '20s, &quot;The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist&quot;). Graves's methods drive some scholars crazy, because they want a clear line drawn between the research and the tangents. &quot;King Jesus&quot; is clearly more propaganda for Graves's &quot;White Goddess&quot; theology, but as propaganda it's great fun. Indulge Graves early on in the book--material that may seem pointless eventually does inform what follows. With few exceptions, the book is sympathetic to Judaism, but the exceptions should not be read as anti-Semitism; rather, the reader should recognize that Graves is equally discriminatory towards all religions where they don't gibe with his White Goddess-ism."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Having grown up in an Episcopalian family in the Southeastern US, I am very familiar with Christ the Savior from St.John's gospel and the epistles of Paul. Graves offers the viewer two alternative interpreations of Jesus in his book,King Jesus. These two alternative views are based on Hebrew concepts of a political/military messiah and the mystery religion of the triple goddess, which requires the sacrifice of the goddess's consort to bless the land and people with his sacrificial blood. There is no doubt that these two world-views, religions, concepts were dominant in the Mediterranean Roman world. For example, St. Paul's epistles strongly condemn the mystery religions of the triple goddess, which he identies as Artemis (also known as Diana in Roman mythology).I realize that my many fundamentalists Christian friends would find this book disturbing but I would invite them to read this exceptional historic novel to gain more insight into the Hebrew concept of a worldly military messiah destined to overthrow Roman domination or the concept of the consort of the triple goddess, destined to be sacrificed for the well being of the land and people.First, the book is a political novel about the efforts of the Hebrew leadership to bring about the birth and development of a young man to be their military leader and savior. Jesus is the son of Mary and Herod's oldest son,Antipater, hidden in the home of Joseph until the time he will arise as the Hebrew ruler. Graves was a scholar of Hebrew religion and he brings his considerable knowledge of the Hebrew faith to the novel. Graves writes of a possible plot wherein the birth, schooling, and mentoring of Jesus were all part of a Hebrew plot to produce the Messiah that would defeat the Romans and bring about a Hebrew golden age of 1000 years.Second,the book is a novel about the struggle between the patriarchial religion of the Hebrews and the cult mystery religions of the triple goddess, or the white goddess. This ancient religion has as the central deity a female goddess who is mother/birth, wife/consort/fertility, and death/destroyer. Graves has Mary the mother of Jesus, his cousin Mary (sister of Martha and Lazarus), and Mary Magdalene playing these roles. However, in the religion of the triple goddess or white goddess, a male plays the role of son, husband, consort, king, and finally human sacrifice to this triple goddess. Graves has Jesus move from the role of warrior king of the Jews to sacrificial king through the novel. Whereas Mary the mother of Jesus is a player in the Hebrew plot to support Jesus as the military Messiah, his wife and cousin Mary asks him to use his powers to raise his cousin (her brother) Lazarus from the dead. Jesus does this act but because he must now offer God a life for a life, he must offer his own life for that of Lazarus. This puts Jesus directly in the power and plot of Mary Magdalene (the layer-out) who requires the sacrificial death of her husband/consort to bless the world and its people. Graves was probably the foremost expert on the religions of the triple goddess and his scholarship helps maintain the internal consistency of the novel.Finally, we are left with the question of whether Jesus' crucifixion was a triump of the feminist mystery religion of the triple goddess over the Hebrew messiah or whether Jesus' cruicifixion spelled the doom of the triple goddess as he emerges as the Christian savior.Graves, an expert on Hebrew religion and mythology, classical history and mythology, and the canonical gospels as well as the Gnostic gospels, is certainly the scholar best suited to try to bring all this together in a fascinating historic novel consistent with the society and theology of the times. Graves was a highly creative and independent thinker and I have no doubt that this book will disturb my fundamentalists Christian friends - none-the-less it is a wonderful description of the world into which Jesus was born and the two major east Mediteranean religious philosophies that competed with Christianity at the time of his death."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Easy reading this ain't, especially while you're first trying to get into it, but it's hard to think of a more rewarding way to spend your time and intellectual effort. The research is astonishing, the hypothesis is brilliant and revelatory, the theology flawless and the narrative lucid and inspiring. Moreover despite Graves' atheism the novel remains utterly respectful of Jesus Christ. A riveting book with which I expect to bore my friends by quoting for probably the rest of my life."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"King Jesus is pure historical romance, a prose masterpiece, a poetically allegorical phenomenon. Blow away the pussywillow's outer flowering and what you hold is the wish granting root and stem; eliminate the metaphor and symbol from the central principle of \\"King Jesus\\" and what you find is the actual entity of this heroic figure in Western art, philosophy and religion. I must admit I am a \\"Johnny come lately\\" to the wonders that is Jesus Christ. I am a Buddhist by faith, with a kind of theosophical attitude towards all religions; I have tried to appreciate the meaning and significance of Jesus over the years, reading Renan, Schweitzer, Steiner, and most recently A.N. Wilson. Robert Graves has existed in my pantheon of great writers since the late sixties. I read his translation of Apulieus, his poetry, and puzzled over the White Goddess for years. They say timing is everything when it comes to appreciating great literature or works of art. Now the time has come for me to recommend this exceptional literary gem. Anyone familiar enough with the author must note the liturgical thread running throughout his writings: Graves, the poet priest, so to speak, of the Goddess Isis. Here, in this novel, you get our savior, the Christ or \\"Chrestman,\\" in all the sacrificial and cocksure glory of Frazer, projected out of a chilling virtual reality, paying the ultimate price for all psychic sins and one sided human development. In this nightmare vision to the well known and often told tale, resplendent with a fervent reality beyond the dream within a dream, I find a most endearing and honorable person of rare and supremely authentic quality. Like one of those \\"prophetic birds\\" written of in The White Goddess, (c.f., P. 26), whose plumage is said to line her nest containing the \\"jawbones and entrails of poets,\\" King Jesus is an awesomely important tale to read and hear; as imperative, one could say, as the Mariner's recollection to the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's \\"Rime.\\" I hope you will find the time to read what this story has to say about the life and death of Western tradition's most important religious icon, King Jesus."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"The thesis of the book is really brilliant. How would an historian in the first centuries of the first millenium view the life of Jesus, the so called &quot;King Of The Jews&quot;? The act of imagination that Graves has taken is breath taking. He fleshes out most of the gaps and mysteries surrounding the Gospels, without attacking or defending Christianity. The book could have been a cringe inducing &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; but it is a great example of the historical novel."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Robert Graves' writings are all fascinating, but this one is unique. You do not have to be a biblical scholar or history fan to enjoy this presentation of Mr. Graves' ideas. Well researched and provacative - not for the easily offended. Read it and form YOUR opinion!"},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"My reaction to Graves' KJ was different from reading I, Claudius. Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the Gospels and so another version of events colored my own response. Perhaps it's because the telling was not as lively and personal as I Claudius. Still it is good to read this book and to get more information about the politics during the time of Jesus - as well as an understanding of the Jews and their politics and their expectations of the Messiah."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"in that King Jesus is certainly not a soap opera. Graves has constructed a well-researched and intriguing life of Christ on earth, which departs in many ways from the received tradition. An excellent book to give the brain cells a stretch of the legs: highly recommended"},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"Readers already familiar with Graves know that he brings a unique blend of scholarship, wit, literary talent, and profound sympathy to whatever subject matter he addresses himself. As in \\"I Claudius,\\" Graves is superbly deft at breathing life into the arcane, alien traditions and source materials that have come down to us from that time. Though best known as a classicist, Graves uses the story of Jesus to explore the themes and symbols of Judeo-Christian mythology. Characters familiar from \\"Claudius\\" appear in this tale as well (Augustus, Livia, Herod the Great), and through skilful manipulation of plot and dialogue Graves depicts Jewish tradition in a context of the mythical corpus prevalent at the time and known from Europe's Atlantic seabord to the fringes of India.Ever the independent thinker, Graves never shied away from controversy, and true to form he offers up an alternative, historically plausible view of Jesus' early life at odds with the official version that has come down to us. Whatever the shortcomings of his efforts, Graves has at least concocted a story that is consistent with our knowledge of society and theology of the time and actually explains elements of the tradition that otherwise defy logic.In fact, Graves is able to use this novel intelligently to explore and explain issues surrounding authorship, religious politics, and redaction in the Scriptures--normally the exclusive province of turgid academia--all in highly readable and readily understood style. It is a testament to his skill as an author and to his deeply humane worldview that Graves is able to challenge our distorted and obfuscated beliefs about Jesus even as he pays respect to the Master and reaffirms the significance of His ministry.Highly recommended to atheists, agnostics, and apostles alike."},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"It is doubtful if there is any man alive today who could write a book which equaled &quot;King Jesus&quot; asan intellectual virtuoso performance.

Even the most prominent claim of the novel - that J.C. was king of the jews by his relation to the edomite - non jewish(converted)king Herod is absurd. As a native of the region, I noticed that the pilgramige of the family from Egypt to jerusalem, passes - for some reasons - in Galeele, which is a detour of at least 200 miles. There is no merit in these writings, just some guy sitting in a library copying bits from various books, and probably just making up stuff. Jesus, one of Humanity's greatest spiritual teachers, is reduced by Graves to a mad librarian spuoting out page after page of the most ridiculous conjunctions of every bit of stale trivia you can imagine - most of which just don't make any sense.Graves must have been using a fualty translation of the Bible, because he keeps making mistakes in the meaning of certain words, on top of which he builds babilonian towers of misinterpretation. Except for a few sensational conjunctions, i don't feel that I've learned anything interesting or substantial about J.C., sorry.The only remedy, is to consider this text as purely fictitious, and even then it's cumbersome, with little story and long \\"theological\\" and pseudo-historic debate.It's a shame becuase Graves is a good writer.P.S. if I may be bold for a moment, and assume Graves position of dismantler of texts, I might suggest that the whole notion of J.C.'s kingdom is not an earthly one - but rather refers to a hightened state of spiritual development:\\"The Kingdom of God is within you\\""},{"Title":"King Jesus","review":"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character.

It is considered a modernist manifesto and after WW II, and well into the 1960s, it was often used in the training of architects all over the western world. European readers found the book interesting primarily because of it's section on the American history of architecture. The subtitle - The growth of a new tradition - refers to Giedion's conviction that the modern movement was the logical outcome of what he saw as a linear historical development. To make his case he gives his version of the history of architecture, and a big portion deals with the industrial era and how new technologies changed architecture and society as a whole. Giedion's all-inclusive way of reasoning was inspired by his teacher Heinrich W&ouml;lfflin. He also admired W&ouml;lfflin's mentor Jakob Burchardt. Giedion's mission is clear and he states that laissez faire mentality hinders development and that with common goals and values the world would be able to make changes for the better on a grand scale. Today the book in my view is primarily interesting as a time document and it gives insight into the modernist world of universal ideals."},{"Title":"Space, time, and architecture;: The growth of a new tradition (The Charles Eliot Norton lectures)","review":"This book is vast in its ambitions, uneven in its analysis, and badly dated in its defense of modern architecture. Giedion's basic premise is that the Industrial Revolution caused a separation to occur between thinking and feeling, this separation was exemplified by what he considers derivative architecture during the 19th century, and that it is up to the modern movement to reunite these two spheres by combining emotions with a scientific approach to architecture, and by adding the dimension of time to its three dimensional depiction of space. His historical analysis is quite erudite, but his treatment of the major architects who founded the modern movement, particularly Gropius and Le Corbusier, verges on hagiography. For instance he considers Gropius' PanAm building in New York, and Le Corbusier's Carpenter Center at Harvard to be great works of architecture, when contemporary critics view these as among their worst. The only American architect given comparable attention is Frank Lloyd Wright. The book flounders at the end in its speculation about the future, praising Le Corbusier's advocacy of separating people from cars by building elevated highways, and housing people in slablike high rise towers. Considering that Pruitt-Igoe was already, at the time of his final revision to his book, failing in St. Louis as an approach to house poor families (it was later blown to smithereens as a total disaster), this advocacy of housing people in high rises rings hollow indeed. He also advocates separating functions in a city, at a time again during his final revision, when Jane Jacobs \\"Death and Life of Great American Cities\\" was revolutionizing city planning by advocating just the opposite. It is worth reading because it makes you think, but it is badly dated."},{"Title":"Space, time, and architecture;: The growth of a new tradition (The Charles Eliot Norton lectures)","review":"I enjoyed this book for the author's insights into how 20th century architecture, starting from certain antecedents in the 19th century, such as the early iron-reinforced concrete structures of William LeBaron Jenny, progressed through Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, the Bauhaus school, and so on, up to the style which he calls \\"the hanging curtain of glass.\\"Giedion shows how this spectacular 20th-century building originated around the turn of the last century and how it's modern variations represent a triumpth of this type of design.The basic principle, as exemplified early on in the Carson, Pirie, Scott, and Co. building in Chicago, is that as stuctural members receeded from the outlying masonry walls into the interior skeleton of the building, this allows the architect to open up the facade with windows, skylights, and other penetrating elements in order to let the maximum amount of air and light into the building. Eventually no real supporting structural members need reside on the outside of the building, and the aesthetic result is the \\"hanging curtain of glass\\" effect... Whatever one thinks of this type of building, it has become a major landmark of 20th-century architectural design in cities all over the world.Giedion's treatment of Robert Maillart's graceful, parabolic spanning bridge designs in the Swiss Alps and some other places, such as the Tavanasa Bridge in the U.S., which he specifically discusses as one of Maillart's most important achievements, is also very interesting.Overall, Giedion's book is a fine treatment of an important and difficult period in the history of architecture, and is one of the most important books on architecture to be written in recent decades."},{"Title":"Space, time, and architecture;: The growth of a new tradition (The Charles Eliot Norton lectures)","review":"One cannot even presume to understand modern architecture until one has read Giedion's classic work. This book did more to shape the view of modern architecture than did any other book. Giedion provides an impressive survey of architecture down through the ages, illustrating those aspects which had an influence on modern architecture. One of his more illucidating chapters is \\"The Demand for Morality in Architecture,\\" which underscores the content of this work.The heart of the book is his chapter on \\"Space-Time in Art, Architecture, adn Construction,\\" in which he examines the leading figures and movements in modern architecture, with the spotlight on Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto. These were the founding fathers. He examines the roots of their ideas as well as the influence they had in shaping the modern movement. This later edition also includes a chapter on \\"Jorn Utzon and the Third Generation,\\" which Giedion felt had successfully carried the principles of modern architecture into contemporary society.Giedion also explores the shifts in attitude toward city planning in the late 19th century and early 20th century, reviewing such seminal figures as Ebenezer Howard, Patrick Geddes, Arturo Soria y Mata, and Tony Garnier, which ultimately lead to the creation of C.I.A.M, the International Congress of Modern Architecture.Giedion is unabashed in his support of modern architecture, which has made this book the favorite whipping post of post-modern critics. But, few have explored the subject as deeply as has Giedion. Don't rely on other interpretations of Giedion.

Such a relegation diminishes his achievements and ignores his role in American history, one that was illuminated by Allan Nevins in his biography of the president.Born in 1837 to an impoverished Presbyterian minister and his wife, Grover Cleveland worked his way through school as a clerk and teacher before being admitted to the bar in Buffalo in 1859. While building a successful practice he served in a number of local offices, rising to become mayor in 1881. Corruption at the state level brought about a call for reform, and Cleveland was seen as the man to answer it. Elected governor in 1882, he ran an administration noted for both its honesty and efficiency. Over the opposition of Tammany Hall he was selected as the Democratic presidential nominee in 1884 and defeated James G. Blaine in the subsequent election.Cleveland's first administration was noted for his efforts to enlarge the civil service and thwarting attempts by veterans to raid the Treasury for greater pension benefits. Defeated by Benjamin Harrison in 1888 despite winning the popular vote, he won reelection four years later in a rematch between the two men. Cleveland's second term was marred by an economic depression and political battles over the currency, as well as a series of labor troubles. Cleveland's laissez-faire approach to the economic problems and his administration's support for the Pullman Company in their conflict with strikers (which Nevins blames on Cleveland's attorney general rather than the president) alienated many Americans, and he was repudiated by his party at the 1896 Democratic convention.Though Nevins exaggerates Cleveland's virtues and minimizes his limitations, this is the best biography of the president. Based on the Cleveland papers (which Nevins edited), it provides a stimulating, well-written portrait of the man and his times that rewards reading today."},{"Title":"Grover Cleveland;: A study in courage, (American political leaders)","review":"Grover Cleveland is associated with the forgotten presidents of the Gilded Age, despite being the first Democrat elected president since the Civil War and the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. He left office as unpopular as Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, despite winning the popular vote in three consecutive presidential campaigns. In painting Grover Cleveland as one of the most courageous presidents in American History, author Allan Nevins explores these inconsistencies in \\"Grover Cleveland: A Portrait in Courage.\\"In his wonderful People's History of the United States, Howard Zinn portrays Cleveland as a Democrat in name, but as Republican as his predecessors and successors. Zinn's view is somewhat typical of how history remembers Grover Cleveland, and it takes an in-depth portrait like this 832-page biography from Allen Nevins to properly remember Cleveland.The Populists opposed the protective tariff because American consumers were forced to pay premiums for necessities, thus raising their cost of living. Grover Cleveland had precisely the same view of the tariff. He proposed cuts in nearly all protective tariffs in his first and second terms, and avidly sought their enactment. The other important financial matter during his tenure was the currency. Populists were opposed to the gold standard because it caused a tight money supply and deflation, which meant that debtor farmers had to repay loans in more dear currency when the loans were due. Cleveland understood this, but he believed that a weak currency would be just as debilitating to the average man.His remarks that appear sympathetic to big business were simply to reassure jittery citizens that had not known a United States led by a Democratic president since the Civil War. Cleveland was opposed to imperialism, opposing not just to the annexation of Hawaii, but also to the repudiation of the Clayton-Bolwer treaty when the United States had a chance to annex Nicaragua in 1884. Cleveland's reliance on his cabinet members such as Richard Olney led some to believe Cleveland had opposed unions and was unwilling to break up trusts, but these actions were more a matter of Olney misinforming Cleveland. In fact, Cleveland's other second-term Attorney General, Judson Harmon, filed a pair of successful lawsuits against a railroad pool and a cast-iron pipe monopoly. Harmon's tactics were the blueprint for the more famous trust-busting suits of the Roosevelt and Taft Administration.Allen Nevins is unlikely to change the opinion of Howard Zinn, whose political views are somewhat to the left of those of Karl Marx, but this biography ought to revise the opinion of the average American toward a president who is not well-known because the primary issues of his presidency are not sexy. The currency issue is probably the least understood issue in American presidential history, and the tariff is not too far behind. Both issues are financial in nature and thus, not very interesting to many people. Cleveland's primary first-term issue, executive civil service reform, has not been issue in over one hundred years, but it was the most important presidential issue of the 1880s. Cleveland's efforts toward civil service reform are laudable, and certainly justified the faith of the Mugwumps, who jumped from the Republican Party to vote for Cleveland in the 1884 election.The tale of the 1884 election is probably the most fascinating story in the book. Grover Cleveland beat James G. Blaine in a close election, decided by Cleveland winning Indiana and New York. The election in New York was so close, that any one of five factors could have turned the election to Cleveland. Belshazzar's feast and the Burchard affair were two Blaine campaign muffs that cost him votes. Ignoring the temperance petition of Elizabeth Cady Stanton put St. John in the race as a Temperance Candidate, and his candidacy cost Blaine numerous votes. The enmity of the retired, but still powerful, Roscoe Conkling, toward Blaine cost the Republican candidate votes along the Erie Canal. Finally, Mugwumps such as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher left the Republican Party to vote for the Democrat Grover Cleveland in such numbers that they affected the election. Any one of these factors might have affected the election - but all five of them, together, most definitely did.Given that Nivens wrote this biography of Cleveland in 1932, it is surprisingly palatable and easy to digest. He does have an annoying habit of introducing names such as Godkin and Gorman and other political figures of the 1880s that are not well-known today by their last name only, with no first name or description of who they were. It is also unsettling to read a statement such as \\"So much has been written of it that there is no need to relate the story again in full.\\" Similar statements appear in the book about Cleveland's so-called affair and his marriage and other incidents of his presidency. Maybe these incidents were well-known to readers during the Depression, when Nevins wrote this biography, but they are not familiar to many of today's readers.The version of the book that I read was the 1962 Dobbs, Merrill version, which was in remarkably good condition for a fifty year old book.

I consider myself fairly well-read in the areas of counseling, group leadership, and the group process. With that said, I am thoroughly impressed with this book by Chen and Rybak. Thus far, it is the most clearly written and most valuable book I have read on this subject. I find myself continually revisiting chapters over and over as I try to implement the skills and ideas outlined in this book. I believe that this book is definitely a must have for anyone interested in the group counseling process.I like the book's many strengths (clear examples, helpful exercises, accessible and fluid language), but if I have to single out its greatest strength, then it would be its roadmap approach to the group process. As I read the book, I find myself challenged to examine my own ideas and beliefs as they relate to the field. I have to ask myself what my basic assumptions are about the interpersonal process. Starting from the beginning chapters, this book helps me establish a solid foundation from where I start my leadership journey.Part Two (Basic Leadership Skills) of this book will be especially helpful for the beginning, less experienced group leaders. It takes the reader through the stepwise approach of starting a group from scratch, leading the first session, establishing a session's pace and feel, working on members' agendas, and working with tension and conflict. Chapter 6 \\"Working on Agendas\\" especially provides the readers with a powerful roadmap to follow. With its accessible language, a young counselor does not feel intimidated by the process, but instead, empowered.Part Three (Advanced Leadership Skills) adds the flesh and muscle to the skeleton. This part can be extremely beneficial for the counseling students, although it really outlines the skills of a veteran group therapist. I love the way Chen and Rybak illustrate how counseling is more than just a series of skills and theories, but a very precise art that takes patience, touch, balance, and know-how. The advanced skills gives the readers something to strive for, while at the same time, further providing the veterans with challenges and approaches that keep the art fresh. Topics that I take special note include: Taking Risks in Communication, Stirring the Pot, and the Hot-Seat Method. Many excellent models for these advanced methods are provided.I appreciate the authors' emphasis on the importance of reflective journal writing by the members and narrative session notes by the leaders. Throughout the text, Chen and Rybak offer excellent writing samples for both the group members and for the group leader. I like the way the authors close the circle by asking the reader to search inside for his own therapeutic voices and by challenging the reader to continue to grow and to live by the creative edge.What I take most from the book, even more than the powerful skills and approaches offered, is the compassion, respect, and enthusiasm that the authors show for their subjects. They truly believe in the art of group counseling and the art of leading a successful group. They believe in the power of group. That passion permeates each page and washes over the reader. This book, in many ways, transcends the counseling field and speaks of truths that can be applied to all fields. I gained so much from this book and I will continue to use it as I continue to grow as a counselor, and more importantly, as a person. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the helping profession, especially students, and to anyone who wants to better his or her leadership and communication skills."},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"I have read other books on the subject of group counseling and therapy and have found that most have one or two positive attributes. However, I find that &quot;Group Leadership Skills&quot; by Chen and Rybak has so many unique qualities (such as personable writing style, effective practice exercises, insightful leadership response samples, bountiful techniques of group counseling, and the emphasis on the development of the self as the instrument in group counseling, etc.) that I really take to heart.When I read other books, the information felt distant to me. However, when I was reading Chen and Rybak, I felt that I was experiencing what actually goes on in real group sessions. Through the numerous case examples and reflection excerpts, I can see the problems, challenges, and breakthroughs that members and leaders might experience in the forming, storming, norming, and working stages. They truthfully and thoughtfully reflect the group dynamics and interpersonal processes. Now, I can fully appreciate the powerful effect that group interaction can have on individuals.The way the book is written makes me feel confident that I can apply the knowledge and skills in my practice with all types of groups be it substance abuse groups, adolescent groups, elderly groups, ACOA groups, or groups of any other purpose. The book is written in the sequence of how a group progresses in its full life course and addresses all sorts of interpersonal dynamics even including those not easily recognized by the untrained eye. Therefore, it is quite adaptable to a wide range of group work.Among the advanced leadership skills, I find the seven principles of constructive confrontation to be a guide or a blueprint in taking effective risks in communication not only in my professional life, but also in my personal life. It is a shame that I did not have the opportunity to learn these important skills earlier in my life, but I am grateful to have discovered them now in this book.To those faint-hearted individuals, the hot-seat method and the method of stirring-the-pot in the working stage might appear a bit intimidating, but to me I find them to be extremely powerful interventions. I witnessed the hot-seat method and the method of stirring-the-pot to have the ability to evoke more intimate self-disclosure and in-depth interpersonal discovery, which are rare occurrences in our daily lives. Therefore, I consider these methods in this book to be gems in the world of counseling.I want to say again how much I appreciate the sample leader responses provided throughout the book. What is unique about them is that these sample leader responses use compassionate and sincere language. When I read these samples, I feel like I can see myself using them in my practice. They are not the typical textbook jargon, but rather they resonate an empathic nature which speaks more from the heart than the head.I was happy to find that multicultural sensitivity is placed in the context of conflict resolution. In our society, we rarely admit that diversity can create tension in a very subtle way that is beyond our language to explain, creating an atmosphere of discomfort and potential for misinterpretation. Chen and Rybak offer a conflict resolution method that brings about healing and resolution directly to the parties involved and insight to other members.I feel this book is very consoling because it speaks to new leaders like myself. It helps us realize that we will face challenges and setbacks, but it also offers us hope that if we continue to practice, experiment, and trust our creative force within ourselves, we may master the art of group leadership one day.I feel that this book acts as a personal mentor for me. Of all the textbooks I have read throughout my graduate study, no other book has had such a striking impact on me. I can see myself continuously consulting and reviewing the book when leading a group because the descriptions and examples are so realistic, focused, and concise. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"If you are a counselor education professor searching for the optimal textbook to provide your students with an excellent foundation in group counseling theory, concepts and techniques, look no further. Here is a book that will provide a framework that will enable your students to go into clinical practice with the set of skills and confidence that they need to guide their clients through a self-discovery journey that will change and improve their lives. Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy by M. Chen and C. Rybak (2004, Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole) is a highly engaging text, full of clear, meaningful examples of interventions that group counselors need to employ in order to ensure the growth and success of their groups. This book is a remarkable combination of the theory and techniques that group counselors need to understand and master so as to effectively lead a group throughout its life cycle. An invaluable resource that will be treasured and referenced by group counseling clinicians throughout their careers, Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy is the ideal textbook for group counselors in training."},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"If you are a counselor and would like to expand into group counseling this book provides everything you need.

The book helps you fine tune your counseling skills and give you the confidence to know what to do to promote growth to the group members. I know I will use this book as a reference throughout my career. This book offers you all the tools you will need to run your own group effectively."},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"I will keep this book as an extremely important reference in forming and leading counseling groups. It is such a practical guide. Certainly, it's based on theory and provides research on the theoretical foundation of group therapy, but the part I like most is the step-by-step guide on creating, leading, and facilitating groups. In addition, there are several chapters devoted to helping you deal with conflict in the group, as well as challenging groups that avoid risks and confrontations. Some very useful techniques discussed in the book are the Hot Seat Method and Stir the Pot. Also valuable are assumptions you must consider when leading groups. I'm beginning to put together a group at my high school on stress management. I can't imagine not using this book in planning and executing the curriculum. I know I will need Chen and Rybak's book often as a reference while leading the group. Every counselor who plans to facilitate a group should buy this book."},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy is a textbook designed to be an aide beyond learning the pertinent material for a particular course. As a new and practicing school counselor working with groups, my familiarity for the group process is a skill that I credit to the thorough nature of the text.

Group Leadership Skills is a perfect blend of theory and application and I would highly recommend adding it to your collection of counseling texts for use in graduate courses and future professional pursuits."},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"As a school counseling graduate student, I appreciate the wealth of insightful information this textbook has to offer about the group counseling process. It vividly describes the stages a leader and clients will progress through when participating in a group setting, while offering helpful suggestions for eliciting group cohesion, heightened awareness, increased disclosure by all members, and promoting positive group interactions. The text nicely balances between theoretical considerations to the group setting and real life examples and scenarios. The skills introduced in this text come to life as the authors provide the reader with multiple examples and ways to apply the techniques in many different settings. The cases at the end of the chapters helped me to conceptualize all the skills addressed and how a typical group member would perceive the group process. There are also scenarios for practice at the end of each chapter which allow for further analysis and self-reflection. I feel that this book has truly laid the foundation in me to be a confident, capable group leader and I am very happy to have it in my collection of counseling books."},{"Title":"Group Leadership Skills: Interpersonal Process in Group Counseling and Therapy","review":"Through group counseling and the use of Dr. Chen's book I am able to communicate my feelings more openly in my relationships with significant others in my life. This has helped me to be more sensitive to the feelings of others and also to ask for help from others when I need it. I have learned a lot about my way of interacting with others and I have been able to see that I have connections to other people rather than focusing on differences. I am making more connections to other people and I have been able to make positive changes to the way I initiate interactions with others. This has helped to expand and strengthen my support system as well as strengthen my family unit."},{"Title":"Merchants of Treason: America's Secrets for Sale","review":"I was surprised by two things with the book. The first was the large number of spy's, or more accurately greedy unscrupulous people with high security jobs, that the book details. The second is just how dumb many of them were. The authors detail out the large number of spy's that have worked against the U.S., primarily during the 1970's and 1980's. The authors also give the reader a nice, but brief history of espionage against the U.S. and details of how many of the organizations that these people were part of. The reader also gets a nice look at the actual techniques that were used to both spy and catch the traitors. Again here I was surprised at just how lax the security procedures were that allowed so much damage. How people could walk out of the CIA and FBI daily with brief cases full of top secret documents is beyond me. Is there not a security guard that could be posted at the door?I have read about many of the more notable spy's over the past 50 years, but I had not heard of maybe half of the people detailed in the book. You will be surprised at just how many people grab a few secret documents and head off to the local Russian embassy for the dirty version of lets make a deal. The fact that so many of these guys, yes most of them are men, get caught after only receiving a few thousand dollars speaks to the overall intelligence of these James Bond emulators. I mean these guys could have walked around with a blue wind breaker with yellow lettering that said SPY and they would have been less obvious then what many of them did. What concerned me was just how stupid many of the guys were, almost to the point of wondering how they even got their jobs in the first place. The reason this concerned me was if these are the guys getting caught maybe there are multitudes of competent spy's out there that we will never find out about. Also just how bad is our security that these intellectual duds were able to game the system and walk out of the building with the family treasures.Overall I found the book well written and interesting. The authors were able to keep the pace of the book lively and limit the amount of dull overly detailed descriptions of legal proceedings. I found the book a rather large eye opener and would recommend it to anyone interested in national security or espionage. It also gave me more then one or two laughs at just how hapless these guys were. In some cases it was the key stone cops meet Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Merchants of Treason: America's Secrets for Sale","review":"The Walker family is the cause of nine Americans and five Montagnards to die in Laos.

It is in the spirit of the other Witch World books, and it had an interesting new viewpoint, focusing on a young baron from Alizon (who almost seems human, in spite of the strange culture he lives in). It is very readable, and kept me interested the whole way: I sat down to read it the day I got it in the mail, and couldn't quit until I finished it about 1 AM. This is probably not the first Witch World book to read (you might have trouble figuring out the context), but it explains some events referred to in Warding of the Witch World.

A highly intelligent, literate and adult piece of historical fiction with a pleasingly sophisticated plot that is very difficult to put down - also featuring Edgar Allan Poe as the eponymous boy (though crucial to the plot he is not one of the major characters as his father is).Fully deserves the excellent reviews it received in the UK press, an enaging evocation of time and place and a wonderfully paced thriller."},{"Title":"American Boy","review":"Don't read this book if you're looking for a story about Edgar Allen Poe--he's more of a device than a character in this book.The narrator has a chip on his shoulder throughout the book which is always a bit off-putting.

However, as far as I can tell, the author conveyed an accurate picture of the times, and certainly an atmospheric one. (Hardly anything to do with Edgar Allan Poe.)"},{"Title":"American Boy","review":"I would just like to add my appreciation of the language that was used in this book. Andrew Taylow artfully combines the various styles of English speech used at the time, with the mix of historical and social conventions, and family and societal values. It's quite an accomplishment, and this, as much as the engaging and progressively engrossing story, makes it shine - a reader's joy and happiness. I experienced the audio book of this, read by Alex Jennings, and found it superbly satisfying. A real gem which took me away - luckily, for 16 CDs. As noted by others, not to worry one's head over the title, which although not an afterthought, is not significant to the story in any crucially developmental way."},{"Title":"American Boy","review":"Here's another book I only read because it was the list of 10 books nominated for a Best Read Award on British TV. Like the first reviewer the author was new to me and I was also not in the habit of reading historical fiction.Once I began it was hard to put the book down.This is almost 500 pages of escapism bliss as Taylor's beautifully told tale slowly unfolds. It's a hybrid of historical and crime fiction that is incredibly atmospheric of nineteenth century London. The novel it most reminds me of,if you want a pointer, is Wilkie Collins' \\"Woman in White\\" and the fact that I compare it to that great classic shows how highly I think of this book.If you like Wilkie Collins or maybe even Charles Dickens you will love this book.I see no point in revealing any details of the intricate plot as I'm sure any literate reader will be quickly gripped by Thomas Shield's quest.I will,however,say that I was pleased with the conclusion of the book, which is not one of those banal denouements where all the loose ends are miraculously tidied up and everyone lives happily ever after.If you are looking for an engrossing and pleasurable read you cannot possibly go wrong with this book.

My local library had only one of his novels, not the one I really wanted (\\"The Four Last Things\\") but I checked this out and was very pleased. This is the only novel I've read since \\"The Quincunx\\", that catches the feeling of Charles Dickens, yet without the sentimentality of that author, and adds a modern eye to the early Victorian period as well as a gift for intricate plotting without the coincidences that sometimes strain the edges of Dickens' plots. As has been pointed out elsewhere, this book is not so much about Edgar Allen Poe, but has him (as a young child) in a subsidiary but important role.

The appendixes of this book are very well done, I especially enjoy the appendix that has highly detailed information on each album that Miles has played on. For musicians there is an appendix which gives examples in musical notation of Miles Davis' solos. Another element that helps this book is the vast amount of quotes from people that knew Miles personally such as his musicians and friends. All in all, this biography gives a good account of Miles' life and is a great source for information on his music.

He doesn't write anything interesting about miles either.Read the 'Miles Davis autobiography' it is a thousand million times better."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"First, you need to know that this is an update of Carr's 1982 biography of Miles Davis. To begin with, there is some definite updating of the early chapters. In particular, recorded material that wasn't available in 1982 is discussed, such as the Plugged Nickel performances, and recent Columbia/Legacy releases such as Carnegie Hall 1961 are specifically mentioned. There are also surprising little nuggets of new information sprinkled throughout the first half. However, these chapters would have benefited from more careful or consistent editing. Statements of fact in 1982 that were later made inaccurate have not been revised. For example, Carr remarks that Miles' days as a sideman were over after LEGRAND JAZZ, a statement belied by the his later sessions with Toto, Chaka Khan, Cameo, Scritti Politti, Shirley Horn, Paolo Rustichelli, et al. Also, Carr marks FILLES DE KILIMANJARO as the last album with Gil Evans, although I suppose STAR PEOPLE is arguable as a matter of degree.Another aspect that consistent editing would have fixed is that statements are presented as more or less current opinions, when the speakers have passed away since the first edition. Even when referring to historical events, Red Rodney, Philly Joe Jones, and others are quoted as contemporary figures. True in 1982, but not today. This is a little disconcerting.In these respects, reading this edition is almost like reading two books, which I suppose it is in a way. But the transition from the old material to the new is seamless, and it always seemed to me that the ending of the first edition was rather rushed, anyway.Initially it seemed to me that the coverage devoted to the post-retirement years (not quite half the book) was more than a little out of balance. However, the space allotted to these years is largely due to the amount of interview material from this period. Many of the interviews were conducted by Carr himself, and the interviewees include Miles (not extensive), many of his sidemen, and other acquaintances. My favorite piece of this new material is a story related by Lydia DeJohnette about Miles coming upon her and Jack arguing in a parking lot in 1981.Upon first reading the new material, I found Carr to be unfailingly complimentary of Miles' post-retirement playing. After reflection, though, while it's still my impression that he is a big fan of 1980's Miles, I have decided that Carr is in fact quite objective. I did find his critiques of actual performances to be more balanced than his generalizations. He recognizes, for example, the sheer tedium (my words, not Carr's) of some of the live dates, as he does with a 20 July 1985 Royal Festival Hall performance. That said, however, when he quotes from his notes and reviews made onsite at live performances, they are often more favorable than his assessment of recorded material. It's interesting to contrast his review of the 1965 Plugged Nickel performances with almost any review of the 1980's live dates. I never saw Miles live, but I've seen enough artists to appreciate the added dimension that being in the same space as the performance brings, so I'm not complaining. It's just an observation.The book presents the most in-depth assessment of Miles since his death. A studied treatment of Miles' later years has been long overdue. It is well researched and enjoyable to read. The focus is very much on the making of Miles' art, visual as well as musical. It is not at all a \\"celebrity biography.\\" As an indication of where the focus lies, Carr deals with the rumors of AIDS and bisexuality in only a paragraph each. There is valuable new insight about Miles' health and his overall outlook in the months prior to his death. It seems Miles was in a very positive frame of mind, was considering retiring from the road, and had plans for painting and recording. After paying the band and expenses from the Montreux/Quincy gig, he paid cash for a new Ferrari. Carr does a good job of contrasting this image with the more common one of Miles as the shaman who has foreseen his own demise and is bidding farewell (which Jack Chambers depicts in the new introduction to MILESTONES).As with Miles Davis' music, biographies of the man are likely to elicit widely varying reactions. However, one needn't agree with all of Carr's critical analyses in order to appreciate the professionalism and effort that went into the reviews. And as with his music, so it is with well informed and well presented writings about him-more Miles is always better than less Miles. Ian Carr's new volume is a welcome addition."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"This seems to be a balanced and sympathetic account of Miles' artistic life. The focus is largely on the music, sometimes to the detriment of the narrative and a fuller understanding of Miles' personal life. For example, in the next to the last chapter there is the first and only reference to Miles' bisexuality. In addition, there is very little follow-up on the lives of his parents, siblings, wives and children. Carr also assumes you have a basic grasp of the history of jazz and popular music of the 20th century, not bothering to explain background such as the recording bans of the 40's. But if you want to sink your teeth into what made Miles a great artist and innovator, then this book should satisfy your hunger."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"This was the 4th biography about Miles Davis I had read. I guess once you read 2 or 3 biographies about a person you don't learn much new information. Although well written I don't think this is the best account of Miles Davis life a fan could read. I recommend Miles Davis Autobiography or Milestones before reading this one."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"As I sure has already been pointed out, this is not, as Carr claims, a definitive biography of Miles Davis. Rather, it is simply a pretty good analysis of his musical career. You do not come away from the book feeling like you really know who Miles Davis was. While Carr does talk some about Miles' personal life, he does not dig too far beneath the surface, and does not provide the intimacy or the detail necessary for the reader to gain a real understanding of Miles the person. One gets the sense that Carr would have viewed a more extensive discussion of Miles' personal life as somehow sensationalistic. This is unfortunate, as it is difficult to fully understand the music without understanding the man.As far as the musical analysis of Miles' work goes, it is quite extensive and generally pretty decent. However, Carr does tend to be VERY opinionated about just about every major issue in jazz and this can be frustrating as he has a tendency to dismiss opinions contrary to his own as stupid or ignorant without debating the merits. As a result, Carr often comes off as arrogant and condecending. Also, as I believe has already been pointed out, he goes to great pains to set up what I believe to be a false dichotomy between &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Non-Western&quot; influences in jazz. He sees Western influences as inferior and scorns jazz musicians who incorporate too much Western influence into jazz (i.e. the cool jazz movement). He even implies that Wynton Marsalis is somehow less of a jazz musician because his classical trumpet playing.Overall, it is a useful guide to Miles' musical career, but don't expect anything close to a &quot;definitive biography&quot;."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"Carr's book does an outstanding job discussing the musical evolution of Miles Davis, providing (for some albums) astute, song by song analysis. The wealth of detail, seemingly accurate for the most part, does make this a definitive biography. Unfortunately the book is marred by an extremely narrow thesis, namely that Davis progressively rejected white, Western music for a more &quot;organic&quot; black music. This thesis manages to be both racially offensive (Carr routinely dismisses white jazz players, even those Davis admired himself), as well as providing a very limited view of the musician's career. Indeed Carr has very odd (and negative) ideas of &quot;Western&quot; music, suggesting that it encompasses both the &quot;free&quot; elements of atonality and randomness as well as the &quot;planned&quot; elements of musical notation and arrangement. Carr also verges on hero worship in some passages of the book, conveniently explaining away various temper tantrums, acts of violence, and rudeness toward fans on his subject's behalf. Despite these misgivings, the work still provides a unique vantage on Davis' life and creative drive."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"Ian Carr's book on Miles is complete, fairly even-handed and really tries to capture Miles as both a Musician and a budding painter and importantly as an individual. It relates the large roller coaster of Miles decade by decade at the top of his game and then coming down, getting involved with seedier elements and then somehow surviving and coming back up to ascension. Anyone who respects the Jazz genre owes it to themselves to read this book if only for the history involved, because during all the twists and turns in Jazz, especially from the Bebop era on, Miles was there, and his place as a central character is assurred, among the Jazz Greats.The only reason I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I read Miles' own autobiography a bit later, and although he throws f-bombs throughout that book, I feel that it is still a better book because it comes from the mind of the Man himself.. This is still a great chronology, definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"Just getting into this bio on one of the jazz superstars, Loving every page so far. Author doing a good job with the difficulty in getting into the subject."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"This is the best biography on Davis. Carr does a great job of covering both his life and his music in prose that is detailed, but not unreadable. I wish there had been an even great discussion of his music, but I'd argue that such an approach would have left less more for information on his personal relationships and life. I wish I'd have had time to listen to all his albums while reading this."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"Ian Carr's MILES DAVIS: The Definitive Biography is one of the more meticulous lives of the great jazz innovator. Published first in 1982, it was thoroughly revised in 1998 to cover Miles' final years as well as shed greater light on his entire career.A strong aspect of the book is Carr's access to various recordings which the average fan wouldn't have a chance to listen to, such as early projects in the 40s and concerts during the 1980s. Carr very thoroughly charts Miles' health problems and the horrendous squalor he was living in during the late 1970s, making the reader impressed that he held out as long as he did. The book is also well-researched, and Carr occasionally corrects mistakes made by other biographers, such as the claim that Miles recorded with Karlheinz Stockhausen (they never met). Carr knows the trumpet well and can speak on technical aspects of Miles' playing better than other commentators. One might also mention that the book is admirably typeset, and its ease on the eyes makes it a pleasure to read.There are a few downsides to the work. Carr rarely attempts to show matters from the viewpoint of Miles' antagonists. His marriage to Cicely Tyson, for instance, is presented as if she was the one responsible for its demise. His coverage of the 80s too often is a dry counting of tour dates, and it would be nice to have some amusing anecdotes thrown in to allow the content to breathe. Also, the book holds no serious musicological analysis of Davis' work, although there are some superficial comments and some examples from various scores at the back of the book.If you are looking for an overview of Miles' entire career that treats all of his phases fairly, from his early traditional jazz to fusion to the almost-pop of his 80s efforts, then Ian Carr's biography, in spite of its negative aspects, is probably the best available."},{"Title":"Miles Davis: The Definitive Biography","review":"Describing any book as &quot;definitive&quot; is absurdly presumptious, especially when the subject is as well-known and widely discussed as Miles Davis. But Carr deserves to be credited with having produced a thorough and meticulous narrative of Miles' life and works. Frequently Miles' music is described to an excessively detailed degree, as if every single piece he recorded was a masterpiece. More judiciously selective analysis would have been preferable. The insights into Miles' working practices and relationships with his musicians are, however, of substantial interest to the jazz fan."},{"Title":"Teaching Aids -","review":"This book might be more relevant for an American school teacher, but I am teaching AIDS education in Africa and it didn't have any useful information.

George W., have only one goal, to destroy public education, this book does it. And it does it through the Florida public school teachers' own words. These heart felt words of dedicated teachers give clear, graphic and total insight into the actual process of instruction and its results. The Bush family and their supporters see the solution to reducing the cost of public education, the authors suggest, is to fail children and fail schools in order to drive parents to send their children to private or charter schools. NCLB for No Child Left Behind is just a way to destroy public education by leaving children behind. In Florida 65,000 children were left behind in third grade by a test created by another brother Bush owned test development company in Texas. Read this book to see what may be happening in your state to eventually eliminate public education and to be replaced by private sectarian schools teaching their own brand of education including bigotry against non believers, hatred for others, and their interpretation of the Bible. The homogenization of our heterogeneous culture through public schools is to be replaced by the religious right's will to divide and conquer public education by supporting the Bush NCLB in the U.S. and the Bush Family FCAT in Florida."},{"Title":"Wife of Bath (Cliffs Complete Study Editions)","review":"This book has historical context; The Wife's prologue and tale; New Historicism Criticism regarding The Wife; Marxism and Psychoanalytic Criticism; and Deconstruction and Feminist Criticism.

This would be an unwise purchase unless you already have considerable knowledge of the Yoruba language or you already own the 12 cassettes in which case this could act as a additional book so that two people could study together.The book consist of a softback execise book cover and medium sized typed text.

He published this expository work in 2005. The book is a review of Paul's letter to the Galatians. It is a collection of sermons originally delivered by Milton at his church. Milton has published 11 books and one music CD.The default setting of man is to be focused on man. We desire to establish a religion that focuses on us. The gift of grace is foreign and even contrary to our hearts. The postmodern substitute to grace does not provide the freedom that we yearn for.Paul's letter to the churches in Galatia marshaled forward the powerful gospel of truth in the strongest form. Paul sought to deliver his brothers and sisters from the shackles of a works centered theology. As many of us often sing, we are \\"prone to wander...prone to leave the God I love.\\"The Galatians were being taken captive, spiritually, by false teachers who were telling them they could please God by moralism, legalism and religious acts that would bring righteousness. These churches needed a forceful liberation from this bondage.Milton's careful investigation into this letter reveals the freeing message delivered by Paul. Man cannot earn, nor does he deserve his salvation. There is nothing you can do to make God love you more or love you less. God loves you in spite of your actions not because of them.Milton's work is a good solitary read or group study and directs the reader to a better understanding of legalism and grace."},{"Title":"Authentic Christianity and the Life of Freedom: Expository Messages from Galatians","review":"An outstanding collection of expository sermons from the book of Galatians.

Good reading !"},{"Title":"Gladiator","review":"I have seen the movie twice now - and loved it - but there were holes in the plot that I was hoping the book would fill. It didn't. I was hoping to find out about Maximus' and Lucilla's previous relationship and also that of Commodus and Maximus. Unfortunately, the book is basically a script for the movie with very little additional story or depth. Save your money and go see the movie again."},{"Title":"Gladiator","review":"Maximus Meridus, the great Roman General, begins the book by fighting for the Roman Empire against the Barbarian tribe in Germania. Maximus is the emperor's most trusted General and the emperor has him in mind to be the next man to rule the Roman Empire. Commodus, the emperor's jealous heir, is outraged by his father's decision and murders his father, emperor Marcus Aurelius, to gain control of the throne. Commodus's first order of business as emperor is to make it so that general Maximus Meridas can never deceive him, so he has Maximus's wife and son slautered and then sends Maximus into exile. Devastated and Deeply wounded by the murdering of his family, Maximus finds a new way of life that makes him even stronger, emotionally as well as physically, than he was before. Maximus begins the hard and enduring life of being a gladiator. Maximus makes new friends and pays close attention to what his heart and his soul tell him while he is a gladiator. As Maximus rises to the top of the gladiator world, he plans a heroic and defiant way to gain his revenge. I really enjoyed this book. It was a gory, cut-them-up book as well as a movie. However, there was a lot more to the story than just the fighting and death. The author, Dewey Gran, did a really good job of introducing the readers to the main character, Maximus. As you read about his family getting killed, you get a big lump in your throat. It makes you feel the outrage that the main character is going through as it happens. The one thing that I didn't like about the book is that it was written to follow the movie, and I had already seen the movie when I read the book. My recommendation is to read the book, then go see the movie. There were no surprises to what was going to happen.

But, when it comes to novelizations I like to see a little extra background, perhaps more character development than you can have in the film. And that's where this book is a bit of a let down. This is a straight retelling of the screenplay with a couple of scenes that didn't make the movie, which where kind of nice to see. I remember when Commodus finds that Maximus is still alive and he was lied to when he thought he was dead, his sister tells him that the legion should know that lies should not be tolerated. In the movie, nothing really comes of that, but in the book it then later goes to a good scene where Commodus oversees the execution of those who told him Maximus was dead. It's just little touches like that.When I read a book, I want to feel like I'm experiencing something a little different than the movie. I felt that way when reading Terry Brooks novelization of The Phantom Menace or even Raymond Benson's novelization of Tomorrow Never Dies. I really didn't get that feeling with this one.So, in short, if you go into the book expecting the movie to be expanded on, prepare to be disappointed.

In My Opinion, the book Gladiator is a great read if you want to learn alittle more about the characters. It also gave me a better view of what each of the characters were thinking in each scene. Some of the parts of this book filled some of the gaps, that the movie didn't show. Also, the dialogue in the book was very helpful for me when I saw the movie again, because there were some words and sentences I had missed while watching the movie. This book is just as powerful as the movie, because it explains every scene with the same details, if not more.

You can almost hear the Zimmer/Gerrard soundtrack as you read it.The book preserves a great deal of the film's energy, intensity, pace, and hits all the high points. Some of the characterization is handled with remarkable economy.The book provides some information on Roman tactics and geography that a reader, or a viewer unfamiliar with Rome, can benefit from. It's compulsively readable, a page-turner from start to finish.But....(you knew I was going to say that...)It could have and should have been more, even given the constraints of novelizing a film such as approval by Dreamworks, confidentiality, and the speed with which these books must be written.Some of the Latin -- starting with the gladiators' battleground itself -- is inaccurate, and I'd probably quibble with some of the ways that Mr. Gram has described tactics. I've already gotten into one argument about the size of an Aurelian as opposed to a Caesarean legion, but I was pleased he got the Syrian archers.I was fascinated by the way he handled the pyrotechnics in the first battle scene, even though I'm not sure the Romans used pitch in such a way. I know they used boiling oil. I know they used naphtha, although probably not in Germania. Okay, these are quibbles that make the experience of reading the book and watching it and arguing with friends enjoyable, and if you're not interested in details of military history, strategy, and tactics, they shouldn't get in your way.What got in my way of truly enjoying this book was some of the language. As an earlier reviewer remarked, the book offers little in the way of additional sightlines or psychological insight into the main characters, and these are things I look for in a novelization.And I kept &quot;falling out of the story&quot; because of the language. In a couple of places, Mr. Gram used metaphors that were really inappropriate for the time and place. Commodus is described as a &quot;vampire.&quot; Okay, the Romans had such things -- striges and lamiae -- but modern usage is such that I was jarred for a moment. In another place, he compares something in Rome to something from the middle ages, abruptly throwing readers forward in time.And he put more weight on adverbs than they are really intended to bear in trying to create an atmosphere of power or splendor: that's telling, not showing and, frankly, I put it down to the problems of writing novelizations.Still, the author has succeeded in what has to be his greatest purpose: an accurate representation of an exciting film.

I believe that the author, who shows scattered signs of elegant prose at times, could have done considerably better with this screen-play adaption. The main problems are:Character background is limited, only the briefest of descriptions are utilized to provide scenery, adjectives are poorly selected and often used reiteratively, there are chapter breaks every 1 to 6 pages and there is virtually no inner-monologue. If you have ever read any decent fantasy / science fiction literature then you'll be quickly bored with this work which has been seemingly aimed at about an eighth grade drop-out level. I can only guess that the author had his hands tied by the film company when he wrote this as it could easily have been 300+ pages of quality material(which, despite the comments made above, such quality prose does occassionally surface when the author has been given his head in describing situations in the movie which occurred at a rapid pace on film)."},{"Title":"Gladiator","review":"I really wanted this book to be great.

This book is little more than a transcript; it is exactly, scene-for-scene, the movie (including the deleted scenes). Yet the writer fails to keep the reader in second-century Rome because 21st-century American phraseology continually creeps into his descriptions: \\"whipped to a frenzy,\\" \\"cheering his head off,\\" etc. Even some of the dialog has been \\"updated\\" for today's audience, including some of the most memorable movie lines: \\"The Emperor has been slain\\" becomes \\"The Emperor was murdered,\\" and \\"Is this not why you are here?\\" is reduced to \\"Is this not why you came?\\" Converting \\"we shall\\" to \\"we'll\\" is simply insulting to the reader who loves this movie's sense of setting. Besides (and more importantly than) this, Mr. Gram writes with a choppy style that remains in third person objective for most of the story, rarely peeking into characters' minds and, therefore, never finding their hearts. The characters of this movie deserve a book that is rich both in historical detail and in emotional depth, but instead they got this, an ultra-quick read that reveals absolutely nothing new. The second star I gave it is for Maximus, because even when reduced to this level of shallowness, I still love him. The third star is for the first several chapters, which give sufficient detail of the opening battle sequence and even seem to promise a bit of character depth. After Marcus Aurelius's demise, however, the book's tentative promises and the author's writing skills die along with him."},{"Title":"Case By Case: A U.S. Army Conterintelligence Agent in World War II","review":"If you are in the least way interested in hisrory or the founding of the intelligence services in the US; this book is a must have. Every page reveals more excitement in WWII Europe. Probably one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Case By Case: A U.S. Army Conterintelligence Agent in World War II","review":"Novelist, screenwriter and director Ib Melchior used his experiences as a Central Intelligence Corps officer in many of his novels and screenplays. In this memoir he describes 18 of the most interesting cases that he investigated in Europe during and immediately after World War II.The book begins by describing his training in the OSS, a civilian spy agency that was a short-lived forerunner of the CIA. Melchior excelled in this difficult training, being one of only six in his group to pass. However, the need for military intelligence officers led to his induction into the CIC and his subsequent deployment to Europe.Melchior takes us through his two-year stint by describing his itinerary through war-torn Europe. In 1990, 45 years later, he and his wife retraced his steps and noted how many communities had remained largely the same (minus war damage) through the decades.Melchior was mainly involved in interrogating civilians, former Nazis, prisoners and displaced persons to uncover Nazi arms caches, Nazi resistance fighters, documents and hidden loot, and in two cases, murder suspects. Each case highlights Melchior's keen ability to sniff out lies and read people's faces, gestures and voices, while at the same time analyzing other information at hand to solve each of these mysteries. He opens a bag of interrogation tricks to show us how subjects were duped, persuaded or sometimes bullied into confessing or giving away their secrets. But Melchior was never cruel and although his methods might not pass muster in today's world, his moral compass was clear and he often displays ample kindness in dealing with his informants.There is plenty of history here--Melchior does a fine job of giving us the background and significance of the investigations he participated in. At times the history is horrifying--several instances of severe Nazi cruelty are described--but Melchior played an important role in saving stolen works of art and in preventing acts of violence.The writing is candid and often riveting; Melchior makes the most of each mystery, each nagging hunch, each peculiar discovery, adding plenty of humorous asides. He is humble without denying pride in his many impressive accomplishments.My father served in the CIC with Melchior in Europe and so I was particularly interested in this book. Highly recommended for those interested in WWII and in true spy stories."},{"Title":"Aliens: Enemies and Allies (Star Wars RPG: Galaxy Guide 12)","review":"I am not a fan of the d20 Star Wars rules. I am a diehard follower of West End Games' rules sets, and the old WEG Star Wars rulebooks and supplements will always be the rules I use to play in a galaxy far far away.With that caveat out of the way, on to the review! This is actually the second aliens sourcebook for WEG Star Wars. This sourcebook does not cover any of the major races of George Lucas' galaxy, instead focusing on aliens that may have been on-screen for three or four minutes, or have never been seen in the movies at all. The alien descriptions are clean, concise, and have good accompanying artwork. The game mechanics that represent each species are, for the most part, balanced and well thought-out. I particularly enjoyed the Revwiens, as sentient plant-aliens have long been a favorite of mine.While this sourcebook is nifty and can enhance a WEG Star Wars campaign immeasureably, it is not necessary to have a fun, fulfilling game session. Still, for diehard fans like myself, this sourecbook is a must."},{"Title":"Aliens: Enemies and Allies (Star Wars RPG: Galaxy Guide 12)","review":"This is a great resource for the Star Wars RPG. It is for the old West End Games D6 version of the game, but I think the info from this book can easily be adapted for later editions of the Star Wars RPG.This book contains info on 39 different alien species. Some you will have heard of or at least recognize from the movies (Amamin, Dresselians, Klatooinans, Weequays, etc.), and some not (Anomids, Eloms,Vodrans, etc.). While I agree these are the more minor characters from the movies, I actually consider this a plus as it will add both variety and an element of the unknown for the player characters (who wants to continually run into the same aliens and allies over and over again?).In sum, and as noted in my item title, this is basically the equivalent of the D&D; Monster Manual for the Star Wars RPG (but a bit shorter since it only contains 39 entries). But it contains some great information that will be both fun and interesting for both GMs and players alike."},{"Title":"Reviving Spiritual Hunger","review":"I started reading this book the very day I received it from amazon.com, and couldn't put it down until it was finished that same evening. If your spiritual life is not continually growing and changing, then this book is for you.I found the text to be very readable and almost conversational in tone. It smacks of the same caliber as books written by other noted authors in the same genre. If you like John Bevere's or David Wilkerson's books, you'll like this one.Throughout the pages, Pastor Schatzline's desire for intimacy with God shines through, as well as his desire to convey that same hunger to the reader. The book begins by examining the root causes of why we become complacent in our walk with God, and urges us to repent of those attitudes. A seed of hunger for God is planted in the very first chapter, and is continually watered and nourished throughout the remainder of the text. We continue by studying the different levels of relationship which exist between ourselves and God, considering the defining characteristics of each level, and given direction for passing from each and on to the next higher level. All of this is backed by much scripture - the book is chock full of Bible references and illustrations.I would highly recommend this book. The desires and knowledge contained within are precisely what this last day church needs to awaken out of its slumber."},{"Title":"Reviving Spiritual Hunger","review":"This book will help you understand the depths of relationship with Jesus Christ. Pastor Schatzline communicates a deepness in relationship that I didn't even know was attainable. Before I read this book I thought that I was a friend of Jesus, but realized that I wasn't quite there. Pastor Schatzline explains the three levels of relationship with Christ - hireling, servant, and friend - and shows what a friendship with Christ actually is like. This book will stimulate you to go deeper in your relationship with Jesus to find that intimate friendship that your soul longs for."},{"Title":"The Lord Looketh On The Heart - Understanding and Overcoming Eating Disorders","review":"I have enjoyed this tape and listen to it from time to time.

Very useful for OKAPs a few weeks before.Pros: Organized/Step wise approach to teaching with some basic problems to do as you move through each lesson. Makes you feel comfortable with the basics of optics and gives you the ability to apply it to more complex problems. Concise resource very easy read in 7-8 hours and complete the entire book.Cons: Complex problems are lacking, does not have many back of the book problems for you to do. Felt more complex optics problems (prismatic effect in glasses, contact lens over correction were not covered in depth enough). Has a little coverage of some clinical optics for Oral boards but not enough to feel prepared.Overall this is a great entry review book to learn the basics of optics that will prepare you to handle most of problems you will encounter on OKAPs but if you are looking for more detailed problems and &#34;advanced&#34; optics problems this canNOT be your only resource."},{"Title":"Last Minute Optics: A Concise Review of Optics, Refraction and Contact Lenses","review":"I liked it.

It also condenses many of the more involved elements of John Law's story into chapter notes so the reader can follow the main themes of the historical account and chose whether to divert attention to the more detailed explanations of specific matters. The historical context of John Law's Mississippi Scheme is also augmented by a concise but informative account of the Darien Scheme (which originated in Scotland) and the South Sea Scheme (which originated in England).I very much like the Newton Page Classics edition of this work. I bought it after being very pleased with the same publisher's edition ofJohn Law of Lauriston: Financier and Statesman, Founder of the Bank of France, Originator of the Mississippi Scheme. This particular edition is wonderfully put together. It has been properly re-formatted and edited for a modern paperback. It also contains a proper professional index which neither the original version nor other modern and less well produced editions contain. The cover image is taken from the early eighteenth-century Dutch produced satirical book \\"Het Groote Tafereel der Dwaasheid\\"which ridiculed John Law's scheme; and the overall design complements the design of the other books produced on this subject by the same publisher.In conclusion, if you would like an easy to read but not over simplified account of this important part of European and American history, I would definitely recommend this well produced and good historical account of the life of John Law and the Mississippi Bubble he created."},{"Title":"The Mississippi bubble: A memoir of John Law","review":"This bookThe Mississippi Bubble: A Memoir of John Law (Newton Page Classics)introduced me to the story of John Law and the Mississippi Bubble.

It's a main character who hides behind his intellectualism in an attempt to cope in his life, so self-absorbed, not self-involved, that he can't make a difference or make a committment to his professed values. In the end, you forget the purpose of this tale and end up glad that this character left Defiance Bay."},{"Title":"Leaving Defiance Bay","review":"In Mr Davis' \\"Leaving Defiance Bay,\\" we are presented with a literary elegy for the environment, the poignant and funny story of a Pacific Northwest man's bafflement at America's love affair with development and his own romantic quandries. The main character's alcoholism works as a powerful metaphor for the unsteadiness of national principles and of modern society, and in an era where one has difficulties dealing with the Orwellian nature of truth from the White House on down, Davis' meditation seems more necessary than ever. Go on and try it; it can only enrich you."},{"Title":"Leaving Defiance Bay","review":"I found 'Leaving Defiance Bay' quite interesting. Aside from his vivid aquatic imagery, Mr. Davis reveals a real knowledge of the wild bird-life native to the Pacific Northwest which would captivate the most hardened follower of the Audubon Society. I believe the novel is quite commendable."},{"Title":"I Am With You Always: A Treasury of Inspirational Quotations, Poems and Prayers","review":"This book is truly beautiful and inspirational. Drawing upon a wide variety of sources, from Lao Tsu to Albert Camus, the author offers poetic and inspiring quotes and verses to remind us that we are not alone, and that the human spirit has the power and strength to persevere. The book is neither sappy nor saccharine, as some of these books tend to be. The poetic selections are uplifting, hopeful, with a touch of melancholy. An example of one of the quotes: &quot;In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.&quot; (Albert Camus)"},{"Title":"I Am With You Always: A Treasury of Inspirational Quotations, Poems and Prayers","review":"This is a well researched book on many topics closest to the human heart and the human experience.

This makes it a uniquely beautiful work."},{"Title":"I Am With You Always: A Treasury of Inspirational Quotations, Poems and Prayers","review":"The book is designed for quick and simple inspiration...not for the high level thinkers out there....."},{"Title":"The tower of Babel","review":"I came across this book randomly, and loved it. Having taken a course on Middle Eastern history and one on borders, I felt like this book supplemented everything I had read about, and more: it provided me with the human dimension of more broader policies and events of the region. Well-balanced, informative and interesting, takes place on the eve of the 1967 war. It examines the same events through the eyes of different characters: an Israeli spy living in Syria, a Palestinian terrorist, a Lebanese banker and an Israeli military adviser. Wonderfully written."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I grew up in Fremont CA and I remember when this happened and when they found Jerry Harris's body but never knew the outcome. A friend at work gave me the book and I could not put it down. It was very weird reading it and knowing a person in the book and reading about night clubs and places I have been to. It is the 1st book of Ann Rule's that I have read, and I really enjoyed the book because I finally found out what happened to Jerry Harris."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"Ann Rule is by far my favorite true crime author. Her stories are gripping, and she is really good at setting the mood and locale. Her books also make me think of \\"America's Most Wanted\\" or \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" in that they perform a public service. \\"America's Most Wanted\\" strives to capture fugitives, and \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" tries to find a resolution to the unsolved crime. What I feel Ann Rule does for the public is use her stories to make people more aware of the dangers of the manipulators, users, and abusers in our lives. Rule's description of a pathological narcissist in one of her books put me on a path that I am convinced saved me from emotional and financial disaster, if not worse. My ex was preoccupied with insurance. I have often wondered how many other women Ann Rule has motivated to leave their abusers before it was too late. \\"In the Name of Love\\" is a collection of shorter stories by Rule. The main story offers a twist on the usual pattern of the abusive male victimizing his female partner. Jerry, a wealthy if somewhat shady businessman fell in love with Susan, who seemed to be a very passive and retiring woman. Jerry is portrayed as a very informal, easygoing guy. He had a childhood friend, Steve, who he took to be just a harmless loser, so he humored him and let him be a hanger-on. He even used him a little for a loan. In Steve's mind, this made him Jerry's business partner. If Jerry was eliminated, Steve thought he would have it all. Jerry never took Steve seriously, a very big mistake. It cost Jerry his life. Steve then made a personality misjudgement very similar to Jerry's. He thought he would be able to intimidate and decieve Susan, who he mistook for a passive victim. The story is very interesting, and might make you take a second look at the people in your own life. This is not Ann Rule's best book, but it is still a stand out in the true crime genre and worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"This is another of my favorite true crime books. Once again, Ann does an outstanding job of introducing the reader to all of the characters. I felt like I knew each person by the time everything tied together in a horrible tragedy. Ann did a wonderful job of detailing the \\"friendships,\\" the murder, the investigation, and luck involved in finally learning what had happened to the victim and who was responsible. True, the book does paint the victim as somewhat of a saint, despite the evidence that he may have been \\"creative\\" in some of his business practices. However, this book to me was more about true love -- finally found, and then lost way too soon, and how this horrible experience affected the widow for the rest of her life. It was quite a tear jerker, unlike most true crime books. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read true crime as well as to those who like romance. This book has it all."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I thought the books was very good as I love reading books by Ann Rule. However, this book was not very objective and painted Jerry Harris as such a wonderful man and Susan as such an intelligent and sweet person. This books seemed to be largely an in depth interview about Susan Harris and her wonderful life with Jerry Harris. It made these characters a little bit too perfect which took away the objectivity and made me feel the books was not real enough. It seemed the author did not delve more into the characters when researching this book."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I've read several Ann Rule true crime novels, and most have been either good or excellent. However &quot;In the Name of Love: ...&quot; is a comparative disappointment. All the hallmarks of Ann Rule (fine writing, excellent research, and a remarkable true story) are absent from this book. And perhaps worse, in the main story Ann Rule writes as if she has transformed herself into some trashy romance novelist ... complete with glowing comments of a handsome husband (I guess the photos in the book weren't very kind) by an adoring wife. Very saccharine, to a sickening extent.In this book we have one main story (&quot;In the Name of Love&quot;) followed by a few short stories. The main story is about a middle-aged entrepreneur who gets killed, and his young wife goes through hell afterwards until the killers are brought to justice. Compared to Ann Rule's wonderful works such as &quot;Dead by Sunset&quot; the story is relatively flat, and Ann doesn't do much justice in &quot;getting into the heads&quot; of the killers. It is as if this story was written in haste. Worse, the short stories are little more than collections of Seattle-area police reports from the 1960s/1970s. Yes, the stories are strange and horrific. But they all have a &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; feel about them.Is the book all bad? Well, no. As with all Ann Rule books &quot;In the Name of Love...&quot; is very readable. Or rather, it is a fast read. It certainly makes for a harmless time-filler at the beach or on an airplane. But really, Ann Rule has done much better.Bottom line: certainly not terrible, but a thoroughly forgettable reading experience."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"Gives wonderful and meticulous detail. How does this author find all this stuff out about her subjects? Very gripping and tragic true crime story about a couple who seemingly had it all, wealth, love and the admiration of their friends. Then...everything changed in a single night with Jerry Harris' disappearnce. His beautiful, young wife Susan has to bear months of wondering and waiting for Jerry to hopefully walk in the door, but that is not to be. At first, it seems that the much younger Susan is very passive and that she is submissive to her husband. However, she becomes a dynamo and formidable woman after her husband's disappearance. She fights Jerry's best friend, Steve Bonilla tooth and nail, as Bonilla is trying to get a piece of Jerry and Susan's financial pie. This all ends with Jerry's murder in 1988 and things are never the same again. Just goes to show that you can't trust your best friend sometimes!! Beware. Great read from Ann Rule."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"Even though I knew alot of the facts of this case and was very involved with the first trial of Steven Bonilla and William Nichols Ann Rule kept me glued to the book with her consise and accurate knowledge of the case. She also did a wonderful job of putting a very personal face on all the people involved, good and bad"},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I too have read all of Ann Rules books, and I felt this was one of her best! I could not put it down! I cannot wait for her next book! Keep up the great work Ann!"},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"Ann Rule can certainly put together a page-turner. The problem is, her stories of true life crime lacks all objectivity. In this installment, Jerry Harris is as perfect a human being as one could imagine, and so doggone naive about his &quot;best friend&quot; you have to wonder if he's not just a big-hearted doofus. I love Ann's books and I read every one them, but I really wish that she would paint her characters three dimensionally--the &quot;good guy&quot; isn't perfect, and the &quot;bad guy&quot; must have some good in him/her or the &quot;good guy&quot; wouldn't have been so duped!"},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"not her best and I wonder if she should not have written it at all since she obviously didn't have enough material for a real book. She just keeps harping on the good guys being so good and the bad guys being so bad without much detail to back it up. Sad. I thought I-5 Killer, Dead by Sunset, and Everything she ever Wanted were fabulous."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"This is not only the story of an avaricious sociopath, it is also the story of a woman who, for almost eight years, experienced and survived adversity most of us cannot even begin to imagine. This woman lost almost everything that mattered to her, but not for a moment did she lose hope, courage, or the sense of right and wrong. The villains in this saga possessed none of these values, and to those who say that this book is not objective, I will tell them that it is hard to be objective when you are writing about the senseless murder of such an obviously kind and generous man that most of us would have been proud to know."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I loved this book.

She will never lose her knack for holding 'me captive'."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"\\"In the Name of Love\\" is a perfectly decent Ann Rule compilation of true crime escapades. The best and by far the longest is the title selection. It concerns the murder of a busy, hustling California whirlwind of a millionaire, Jerry Harris. The resolution is a testament to his gritty, determined widow and some equally dedicated cops who skillfully sort out some overlapping jurisdictions.There are 4 other chapters: The best are \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" about two adventure-seeking Seattle teenage girls who get themselves in way over their heads and \\"The Killer Who Never Forgot..or Forgave\\". The latter had all the material for a full length novel. Had that come to pass, Arne Kaarsten could have gone to the front row of nefarious Ann Rule quiffs.INL is notable because that \\"Ann Rule rule\\" is not in effect! Those often pesky centerfold photos illuminate characters without giving away resolutions. Likewise, the back cover teases but reveals nothing.INL is not the authoress' best work, yet remains a safe choice for established fans. New readers are better advised to turn to her older, entrenched full length novels such as \\"The I5 Killer\\", \\"The Want Ad Killer\\", \\"The Lust Killer\\" and \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\"."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I am a hugh Ann Rule fan and this book was very enjoyable to read. The First story which is two thirds of the book was classic Ann Rule style. I couldn't wait to get back to the book. This is normal for Ann Rule's books. Some of the other stories in this book were good but not great I feel due to the lack of detail, that I am accustom to from Ms. Rule's books. Over all I am very glad that I bought this book. Keep them coming, I am anxiously waiting....."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I am a serious lover of Ann Rule books, but this wasn't one of my favorites. It really took a while to grab my attention, unlike other books I've read by her. Not her best, but still a good read when compared to most other true crime books."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"The main story in this book by Ann Rule is about a successful entrepreneur who falls in love with an inexperienced younger woman whom he eventually marries. His wife is somewhat submissive in her marriage, allowing her husband to make the plans, decisions, etc. However, one business relationship becomes threatening to her husband and he suddenly disappears. The young wife becomes obessed with finding her husband and looks for every angle. She turns out to be a strong, assertive person in her own right. Ann Rule, as is her talent, traces their relationship through the years, and brings out the human element in this true crime story. There are several other fascinating short true crime stories in the book, all of which make it difficult to put the book down."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"Ann Rule is a wonderful story teller. She does a terrific job reporting the facts in true crime stories."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"In the name of love could have easily been a book in itself. The length is about 200 pages long. Ann Rule writes about Jerry and Susan Harris, a vivacious couple, who had money, friends, love, and popularity among their family and friends and associates. Jerry Lee Harris unfortunately made a deadly friend in Steven Bonilla who if he investigated himself would have learned that his best friend was a sociopath who would stop at nothing to steal Jerry's life and even his wife. For Susan and Jerry, their relationship seemed like an ideal marriage and partnership. They rarely fought with one another maybe about having children. Together, Susan and Jerry appeared the perfect match. When Jerry never came home one night in October 1987, Susan panicked and worried that something was terribly wrong. Regardless of his outcome, she would have been more relieved if he left for another woman then at least he would be alive. Sadly, he was killed that night and dumped in the desert. Found months later, the cause of death was determined to be homicide. Bonilla who was once Jerry's friend had become his enemy by badmouthing his life in death. Susan at a young age had taken up Jerry's businesses of successful clubs. The problems was financial but it didn't matter to Susan because all she wanted was Jerry to be alive and well. The news of his murder gave some closure that he was never coming to their beautiful home on Blackhawk Road in Northern California. The investigations into Bonilla's life and one of the guy's who turned in evidence against Steven and the killer revealed a shocking past of Jerry's best friend who attempted to kill his first wife by planning a bomb under her car that never went off because the guy cut the wires. Bonilla's life also included involving his second wife, Ginger, into buying supplies for a meth lab. The author omits the ingredients here purposely as if we can't find out on the internet. For Bonilla, Jerry was everything that Steven wasn't and he wanted it all even his young pretty wife, Susan, who he took for granted as dumb and ignorant. She surprised him by being stronger than he could have imagined by derailing him at every possible point. In the end of the story, it wasn't about money for Susan. She never recovered from her loss of the love of her life, Jerry Lee Harris. She has found a new life away from California and a new name. Bonilla is on death row, the killer is in for life, and the man who helped them get there only got three years. Of course, Ann Rule writes from a policeman's perspective because she was one for many years and you can expect her to be biased in that aspect. She does write about people's mistakes in judgment of others. Jerry Lee Harris was somebody who believed the good in everybody maybe that's one of his endearing qualities and faults."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I have read all of Ann Rule's books and thoroughly enjoy them. However, this book seems to lack objectivity. Jerry is so good and Steve so bad. Jerry is so tall and Steve is so short. He even loses stature as the book progresses but if you will notice in the wedding pictures they seem to be the same height. Well written, as usual, but I just wish I could have been surer of the facts."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"ANYTHING by Ann Rule is a must for true crime fans.

Look forward to her next, and next, and next.."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I read this book when it first came out and my first thought was &quot;Ann Rule did not write this book&quot;. It is poorly written and not at all in the same wording / manner that Ann Rule uses.Second, it is totally one sided. I am sorry but the 'poor victim' was a crook himself that took from others and used others to get what he wanted.He was murdered because he stepped on people to get money for his own benefit.I wonder, did Ann Rule get paid by Jerry's wife to write such a false account of this devious man?Not worth reading if you have read any other Ann Rules, and if you want to read TRUE life crime novels."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I read this book in much the same way as I have read Ann Rule's other books: fast. While I enjoy her books, Ann Rule does not define the main characters here as much as she has in say, &quot;Everything She Ever Wanted.&quot; For instances, why did Jerry Harris get his nose broken three times if he was such a saint? Why didn't Ms. Rule do more research into the character of Steve? I would have preferred to look at this story from the angle of how someone is set up to be a good guy, a scapegoat, and how they play it out over their lives. I was irritated overall by Ann Rules one-dimensional view of everyone. And I did not like being made a part of Susan and Jerry's schemes to outwit others as part of a cute joke."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"In the name of love was the first book I read by Ann Rule and from then on I just could not stop reading. She is a master mind in true crime and this is one of her best works."},{"Title":"In the Name of Love","review":"I usually enjoy Ann Rule's books and have a hard time putting them down. However, in this story of a California millionaire who is murdered by a &quot;friend&quot;/business partner, I find that Ann Rule is a little biased in her opinion of Jerry Harris, the victim in this story. I myself found him to be yes, at times compassionate and generous to the less fortunate, but 99% of the time, I found him to be a complete show off, very shrewd, not all that honest, and greedy. I also found his &quot;poor&quot; wife to be somewhat of a gold digger. I just cant see this beautiful young lady interested in this man for anything other than his money, although she tries very hard to show that, that is not the case...... OK, right!!! This man definitley did not deserve to be murdered but I just did not find him as saintly as Ann Rule portrayed him to be. A real good mystery story though and it is pretty obvious right from the start who did it. Once again, Ann has done better."},{"Title":"Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (In-formation)","review":"I must say that this is one of the most interesting books I've read so far concerning the experience of everyday (Soviet?) socialism. By reconsidering such an important subject through a solid (and novel) theoretical lens and providing high quality ethnographic data, Yurchak does what every good ethnographer should do: (laconically speaking) bring something new. This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in (post)socialism. Last but not least, it is very fun to read."},{"Title":"Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (In-formation)","review":"The anthropological account of post-modern society offered in this book is certainly one of the best I encountered in recent years. By brilliantly and engagingly analyzing the late soviet society, the author provides us with original analytical insights into the peoples' relations with ideology, discourse and ritual. A perennial social laboratory for all kinds of cultural experiments, Russia in its soviet phase served A. Yurchak as an empirical field whereby to conceptualize the paradoxical, non-dichotomous and multi-layered post-modern social condition. Moreover, Yurchak joins the exclusive club of genial authors who succeeded in touching the intangible uniqueness of the \\"soviet experience\\" - i.e. everyday life, way of thinking, forms of language and power, performance of dream and fake. Thus, this reading is necessary for both the favorites of lively intellectual reading and for everyone who pretends to understand something about \\"Russians\\", even if they are already post-Soviet and therefore similar and close on the one hand, but different and inconceivable on the other.As anthropologist and Russian by origin, I try, in my everyday experience, to explain to my colleagues and friends the world I came from and to show how relevant this world is to any cultural and intellectual account of contemporary life. Yurchak's book is a great contribution to this challenge."},{"Title":"Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (In-formation)","review":"This is a very good ethnographic account of some important aspects of everyday life in the later years of Soviet Union. It is interesting, well written, the quality of the research is high, and the account is truly enlightening. As a researcher actively interested in East European ethnography I woud very much like to recommend it to readers looking for interesting and non-banal accounts."},{"Title":"Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (In-formation)","review":"This book was really eye opening. I did not know much about the Soviet generation or Soviet Union except for the little taught in high school, but this book showed me how these people lived and interacted in their daily life. It was really fascinating and just a great read. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (In-formation)","review":"In America there was once a popular but simplistic image of the Soviet Russia as the Evil Empire destined to fall, precisely because it was unfree and therefore evil. Ronald Reagan who advocated it also once said that the Russian people do not have a word for \\"freedom\\". Not so fast -- says Alexei Yurchak. He was born in the Soviet Union and became a cultural anthropologist in California. He employs linguistic structural analysis in very interesting ways. For him, the Soviet Union was once a stable, entrenched, conservative state and the majority of Russian people -- actually myself included -- thought it would last forever. But the way people employ language and read ideologies can change. That change can be undetectable at first, and then unstoppable.Yurchak's Master-idea is that the Soviet system was an example of how a state can prepare its own demise in an invisible way. It happened in Russia through unraveling of authoritative discourse by Gorbachev's naive but well-meaning shillyshallying undermining the Soviet system and the master signifiers with which the Soviet society was \\"quilted\\" and held together. According to Yurchak \\"In its first three or four years, perestroika was not much more than a deconstruction of Soviet authoritative discourse\\". This could a cautionary tale for America as well because the Soviet Union shared more features with American modernity than the Americans themselves are willing to admit.The demise of the Soviet Union was not caused by anti-modernity or backwardness of Russian people. The Soviet experiment was a cousin of Western modernity and shared many features with the Western democracies, in particular its roots in the Enlightenment project. The Soviet Union wasn't \\"evil\\" in late stages 1950-1980s. The most people were decent. The Soviet system, despite its flaws, offered a set of collective values. There were many moral and ethical aspects to Soviet socialism, and even though those values have been betrayed by the state, they were still very important to people themselves in their lives. These values were: solidarity, community, altruism, education, creativity, friendship and safety. Perhaps they were incommensurable with the \\"Western values\\" such as the rule of law and freedom, but for Russians they were the most important. For many \\"socialism\\" was a system of human values and everyday realities which wasn't necessarily equivalent of the official interpretation provided by the state rhetoric.Yurchak starts with a general paradox within the ideology of modernity: the split between ideological enunciation, which reflects the theoretical ideals of the Enlightenment, and ideological rule, which are the practical concerns of the modern state's political authority. In Soviet Union the paradox was \\"solved\\" by means of dogmatic political closure and elevation of Master signifier [Lenin, Stalin, Party] but it doesn't mean the Western democracies are immune to totalitarian temptation to which the Soviet Union had succumbed. The vast governmental bureaucracy and Quango-state are waiting in the shadows here as well, may be ready to appropriate discourse.It is hard to agree with everything in his book. But it is an interesting perspective. I wish Alexei Yurchak would explore more implications of Roman Jacobson's \\"poetic function of language\\" and its connection to Russian experiment in communism. It seems to me, as a Russian native speaker, that Russians put stress on form, sound, and poetics. The English-language tradition prioritizes content and meaning. Can we speak of \\"Hermeneutics\\" of the West versus \\"Poetics\\" of Russia? Perhaps the tragedy of Russia was under-development of Hermeneutics? How does one explain the feeble attempts to throw a light of reason into the loopy texts and theories of Marks, Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin? Perhaps the Russians read it as a kind of magical text, a poetry, a bad poetry -- not Pasternak or Blok -- but kind of poetry nevertheless?"},{"Title":"Jackson's Valley Campaign (Great Campaigns Series)","review":"What a wonderful and enthrilling book. Doc Martin really managed to let the reader feel like he'd be part of the whole story. From the beginning of the book the reader feels like standing right next to Stonewall Jackson, the tactical genius who rewrote military history during the Civil War. It is an absolute pleasure to feel and see the numerous photographs in the book become alive with the words of the author. The fact that beside Stonewall Jackson the book offers an exclusive view on all the other important personalities behind the scenes of the war and around the map-table makes the reader finish the book with an exhausted - because of the many details shown - but satisfied impression about this time period and it's heroes. I highly enjoyed analyzing the movements of the opposing forces on the charts and maps and I can only recommend Mr. Martin's other campaign books 'The Peninsula Campaign', 'The Chancellorville Campaign', and 'The Philadelphia Campaign', as well as 'Confederate Monuments at Gettysburg' and 'Gettysburg July 1'."},{"Title":"Jackson's Valley Campaign (Great Campaigns Series)","review":"I recently purchased this book used as it has gone out of print. It is another of the books in the Great Campaigns series. I found this book to be an excellent introduction to Jackson's famous Campaign. I was surprised to learn how many times Jackson actually lost more men than the Union. The Strategic maps in this book were very well done, but the battle maps left something to be desired. A nice feature of this book for scenario designers was the appendix listing regimental strengths at each battle when known. 184 pp., 11 maps"},{"Title":"A Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Naxos Audio)","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) is best known as the creator of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. This outstanding biography by Hesketh Pearson (and wonderfully narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith) reveals Doyle's many other accomplishments, including how he came to the profession of medicine, his activities as a war correspondent, his eventual interest in spiritualism, as well as his many other writings. Ironically, Doyle felt his Sherlock Holmes stories to be the least of his literary works while prizing his now largely forgotten major historical novels. Here too is the story of Doyle as a husband, including the death of his first wife and the enduring affection of his second marriage.

(it's not the presentation or answering objections, if you want it badly, you'll buy, simple as that, thus selling is motivational, not persuasive)Overall, it's definitly worth your browse.

The author has a phenominal understanding of sales. I have attended his seminar and find his techniques to be right on target.

And I continue to review and leverage many of D Forbes Ley insights as I grow a mulit-million dollar sales force consulting firm (and close million dollar deals). D Forbes Ley was the first to construct a sales process that focused on emotional buying motives. while some of the text is outdated (sales scripting) there are some huge gems in this book. He makes a great outline for the difference between the human \\"needs\\" and \\"wants\\" and how to uncover the prospects pain (he calls selling a \\"hurt\\" and \\"rescue\\" mission). if you apply his simple concepts it can give you a focused and effective approach."},{"Title":"The Best Seller","review":"As a professional salesperson for the past eight years, I can definitively say this is the best sales book ever written. It assumes a more advanced level of knowledge. While the techniques or conversations seem dated...they are not... You can apply 100% of the same principals today and while there has been change in the past 20 years..people's buying motives have not changed. I have used the techniques in this book with powerful success as have mentors of mind. The greatest salesmen I have ever met swore by the techniques here......it is very powerful."},{"Title":"The Best Seller","review":"I first read Forbes' book several years ago. I ended up taking his intensive selling course in California (I live in Michigan). I loved the book; I loved the course; I'm still waiting for the movie (although he did recommend the movie \\"Stand and Deliver\\" as, in part, a movie about motivation and selling). I have also gone through and have practiced the Sandler Sales Institute system.Whether you feel his book is helpful or not may depend on the context in which you are selling. I believe his most important point is that you must sell to a prospect's hurt or pain, as well as to his/her logic. The emotional sale must be, as he puts it, invisible. A real estate agent selling a home to an interested buyer in the owner's living room is a much different selling context than team selling to a purchasing manager of a Tier One auto supplier. For the latter, any open display of gamesmanship or obviously tired (translate: \\"visible\\") techniques will be fatal. But Forbes' point is that even in selling to the purchasing agent, and to the various users within the purchasing agent's company, you must click into their emotional hurt to motivate them to buy, if only to help them talk themselves into believing that your product is the best buy. Relying only on a logical presentation of more features than your competition will not cut it.Todd W.

Top picks of mine are books by Willie Gayle(if you see them out here you'll see by price how much other readers think of them!) Included in this list are Power Selling and 7 seconds to success in sales.Others I like are Socratic selling by Kevin Daley and I Hate Selling by Allen Boress and I like the tough questioning Audio Program by Tom Hopkins/J. Douglas Edwards \\"Back to the Future in Sales\\".All of these books have questioning as their primary method of selling. Some are soft(willie Gayle). Some are tough, \\"Back to the Future\\", another in the soft questioning area like Willie Gayle is Roy Chitwood in World Class Selling and some are in the middle like Socratic selling.I believe Mr. Ley was a trainee of Willie Gayle's because many of the soft objection handling techniques sound like the soft butter of Willie Gayle cushion and reverse or cushion and question.The interest creating questions at early and correct part of the meeting are some of the best I have heard in the business and rate with Kevin Daley's Socratic Selling in piquing my clients interest.While I may agree I may not use these techniques in B2B selling exactly, for selling in the home or on the lot or one on one with a couple: I feel these techniques will get a client chasing after you for more benefits and emotional wins for himself as you use the interest generating questions and follow with his emotional rewards for owning your product.Bravo, at this point maybe the best or at least the best compilation of timeless writings from the past.If your sales don't go up.

Winkleby and Steele capture the triumphs of under-represented and low-income students in Northern California as they ascend through higher education and health professions and leave you marveling at the power of opportunity and role models. It's remarkable that the Stanford Medical Youth Science Program can even tell the complete story of so many young students--a testament to the attention and intent of the outreach program. This is a wonderful program and outstanding book that should revolutionize how society ensures opportunity to young students worldwide! AWESOME."},{"Title":"Healing Journeys: Teaching Medicine, Nurturing Hope","review":"This is a fabulous true story which has &quot;the Good&quot; (focused young students), &quot;the Evil&quot; (problems generated by poverty),&quot;the Benefactor&quot; (focused proplem solvers), &quot;the Hero/Heroine&quot; (education)and a &quot;Theme&quot; (what goes around comes around). Stanford Medical Youth Science Program started with an idea that Health Services in improverished communities could be well served by reaching out to the youth of these communities. Since 1987, 333 bright,low-income students from rural and urban California high schools, with the help of Stanford University and some brilliant and enlightened mentors, have received an unparalleled opportunity to realize the great potential that lies within them. In the course of applying for the Stanford Medical Youth Science Program, being selected, living on campus for 5 weeks and attending special classes, labs, seminars and lectures, these special young students became filled with a certainty of their intelligence, abilities and self worth. It is thrilling to read the of the excitement this program generates in the lifes of 16 of the Program's Graduates. We get to experience thru their eyes what it was like to admitted to college (often a first for their families). We get to see these wonderful men and women give back to their communities even more than they received."},{"Title":"Judge Dave and the Rainbow People","review":"It's not every day that you read a book containing the full text of a consent agreement between parties to a health statute dispute and still find it very enjoyable. It's just as uncommon for a federal appeals court judge to write a book about the time he oversaw the peaceful assembly of thousands of middle-aged hippies in the woods of North Carolina. But that's what Judge Dave and the Rainbow People is about.The Rainbow People are not an organization as such. They're just whoever shows up around Independence Day each year at a place on federal land decided the year before. The people who show up are mostly baby boomer ex-hippies trying to relive the Summer of Love. They come by the thousands, get naked, and live in the woods for weeks. Invariably, the Forrest Service comes after them.In 1987 the Rainbow People converged on Nantahala Forrest in Western North Carolina. It wasn't long before the State tried to evict them under a sanitation law that was arguably unconstitutional. The case ended up before Judge Dave, who was a circuit court judge at the time.The result is an endearing account of how a conservative judge faced 15,000 decadent hippies (and at least one elephant), the ACLU, snarky law clerks, a ticking clock, and his own Senate confirmation to the D.C. Circuit in the background, and still managed to avoid catastrophe by avoiding a ruling on the law. Judge Dave is sincere and admits up front that this was one case where the results, and not the letter of the law, drove his decision. The alternative was a possible showdown between thousands of until-then peaceful gatherers and state troopers. I guess he made use of judicial discretion.Judge Dave got to visit the Rainbow camp a couple of times while he assessed the problem and later monitored the implementation of the agreement he brokered between the two sides. These visits account for much of the book and Judge Dave recounts them with a wonderful understated dry wit. &quot;That weekend, July 4th occurred on Saturday as scheduled,&quot; he recalls in one part.You learn how tolerant Judge Dave is. Not in the modern meaning of the word, which holds that everyone's wonderful, but as originally defined: &quot;to allow without prohibiting&quot; even if one strongly disagrees. You also learn how truly peaceful the Rainbow People are and how this allowed tolerance to work. Finally, you learn that Judge Dave found himself staring at the naked ladies quite a bit!I would recommend this book, especially to lawyers, law students, and hippies (quite the niche). The only real critique I have is that at the end of the book, one of the Rainbow leaders shares his memories in 20 pages. I bet this was done to provide some sort of &quot;equal time&quot;, but it doesn't add much and is actually a bit distracting. After finishing Judge Dave's hilarious and fair account of the gathering it's odd to go through a flat mini-review of what you just read. But hey, judge for yourself. Happy trails!"},{"Title":"Judge Dave and the Rainbow People","review":"This book is, as President Teddy Roosevelt would say, DELIGHTFUL.For fellow judges, lawyers, and law students, it is a rare look into the judicial decision making process of a federal jusge. Judge Sentelle tells the story (laced with humour) of how he used appropiate judicial restraint and fairness to solve a complex civil case.As you follow his actions during the course of this case, you will see this judge exhibits humility, wisdom and common-sense judgment----virtues that all federal and state judges should have.Thanks, Your Honor, for an enjoyable and worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Judge Dave and the Rainbow People","review":"Judge David provides a humorous outsider's observation of a Rainbow Gathering. He is open minded and a very good amateur writer. But don't expect this federal officer's observation to either be comprehensive or to adequately document the details of the Rainbow Family Gatherings or their history of abuse at the hands of the Federal Government. For that, you should read \\"People of the Rainbow\\" (Niman - Univ of Tennessee Press). The two books work well in tandem."},{"Title":"Studies in Christian Ethics (Articles and Book Reviews) (Vol 8)","review":"This book was confusing and a lot of things happended that you have to remember for later. I gave it two stars because i thought it had a good story, but there were A LOT of characters. I forgot about a lot of them as the book went on so i couldn't enjoy it. If you have a bad memory, like me, i sugjest that you don't even think about this book. I thought it was pretty much terrible, and i can't belive i spent my time reading it. If you like war and a lot if killing, than you will like it. But if you are really sensitive about killing, but like Middle Aged stuff, good luck finding a book to read. I sugjest a nice book like Robin Hood. Better yet, watch the Disney version of Robin Hood. That is a nice movie. No killing or anything like that. This one dosen't say all the details about the blood and guts and stuff, but a lot of people die, which is good, because that is one less character to think about. I highly recomend that you don't read this book, but if you like books, than you will probebly like it more than me. When i read a book for school (I read this book in a group with 4 people including me) all i can think about is what is on tv. That is probebly what made me confused with all the characters. After a while, i think my group got anoyed with me for not paying attention. I'm not very good at that. But anyway, if you are like me, than raed another book. Also, if you don't like memorizing, steer clear of this book because there is a lot of memorizing involved in understanding the book."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This book was a wonderful romance story between Danina and Nikoliai. It is also a story of how things were in the Soviet Union during the revolution. Having taken ballet as a young girl I could appreciate how hard I knew Danielle Steel tried to portray Danina's training. I must say that she did not do a very good job of it. Her descriptions of the ballet life left much to be desired. I know this was supposed to be a romance novel, but the whole background was the ballet and she could have done a much better job researching.

To bad there was so much tragedy to Danina. She was a very warm a loving person. I feel that Nikolai should have gone with her to Vermont instead of Siberia with the Czar and Czarina.

Granted, it was a nice quick sunday afternoon read...but nothing more."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"There was definitely no thinking required on this one. Everyone is saying Steele has lost her skills , i wouldn't know what they're talking about since i have never read her books. It was very simple and easy to understand, nothing complicated. it was a bit annoying that Danina kept getting ill and then...no wait first she gets influenza, then she gets sick 'coz she's pregnant, i didn't know you could get so sick from being pregnant even if you're a ballerina whose teacher is a slave driver. remind me not to get pregnant ever. Then she brakes her ankle. the weird thing is how did the storyteller get to know all the stuff, i mean i know the box and all that but the intricate details...weird. the only reason i bought this book was because i thought there would be a lot about ballet, which i like. i wish Steele had put in more of that.

Its quick, not too involved and just enough romance to keep your interest. The main character although suffering some of life's heartaches isn't bombarded with them like many of Steele's other leading characters. I also liked the touch of history throughout the book because you know how that's going to work out. What Steele does nicely in this book is that she keeps you guessing as to how the true facts will impact on the lives of the main characters. All in all if you're planning to sit by the pool or beach, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"If you like Danielle Steel's books, you'll probably enjoy Granny Dan. It's a cute story, extremely easy reading, and it has the predictable happy ending. It seems to me, though, that Ms. Steel's writing is getting more and more shallow as she keeps popping the books out. I agree with the one reader who felt that rather than trying to beat some sort of publishing record, Ms. Steel should take the time to write higher quality books. (Why in the world did she sign on to write THREE books a year? It's not like she needs the money!) Although I have been a loyal Danielle Steel reader for about fifteen years now, and will probably continue to be one for many more, I do feel a little cheated each time a new book comes out. I seem to remember her early books (The Ring, Crossings, Family Album) interlaced with more more character development, detailed descriptions, historical references.....and above all a little more editing! It seems that Ms. Steel's editor has with increasing frequency and blatancy been taking time off to do something other than read Ms. Steel's manuscripts! I honestly can't believe that a professional would allow something like Danielle's more recent books to slip by without some fine tuning! Ms. Steel repeats herself over and over in a continuous train of thought. She almost writes to her readers as though they were 12-year-olds, explaining obvious emotions and thought patterns that her characters experience....and then repeating them over and over again as if she thought we might forget she just said the same thing two paragraphs before! Perhaps her earlier work wasn't necessarily better, it was just that I began to read them about the time I was twelve, which is perhaps the maturity level of her intended reading audience! I mean honestly, in Granny Dan the heroine Danina's ballet instructor is at one point telling Danina's lover Nickolai Danina's sad background, including how many years Danina had been at the ballet school. Then, in the same conversation a few paragraphs later, Nickolai actually asks the instructor how many years Daninia had been at the ballet school, as if the instructor had never been talking at all! It is major oversights like this one throughout the book that distracts from the story. Perhaps, Ms. Steel (and her editor for that matter) have become a bit too big for their britches, thinking that Ms. Steel's writing need not go further than a first draft, for honestly, her published book seems like that's all it is: a first draft. The entire thing is a narrative with very little dialog, description, or research to make the story more believable. If Ms. Steel could at least take the time to perfect her novels, I'd feel a little less cheated.....because she does write a good story, albeit predictable. But that's what I've always liked about her books--they are very easy reading that requires no thinking, I can usually read them in a day or two, and they always have a happy ending. Certainly, with her juvenile writing style, Danielle Steel is no Diana Gabaldon or Judith McNaught, but she does tell good stories. I just wish she'd put a little more effort into her latest work--because if she were a first-time author there's no way in the world she'd come close to getting a publishing deal with the drafts she's putting out now!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Wonderful read, didn't want to put it down. I love Danielle Steeles Granny Dan. I have all her books in either paper back, hard cover or kindle."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Bought a bunch of these Danielle Steel books for my 94 year old aunt on here. She only reads DS. Thanks for having them. They are hard to find where I live and she has about 10 more to read and she will have read every single book of DS. Thanks :)"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Once again Danielle Steel brings her own special artistry in writing this novel and in doing so brought forth memories of special times shared with my own late grandmother. A heart-rendering story of love lost but never forgotten."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This is the second time that I read this book and I really enjoyed it. Danina Petroskova is Granny Dan to her granddaughter. The grandmother who sang to her, liked to roller skate and wore black and shabby dresses. When she passes away in the nursing home, all her belongings are given to her granddaughter. This includes a pair of ballet slippers, a locket and letters written in Russian. She was a prima ballerina in Russia who had a relationship with the Imperial family and had a magical romance. The Russian Revolution changed the course of the life forever. It shows that we all often forget that the elderly were once young and vibrant and have many experiences worth hearing about. It was a very touching story."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I have just finished reading Granny Dan, and so I've been now reading the reviews. I am amazed at how some people were disappointed in this novel because I found it to be one of Danielle Steels best works. I was drawn into it by the prologue alone, I guess because as I've gotten older, I've been thinking a lot about my family and the past, and regret not finding out more about my own grandmother. There was a line in the book , something to the affect of, why do we think they were never young people. That's exactly how I thought about my grandmother. She was 62 when I was born, always OLD to me. And altho she lived to 102, I never thought to ask her about her childhood, or HER family, and even what her parents names were. Now, all my family are gone, and I have no one to ask. To me, in Danielle Steel books, there is always a good story, but she seems to repeat things over and over and over.......especially in describing how handsome, thin, beautiful, chiseled, etc. the characters are, and I tend to get bored.......seems to me it's just to \\"stretch\\" the novel into more pages.......too much \\"fluff\\", but in this novel, I found it to be a page turner, minimal repetition, and decent reading for anyone that regrets not finding out more information about a family member while they are still alive."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"It was a great novel, as are all those by Danielle Steel. Once you begin reading it you're looking forward to picking it up where you left off.It reminds you that there's more to a person than what we see."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I was pretty disappointed as I struggled to maintain interest! This has got to be one of Steel's most uninteresting novel's I have read. The end had a rather unique twist though predictable leading up to the end!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"to put it bluntly this is my absolute favorite book. even though I dont have it n the kindle i still loved this book....ever since i read granny dan i have been inspired to take up ballet..."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This is by far my favorite book by Danielle Steel. I seldom buy novels, preferring to check them out of the library. This is one of those rare novels that I purchased and keep on my bookshelf, re-reading it once or twice a year when I'm in the mood for a short, sweet tale. And I cry every time, even though the ending never changes!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I'd like to advise Ms. Steel to stop exploiting the Russian pre- and post-revolutionary theme. Her Zoya was close to what had really happened in Russia, but this book... I don't know, it looks like a cheap fake, even the heroine's name... There's no such Russian name like Danina (sounds more like a female surname), and Petroskova (it's something close to Bulgarian)... This whole story reminds me the biography of Anna Pavlova, the greatest Russian ballet dancer, but Danina acts and speaks like she lives on the West of nowadays. It's a pity 'cause I do enjoy Steel's books a lot, but this one... Perhaps, she needs to study better the environment she discribes."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I think one should describe this book as how to survive the maladies of the early 20th century. My gosh, how many times does this woman have to succumb to complete exhaustion and be able to take only bits of nourishment. And sorry, Nickolai, you are a complete loser. You married Marie....make the best of it. Obviously I didn't like the book! I don't like these unrealistic episodes of complete romance conquering all...my fault. I am sure Steel satiates the longings of many a reader, just too soapy for me."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I am still trying to figure out what was going on with that disaster, the Klone and I, so I read &quot;Granny Dan&quot; Where is the depth in the characters? In her early books DS gave a history of each character that made one feel as if they were intimate friends. I was left wondering what &quot;Marie's&quot; problem was, what was Madame Markova's history and WHY did everyone at the school apparently love this little twit who was sick most of the time or running off to the czar. Surely one or two other ballerinas could have provided a little conflict. I was so sure we'd get some old DS twists. Madam dying. leaving the school to Danina, Danina taking a few orphan kids to Vermont and landing in the US, pregnant of course, and so on and so on. I am ready to see another one like &quot;The Ring&quot; or &quot;Thursten House&quot;I will get the next DS book, hoping it is comparable to her first books. After such a dry spell, we are due to see something great!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Actually, I give this book Zero stars.First, I will preface this by saying I am NOT a Danielle Steel fan. I picked this one up because I am interested in ballet and the WWI period. It is obvious that Ms. Steele realized the fate of the Romanov family is a hot topic and that she has heard of Anna Pavlova and decided to do a book on them but didn't bother to do any other research than that. It was Dr. Botkin who was shot with the Romanovs not the hero of this book. The Czarina was an Englishwoman, so why couldn't she get friendly with the doctor's wife (Marie)? People were starving in Russia at the time (That's why there was a revolution, folks), yet everyone is fluttering around this two-bit, still-rising-star dancer. I laughed out loud when a reference was made regarding a visitng dancer from Paris. In the context of the story, she must have visited during World War I. (Yes, a lot of people crossed through enemy lines to visit ballet companies then, didn't they?) Also, Danina is just plopped into ballet school eh? No audition, no nothing right? Other readers have already pointed out that this ballerina must be good, keeping up her star status when she is sick all the time. If you want a good laugh or if you can read without thinking, pick up this book. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Surely this book wasn't written by an adult??? Horrible waste of time, waste of money, and waste of a supposedly talented writer!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"A great love story with exciting characters and with ambitions worth noting. Kept me wanting more even with tears shed."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Granny Dan by Danielle Steel ia and enchanting story of a Russian ballerina named Danina. Through her whole life she had danced and she became a Prema. As the story goes on Danina met a wonderful man named Nikola, and although he was married they planned to move away together. However Nikolai was the doctor of the Imperial Family, and she was a great friend of the family also. Nikaoli and Danina became very close, and eventually admitted to the fact that they truly loved each other. Granny Dan is a wonderful book that once you begin reading you can not put it down. This is a really great book for all people, however it is more appealing to women because Steel makes every girl's dream of being a beautiful and graceful ballerina a reality. Throughout the whole story Danielle Steel expresses many different emotions. This is a wonderful book and I highly recomend it. So in conclusion happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"\\"Granny Dan\\" is a story of a ballet dancer from Russia. This book takes place a long time ago, just prior and during Russia's first revolution.It's a love story between a dedicated ballet dancer and a man who never knew how love could be. Together they taught each other about love and the bonds love can have.This was a nice story, although somewhat normal in it's development. This is a typical love story, probably told many different times, just with different characters in different circumstances.What I liked about it, though, was the characters. They intrigued me as well as the life they lead in a time and place I know little about.This story, I think, has more underlining meaning though. The question is, do we really know anything about the elders in our lives? What kind of person they were before they were our grandparents or parents? And if we don't, then why not learn about them before it's too late?This was a heartwarming and somber story. But I loved it!!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Once upon a time, I read every book that Danielle Steel put out, plus saw all the movies. Over time, they all began to run together with similar themes and predictable plots. I gave this book a chance, and found it to be better than most, but still quite predictable. Towards the end, it just seemed like she wanted to get it to print, and stopped putting the effort into it. Great detail in the first few chapters, but it loses motivation. I wish she had included more historic facts into the novel. Then it really could have been a learning lesson."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel by Danielle Steel. The characters were moving and the story was enchanting. The history made it all the more memorable."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Although this wasn't one of Danielle Steel's greatest works, (I actually got through this one without crying) it was an enjoyable story that held my attention until I finished it."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I enjoyed the plot and time period of this book. I was upset that the ending was given away at the beginning. It kind of makes you feel hopeless and not want to finish it. I was pretty sick of Dan being 'sick'. She made a lot of DUMB choices as well as Nicolai. So, they made their bed and had to lie in it. Literally, at times it seems. I would have enjoyed the book more if the overall tone of the book wasn't so depressing."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I picked this book up because I really enjoyed Zoya and wanted to read about that subject again. I was disappointed in this book though. It seemed as if nothing was happening in this book. It was a slow read for me and was very difficult to finish."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This romance novel explored the life of its central character \\"Danina\\" through the eyes of her granddaughter at the introduction. Rather than being romantic and mysterious, I felt in many ways this was tragic and all too common an occurrence. A young woman supposedly close to her grandmother while she was a child and a young adult, inherits through her grandmother's death, a package that contains toe shoes and love letters. This young woman through translation of these letters discovers how little she truly knew about her grandmother. Amazing. I see this happen every day, with children that have parents and grandparents from a foreign country or just a distant past. The children are bored or embarrassed about their \\"different\\" relatives and miss the richness of their own past. What is defined as a close relationship here, in many cultures would pass as a mere acquaintance. The author was wise to point out the opportunities missed.The story goes on the about the grandmother's past life. This as most romance novels do, go on about a very attractive petite incredibly graceful child with a widower father and four sons placing his only daughter in a ballet boarding school. She of course flourishes and is the favorite of the head mistress. I'm being particularly heavy on the adjectives here because I believe the author outdid herself in this regard.Danina (the grandmother) the young adult at the peak of her popularity becomes acquainted with the Czar's family and enchants them all. Unfortunately, at some point in time she catches the flu and becomes gravely ill and is taken under the wing of the Czar's family. There she is nursed to recovery. She becomes involved with a member of the Czar's staff and her head mistress is understandable shaken about her commitment to ballet. Unfortunately, this is no simple relationship, this man is married and would lose his position and she her position as a prima ballerina with the scandal.The story goes on about this struggle and some of the upheavals in Russia at that time as well as Danina and her lover's involvement. Without giving the rest of the story away, the book goes on to unfold how she ends up in Vermont and her life there.As far as romance novels go, this was typical with the obsession on how unusually attractive, graceful and every over the top gushing adjective there could be to describe the central character. This girl was ultra devoted, right as rain and always trying to do the right thing. The lover was dashing powerful and true. The story was interesting in the setting, ballet, pre-revolution Russia and the situation that unfolded.However, just for once, I would like a romance novel, to have an average looking central character, maybe a little pudgy, with bad skin and with the usual questions about what the right thing to do is, versus just knowing it. I would like the love interest to be not quite so perfect, maybe skinny with a big nose and less than perfect employment history. It would be nice if they would find each other and work through day to day struggles to pay the bills and define their relationship. You know the important stuff, like who does the dishes and who cooks. You would see them, dealing with corporate America, or maybe Central South America or today's Korea, with all the issues that play in a normal relationship: Money, Sex, Commitment, Long term planning and Communication. But, Hey, if they did that it wouldn't be a Romance novel."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"To the author of Granny Dan.....Who are you and what have you done with Danielle Steele? This one rates right down there with The Klone and I.......stinkers. I didn't think I'd ever get through it, kept waiting for something to happen."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I was really disappointed afer reading this book, it sounded so good reading the dust cover. I found this story of Danina and her lover Nikoli lacking in many areas. First this novel starts out with Danina's Grandaughter discovering letters of her recently departed Grandmother. The book then begins telling Danina's story, although a letter format is not used here. Also this story is lacking a lot of historical detailing that would have given more substance to the storyline. Finally there are too many personal details missing here. I found it really hard to want these people to be together, there was no chemistry between them. The book abruptly stops and leaves out details about what happens to Danina after arriving in the United States. I personally wondered why Danina's daughter was descibed in the manner she was. This book would have been great if it had been about 300 pages longer."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I am not a romance junkie nor a regular Steel reader. I bought this book in the hopes of finding something different and exciting, a glimpse into the world of Russian ballet training, along with a tender love story. I got neither.To me this was an outline of what could have been a great book with only a few of the scenes developed.Much of the action, including Danina's entire training at the ballet, was summarized in a few narrative paragraphs.I never formed a bond with any of the characters nor could I &quot;feel&quot; for them because they never became real to me. Except for a few scenes most of the integral conversation and description that should have lead to that bond was merely reported on not shown in detail.Ms. Steel forgot the elemental rule of fiction writing, don't tell, show. Make each scene come alive with detail and conversation.It's a shame because this COULD have been a great book if it had been written correctly."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"When I began reading Granny Dan, I was captivated. It was wonderful reading about the events that happened in Danina's life and the things that happened between she and Nikolai. However, I was very disappointed at the ending. I feel Danielle Steel needed to add at least one more chapter to the book. The content of the book lifted me higher and higher, then at the end, I felt as though I was dropped. I believe there could have been a much better way to end Granny Dan."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I have read the other reviews for this book, and completely, in my opinion, disagree with some of the reviews. For one, the story took me right in and I was so into it that I never noticed any grammatical errors or if Ms. Steel was repeating information. As for myself, I do not read a &quot;fictional&quot; book to check for accuracy in historical events or to check for errors, if I did, I would be an editor or publisher. In my opinion, the story was wonderfully told, with descriptions of places and events so extensive, I could &quot;see&quot; the entire story. I also felt that it is a story that points out how we (the younger generation) view our own elders. We do tend to think of them as someone who has always been old, when, in fact, they have been our age, they were young before they were old and, they have their own great stories to tell if we will take the time to listen. They had dreams and loves and heartbreaks just as we have and this story really shows that. I say, &quot;Way to go Ms. Steel, another great novel! &quot;"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I have been reading Danielle Steel for many years and I truly enjoyed this book.

It's incredible! A beautiful romance with so much more. Yes, you will cry, but this book leaves you with something when you are done. There was heartache and tears, but also a deep soulful love that is just beautiful. I'm not good with words. I just want to say how truly wonderful this book is. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"When I picked up &quot;Granny Dan&quot; I was a bit skeptical. Historical romance is not my forte, but this book is good.

Although it may be simplistic, &quot;Granny Dan&quot;, is a short, sweet, provocative story.Using the backdrop of Czarist Russia allowed me to see the glitter, the gold &amp; the powers of the rich. As well as the trials &amp; tribulations of those held in the grip of their powers. Steele always describes so well I feel as if I am &quot;there&quot;.

I had a tough time with this one, it was differnt from the rest and didn't keep my interest as easily. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I HAVE BEEN READING DANIELLE STEELE FOR YEARS AND THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK.

I, unfortunately, heard the audio version, and I found it difficult to keep track of the many illnesses of the protagonist, who had - let me see - severe influenza, morning sickness, a bad abortion, and a banged-up foot. She was constantly in bed - either ill or with her adle-brained doctor-lover, who was stupid enough to go to Siberia to the Czar instead of running away to exotic Vermont with Granny Dan.

She offers us nothing new with this....it actually seems as though she whipped this one out in a weekend by just thinking of the basic plot of previous books like Zoya. Very shallow, even babyish writing here, no depth, and really no interest overall, and certainly no surprises....why is it that nearly every Steel book has a heroine who is pregnant and has no clue about it? Her shorter books are her worst...although, I remain a fan of her storytelling talents......they just weren't evident in this one!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

It's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This was my fourth or fifth Danielle Steel book to read and I think I loved this book much more than the rest. This story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. It stayed in my mind for 3 days straight after I first read it. The characters and their love story was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever read. He was married to an unloving wife which made him miserable and she was a young girl who didn't know what love was...until they met. I give this book 5 stars because it kept me interested and wanting more when I finsihed it. It isn't one of Danielle Steel's longer books, but it has a very compacted and dramatic story. When you start the book, it is told from the point of view of a character who is not named, but she is the pivitol beginning and ending of this story. It is the middle of the book that focuses on the two main characters who make up the love story."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This is one of the best Danielle Steel's novels... It tells the story of a young girl, Danina Petroskova, who became a Russian ballerina at a very young age. Her mother died and her father and brothers, who were involved in the Russian army during the time of the Czar, could not take care of her. She was brought to a ballet school and because she showed great talent, she was allowed to stay and train. The story tells of her hard work and dedication to become the prima ballerina.Danina faced many obstacles during her youth and young adulthood in the ballet. She suffered with a nearly fatal illness that left her weak and lifeless. At the same time she began a forbidden romance with her married physician... As the romance blossomed, her life began to change and she wanted more than just the discipline and recognition of the ballet.The story is fascinating and is told in a flashback format after Danina's granddaughter in America found her love letters and ballet slippers in the closet. Granny Dan, now an elderly grandmother, had an exciting and passionate life that was hard to believe and her granddaughter uncovered it after she passed away."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I just finished reading the book Granny Dan by Danielle Steel. Her stories are an easy read but you will find it difficult to put it down.If you enjoy reading love stories and the life of the ballet then I highly recommend that you read this book. This book deals with the lives of a young woman and a man and their love for each other. It's also about the life in the ballet during the war in 1902.All in all, Granny Dan was a memorizing love story that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Granny Dan was a very touching book, and I found to be much better than Danielle Steel's other books. This is a necessity for every young person to read; it shows you that even though &quot;Granny Dan&quot; was elderly, she wasn't always that way. This is a common misconception w/ the young people of today. I really enjoyed the book, especially since I'm a dancer as well. It was a wonderful story, that I truly enjoyed! Pick up the book today!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Danina, the main character, is a remarkable ballerina. She makes everybody around her joyful because of her glowing personality.This is an excellent book because it is about a girl named Danina whose mother died when she was young and her father and brothers and to go away and leave for the war, therefore, her father sent her to a ballet school. She was petrified of going and didn't want to leave her father.She grows up at the ballet loving her teacher, Madame Markova, like her own mother. Happy she went there in the first place, she grew to love everybody. She worked hard and was the best ballerina there, when unexpectedly, she fell ill one day and could not dance. The Czarina sent one of her doctors to help her because they were close friends with Danina, and Danina soon left with them to a small cottage that they had. Everybody thought she wasn't going to live, but they were all wrong. She soon fell in love with her doctor, who in return, felt the same way for her as he says in the book, \\"'Danina...I Love you...' and without waiting for an answer from her, he bent gently toward her and kissed her.\\" Danina was scared because he was married, had children, and told him that they shouldn't. Later on as she gets better, she ends up having an affair with her doctor, and she soon returns to the school rejoining Madame Markova. Madame Markova soon suspects that she is in love and it is going to ruin her. Madame Markova had always told her that she should never let a man get in the way of her dancing because it would ruin her life, and she wouldn't give it her all. When she had found about Danina in love, she says, \\"You are a whore now, like the others, the little cheap ones who dance and play, and to whom it means nothing. You should be dancing on the streets in Paris, not here at the Maryinsky. You don't belong here. I always told you, you cannot be like them if you truly want this. You must choose, Danina.\\" Danina loves dancing, because that was all she knew ever since she was a young girl to the age of 19, but she is also terribly in love with her doctor. She can't decide which she wants more.To find out her decision, then you should read Granny Dan by Danielle Steel because I think it is a great book."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This book was the first book that I've ever read by Danielle Steel, and that was over six months ago. Since then, I have gotten hooked on her historical fiction books, but yet continue to come back to this one, Granny Dan.It's a wonderful story that takes place in Russia. But most of all, this story revolves around the idea that you never really know someone in your family, like your grandparents, etc.. You never know who they were when they were younger, what they were like, what experiences they had, and you are left wondering these things when they are gone. And if only you knew their story, about their life, you could learn so much. That's what happens in this book.Granny Dan was the grandmother who loved to rollerskate, who loved to sing, but yet she never talked about her past. When she passes away, a box is delivered to her granddaughter, and inside are the things that reveal Granny Dan's past: toe shoes, a locket, and a stack of letters... all these things unlock the mystery to Granny Dan's past. Things that her granddaughter never knew.This book takes place in Russia in 1902. It talks about the Czar and Czarina, and life in the imperial court. Danielle Steel's charecters are so life like and real, that you're sure to get swept up in this magical story that takes you to another place (Russia, 1902), another life (the Imperial court and the ballet). It's a story that makes you wonder that if only you knew about the past behind your own relatives, you could learn so much."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I have never read anything by Danielle Steel and picked this up to see what the fuss was all about. I found it very disappointing and full of holes. Also, she repeats everything so many times that I feel she was trying to fill the pages. It's not a particularly long book as it is. If you were to take out the repetitions, it would probably go about a quarter of its length. I may one day read something else by DS, but this definitely has turned me off reading further right now."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This is a book that you just want to keep on reading. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"It's a wonderful story and very well written. It would have been better if the book was longer so it could go into more details (character-wise and historical) about the last months."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This was a wonderfully crafted love story with simple, readable writing. It was a feel-good story with likable characters and, though there is little detail, there seems to be nothing lacking. This was the first book of Danielle Steel's I had read, and picked it up initially for the Degas painting on the cover. After I read the dust jacket, I wanted to read the book because it was about a ballerina, but the only reason I bought it was because it was on sale at B. Dalton for six dollars. Well, I'm glad I did buy it, and I do not agree with some of the reviews I've read. This was a good story."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This was the first Danielle Steel book I read, and I just loved it to tears. This is also the first book I've ever cried over. Anyone whose a sucker for love, romance, and tragical events will love this book as much as I did. The fairy tale events of this book could make everyone dream a little bit again."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Other readers have given this book a lower score but I would have to disagree. Steel's novels can be redundant and shallow at times. With story filled characters that come across to me as unrealistic. Much to my surprise this book is different. Heart wrenching without being heavy, this story seems to have it all: loss, love, relationships with family/friends, sacrifice, starting over again, etc. One of Steel's best...."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"The story is enjoyable. If you like to read about dancers, you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Granny Dan, by Danielle Steel is an incredible story of a young girl's life. The story follows Danina Petroskova, a ballerina, through life's hard times while she is growing up. Danina's entire world revolves around ballet and succeeding in it. However, the story is told from the granddaughter of Danina's point of view. She never understood that her grandmother had led such a fascinating life until after her death when she found a hidden box of her belongings. Now she learned about Danina's romantic affair with her doctor at age nineteen, she learned of the hard times she faced when she was moved away during the war so her brothers and father could fight in the war. The granddaughter is also informed about how hard her grandmother was pushed to do well in ballet. Madame Markova, her mother-like figure, pressured her all day long. At nineteen, she was stricken with influenza, which nearly killed her. Recovering from her illness and heartbreak, Danina perseveres and is determined throughout the book.Danielle Steele did an excellent job writing this novel. She told the reader a lot of background and information that was needed to make the story fit. Although at times the story may seemed to go by too slow, there were underlying meanings in the text and it was an easy book to understand. The setting in the book first started in Russia while the Revolution was going on, and then to the Maryinski Ballet where she lived during her childhood, and lastly in Vermont with her lover. The story was a true romance novel with an interesting twist; it is not often the main character falls madly in love with her doctor who is already married with children.Granny Dan is a book that can make you cry, laugh, and feel like you are in the story yourself. Steele did a very good job at changing the emotions and tone throughout the story. The story of Danina told by her granddaughter also reveals that often times younger generations have no idea what their parents and grandparents had to deal with. There are opportunities missed because they may feel \\"embarrassed\\" by their elders when really they are missing out on fascinating lifetimes. Although at times it may have seemed to go by slow, the story unfolded nicely into a great book."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Granny Dan is an awesome book! The way Danielle Steel describes Danina's life and story is remarkably detailed and intriguing. Anyone who has a passion for the ballet will love this book. Even if you aren't really a fan, you might still find Granny Dan to be a fantastic read. I am a dancer myself, and I flew through it. I read it in one sitting and once begun, couldn't stop until it was finished."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I'm not at all a fan of Danielle Steel's writings but I actually found Granny Dan to be a good novel.Now let's face it--Steel is known for her soap operalike writing as a drama queen but Granny dan was a beautifully written novel about the life of a ballerina in Germany during WWI.I would recommend Granny Dan BUT if you're lookinf for a new favorite author-- look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Granny Dan was one of Danielle Steel's finest books. The truth behind the life of her grandmother and the fiction to create a story that keeps your heart in the book the whole time. It begins by the start of a young girls life, Danina Petroskova, at the ballet. The ballet is her home, she grew up with the atomospere of dance. As she grows older she takes on a devastating illness. Her illness makes her realize there is another life not of the ballet, and how to love someone. Her mother-like figure, Madame Markova, tries desperately to keep Danina under her wing and stay with the ballet. Danina has to make a crucial decision for her future life. This book really kept me in the circle. I could very much relate, I used to dance and I thought it was everything in my life. As i grew older my interests changed as did Danina's. At a point in the middle, Danielle Steel had lost the detailed focus she had used in the beginning but it gained strength in the end. Her usage of words and the entire story plot was wonderful and exciting. If your looking for a book to keep your interest of the ballet and a heart warming story of love than this is it."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I read all of the reviews on Amazon before buying and they weren't to good, but I bought the book anyway because the story sounded good. I am glad I wen't ahead and bought. If I didn't I would have missed one of the most perfectly satisfying novels I have ever read. After reading Zoya I wanted a book that has more about the Russian Revolution. I thought that Danielle Steel would never write one again on the subject. Yet she did. People said this book was just like Zoya, but it wasn't. It had it's own unique qualities. There never was a dull moment in the book. It had action, love, sadness, and remembrance all rapped together amongst the pages. I think so many people who gave this book a bad review didn't sit and pay attention to the beautiful words. Words that made a sweet lullabuy in my head. This novel is utter perfection in my opinion. SO many people seemed to offend people who liked this novel. How could someone not. I am now not going to listen to the reviews shared on Amazon but decide myself if I would like the book. This book is a perfect book to read again and again. It is one to save and cherish. While reading the book remember to savor each and every satisfying word and let the story create the symphony in your mind, just like it created in mine. From an avid reader buy Granny Dan."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Dancing on the coattails of history, Danielle Steele's Granny Dan is a sweeping saga based on the true life story of her grandmother.As a young woman, Granny Dan was the leading young ballerina in pre-communist Russia, which in that society, would have been similar to being Julia Roberts in our own country today. She charms the Russian royal family, especially the czar's young son, and is admitted into their inner circle.Torn between the disciplined life of a dancer in a strict ballet school and the fairy tale-like existance at the czar's summer home, the young woman must make painful choices.An illness causes her to become very close to her physician, a man in a loveless marriage and they fall deeply in love. So much so that Steel's grandmother keeps all his letters with her until she dies. Steel bases her book on the letters, which she had translated.Marrying her grandmother's real-life story with her masterful fiction-writing techniques, Steel presents a powerful tale of star-crossed lovers, strong characters who are real and believable. Their passion for each other is played out against the backdrop of history.We are given a taste of what life in czarist Russia was like, and it is as if we travel back in time with the characters. With the coming of the communist revolution, their world is forever lost.This ultimately tragic story is a haunting one, which will stay with you long after you've read the last page."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I am not a romance fan. However, I've read a few of Danielle Steel's books and enjoyed them. Granny Dan was no exception. The story took place in the midst of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Danina Petroskova was brought to the Maryinksi Ballet when she was seven years old, while her family fought in the war. Frightened at first, she learned to love her new home and became obsessed with being a prima ballerina. At nineteen, she was stricken with the influenza virus which almost killed her. She survived it and was sent to live with the Czar and his family to recuperate. There, she falls in love with her doctor, Nikolai Obrajensky, who is married with children. That, their stations in life, and the war-ravaged world threaten to destroy their relationship.The reason I give this book a four star review? Because two thirds of the way into it, the story becomes repetitive. Should I leave and go with this man or should I stay with the ballet? I tore through the pages thinking, &quot;Let's get on with it, already!&quot;But then the story takes a climatic turn, forcing her into action. Granny Dan is a story within a story. The prologue involves Danina's granddaughter, who discovers her love letters in a box, among other things. The epilogue deals with what happened to Nikolai, her father and remaining brother, her mentor. Some of you might want to keep a box of kleenex handy."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I love Danielle Steel's books, at least I used to. I couldn't wait until a new one came out. Lately, I have been very disappointed in her style.Granny Dan was a very slow moving, boring book. I forced myself to read it, as I finish a book when I start one. It was hard to do so though.What happened to the Danielle Steel of a few years back? We want her back!!!I've told others not to waste their time reading this book. Hopefully Danielle will pick up her writing like she used to do. Is she trying to publish too many books, and therefore, not putting her &quot;all&quot; into them individually?Sorry Danielle, but this one is very lacking.A dissappointed fan...."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I have read some of the customer reviews and I totally disagree with most of them. This is my first Danielle Steele book, and I think it is excellent! I thought it was sad about Nikolai and Danina, but I think that DS did a good job in portraying the emotions of the characters. I felt what the characters felt. Unfortunately I finished the book at school so I couldn't cry over it, but I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an insightful, quick read."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This is another book that DS manages to put us &quot;there&quot;.

The story she weaves really kept my attention and interest in the characters. I like Danielle Steel, but at times her books can seem &quot;alike&quot;. Granny Dan was different. It took different twists. I loved the Geneological aspect. Made me wonder what my grandparents were like as young people."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"A real love story. An innocent love. Firstly, Danina's love for her career in the world of ballet and secondly, the unconditional love she shares with her doctor/lover, a married man who not only adores her, but who lives in a loveless relationship married to a woman who never loved him, but would also not permit someone else to love him or ever allow him to love another. A love story that is so warm that it gives you hope. Not to forget the high price ones pays for such unconditional love which has no boundaries."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"The rush to keep up with her tradition of putting out 2-3 books a year has definitely caught up with Ms. Steel. I'm a long-time fan, and have read almost everything she has written.

I hope this isn't indicative of future books."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I loved how this book just flowed along, you never had to question it. It is a great summer vacation book, light reading I finished in a day. I just couldn't put it down! It had so many interesting twists and turns, you really ached for the herione, Danina. She turned out to be stronger because of her tragic past, and it is an intriguing past which unravels in this great book."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I found this book to be a pleasant, short read.

I read it in one day, because I couldn't put it down. The story line was not shocking, but entertaining none the less."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I have read most of Danielle Steel's books and I always enjoy them but this is by far one of the best she has written so far.It is a story of love found and fought for during a very difficult historical period in Russia. I laughed with Danina, smiled with each character, felt the excitement, and cried through each tragedy as if I was there. It brought to my mind so many thoughts of my own grandparents and others that have come before. It was riveting!"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"In keeping with her tendency to cover familiar territory, DS has gone back to the Russian Revolution with &quot;Granny Dan&quot;, a book that leaves you wondering ... well, why? First, the whole concept of &quot;Granny Dan&quot; -- the beloved grandmother who has died at the beginning of the book having all this secret back history -- is absurd. And as she has done before, by starting the novel by telling you how it's going to end up, DS manages to completely remove any chance at intrigue. I don't have any problem with Ms. Steel covering historical events in her novels -- for example, I love her &quot;Titanic&quot; depiction in &quot;No Greater Love&quot; -- but I do get increasingly irritated with her characters being relatives of the Romanov family or other such royalty. How about writing about a completely unknown, totally unconnected person who lived during the Revolution? That might show some real insight into the struggle -- and I'm sure you could get a love story in there too."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"This was an o.k. book. In my opinion, it was not better than ZOYA which had more detail. I was so excited when it first came out. I was somewhat disappointed when I finished it. Do not buy it.

I haven't read a good one from her in years.

Shortly after that performance, Danina becomes deathly ill. Her mentor Madame Markova worries over Danina as if she was her own daughter. One of the Czar's doctors, Nikolai Obrajinsky, tries to help cure Danina, but can do little for his patient. He prays for divine intervention. A miracle occurs and Danina begins to recover.While she recuperates, the Czarina invites her to stay at one of their estates. While residing there, Nikolai begins to visit her. Though they are happy together, he remains tied to an unhappy marriage that has produced two children and little else. Will he give up on his current life, including his children, for her? In turn, will she give up her beloved ballet for him?Danielle Steel is renowned for her powerful romance novels, many of which have been turned into movies. Her latest historical romance, GRANNY DAN, may be the great author's best work to date. The novel will remind readers of Dr. Zhivago as pre Revolutionary Russia comes to life due to the fabulous descriptive abilities of Ms. Steele. Danina, Nikolai, and Madame Makova are brilliantly developed characters who bring the world of the Czar to life. Ms. Steele is going obtain much critical acclaim as well as another best seller for the great GRANNY DAN.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I have to say that I did NOT like this book. The potential for a good book was there, and the plot could have been wonderful, but it was poorly structured and sloppily written. Sometimes I think Danielle Steele just rushes through her books and spits out whatever she can so she can get on with the next book. And what's worse, she has a large enough fan base that she can do it and still make bunches of money. Anyway, this book did not touch me on a personal level and i don't really think it deservs all the rave reveiws that I read. There wasn't enough elaboration or dialouge to really touch your heart and at the end, i was really glad it was over. The story was too farfetched and the end just kinda left you hanging like the author had gotten bored with it. So, the only good thing i have to say about this book is that i got it from the library."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"I decided to try reading a D.S. book simply because she's a big name and has bestsellers. What an awful book for me to start out with. Danina wasn't an interesting character in the least. The male character, the doctor whose name I can't remember because I couldn't find it in my heart to even finish the book, completely took advantage of Danina. I believe the doctor was about 38 years old and Danina was about 18 (?). It's been some time since I've read this book, about a year and a half, so I might be a few years off with the age difference, but I remember it being close to 20 years. I found the age difference repulsive, but also the book was very slow. I don't recommend this book at all. I have heard that some of her older books are good reads so I'm going to try them instead."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"While I've been a longtime fan and enjoyed this book, it seems Ms. Steel's books have come to be redundant within themselves as of late. We need more books like &quot;Star&quot;, where the writer doesn't dwell on character feelings so much, and focuses more on events and setting. If she gets out of her rut, I'll be first in line to buy her next book."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"Not quite as bad as &quot;The Klone and I,&quot; which I couldn't even read the whole way through, &quot;Granny Dan&quot; is nonetheless weak and rambling. The story meanders around slowly, and the same phrases are repeated over and over and OVER again to the point of annoying redundancy. I kept wanting to scream &quot;Okay, all right already! You've said it a million times!&quot; Also I have trouble relating to someone who is in love with a man old enough to be her father, although I might feel differently if the author could have made it believable. It's a good thing he's a doctor, though, because Danina is constantly ill. If it's not one thing, it's another. In the two years they are together, she takes four months to recover from the flu (I've known cancer victims undergoing chemotherapy who were not in such bad shape); is rushed to the hospital bleeding profusely from a botched abortion; and is once again rushed to the hospital with a broken ankle. Danina is not a sympathetic character but just a pathetic one, as is her doctor-lover."},{"Title":"Granny Dan","review":"DS is losing her touch.

Definately recommended."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"Modern Chess Openings does a good job of giving you a general idea of the most important lines in all of the major openings. It will not teach you the ideas behind the openings (get Understanding the Openings or Winning Chess Traps to learn ideas and tactics in the openings) but it will give you a general idea of what is considered to be up to date theory.I don't know of a better single volume book to be used as a reference on openings. So as far as I am concerned, and want to express my opinion here, this is a good book for a dedicated chess player to get."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"There are two rivals to MCO-14 that I can think of offhand: Nunn's Chess Openings and the Small Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (pub. by Chess Informant). I think both have the edge over MCO-14. Though NCO has two hundred pages less than MCO, it provides more coverage, simply because there's less white space. Three GMs and one FM (Burgess) have pooled their efforts; all have have a reputation as good chess authors. The lines given are absolutely main-line. In fact, whenever I'm learning a new opening, NCO is my first port of call, since it gives the crucial, essential lines. The lines have all been computer checked. I don't think MCO can compare. The Small Encyclopedia also gives only essential lines and is not bad, but in my humble opinion is probably not as good as NCO.For those wanting words, might I suggest Kallai's 'Basic Chess Openings' and 'More Basic Chess Openings'?The only advantage of MCO is that the abundance of white space makes the text more readable. NCO has attempted to pack the maximum amount of information in its 500+ pages"},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"Presumably you already know that DeFirmian and his co-authors are talented, well respected, International Grandmasters expert in their particular openings, and that MCO-14 is filled with cutting edge, theoretically current opening analysis. I'm no grandmaster, master, or even candidate master, so I will not dare to evaluate any particular line for holes in their variations. I will say that for a class A player, like myself, or below, MCO-14 is far more useful, than say, Nunn's Chess Openings for the following reasons: 1) More (and better) verbal descriptions of the openings. The one page intros make one want to take out the chessboard and play an opening. 2) Prose evaluations of the variations explaining why a player is better or worse, or why a position is unclear. NCO uses only symbols. Which is good if you're some hotshot international player who lives or dies on some obscure variation of the Sicilian Defence, or whatever. 3) Easier look up of openings. MCO-14 organizes the openings under double king pawn, double queen pawn, etc. and gives the inital moves. This is very helpful if you don't know an opening's name or ECO code (or even what an ECO code is). NCO arranges by opening name, and in ECO order (although there is an index, none that great, in the back). They are both great books but for the above reasons, you might consider MCO-14 first."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"An amazing reference book for the openings. It shows you all the best lines for almost every single opening. It also has a nice table of contents in the beginning which points you to the opening you need within seconds. Covers all the main variations of the openings too. If you have never seen a reference book, it's just pages and pages of tables with little footnotes explaining certain moves and other possible variations. All the moves are also computer checked for accuracy. What you do with one of these books is play a game like you normally would, and then after the game you check your opening by the way the book went. Then you mentally record your mistakes and you will greatly improve. This can also teach you a new opening, if you like memorizing lines of play. But I would not recommend that. This is the best one volume openings reference book. What I like about this one is that it gives a little background information for all the major openings. This is great for someone who just likes to know everything about chess, especially the opening they use. By the way, its also in algebraic notation, which is a plus. Although all this good stuff comes at a price. This will help however, as long as you use it right.PROS:Many Openings and VariationsGood BindingNice History of OpeningsAlgebraic NotationCONS:Won't Really Teach You OpeningsTakes Some Time to Learn How to Read the TablesJust A Reference BookSummary: The best One-Volume openings reference book you can buy, well if you can afford it."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"OK, ok, ok. You have read my review of &quot;Nunn's Chess Openings.&quot; (IF not, you should probably go and read that first, because much of what I said there --- especially in the &quot;warning&quot; part; applies here.) Then why I am bothering to review or recommend this book?The answer is simple. I teach chess for a living. And my students give me a great deal of very valuable feedback. For instance I recently attended the FL State Chess Championships in Orlando. Many people came up to me and said stuff like, &quot;I have read your reviews on Amazon and ...&quot;The bottom line? The average player is probably below a 1600 (rating) and has a very limited knowledge of chess. Their libraries are often small, 5-10 books - if that many. And they need as much help as possible.If you are like me and want &quot;Just the Facts,&quot; (&amp; like Sgt. Friday!); then you will probably prefer Nunn's book. But do you have my background in chess theory? Do you bring a USCF Life-Master's understanding of the game with you? Do you have over 20 years of tournament experience? Have you played 50,000 games of chess on the Internet? No? Then you may want to get GM DeFirmian's book. (Please understand ... this is NOT a put-down or an ego trip!! I am just trying to communicate - in the strongest possible terms - what the majority of the players I have spoken to and what my students' have communicated to me.)And if you like an occaisional explanation, and would like the lines summarized, (and even a recommendation once in a while); then MCO is the book for you. (If you live near a good size bookstore, check them both out and decide for yourself!)My friend GM DeFirmian (and an excellent team of writers), has probably spent more time on this book than 10 or 20 authors have spent on their works. Walter Korn has always done a competent job of assisting in the editing. The nice thing about MCO-14, as compared to the last edition of MCO; is that 75-90% of the games quoted are now of the latest vintage. (The last two editions of MCO are also sitting on my bookshelf.)I have spent many, many hours in this book. I am working on a Grunfeld Repertoire (ChessBase format) based primarily on MC0-14. It is no exagerration when I say I have spent close to 150 hours using this book. (Maybe a lot more!!) My students and contacts in chess prefer it over NCO like 3 to 1.I still like NCO better!! But this is also a good book. (If not for just a few typo's and some other minor ticks, I would have given it 5 stars. But good or bad - I am a perfectionist. And bear in mind, I have found a couple of errors [but a lot fewer!] in NCO too!) If you are around 1800, you would probably be happier - in the long run - with &quot;Nunn's Chess Opening's.&quot; But if you are relatively inexperienced and fall into the category of 1650 or less; then honestly you might do better with MCO. Or buy both and compare!!Also, one more piece of advice. If you are going to use this book a lot, do what I did and order the Hard-Back version!! For the few dollars more, you get a book that should stand up to years of heavy use."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"When I look over most reviews, I bet most readers have a hard time. Most of the bad reviews on a book like this are written by a beginner that expected something different. This is a reference book, it isn't meant to be the same as a book based on explanation. You could study 40 pages of this book and play a game that didn't utilize any of what you had learned but then after you could look up what happened and see some other ideas. Consider the case where you get beat over and over by someone that seems to always get an opening edge and this book becomes invaluable in finding ways to improve your play against them.I don't claim to be a chess god, I'm about 1800 uscf and have 25 or so books. Even a 1200 can gain some help from this type of book but they have to understand that you read reference books a bit different than others. You don't go cover to cover, line by line. Most players should do the first 6-10 moves (or usually until they pick something different) and look for the immediate few possibilities...then move to something different. The problem is that so many try to brute force read it and get discouraged because they can't memorize 30 moves for every opening. MCO was my 2nd chess book and I know I made that mistake at first. You don't read an encyclopedia the same way as Stephen King. The key to determining if you need this at your chess level is to decide are you willing to analyze your own games, which first means writing them down. If you are then this is great for you, if you aren't then you probably want something more guaged to assimilation through explanation.So yes, Reassess Your Chess or something is going to be a much better book for players to read for a month. But MCO or NCO is going to be a book you keep going back to and putting back down. Impressive is the total number of lines these types of books cover. This would have to be lessened to provide things like detailed explanations of why white is better. Also when you play through a line and find something not listed, you explore it on your own. More times than not you will see that the book is better for you but when it isn't...that means your opponent has a harder time looking it up. For the most part though the knowledge in this book is meant as a means to gradually improve. You study other books, consult this to pick an opening and then play games. As you record and analyze your games you will have a need to figure out when you left book in a game and see if it was wise to do so. It might be they did, you did or even your computer did...but this book can help in researching the problem. A more serious player might have a fairly developed repertoire but consults the book when he is scoring badly against a certain opening to brush up on or simply add variety. It doesn't give you the answer, it gives you a direction. Like most reference books it isn't what knowledge the book contains but how the reader utilizes it. Also when possible I advise getting the hardcover version.In the end if you need this type of reference book, it should do a good job. I've looked at NCO and MCO and they are both similar. MCO does seem to have a little more explanation but NCO gets a lot of respect from good players. NCO might have an edge on accuracy with MCO having the edge on a bit better explanation. Personally I would like to see a version like either that added 50 more pages of overview analysis, like maybe blitz openings or point to different openings with a similar character to help develop a system. I think this would make the book more accessible to more players just because it would cover GM level as well as the casual player, but many would consider this cluttering for a seperate type of book. The streamlined form of the book is why it is a great reference book after all."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"More is not necessarily better - if you feel that your level of chess expertise requires that you have every plausible variation &quot;packed&quot; into one volume - go with Nunn's Chess Openings. Having more &quot;white space&quot; does not make MC0-14 a less serious work - just one with different priorities. The GMs who co-wrote MC0-14 did a thorough job - AND included words! I find it a valuable middlegame guide when MCO-14 evaluates a variation with text (&quot;White is slightly better due to the two bishops and active pieces&quot;) rather than simply NCO's brief +/=. Masters and above need no verbal evaluations, the rest of us (I'm only rated 1820 U.S.C.F. myself) need more help in the clinches."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"This is pretty much the quintessential reference guide for chess openings - it has been called the chess \\"bible\\" by many players. Any serious chess player needs a good openings reference book in their library for reference purposes. But remember this book is an overview of EVERY opening so it doesn't spend too much time on each opening for that you need to buy individual books on individual openings. But this book starts each chapter/opening with a brief overview of the opening, it's history, the main ideas of the opening and the sub-variations. Then it list columns of variations that you can memorize (good luck!) or play through to get a feel for the main ideas in the opening. And lets face it, if you make mistakes in the opening you will likely feel them the entire game so surviving the opening is important! I wouldn't bother with this book if you are rated below say 1500, it would be a waste of your study time."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"This is a good book for a reference and has helped me find the right opening for me.

You also - again, occasionally - get whole games to analyze.But it is not free from errors, in fact ... it would be unrealistic to expect to see a work this large contain no errors at all.Some sections leave out move pairs, repeat moves, or have a line that I simply cannot follow.And some things - - - a good editor should have caught. For example on page 242-243, there is a {general} discussion of the Sicilian. Then the author directs you to the individual sections for further guidance. But they left something out.Unless you enjoy thumbing endlessly through the book, you should probably make a note of the following on page # 243 ...{Section} One, The Najdorf Sicilian begins on page # 244.{Section} Two, The Dragon Variation, begins on page # 267.{Section} Three, Scheveningen - this begins on page # 287.{Section} Four, Systems with ...e6: begins on page # 300.{Section} Five, The Classical Sicilian, begins on page # 317.{Section} Six (#6), Sveshnikov and Kalishnikov Sicilians, (...Nc6 &amp; early ...e5); begins on page # 336.{Section} Seven, Non-Open Sicilians; this begins on page # 344.Of course my copy is a hard-back ... if yours is a paper-back - - - the page numbering might be different.

For most intermediate players, this would be a better buy than a book on a specific opening.How in the world do I objectively analyze this book? There are two ways to study this book: 1) Examine lines you know 2) Examine lines you don't know.As an example of 1), the line 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6 6.Bd3 cxd4 7.cxd4 Bd7 8.O-O Nxd4 9.Nxd4 Qxd4 10.Nc3 is only included as a footnote in this edition. (In the 13th edition, it was a main line.) 6. Bd3 is no longer considered a main move; 6. Be2 and 6.a3 are.As for 2), this can be done by playing any game from a recent tournament, and seeing what your opening book says about it. (An interesting excerise by itself.) In this regard, I find that NCO has more ideas than MCO. This may be expected as NCO has more information crammed into fewer pages. (The layout of MCO is easier on the eye than the layout of NCO.)If I had to buy only one book, I would buy MCO, despite its lack of depth as compared to NCO, due to its more verbose descriptions and less cluttered layout."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"Contrary to one of the reviews, this book does _not_ give every possible move for various openings; prior editions never have. I obviously use it as a reference source, and the little that I have read is irritating due to the typos. Page 504, column 4 of the Albin Counter Gambit gives 4.Nf3Nf3. It is impossible for two pieces to occupy the same square at the same time; Black's move should have read 4...Nc6. On the same page, footnote (f) has move 11. as&quot;Fr2&quot; There is no piece that begins with &quot;F&quot; and there's no square designated &quot;r2.&quot; The proofreader must have been alseep or nonexistent before that page was printed.

The binding is not so good either. After I found out what this book is really about I used it very little and still it's falling apart.

I made the mistake of buying this book thinking it will teach me openings, but for someone at my level it's just useless.

This is [I think] impossible. The book itself could be a digital computer chess engine book reference, and not sold as a book itself. Even the free chess engines, provide more or less the same things cpncerning the book openings.The second reason for disapprove is that this book has just plain opening moves, without covering any ideas about middlegame play, besides the one page introduction at every chapter.My third and last reason for disapproval is that i got tired by the way lines are presented, [ok this is really personal issue], but I got really tired trying to learn a long line.I guess the excuse is that you can't fit all the stuff I wanted in a single book, but then why to buy this one?Oh and by the way some lines are not covered extensively [ at the english game for example many (main?) lines are missing :-( ]So my advise for everyone thinking to buy an all in one book for openings is NO WAY! Choose some openings you want to play and buy a specific book for this opening. Maybe I would buy an all in one book IF 1) had many diagrams 2)had instructions and ideas for middlegame play 3)had a better schema/presentations 4)Covered larger portions of chess openings theory. All of the above are conflicting with the idea all in one book so I find it rather difficult to buy one ;-)This is 100% my free and personal opinion.

If you are hoping to learn openings from MCO, I fear you will be disappointed. While there are some very broad descriptions of openings, they do not have the detail needed to understand the book.If you have the idea of learning openings by rote, I think you are making a mistake, and should concentrate on the ideas of the openings, and perhaps purchase Chris Ward's Improve your opening play and Reubin Fine's The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings.That said, I find MCO to be a very thorough reference. If you lost a game due to a poor opening, you can look the opening up in MCO, see where you went wrong and what the primary acceptable moves are.With the caveots mentioned above, I think this is an excellent reference book."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"I just ordered this book because it is a great book for almost any chess player but maybe more for the serious player.

It worked for me right from the first game I used it as a reference. I am now able to get past the opening phase of a game vs strong opponents (ie. rated 2000+) in pretty good shape but lose it in the middle or endgame. Now I can start working on my middle game so I can one day compete with the strong players/computers. I have been trying to find a book with this info for some time so if your stuck on trying to improve your opening play you need this book to get you over the top.

This book isn't much more useful than that to anyone rated less than 1500.) If you don't know how to evaluate positions, how to take advantage of imbalances, etc., this book will not help you at all.

It is kept up to date by teams of experts with an important focus on games and lines used in recent tournament play.MCO is, however, just a survey of what's out there. Back in the days before chess databases with millions of games were widely (indeed *freely*) available, MCO was on of the critical references on every serious chess player's shelf. I loved seeing chess players poring over their tattered MCO, each book individualized with hundreds of personal annotations from the player's own experience.Sad to say, I think those days are over. MCO, and other surveys, are simply obsolete. Here's what MCO does not do:* MCO does not offer much insight into the kinds of middle games a player should expect from a given line or variation. A good specialized opening book will do this.* MCO does not offer the very best full-game examples for a given opening. A good specialized book will generally do this, and players can find their own using freely available chess database software (or the commercial stuff).* MCO does not offer depth in any given opening. It can't. It's a survey of *all* openings. If you are new to tournament play, and are hoping to build a repertoire of strong openings, you will exhaust MCO's resources on a given line in just a week or two. If you are an expert or better, you already know that MCO is not the resource for you.Conclusion: unless you are genuinely interested in achieving a broad-but-shallow knowledge of all possible chess openings, there are better tools for getting strong at opening strategy. My guess is that 19 out of 20 people who buy MCO will make less use of it than any other chess book they own."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"I have just purchased this book, and found out that it is the best opening encyclopedia ever.

The edition I have is the 12th one, by Walter Korn. It is divided into four chapters: King Pawn Opening, Queen Pawn Opening, Indian Defense and Flank Opening.The King Pawn chapter has all known openings but the most covered are the three about Ruy Lopez, French and Sicilian. Even the less known Two Knight Defense also gave me much trouble when my opponents use it. This book is helpful when I need to come back and study. And how about the Evan Gambit where Kasparov used successfully against some GMs? About the Queen Pawn Openings, if we recall 32 out of 34 games in the famous Alekhine-Capablanca match used it. Then Botvinnik used Dutch and Slav; Kasparov, Catalan; Fischer, Benoni; etc. They are all here. The Indian Defense is a derivative from the Queen Pawn Opening, however it evolves so much and becomes so important that it starts another category. The last section is for any openings where White does not start with either King or Queen Pawn. And the English and Bird are Sicilian and Dutch with one extra move in hand. And the Reti's can transpose to almost anything.This book is important for who wants to prepare for tournaments. It is a collective effort of many contributors. If I could understand and memorize 10% of all the important lines in the book, I would be in good shape for any tournament.I looked in Borders/Amazon site for where to insert this review, for my edition is 12th. edition. Here I only found Walter Korn, editions: 9th, 11th, and 13th. Now, that's really odds [;-)]. So I chose to put this review here. Either I use to my 12th edition or something about the 14th ed. by De Firmian, but his book does not look as impressive as Korn 12th edition.

That is why you see these 14 year old GMs who have been breast fed on them. Computers are simply more efficient as a learning tool, but there are a handful of very useful books. MCO is one of them.While it may not have as much information as NCO it is a much easier read and contains enough information about most openings. Specialists will be encouraged to do their own opening research which, unfortunately, is now linked to the middle and even endgame.Now for the bad. This book has the worst binding of any I have ever come across. My copy fell apart after the first four months and I have a friend who had to get his binded. Considering the cost of this book the publisher certainly took a short cut here and I am convinced that it will cost them much business in the future, as now players have access to databases. I would rather pay extra money to have a more permanent binding.Secondly, with the information wave flooding the chess arena since the advent of computers, much of the information in this book needs updating. In the old days MCO was released every decade, but now a new version is desperately needed every 4-5 years.I'll end by stating that pound-for-pound and dollar-for-dollar, MCO is excellent value.

I beleive that back then these books were edited by Walter Korn. I found MCO a good way to look up any opening that a chess opponent surprised me with in tournament play. When I got into correspondence chess the later editions of MCO helped me get through openings that I did not know. I also found that as each new edition came out some of the older, less popular, lines were removed from the book. Therefore, I recommend that you keep all editons of MCO that you have in order to keep these lesser known lines at your finger tips.If you have access to a database of chess games then this book may not be that valuable to you.

Meanwhile, irregular openings receive small coverage. If you would like to prepare yourselves for a tournament, you need another book that covers a specific opening in depth. In conclusion, I think MCO is good for a survey of openings and give you important variations in a given opening. Apart from the desire to explore the openings universe, I bought this book to prepare for tournaments. To give an example, before reading MCO I played the Sicilian counterattack as Black (with e6 and Bb4 pinning white N on c3). The author says this line contain some tactical points for Black but is bad if White knows what to do. After many games of this line as Black, I agree with him. You can use this book to evaluate whether your chosen variations are strong enough in competitive play. In conclusion, I think MCO serve its purpose as a comprehensive one volume reference work, a book that can give you a lead to some openings or some variations which you have not played or discovered before. For example, over my more than 20 years of playing chess, I just discovered that the Latvian Gambit (1.e4 e5 2 Nf3 f5) is not only playable but often leads to a very exciting game. The opening should receive more attention.My experience tells me the other side of openings which perhaps no book has ever touched upon it. Many players I played with avoid playing along any line of opening especially among casual games. These out-of-the-book openings may not look strong but some are quite hard to refute. The difference is that 'book' openings often involves pawn push to the fourth rank (1e4 1d4 1c4 1f4 for white and the fifth rank for black. One player who is lower rating than me played 1.f3 and with some elaborate system after that: he developed KN on h3 and then f2. At first I think his opening system was bad but I found it hard to crack his position (actually I lost the game). Therefore, despite many centuries of opening studies, this unexplored side of the openings at least is better than it looks. Among the less played openings (e.g. 1.b4), many are better than its reputation. So I think a book like MCO is not complete without this coverage, though this kind of openings is hard to classify and analyze as the established ones."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"This is a great book! I just got it yesterday and have looked at the main lines of most of the openings and it is very descriptive. It took me a little bit to figure out the tables but after I got that sorted through it was very easy. I have been looking for a good openings book for a while and now I have one."},{"Title":"Modern Chess Openings: MCO-14 (McKay Chess Library)","review":"The MCO series is not for the faint-hearted. First and foremost, it's NOT for reading, it's a reference. It's also a gigantic tome, exhaustive, and brutally dense in material. It is, however, absolutely essential for someone who asks: &quot;What's wrong with that move?&quot; MCO-14 analyzes every possible move from every possible line of every possible opening to give the reader a way to track down any possible mistake anyone has ever made. DO NOT buy this book if you haven't played much chess. DO NOT buy it if your chess is poor and you're looking for improvement. However, if you've reached the point of asking &quot;Why?&quot; when reviewing a game, if your chess is strong and you want to make it stronger, MCO-14 is absolutely essential."},{"Title":"Facilitation Skills: The ASTD Trainer's Sourcebook","review":"I gave this book only 3 stars, not because of any lack of quaility. The content is not new. But the format and usability is worth 5 stars. This is a very functional book if you're involved in organizational training. This book has several diferent modules to use in short or long-term training. If you work in organization training -- this is a must buy. Very functional!"},{"Title":"Facilitation Skills: The ASTD Trainer's Sourcebook","review":"I always buy these books because they make my life easier. Just do some adjustments and customization and you have a good working presentation."},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"This book is incredibly uplifting in spirit! When you look at it, the pictures soothe your soul. You truly want to be in the picture. I had heard this about Thomas Kinkade's work. The true bonus for me with this book is the writing. It is as clear and true and inviting as the artwork depicted on its pages. Mr. Kinkade gently and beautifully reminds us to contemplate and practice what is truly most important in our lives. Each time I open this book to read and view its pages, it brings literal tears to my eyes, there is that much Truth and beauty in it which caresses my being. My gratitude and blessings go to the creators of this true work of art."},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"Thomas Kincade makes you believe that &quot;simpler times&quot; are within reach for each of us! Not a vision from the past, but an attainable goal even in our frenetic modern world!Kincade gives practical suggestions from lessons he's learned in his own life: setting priorities, learning to say 'no', slowing down, creating your own private retreat.And throughout Kincade's heart-warming narrative, flows a peaceful, gentle stream of his artwork. Paintings that capture the essence of nature &amp; draw you into its beauty.Withdraw to your own private retreat &amp; take &quot;Simpler Times&quot; with you!"},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"At the college I work at I teach classes on personal development and stress management through hardiness training. Recently, in class, we were discussing whether it is possible to experience joy when in the midst of challenges and trials. Through beautiful artwork and inspired narrative in &quot;Simpler Times,&quot; Mr. Kinkade demonstrates how one can experience peace and joy in a hectic world. The book was like food for my soul. Thank you."},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"When my work days start to overwhelm me, glancing at a few pages from this work of art help me to gain perspective again. Mr. Kincaids paintings alone have the ability to sooth and calm, but his text adds even more to his message of joy, hope, and learning to find your own &quot;retreat&quot; to reflect and slow your life down a bit. I love this book."},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"I bought this book 2 years ago, as a reward for myself.

It really helps you to prioritize the things in your life, which leads to a more peaceful relaxed atmosphere for you and those around you. It really helped me to put things in perspective. Just the pictures alone create a peacefulness; add that to the text, and you have got one awesome book."},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"I first saw Tomas Kinkades work at a gallery in Port Jefferson Long Island. They were set in special rooms with typical individual lights for each piece. There were dimmer switches in the room that we were able to control the lighting, enhancing the effects. The paintings actually came alive with light as I dimmed the house lights. I'm not in the position to afford his work but with this book I'm at least able to enjoy the experience. The book is so good you can see the brush strokes and even the bumps in the canvas It's not as good as the real thing although it dose tease your senses. So sit back. Put on some soothing music and live the experience."},{"Title":"Simpler Times","review":"I savored every moment of this book, taking time to enjoy the writings and the pictures as the theme is..

In this book are his best paintings and artwork brought together, accompanied by heartfelt quotes and scriptures. This book is a true classic."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"My son received this book over a year ago at age two. He LOVES it. We have to read at least one Curious George story every night. All eight stories are wonderful Curious George tales (Takes a Train, Visits a Toy Store, and the Dump Truck, Goes Camping, and the Birthday Surprise, Goes to a Costume Party, Visits the Library, in the Big City). To address one CG reviewer's concern, neither George nor the Man with the Yellow Hat smoke in any of these stories. This collection has held up well with the usage and is a great price. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"I was disappointed with this book; I ordered it online without realizing that it was a recent publication, illustrated 'in the style of' H.A. Rey. Both the illustrations and the stories lack the charm of the originals."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"Our daughter LOVES Curious George- we already had the \\"Complete Adventures of Curious George\\" when we decided to buy the \\"Treasury\\".We were aware that the \\"Treasury\\" was not by the original authors, but rather \\"inspired\\" by their work, and were a bit hesitant to purchase it, particularly based on a few less than flattering comments on the [..] website- some found it formulaic, drawings uninspired, etc.We were pleased with our purchase. Our daughter loves this book, currently more than \\"Adventures\\", likely because she hasn't completely memorized it!The illustrations are good (if perhaps subtly different than H.A. Rey's), the plot lines entertaining (maybe stories about a mischievous monkey can't help but be to be a bit formulaic). These books were written in the 1990s and 2000s, so it's not surprising that no one smokes in them and minorities are more visible (without, in our opinion, the books striving to be overwhelmingly politically correct).But reading \\"Curious George Visits the Big City\\", obviously set in New York, saddened us. There's a scene where George is looking out over the city, and what look to be the World Trade Center is visible in the distance. This particular book was written in the 90s, based on a view that today's children will never see.If your children liked the original George book, they will enjoy this one too. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"This is a fairly cynical effort by a publisher trying to wring every last penny out of the creation of a deceased author. Although the book cover says in prominent lettering, \\"Margaret and H.A. Rey\\", do not be fooled. They had nothing to do with this. Rather, every story is \\"in the style of\\" Margaret and H.A. Rey. It's pretty obvious the stories were churned out as quickly as possible, as they all have basically the same plot, same resolution. Do a little research, get the original Curious George books by the Reys, and you'll be much happier."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"While these stories are classic George and what you expect, the kindle format is anything but readable. The book is basically scanned and re-subtitled under the illustrations. It does not work well at all on my reader and is a waste of money. It is absolutely frustrating to try and read this in a dim room at night time, I'll stick to Thomas the Train books, they seemed to be actually made for an e-reader. Until I see a review that states these are improved for the e-book format I'll pass."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"My son loves Curious George TV show, so I purchased this book.

Curious George continues to live and will live forever! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my nephew (5 years old), and I had it shipped directly to him. When I went to visit and saw the book , I was really surprised at how thick it was. When I was a kid, I always thought there weren't enough Curious George stories. I wish I'd had this book back then. Since he's only had it for a few months, I haven't seen any of the book binding issues that other reviewers have mentioned. I definitely think that, for the price, it's a great buy."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"My two year old loves this book- she asks me or her dad to read her a story from it almost every night.

He points to the pictures and he will sit in our lap and allow us to read him the stories from the book. He will also grab the book and sit on the floor or chair and flip through the book looking at the pictures or pretends that he is reading the book. It's so adorable!! This has to be his favorite book out of the many we have for him. I don't know how many times we've read this book to him, but he still loves it. I'm glad we have this book for him and we will be buying the other Curious George books for him."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"We love George so this was a must.

The price is great for a hardback book."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"This book is a very nice hard cover book with eight stories inside. The stories are just the right length for us to read with a two-year-old. My son likes this book a lot and has been even looking through it on his own. I have given this book as a gift and would do it again, since it appears that you spent more than you did.:)"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"First, I must admit that I was never a Curious George fan as a child. I remember the other children taking the books from the library -- they loved them -- but I just didn't see what was so great.When my daughter was born, a friend of ours bought this book as a present. I didn't read it to her until she was about 2, and that was only at her request. She is now 4 and she still loves the stories, and believe it or not, they've grown on me.Many people have complained that these stories and illustrations are not the originals, but that's just fine with me. It didn't take away from my daughter's enjoyment either.If you are an avid fan of the original Curious George, this may not be for you; however, I enjoy it and think the stories are perfect for bedtime. And, it's not like my opinion counts the most -- my daughter's does -- and she is asking for more books like this one!"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"This was a great book.

I bought this book, cause i wanted to build his interest in reading with one of his fav. tv characters.

When It arrived we were surprised at how nice the book is. Very well made with a nice hard cover and really nice heavy stock pages. Our oldest loves the curious George movies and ipad games and this turned out to be a great addition. We read it to him before naps and bed time and he gets all caught up in the stories as we go. After two stories, roughly ten minutes to twelve minutes worth, he is ready to go nighty-night. Very happy we got it."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"This book is perfect for my little family. We all love Curious George!

If you love Curious George, you will enjoy this."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"While my 3 year old son doesn't notice, the choice you have to use this on an iPad is to pick from reading the text or to have the picture big enough to notice the details, because you can't do both without constantly having to zoom in and out. Overall, if I had known it was this complicated, I wouldn't have bought it."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"This has been one of my son's favorite books as a 2 and 3 year old. We have to read from it nearly every night. It gives a nice variety of Curious George stories. Easy to read, great illustrations."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"As another reviewer noted, this is a poorly laid out ebook - just scans of the pages (including the text) with the text added again below them. It's painful. Kid's books have a lot of potential on color devices like the fire, but weak attempts like this are not worth the download."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"These stories do not have the same charm or creative plot lines as those 'originals'. The majority are stories of a monkey running off and doing things he shouldn't but in the end is praised for it. Yawn. My toddlers like the illustrations but some stories could use a lot more creativity and down-to-earthness (if that is possible with a book about a monkey). There seem to be no realistic consequences and the man in the yellow hat is always taking George somewhere and then letting him run off. Predictable.Not a horrible read but certainly not the classics. I wish I had just checked it out from the library."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"I bought this book for my niece when she was five or six years old. One thing I noticed when I actually sat down and read it to her is that the stories are a bit tamer than the originals. You won't see Curious George crying on a city sidewalk with a crumpled up leg, and you certainly won't see him getting high on ether at the hospital. But that's okay. My niece loved the book, and that's what matters most."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"This is a delightful, space-saving collection of CG stories. It has held up very well, and my 2 year old son has learned so many words from it. He adores this book, and it's NOT over his head at all. I think for MOST children it's not appropriate until age 3 unless your child is extremely verbal. Why by 8 or 10 separate books when you can have them all together in one book. It's great for toting to waiting room at the Dr. office, etc. I throw it in my bag and it holds his attention whenever we have to wait for longer periods of time."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Curious George","review":"My daughter just recently started to become interested in the Curious George books. She can't get enought of them. I really like it when books come out into a collection like this. You have many books all in one.

These books most kids grew up with and they're still around to delight further generations. This collection contains several of the books in the series and it nicely bound into a collection of favorites. The pages are thick and should stand up to years of reading again and again as we do with these types of books. I'm sure the dust jacket will most likely be discarded but it too is thick and should also hold up well over the years.I was a bit letdown to see the lack of Curious George Goes To The Hospital but that's about the only downside to this collection. Who doesn't love George sniffing ether?

According to the author information, Gordon Rottman was a Special Forces weapons specialist in the 5th SF Group in Vietnam in 1969-1970. At the time of publication in 1987, he was a civilian contract Special Operations Intelligence Specialist at the Army Joint Readiness Center, Fort Chaffee, AK and, as a Reserve MSG, the Operations Sergeant of the Opposing Forces Group of the 75th Maneuver Area Command. Ron Volstad did the illustrations and, not to take anything away from the text, the illustrations alone are worth the price of the book.The book contains 10 pages of full color plates with 55 artist renderings depicting uniforms and equipment of Ranger and LRRP units of all eras from 1942 to 1987. The artist is very faithful in his capturing of the uniforms worn, including insignia, and the equipment carried by particular individuals. The artists illustrations are described in the last section of the book. Each picture has the specific items of clothing and equipment identified including the year of introduction of the item and its supply system designation (e.g. &quot;M1 rifle with M7A1 grenade launcher and M15 grenade sight&quot;). In addition to the artist pictures, the book includes numerous photographs of the Ranger and LRRP units and individuals from the years covered.The section on the Korean War period is not as complete as it could be. However, the author did not have Bob Black's book &quot;Rangers in Korea&quot; (published in 1989) for reference. As it is, the book covers the Korean War period in about four pages and is a good summary.The author begins by relating the problems of Ranger organizations in all the eras covered in the book. &quot;Their missions and capabilities have often been misunderstood, and their personnel misused. Ranger organization and missions have changed with each war, which has led to an additional problem - lack of continuity between the wars.&quot; The author also illuminates the difference between Ranger-type organizations and LRRP units.

Although some may quibble with a few of the attributions the book is a masterpiece. If one book could be credited as elevating the Caucasian rug from an unuappreicated (and at that time underpriced) art form to the status that it enjoys today it is this one. It is generously filled with color photographs. The art of photographing rugs has come along way since this book was put in print and some might be disappointed that the photos are not more crisp but I cannot emphasize enough that this is an important work and an incredibly beautiful book.The main focus of the book is 19th century Caucasian village rugs although it contains some discussion of earlier rugs of the Caucasus.Highly recommended.Jim Connell \\"Hallstatt Prince\\""},{"Title":"Migraine and Other Headaches (American Academy of Neurology Press Quality of Life Guide Series)","review":"Up-to-date, comprehensive, full of information, yet totally readable.

Sometimes the main characters have been of the mischievous type like Squirrel Nutkin, Hunca Munca or Samuel Whiskers. Well, in \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\", the main characters, Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, are two thoroughly disagreeable and unpleasant creatures. Mr. Tod has foxy whiskers and is of a wandering habit. The other animals either cannot bear him or are frightened of him. He has several different houses but is rarely found home. However, his houses are not always empty, for Tommy Brock is prone to moving in without Mr. Tod's permission. Tommy Brock is a fat, waddling badger with a horrible grinning face and a habit of digging things up. One day he pays a call to old Mr. Bouncer, Benjamin Bunny's father. Today he is in charge of looking after the young, while Benjamin and his wife Flopsy are out. Unfortunately after conversing with the badger and smoking a very strong cabbage leaf cigar, the old rabbit falls asleep and Tommy Brock makes off with the rabbit babies. When Benjamin and Flopsy return they find their young gone and Benjamin at once goes out to track down Tommy Brock. Along the way he enlists the help of his brother-in-law, Peter Rabbit. Of course, they are not the only ones after the terrible badger. It seems that yet again he has set up house in one of Mr. Tod's residences and the fox, who is not in the best of moods this day, discovers the badger asleep in his bed... There are not many color pictures in this book, but there are many black and white illustrations in the style of woodcuts. Of course the story is extremely interesting and suspensful. \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\" is a longer story than some of the author's other tales. Also, there is more narration than dialogue and the language is early twentieth century, so this story may be more suitable for older children. Parents and children should not pass up this lesser known tale by a very talented storyteller and illustrator."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF MR TOD","review":"My 7 year old loved this book.

Liturgical studies)","review":"Over the past 40 years, there has been a revival within the Catholic Church recognizing the biblical roots of the liturgy. Figures such as Scott Hahn have led the way for Catholics - and non-Catholics - to understand the deep Scriptural basis for the various liturgies within the Church, especially the Mass. Fr. Jean Danielou was the forerunner of this revival, and this book, \\"The Bible and the Liturgy\\" is one of the foundational stones of this edifice.Fr. Danielou, who was made a Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1969, was a major figure in the \\"resourcement\\" movement in the Catholic Church leading to Vatican II. This movement desired to \\"return to the sources\\" for understanding all aspects of Catholic theology including the liturgy; the sources they wished to return to were primarily the writings of Scripture and the Church Fathers. This book, originally written in 1956, is a splendid fruit of this movement, as Fr. Danielou explores the biblical roots of the liturgy as understood by the Church Fathers. The book primarily focuses on the three sacraments of initiation: baptism, confirmation, and the Eucharist, and follows the development of the rites of these three sacraments, from their biblical roots to their practice in the first five centuries of Christianity. But where this book really shines is in its analysis of the Sabbath and its successor, the Lord's Day. Fr. Danielou explores the various images the Fathers used to explain the transfer of the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday, the \\"Eighth Day.\\" This is theology that is often forgotten today, but it has a very practical application in helping Christians today to set aside a day for the worship of the Lord.This is a book that can be read again and again to much profit. The University of Notre Dame Press is to be commended for republishing this classic of liturgical theology."},{"Title":"The Bible and the liturgy (University of Notre Dame.

It's about a family from Germany that settles in Texas, during its formative days. Their young boy, Johann, is soon re-christened \\"Johnny Texas\\" in recognition of the family's new life.One day, Dad comes home with a slave, a young black man named Tobias who seems eternally morose, because they need help on their farm. Soon, Dad decides to give Tobias his freedom; thereafter, Tobias is a much happier fellow. He puts his bill of sale (proof of freedom) in a leather pouch and wears it around his neck.Later, Dad gets involved in the war for Texas independence, and readers are treated to a BRIEF recap of the Battle of San Jacinto, wherein Sam Houston routed the Mexican army and captured Santa Anna.This is a good book for seven-year-old Texans because they will, if they have been properly educated, recognize much of the Texas history -- plus, it's a simple story organized into chapters, and serves as an excellent introduction to the world of literature.I recommend this book to kids throughout the United States. Texas history is more interesting than the history of any other state, and everyone should learn about it."},{"Title":"Johnny Texas (DELL YEARLING BOOK)","review":"When I was 6 years old in 1950, my grandmother took me to a special event at the local drug store in Yorktown, Texas, which as of three years ago still had the original iron hitching posts along the sidewalk. The event was the local release of Johnny Texas, and Carol Hoff was signing copies of her new book. Recently my sister came across my copy and sent it to me. It's pretty ragged by now, having been read several times by me and having subsequently gone through a number of other kids. But I was overjoyed to find that it still has the same magic it had 50 years ago. I recently reviewed a number of books for a school curriculum program, and it was daunting to find just how muddy, disjointed and confused--both emotionally and philosophically--most \\"modern\\" juvenile fiction has become. All these years of pop psychology and political correctness have taken their toll. We no longer tell stories kids are expected to enjoy; we indoctrinate future citizens of the gray zone. Johnny Texas is about real people confronting and handling challenges in a real world. Their motivations are recognizable, their moral choices unambiguous. The history is fascinating. More importantly, real kids in or out of Texas will still find this one heck of a great story.

We were taught in school that Major Ridge was a traitor; a man who deserved to be hated by the Cherokee people. Wilkinson's historical novel gives us a close up view of the events and tragic occurences that led up to the Trail of Tears. The only people who would find this novel boring are most likely the people who don't care about this great injustice to the Cherokees.

It made an indelible imprint on my heart."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"As a historian, I appreciate appropriate use of historical information, and especially of pertinent documents, as a part of historical fiction. Therefore, it is a pleasure for me to enthusiastically recommend David Marion Wilkinson's Oblivion's Alter, a story of the circumstances leading up to the historically important Cherokee Trail of Tears.The story is told mainly from the perspective of one Cherokee Chief, Kah-numg-da-tla-geb, whose name is anglicized as The Man who walked the Mountaintops or Ridge Walker. Ridge was known and respected as one of the most eloquent and persuasive chiefs. He was selected to lead several missions to Washington D.C. seeking enforcement of a treaty signed by George Washington ceding a large tract of land to the Cherokee Nation. That original treaty covered lands in parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Ridge negotiated with several U. S. Presidents including Thomas Jefferson and finally Andrew Jackson.When the Principle Cherokee Chief John Ross refused to see, as Ridge did, that the U. S. Government under President Jackson would force the Cherokee to migrate west, Ridge signed the New Echota Treaty, selling Cherokee lands to the U. S. Government for five million dollars. This was a treasonous act in the view of many full-blooded tribe members. Setting a brilliant hook in the first chapter of Oblivion's Alter, Wilkinson sets the stage for the score settling that Ridge knows he must ultimately endure, and then carefully steps the reader through Ridge's life and the events leading up to the tragic ending thus foretold. It is good history as well as wonderful fiction, a marvelous page turner."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"I am not a novel reader but I could not put it down.

They just keep getting better--or else I just appreciate them more the more I read them. To me the author has the gift of empathy. Whether he sees the world through the eyes of an oil field worker imported from India, a Mexican at war with Texas, an Indian chief, the President of the United States or anyone of the other main or supporting characters who people his tales, I always get the feeling that it is the character speaking and not the author through the character. Big difference. Normally, as I read I go behind the character and see the author busily typing away replete with his/her biases. Not so with the books of David Marion Wilkinson. I get to see several sides of an issue, and I can honestly say that even the meanest character that he dreams up has a human side which does not allow me to dismiss him/her out of hand. In Oblivion's Altar, I see and understand President Jackson's position as well as that of the several chiefs who attempt to get the U.S. government to abide by law--peacefully and with war. It was so unavoidably sad--and just plain unavoidable--what happened to the Cherokee and the other tribes of Native Americans. When you read any of DMW's stories you get [taken] into the complexities of the human spirit and you rejoice, pity, get angry at and grieve with every character at some point or other. It's great to know the author is a young man with several great books in him--and I plan to read every one."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"This is historical fiction at its best, educating while entertaining. &quot;Oblivion's Altar&quot; is set in the early to mid 1800's and focuses on the great Cherokee chieftain whose anglocized name as Ridge. Like many Native American of his time he straddled the worlds and cultures of his ancestors and the burgeoning white world. It was inevitably a no-win situation but the courage and wisdom of Ridge (symbolic of many other Natives) are inspirational.Wilkinson's accomplishments are the blending of historical research with his own fertile imagination.Historical events are thus rendered in an excellent narrative rather than as dry scholarship. Characters are fused with realism, rather than seeming contrivances.History is often the story of how ordinary people deal with extraordinary circumstances. &quot;Oblivion's Altar&quot; is an excellent example of this."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"These historical figures will haunt your memory for weeks after you have finished this book.

If he is to succeed, he must reach not only those with an interest in the history of which he writes, but those to whom plot and character development are everything and history an afterthought. David Wilkinson has succeeded on a grand scale with his book. This superbly crafted story of the great Cherokee Nation and the forces which drove its people from their lands in the southeast along the Trail of Tears to Oklahoma brings to life one of the more sordid and shameful episodes in American History. Much has been written of this tragedy, but we seldom see the faces of its victims. Wilkinson has brought them to life for us in a way that is both fascinating and unforgettable.

Although the events depicted in the book occurred some 200 years ago, they could easily be translated to recent times. I have met and seen the Kah-nung-da-tla-geb's of modern times. Proud people who are struggling to teach their children the old ways, yet realizing, as difficult it is to accept, that assimilation is a necessity to survive, to succeed. The Cherokee &quot;exceeded all the Americans' expectations&quot; in this regard and learned to use the &quot;civilized ways&quot; to their advantage, and it wasn't enough. In my little community, many have become educated, successful and assimilated, and, like long ago, it isn't enough. We are still considered &quot;a thorn in their heel&quot;. This is a must read book for anyone who has struggled and dispaired, and who has loved family, heritage and country. I am not a &quot;reader&quot; but, like his previous book, NOT BETWEEN BROTHERS, I couldn't put it down. To David Marion Wilkinson, thanks - with respect and admiration."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"David Marion Wilkinson wrote there a fine and fascinating novel on the policy of the US vis-&agrave;-vis the Cherokee people and fate. As soon as the Cherokee were confronted to the presence of the whites they realized that their living circumstances had changed. To face the upsurging wave of arriving whites, they had to make choices. They chose integration at first and decided to invest in the education of their children, the development their agriculture on the white pattern, the wide openong of their clans to whites through marriages producing an important proportion of mixed-bloods who will imprint a strong change in their society. So they invented an alphabet for their language and started a printed newspaper, that still exists. They also translated the Bible into Cherokee and adopted a constitution modelled on that of the US, which more or less imposed a regression in the role of women in their society. They tried to build a nation that was integratable in US society because organized on similar lines, though retaining their language, their culture, many of their traditions (including their religion based on a single god, the Great Provider) and their defiant spirit. But there came a time when the choice imposed by the whites was between two evils : to move west on the basis of a more or less negotiated treaty or to wait for the coming of US soldiers and other militia to be dislodged from their land. The choice was between an attachment to the people and their survival or to the country, the territory, the land of their ancestors. Some leaders did not understand that the second choice was just unrealistic in front of white decisions and will. Some understood the dead-end in which they were and negociated their departure. This led to the peaceful and rather orderly departure of some, behind Chief Ridge and later on to the painful and cruel forced departure of the others with bayonets in their backs on the Trail of Tears. The novel explores the deep motivations of the leaders of each faction and their contradictions. The depicting of such complex convictions and feelings is done in such details that the book becomes a saga or even an epic of Cherokee survival in the wake of their Trail of Tears. The book also tries to bring to light the personality and rich heritage of Chief Ridge, a man who has been completely evacuated from Cherokee memory. It is thus a call for his rehabilitation nearly two centuries later, some kind of reunification of Cherokee purpose in present-day American society.But the best side of the book is the deep inspiration the author found in an extremely careful exploration of Cherokee culture, Cherokee mythology and Cherokee history. His rendering of the Trail of Tears in one of the final chapters is a marvelous evocation of the suffering and yet of the hope of the Cherokee, of the cruelty of the whites and yet of their christian compassion, of the danger of complete extinction of the Cherokee on this trail and yet the fantastic will to survive and to thrive after the ordeal. Never do we have the impression to be in a history book, but always in a human, humane and deeply felt account of events always captured from the point of view of their various actors, including Sharp Knife better known as President Andrew Jackson. And that is the best and worst part of this story : the whites did not try to annihilate the Cherokee essentially out of hatred for the Red Indians, but out of the will to avoid a civil war coming from a possible secession of southern states. And this attempt, which was successful by isolating South Carolina who refused the federal power of Congress, did not avoid the Civil War that was to come thirty years later. The Cherokee were sacrificed for no avail, at the best some respite or delay. That's what appears as most striking about the whites : they are most of the time governed by short term interests and do not see the wider and longer picture. In other words, their desire to impose their civilization, a desire that is always dominant in their way of looking at the world, is here ever present and this is a beautiful lesson in modern politics, because some Americans, often in powerful positions and offices, are still thinking and acting along that line, that we must definitely consider as imperialistic. The novel is thus more modern than we may think at first sight.Everyone who is interested in America and the American project for the world, and the US have a project for the world, has to read this book to get new and invigorating insight in the subject.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan, France"},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"Oblivion's Altar is an amazing true tale of the Cherokee's struggle for land, their strength and their courage. it is a history you have not read before. The men and women depicted come alive and you feel their pride and their exasperation dealing with courts and government. The perspective of the book is not one-sided nor judgmental. It is an excellent read for anyone -- history buffs, readers interested in native american culture or ordinary avid readers like myself. It is a book you won't put down."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"\\"There is a legend among the Ani-yunwi-ya, the People of Kitu&#65533;hwa, as ancient as theBlue Mountains, as the People themselves.&#65533; In a lengthy (time-wise) story (it coversthe period of time from 1776 to 1839), &#65533;Oblivion&#65533;s Altar&#65533; is the story of a greatCherokee chieftain named Kah-nung-da-tla-geh, the Man Who Walks theMountaintops, or Ridge. He is a leader of his tribe who has vision far beyond hisown geographic limitations; he is a man who has determined, through his wisdom,experience, and personal makeup, that his people can be delivered into newfreedoms, that they can co-exist with the white man, if given half a chance. It is theperfidy of man that seems destined to prevent his vision, his dreams.Thus, it comesas no surprise when treaties, agreements, and integrity fail to win the day.Of course, try as hard as they may, justifying the complete subjugation of the nativeAmericans does not come across convincingly by any degree. The argumentspresented by both historians and politicians always ring hollow, now decades anddecades later. Greed, jealousy, hatred, yes, even &#65533;religious convictions&#65533; fueled thishegemonious movement and America is not the better or more proud for it. David Marion Wilkinson&#65533;s book cedes that this is a given, at least by any intelligent reader.It is the understanding of the nature of the beast that he seems to dwell upon.Wilkinson&#65533;s protagonists draw more than sympathy, of course. With painstakingdetail, a thorough presentation, and depth of the entire picture of thisnot-so-glorious picture in America&#65533;s past, the author makes a case that is difficult torefute (most don&#65533;t try to refute it today, of course). But Wilkinson&#65533;s novel is not asoap box oratory on the evils of Manifest Destiny, or even the evils of the white man.This would be too obvious and he transcends the glaring obvious and insteadpresents a remarkable story, a genuine story of an American tragic hero and as atragic hero, Ridge has his tragic flaw. Is it naivet&eacute;? A foolhardy trust of his fellowhuman beings that brings bout his own demise, as Shakespeare might say?Regardless, Kah-nung-da-tla-geh, the Man Who Walks the Mountaintops, comesacross not so much as the martyr for his cause, but as a genuine, sensitive humanbeing, a man with broad shoulders and even broader horizons.The Trail of Tears and the other degrading examples of &#65533;justice&#65533; serve as aconvincing backdrop to the entire picture.But when Ridge sings his own epitaph:(&#65533;Worry not for the Man Who Walks the Mountaintops, my friends. For I am old,my children are grown, and I am truly weary of the cares of this world. Myancestors are waiting for me. I will know what it&#65533;s like to be loved by my peopleagain. I&#65533;m not afraid to die.&#65533;), we are convinced of his own immortality, and moreimportantly the essence of his immortality.Wilkinson&#65533;s style of writing is easy-paced, but the depth and understanding in thispace is remarkable and add to the quality of his prose. Certainly, he seems topossess more than a passing knowledge of the landscape and atmosphere he creates.This author comes across as knowing what he writes about and does so in aconvincing manner. His characters do seem to be more than words on a page (agood example is his portrayal of President Jackson) and it is this illuminatingcharacterization that runs parallel with the story line in a fashion that makes thereader want the book to continue on forever, almost.&#65533;Oblivion&#65533;s Altar&#65533; is a well-written, well-documented novel that belongs on the topshelf of American stories. Mr. Wilkinson, himself the winner of the Spur Award forBest novel of the West, has clearly spent time and energy is creating a voice, notonly for the Cherokee, but for all Americans. This is no ordinarily &#65533;western&#65533;novel--it rings with a true theme of Americana, in its purest sense. It is a book thatis not easily put down, nor forgotten."},{"Title":"Oblivion's Altar:: A Novel of Courage","review":"This book is one of the most exciting novels I have ever read. The action scenes in the book are as good as in a movie. Mr. Wilkinson has out done himself with this spectacular novel. Both the research and in-depth storyline are stunning. I hope that he produces another book like this because i will be the first one to buyit!"},{"Title":"Six Keys to a Deeper Spiritual Life","review":"In her book, The Catholic Challenge, Therese Cirner clearly and concisely lays out six \\"keys\\" to a deeper spiritual life. Cirner acknowledges the wisdom of the spiritual masters who have lent classic wisdom to the topic of living a holy life, but offers this book for those looking to \\"bridge\\" their own spiritual journeys to such classical writers as St. John of the Cross or Teresa of Avila.Cirner's six keys, prayer, Scripture and spiritual reading, the sacraments, community, virtue and forgiveness, are each laid out in a chapter concluding with reflection questions and an inspirational prayer. The book could be used as a small prayer group resource, or would be excellent for individual contemplation and reflection. Additional literary references are recommended for each of the Keys, offering the reader a treasure trove of resources for the challenge of growing a deeper spiritual life."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Sport Riding Techniques by Nick IenatschIenatsch's book can be summarized as a photograph book with some tips on motorcycle riding. It is extremely sparse compared to Hough's Proficient Motorcycling and even Code's Twist of the Wrist series. It wasn't very helpful overall and did not add much value to riding techniques over Hough, Code, or Parks' books. That said, there are lots of useful photographs and diagrams concerning riding techniques.Ienatsch and Park recommend using both brakes to achieve the shortest stopping distances, while Code and Hough emphasize that the front brakes are the only ones necessary to stop properly in a short order. Ienatsch breaks down advanced steering into 4 additional steps, while this is covered more fluidly in any of the other books (Hough, Code, and even Parks). Pivot steering, or weighing the outside footpeg, was described extremely well by Code but isn't as emphasized by the other authors - and Park actually doesn't believe in it.Ienatsch even compared heel-toe downshifting from cars with the rev-matching method on motorcycles, which I particularly enjoyed. I find that a lot of authors try their best to avoid any analogous references to automobiles for whatever reason. It's logical to bring cars into the motorcycle discussion because everyone typically gets their driver's license before their motorcycle endorsement - unless they start at a young age with dirt bikes.I would recommend Hough's Proficient Motorcycling along with Code's Twist of the Wrist 2 to get a good primer on riding techniques. Ienatsch's Sport Riding Techniques is good as an additional reference.Overall: 4/5 stars"},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I can appreciate Nick's lifelong experience, but as an self-described intermediate rider looking to go that extra step, I found this book MILDLY disappointing. Mostly just common sense. There were a few solid tips and guidelines but nothing revolutionary. Maybe my expectations were a bit misguided. \\"Get as much seat time as possible.\\" \\"Work on gently using the brakes and throttle.\\" It just seemed geared more toward a rank beginner. Discussions on traction and lean angle were informative but not enlightening. For less than 20 bucks, it's a worthwhile read. That same amount of time spent riding and improving would be just as helpful."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Being actively involved in motorcycle riding education for over ten years, I like to think I know a few things about riding motorcycles and how to explain how to ride motorcycles. There are a lot of people who can talk about riding, and a lot of people who are great riders, but very few people on this earth have the rare talent to be able to do both. Ienatsch is a masterful writer and rider, two traits that when combined result in a how-to book that does a fantastic job explaining the task of riding without getting too hung up on fringe riding ideas and concepts. In my humble opinion, this is the most concise and best written book of its type and every motorcyclist who wishes to improve their riding ability should have a dog-eared copy of this one on their book shelf."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I loved this book and the technical information it contained.

MUCH better than the Twist of the Wrist series, which is quite taxing and not very rewarding. However, neither this book nor any other can teach you how to drag a knee, slide your rear tire, etc. But it will show you why doing those things on the street is a bad idea.

I currently ride a sportsbike and just got back into riding after 15 years of not riding. The tips in this book were clear and made sense when I got out on the road and tried to execute them.

This author has been instructed by people like Kenny Roberts (wrote forward) and Eddie Lawson. The best of the best. He has some valuable (maybe lifesaving) things to pass on to you. If you've been to numerous high speed riding schools maybe you don't need this book. But the rest of us have allot to learn."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This is the best book out there on developing the skills to safely and proficiently operate a high-performance motorcycle. There are a good many books that one can reference for braking, cornering, shifting, mental preparation, and so on. The distinguishing element in Sport Riding Techniques is taking the concepts and putting them into practice. Ianatsch includes skill-development drills in almost every chapter. The drills simply work.Since the goal of this book is to teach riders techniques for operating their bike at a very high level, it is probably not the best book for beginners. The concepts are the same for beginning and experienced riders alike, but the emphasis on speed makes all the difference. It is not that Ianatsch endorses high speed, win at all cost riding. Quite the contrary, he takes a very responsible position on street speed that all riders should read. However, new riders have unique needs that warrant a slower approach. They should cut their teeth on Proficient Motorcycling by David Hough and take the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's new rider course."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Very good and informative book all motorcyclists should read .

This book is essential for beginner riders. It has great pictures and diagrams but I think I only learned 1 or 2 things from the whole book. \\"Twist of the Wrist\\", get that book if you are looking for theories and ideas to actually put into practice on the motorcycle.

Since reading this book five years ago I still find myself using the concepts to monitor my riding and tweak my technique during road rides. I particularly like the way his book taught me to be more thoughtful about points of traction which has improved my throttle control from apex to corner exit. As someone who has ridden for 29 years, I still feel that I enjoy being a student who can work on technique. As I get older I value the mixture of speed with smooth technique. But the book only works if you actually read it, ride, practice, read more, repeat."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book is a must have for any rider that wants to learn as much as they can about how to ride with confidence and safety. It explains the right way to ride and control your bike a way that is easy to understand but very technical.

Nevertheless, if I could give just one book to my son to read and learn from it would be \\"Sport Riding Techniques.

When I got the book in the mail, I was really impressed with the layout and overall quality of the book. Nice, glossy pages with large pictures of modern sportbikes and easy to read text and captions. However, once I started reading it I noticed that the tips and techniques, while valuable, are really aimed at newer, less experience riders. Subjects are not discussed in the detail I was hoping for and issues like basic suspension set-up or advice on performance modification were not covered at all.I guess I was hoping for a &quot;Twist of the Wrist 2&quot; meets &quot;Total Control...&quot; meets &quot;Sportbike Performance Handbook&quot; type of book. Not even close. Still, I believe this is a very high quality piece of literature that can be enjoyed by both entry level and experienced riders alike."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I am a new rider and my skills improved dramatically with each chapter. This book is an easy and quick read. In fact, its totally engaging.Nick shares his years of experience and demonstrates that safety and speed are not mutually exclusive. By taking his advice to heart, one can learn to feel the relationship that must exist between the rider, the machine and the pavement. Once understood and practiced, you'll be carving up the road as quickly and safely as possible. What a thrill!Experienced riders will appreciate that each chapter ends with a &quot;Lesson's from the Racetrack&quot; section. So the tips and/or refresers make this book a must read for any rider, in my humble opinion.If nothing else, its worth the price for the incredible photos. Enjoy and I'll see you on the coast. :-)"},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I purchased my first motorcycle about two years ago and since then I have spent a lot of time trying to become a safe and fast rider. Having said that, I wish I would have bought this book a year ago; I would be so much further along. I've been riding one time since reading this book and the difference in my riding is astounding. Its amazing what a few adjustments can make. I highly recommend this book for people new to the world of motorcycleing. It can not only teach you the skills necessary to preserve your life, it will make your rides a great deal more fulfilling. Thank you Nick Ienatsch."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I own a variety of sport and general riding technique books. I started with the horribly-written Keith Code books which I thought were the greatest thing since sliced bread when they first came out (because there was nothing else that I could find like them at the time). I have the David Hough books and a smattering of other motorcycle skill-enhancing books by other authors. Nothing compares to \\"Sport Riding Techniques.\\"Nick Ienatsch is a top-notch motorcycle racer, and track-school coach who knows what he is talking about when it comes to technique -but so was Keith Code and his books, while full of sage advice, were pedantic at best. Code's \\"Twist of the Wrist\\" can be literally painful to read. Ienatsch, in addition to being a highly skilled racer, rider, and top instructor at the Freddie Spencer Superbike School, is also a highly skilled writer and moto-journalist who has been writing about motorcycles professionally for decades. Writing for a motorcycle magazine has taught him how to write in an entertaining but down-to-earth manner which makes him the ideal person to write a book detailing just exactly what is going on when a rider has mastered the techniques that not only allow you to go fast on a racetrack, but keep you alive on the street.Ienatsch separates the track from the street in his writing. He plainly tells it like it is that certain techniques are best left to the safety of a track and not for the everyday world of gravel in the corners, wildlife on the road, and cell-phone talking teenagers driving daddy's car the other way. While these skills are very useful to master, he explains that hanging off and other racetrack techniques will only get you going way too fast for street conditions and draw attention to you from the constabulary. They are best reserved for the track, or when needed in an emergency when you need to draw from your safety margin when things go completely toes-up on the street. Nick is the author of the highly-acclaimed motorcycle magazine article \\"The Pace\\" in which he details the way to treat riding on the street in a responsible and fun manner and stay alive. He has ridden with many other moto-journalists and seen many of them crash and get seriously hurt -even killed. He knows that one needs to ride \\"The Pace\\" to stay alive on the street. He is down to earth when telling which techniques are for the track, and what lessons we can learn from that and apply to the public roads.The book is not only superbly written and detail a step-by-step approach to understanding what makes a motorcycle turn, stop and accelerate right to the theoretical limits, but it does it in a beautifully presented coffee table worthy book with tons of very high quality photos and prints inside. All the pages throughout are glossy and the text is immaculately laid out and printed. Even if this book were like the fluff that most other motorcycle self-help/technique books are, it would still be beautiful and worthy of collecting just to page through the pictures and feel the wonderful glossy pages turn under your fingers. It's that nice of a book.The fact that it is so much more than just a pretty coffee table book is almost gravy. For $25 you can't buy anything else for your bike or your gearbag that will give such a return on its investment. There are no go-fast farkles or safety gadgets that will yield such a benifit for your riding and safety as this book. It should be in every rider's library. Get it and read it. It might just save your life, or at least make it that much more enjoyable when you are out on two wheels."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"If you are going to buy only ONE book to help you with your understanding of motorcycle riding technique as well as safety, this is THE book! Even if you think you're above needing any book, because you're such a great natural rider, unless you are already riding through the corners at speed on track days without falling down, you should read this book, it will improve your skills and make you safer, as well as faster on the twisties! I also have Proficient Motorcycling, and this book is definitely superior in its explanations of how the bike responds to rider input, and what exactly that input should be, and the ways for you to refine it to be a smooth and confident and safer rider. It explains finding your turn apex and how to ride through it in a clearer manner, and I think is more easily understood. It also covers the mental side of safety which is awareness of one's surroundings, and how to recognize and prepare ahead of time for potentially dangerous situations. Proficient Motorcycling does this as well, and I would recommend that as your second book. But Sport Riding Techniques will teach you how to ride with more FINESSE."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Nick Ienatsch does a good job of explaining the skills required to ride a motorcycle and how to hone those skills.

After mastering Nick's writings, get your hands on Andy Ibbott's \\"Performance Riding Techniques.\\" Between these two books, you will have the best material on the market for advancing your riding skills to a significantly higher level. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book is a little confused in it's identity. It tries to cover both street and track riding but doesn't give clear explanations for why some techniques are only good for the track. For example, when cornering on the street the book seems to suggest not hanging off the bike - because it looks aggressive and may get you noticed by the police. That seems like rather weak logic, if hanging off means the bike is more upright, isn't that the 'safer' technique to use when dealing with unpredictable road surface?My biggest reason for not being thrilled with the book is that it feels like the author read Proficient Motorcycling and then Total Control, missed what really made those books good and then put this thing together. That isn't to say that this is a bad book - just that it's not as good as Total Control when it comes to riding techniques. This book has stories that read almost exactly like Hough's (except without the silly names), but here they feel more out of place and even more like page filler than they did in Hough's book. This book also has a ton of photos just like Total Control - except here the photos more often than not bear no relation to the text at all. It really feels like the author sat down with a giant stack of photos and stuck him in wherever and came up with whatever captions he could.The end result is a book that just isn't as good for riding technique as Total Control, and not as good as Proficient Motorcycling for street safety.Considering that this book costs more than Total Control and more than Proficient Motorcycling - I can't recommend buying it unless you already own both Total Control and Proficient Motorcycling. If you do own those already - this book makes an OK and admittedly very pretty addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Regardless of what you ride or how long you have ridden, this book will help you improve your skills."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Well i say DO NOT buy this or any book from amazon.

I used to ride dirt bikes as a kid, and starting riding street bikes a few years ago in my mid 40's. I was disappointed in Keith Codes \\"Twist of the Wrist\\" finding it dated, and I didn't agree that all of his track riding skills translate to sport riding. I am a better rider because of \\"Sport Riding Techniques.\\"This book has just enough technical information about why things happen while steering, breaking, etc to help understand how we should ride. It does not read like a physics book. A lot of things in this book I was already doing, some I had never thought of, and some I was doing wrong because Keith Codes book was vague or I misunderstood it. The color photography makes the book more enjoyable for me, although not all of it is totally relevant.The criticisms that this book is too basic does not ring true for me. When Nick Ienatsch writes that if you ride at 100 miles an hour, you should practice braking from 100 miles an hour, it may be rudimentary, but I never practiced braking from the speed I ride. I am glad he wrote that in his book, and I am glad I have now practiced it. The only thing I would have liked to see is a section about \\"Vanishing Point,\\" but after reading about that technique on the internet, I can see how it fits in with the skills promulgated in this book.I reread a couple chapters the first time through, reread some sections again, and am rereading the book. There is a lot to digest and make into automatic responses when riding. I will probably get \\"Total Control\\" by Lee Parks next, which has some good reviews on Amazon."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I bought this book as a warmup to my return to track racing. I was very impressed by the correlations that the author (and Kenny Roberts) made to safe riding on the more spirited twisty roads we (as motorcyclists) tend to seek and the track experiences I started building so many years ago. I was thoroughly pleased with the both the refresher on corner braking and the new (to me) way the author alliterates traction in the various stages of lean."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"It's an OK book. Not amazed at the information given or the layout. I would def. question some of (and lack of) the public road riding skills..."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I was a big fan of the magazine \\"Sport Rider\\" while Nick was editor there. I think he has continued an excellent approach/attitude to motorcycling in writing this book. I believe it caters for the full gamut of riders, very experienced to novice. I would rate it right up there with the \\"Twist of the Wrist\\" books, it may be of even more value to some people. He manages to get across the information in easy to understand explanations & excellent colour pictures. If you were just to buy one book about motorcycle riding technique then this should be the one."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This is the best book on the subject that I have read and will be referenced again and again. The author's greatest skill is in getting the messages and lessons across in a straightforward and easily understood fashion. He also includes practice exercises for continued learning. The section on \\"the Pace\\" gives common sense pointers that are sure to make your group rides safer and enjoyable.Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book is clearly written and nicely illustrated, valuable (in a jungle of riding safety books) for its special emphasis on sport bikes."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Great book period. Even if you are an experienced rider. A wealth of information."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Outstanding book with practical applications for harder riding on the street without being a squid. This is not a racing manual, it's an overall bike riding manual for any type of street bike. The author is realistic and not giving you the same old info you get from a safety course."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Why should someone who rides on the street read a book written by a motorcycle racer? Because today, an awful lot of riders are tooling around on 100+ horsepower race bikes and wondering why the corners come at them so darned fast!This book is clearly and smoothly written with outstanding photographs, great stories and excellent advice. Here's a sample: There is more to cornering than braking early, throwing the bike down and twisting the throttle. Ever hear of trail braking? Racers use it, and you'll need it when that cage driver backs out in front of you while your leaned over in a tight right hander. Ever wonder why corners scare you? It could be because you are rushing them, not keeping your eyes up, and are riding way too fast for the street. Have you ever wondered just how far you could lean your bike over before bad things start to happen? If you read this book, you'll know how to find out safely.This is a wonderful book for intermediate or experienced riders. New riders probably won't get it. However, for anyone who has been riding for awhile, this book will explain a lot.Quibbles? I wish the author was more descriptive of how a bike behaves at the limit, but I guess that's sort of his point: The smart move is to gradually work up to your limits in a safe and controlled way, in a safe and controlled environment, like a racetrack.Buy this book today and ride better by this weekend."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I have read many sportbiking books over the last several years. So far, this is the absolutely the best. I actually read it every winter, becuase there are things that any level rider can pick up. As you progress in your skills, more things about what he writes begin to click and make sense.Overall, I think this a must read for any sportbike rider, especially if you are new to sportbike riding."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book is a must for any rider. No matter how much one thinks they know, this book will make you better, safer and increase your enjoyment of riding on street. The details included make this worth ten times it's cost. It's very well written with many photos and illustrations. The author put a lot of effort in on this and the result is first class."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book is a great way to improve your riding skills. It has helped me out a whole lot, you will not be disappointed with this book!"},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"I have actually checked \\"YES\\" for the review comments of Christopher Lim (Substance without flash) which in my opinion is the best comment that describes Ienatsch's book. After reading this book and applying what I have learnt from it to real life, I have realized that I was doing somethings in a wrong way that I thought I understood correctly from Code's book (okay, english is not my native language but my english is not bad). Code's book widened my horizon and gave a lot of valueable information. Ienatsch's book filed in the gaps and made it clearer.I have only one disappointment about the book but it is not content related. It is about the book itself. I am very careful about my books, I never fold back the pages that I already read to hold the book in one hand, or never try to open them fully or flatten the midsection or so. But this book has just fallen apart after the first reading. Now there is nothing that holds the first 30-35 pages, they are simply separated from the book. I guess the binding quality is not very high. Handle carefully!"},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Good book for everyone who rides a bike. There are no secret, earth shattering revelations, (maybe none exist) but it does contain \\"all\\" the tips and skills for advanced riding and should be a part of everyones library.

Even though I felt comfortable right away on my new road bike, after reading Nick's book it all clicked..! I now ride safer, more in control, and when it comes time to tear up the twisties, I'm having more fun on my bike than I could have imagined..!

I have purchased several riding books and this is by far the best vresion."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This is a newbie book. Do not expect any intermediate or advanced tips. With that being said it does reinforce what I have preached but morons have contradicted. Use the rear break, stupid! No listen to me becuase I am faster then I have brains and crash all the time so I must be fast. I am stupid and you grab a fist full of brake and endo like a total loser like I did. Don't ride with idiots in the canyons. Pushing the limits in the canyons does not make you faster it makes you crash. Guys that crash every four months are not fast, only ignorant. This should be in the driver test handbook for all the lemmings following the morons knee draging off the cliffs to the morgue \\"every\\" weekend. Get lessons (from pro's not morons) and take it to the track."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Keith Code's popular books Twist of the Wrist I & II came out long before Ienatsch's book, and are ubiquitous partly due to that, and partly because they are available everywhere and discounted even on Amazon. One of the reasons I was hesitant about buying Sport Riding Techniques was because of the price. However, it's worth every penny.Code's books are written in an aphoristic style that is eminently quotable, but low on detailed explanation. Although Ienatsch's book is filled with gorgeous colour photos, his writing dispenses with flashiness and instead goes into detailed but down-to-earth explanations. I bought both of Code's books before Ienatsch's, and Sport Riding Techniques helped fill in a lot of holes left by the Twist of the Wrist series, in addition to being significantly more up-to-date.Why exactly does the rear brake lock more easily than the front? At exactly which point do you get off the brakes and on the throttle? Exactly how do you balance lean angle and acceleration? Notice the key word \\"exactly\\"; you aren't left guessing.There is also a clear distinction between track-only techniques and street techniques, which is necessary although some people may not like to hear it.This is one of those books that rewards first-time reads, yet will keep rewarding re-reads for years to come. This book definitely deserves to be more widely read, especially outside the US."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"When a rider and writer of Nick Ienatsch's stature puts all his wisdom, knowledge and experience into a book, it's time to sit up and listen carefully, especially these days when 100-HP 600s and 140-HP 1,000s are ripping 10-second quarter miles at 140+ (G-SXR 1000 tests) and are available to anyone with $ whether or not they have a clue.Nick is among the very best writers about motorcycling, ever, up there with Don Canet and Kevin Cameron (no point in ranking them subjectively, because all three are excellent). He is also a champion racer, primarily on 250s. Having ridden on the road with him, I attest to his smooth, skilled way of proceeding, and his concern for safety.This book should be required reading for every rider who puts a wheel on road or track. Once read, it should be memorized and used as the core belief set that will make a rider quicker and safer, and every ride more enjoyable, including anyone else who is along for the pleasure of it. No one should dare suggest that he or she is 'above it,' knows better and 'doesn't need' the lessons Ienatsch teaches. We all do. This book will, among other things, keep a rider alive to ride again and enjoy one of the most interesting and pleasurable ways to get down the road devised by Man.Don't argue with me. Get it.PS One of life's ironies is that Ienatsch, one of the best writers on motorcycling who ever puts finger to keyboard, doesn't have a regular gig and is only read intermittently in CYCLE WORLD. Let's hope that changes, soon."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"It starts off with the basics even a rookie rider would know but then it grows into more detail with every chapter. I bought it because I liked Nick's article &quot;The Pace.&quot; For the novice rider, you'll know most of the content but I'm sure there are some things you'll learn from it. The way he describes limits on cornering and braking with the tire point system is a nice fresh approach. It will be a great book for someone who is new to Sport Bikes. It's also good for those who have been riding because you can never stop learning or looking for ways to improve on your riding. It's worth the money in my opinion."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book shows basics for performance street riding always keeping security in first place. It's not for those who are looking to improve their track techniques. It's definetly not for racers, but if your're a beginner here you can find how to ride fast and in safety. You'll learn the correct body position while cornering, how to chose the best line, how to use throttle and brakes properly and especially how to make turns.Everything is explained pretty clear but i've felt the lack of some exercise to practice what's explained.I'd definetly suggest it to beginners who want to improve their knowledge about performance riding or security while on the road, but if you've already read Total Control (Lee Parks) or Twist of the Wrist I and II (Keith Code), this book won't add much more to your riding skills and knowledge."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Nick Ienatsch's SPORT RIDING TECHNIQUES is easily the most beautifully produced and clearly and consumately written book on motorcycle racing and street riding, whatever your level of competence. I would recommend it to anyone who has completed a basic motorcycle safety course, whether their goal is to more safely and thourghly enjoy their street riding or to sharpen their technique for racing or track days. This, unlike most instructional books, is a pleasure to read. Ienatsch rides--I've seen him--and writes with equal skill. I've read it twice now and keep going back to it to practice the the techniques he limns so beautifully."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"As a novice rider I purchased this book with the hope of gaining some expert advice. It was the perfect choice. The writing and advice is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Topics such as traction, throttle control, and turning techniques all helped me in gaining confidence on the road. This book should be required reading for all sport bike owners."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This is a great book. The high quality of the presentation, including paper, binding, photos and organization make for an excellent coffee table browser. However, the real value is in the succinctly written nuggets of sport riding wisdom. If you're fairly new to motorcycles as I was when I picked this up, then I strongly recommend it. Start with a quick cover to cover read to get the general idea. Then go back and re-read each section very carefully, with a couple of rides in between to practice and understand everything explained. I feel that I improved significantly and that others in a similar situation will too."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This is probably one of, if not the best motorcycle book to be written in the last decade. I have given this book to countless individuals that are either just learning to ride or are simply trying to become better riders.As someone who instructs people professionally on the racetrack and who has also taught numerous people how to ride from scratch on the street, this book covers so much material in an easy to read and understand format while not getting over anyones head. This is an awesome book for guys, girls or anyone who is looking to learn about sport riding and what these bikes (as well as what we) are capable of. For a while, this was the only book I sold or reccomended to anyone.Pick up a copy. You'll finsh it in two days and give it to your best friend or end up reading it again.

Illustrations are excellent, full of pictures and graphics that makes reading a pleasure. Highly recommendable."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Excellent book. Very well organized with down to earth advise that easily translates from track to street riding techniques. That's perhaps one of the greatest strength's of this book: the reliance on great technique to make riding on the street safer and more fun. The chapter on braking alone is worth the entire book; but, hey, you get lots more between the covers. The writing is clear; the illustrations on point and the photographs first notch. A must for every rider's library."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This book is more for the advanced rider than for a beginner.

I got exactly what I was hoping for, plus a bit more.The chapters of the book takes you from the fundamentals of controlling a motorcycle, through rider attitude to track skills, and provides the information necessary for understanding your own limits as well as those of your bike.Each chapter is concluded with a few pointers/lessons which are helpful in order to analyse and improve your riding.I would recommend this book to any rider who takes an interest in knowing what it is you intuitively do when you get on your bike.

From Novice to Old Hand, something new for everyone."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"The content is also very good. Nick presents the basics of sport riding in a pleasent way. I liked the concept of 100 point of traction he presents. This is always in my mind when I am riding in the twisties. A must have for the less experienced rider."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"This is a great book that will help improve your riding and smoothness.This is the second book I read regarding riding techniques. The first book is Pridmore's \\"Smooth Riding the Pridmore Way\\" which is an excellent supplement. If you will only read one book, read Nick's Sport Riding Techniques.Comparing the two, I would say Pridmore's book helps with the mechanical aspects of riding: Braking, shifting, turning, etc. Nick's book tends to be more about the mental game of riding, specifically on the street: Situational awareness, traffic, smoothness...Both books are valuable, but Nick's book is the better, more valuable read."},{"Title":"Sport Riding Techniques: How To Develop Real World Skills for Speed, Safety, and Confidence on the Street and Track","review":"Highly recommended reading for beginners through experiened riders.

He preached about the Bible, sin, repentance, and a godly life. We should continue doing the same with Deaf worldwide. This is a very good book. I quote from it often as I lead the worldwide International Partnership Ministries Deaf Ministries Department."},{"Title":"Rush to Nowhere","review":"This novel happens to be written by a young southern writer -- so, my review is likely to be biased. However, if you liked 'Bright Lights, Big City', a novel about the wretched excess of the fantastic 80s decade, you'll like this novel too. The title gives you a clue about the plotline; weren't we all in a rush in the 80s? Are we still rushing to nowhere?Russell develops an excellent plotline with vivid, believable southern characters (believable if you're living in the South, that is!). The protagonist is transplanted to New York City (or exiled there, according to his southern relatives who think NYC is the Big Evil City). At any rate, the main character works in advertising (yuck, huh?)...but he's an aspiring novelist. As his life gets twisted up and mangled, accidental happenstance has him meeting a famous older movie actress and falling in lust, then in love. To say nothing of the humorous irony waiting to pounce on him at every corner!This is a funny, witty, fast read for anyone who loved the 80s decade; it will have you laughing aloud, and wondering at the strange coincidences that sometimes happen in our own lives."},{"Title":"Rush to Nowhere","review":"Dancer is an aspiring writer from Alabama who works as an assistant at a major advertising agency in New York to pay (barely) his bills while he waits for a publisher, any publisher, to discover him. Instead, he meets an actress twice his age, and ends up going on a crazy series of back-to-back adventures that range from winning a chunk of money in Atlantic City to flying to Europe at a moment's notice for a celebrity funeral.The author was working for a New York City advertising agency when he wrote this book. The scenes in the agency are very funny and very true to what the job is like; similarly, his harangues about the subway commute (the Train of Tears) and living in Brooklyn with a strange roommate will strike a chord with anyone who's ever lived here. And those scenes are the best in the book. The others are so over the top that the suspension of disbelief just doesn't work. You put the book down with the sense that the writer was vacillating between autobiography and wishful thinking.There's no question that Mr. Russell has ability, but as a reader, I found myself wishing someone had sat him down and explained to him the elements of a good plot, also the importance of having a likable narrator (since this one looks down on everybody and everything else just a little too much). Right now, the book reads like it was written by a talented sophomore."},{"Title":"A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English (4 Vol Set)","review":"The scope of this work is similar to Manly & Rickert's Texts of the Canterbury Tales. Likewise, it is the most extensive and almost solitary work of its kind in late medieval english. If one can afford it, it is a superb research tool, if only a springboard into further discussions of linguistic patterns in medieval manuscripts and incunables. The work is figuratively and physically heavy, large, and expansive."},{"Title":"A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English (4 Vol Set)","review":"The book was described accurately, as regards both content and condition. The work itself is a remarkable achievement, and a great adjunct to reading texts of that era."},{"Title":"Women's costume in French texts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, (The Johns Hopkins studies in Romance literatures and languages. vol. VII)","review":"This text is Eunice R. Goddard's Doctoral Thesis, written in 1925. This is a very consise overview of eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth century references in french texts to clothing of the era. It's nice for the broad overview but the pictures came out poorly and don't do the text justice. If you can find the ... authorized photocopy, and you're interested in this era, it's worth the price."},{"Title":"Coaching Youth Football","review":"I found this book to be way off the mark. The author(s) have obviously never played or coached youth football. A 4-3 defense, which the authors recommend, is one of the worst defeneses in youth football because youth teams almost never pass the ball. You can run off tackle all day on the 4-3.For the same reason, there is no point in running offenses designed primarily for passing at this level, such as the pro set described in the book. Passing in youth football is used primarily as a change of pace to the run and to keep the field open for inside running.It's obvious that the authors are not youth coaches but rather people who watch too much football on TV. They took the pro football philosophy and tried to apply it to youth football. Youth football is an entirely different game. Pro football is a highly skilled game utilizing elite athletes that have literally one-in-a-million talent and years of experience. Youth football is a bunch of average kids who may or may not have played football before, and you have to take this into account when developing your game strategy. Offenses that emphasize running will be much more successful than pro-type passing offenses, as will defenses that are primarily designed to stop the run.Worst of all, the authors emphasize that the kids should have 'fun', and not to worry about winning. I have a real problem with that. In my experience, winning is the most fun you can have, and makes all of the hours of hard work worth it to the kids. Telling your kids that losing or winning doesn't matter belittles the effort that they have put into all the practices and all the games. If you win, the reward is self-evident. If you lose, well, accept defeat gracefully, but don't teach the kids to be comfortable with losing. That's a terrible thing to do to a kid. Turn a defeat into a learning experience so that next time you will be better prepared to win. You can't win'em all, but teaching a kid that winning doesn't matter does nothing but teach him not to try too hard in the first place.

At the youth level coaching is a position of many responsibilities. You aren't there to win every game (although you owe it to your players to try) but you ARE there to see to it that they have fun. That's what football is about. This book does a great job of stressing that. The problems come when it tries to get into the actual game. The book shows offensive and defensive formations that are worthless in youth football (the split back &quot;pro&quot; formation on offense, and the 4-3 defense). Youth football teams run on almost every play, passing formations and passing defenses are of no use at all. The book also spends way too much time on flag football rules and formations. Youth football is different from youth FLAG football, and books should be written for one or the other but not both of them. If you're looking for a book to help show you WHY to coach, this is it... but for HOW to coach, you'll have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Coaching Youth Football","review":"Any coach who wants to get into the right mindset should read this at the start of every season, again at the halfway point, and again at the end of the year. It makes you plan your season so the kids get the most out of the game. If you want to get your kids excited about football and run a class program, this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Coaching Youth Football","review":"Although it is technically legal to do so, I have a real problem with a publisher that would change the name of their book to the same name as another better written book simply to increase their own sales. This book used to be named Rookie Coaches Football Guide.Coaching youth sports is an incredible responibility to a well intentioned coach. Any good youth coach understands that the youth players well-being comes before winning at any cost. At the same time, not giving the youth player instruction on how to properly play the game should be criminal. The key is finding the balance between adequate instruction and inspiring the player to learn and enjoy the game.If you want the book that will give you all the tools you need to coach a youth football team, buy the original book with this name, Coaching Youth Football by John T. Reed. A far superior book designed for the youth coach, that is also available through Amazon."},{"Title":"Coaching Youth Football","review":"I mistakenly purchased this book when trying to obtain the Reed book by the same title. It is simply awful. It tries to take the tenets of higher level football (Div 1A and Pro) and apply them to youth football, which is an entirely different game. Get Reed's book. It is a step-by-step primer that even a first time coach without playing experience could follow and achieve success with.

It is the language of a distinct ethnic group from the middle of Southeast Asia, roughly the northern part of Burma and neighboring part of China. But this group has been dispersed by the currents of history and encroachments of modernity. Mong is a specialist in the history of the Shan people and their language. He follows the development of the Shan language primarily through its manuscripts from the probable origins of the Shan alphabet to the present-day threats to its survival. The language mostly developed naturally, but at times its adherents had to devise strategies to keep it from fading away. Parts of the book are passages, sometimes fairly lengthy ones, in the Shan language, especially where the author analyzes changes in it during different stages of its development. But these passages can be glossed over by the large majority not knowing Shan to nonetheless still comprehend this book on this historically and culturally significant, yet now fragile Southeast Asian language."},{"Title":"Alliances, Outsourcing, and the Lean Organization:","review":"Undoubtedly one of the best business books ever written about alliances and outsourcing.

He mentioned that &quot;Too often, an alliance is seen as a way of &quot;plugging a gap&quot; or &quot;covering a weakness&quot; rather than exploiting a strength.&quot; He also explain what key success factors needed to ensure long-term competitiveness of the organization.

Dave Lowry has a fantastic breadth of Japanese knowledge both martial and mundane. A master of the sword, brush, and open-hand combat he is also experienced in tea ceremony, flower arranging, and much more. As a young man he serendipitously found a bugei master who he eventually convinced to teach him the way. Early on his sensei proclaimed that, \\"More is expected of bugeisha then ordinary people.\\" More is what you get in this masterful book. He entices us to follow along the path of his life and training with delightful wit, candor, and humility. I truly enjoyed this book.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"This book is outstanding because of its authenticity, clarity, and humility. It is the privileged description of a traditional Japanese martial arts education undertaken by a mid-Western American.

I will make it a point to visit the village of Yagyumura and the gravesite of the Yagyu Ryu swordsman when I travel to Japan"},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Books of this type are truly few and far between. Even among the growing popularity of kenjutsu and iai in America, there are very few English books on the subject. Even fewer are the books that give you a decent insight into a particular ryu and it's history. Lowry not only captures a good historical overview of the Yagyu Shinkage ryu, but intertwines some of the philosophical aspects of the art through his own education of the school.On the negative side, most of the book is history of the Yagyu Shinkage ryu. While he includes reflections on his own training, I would have enjoyed hearing more of that along with the history. A line of inheritance of the Shinkage ryu would have been great. A great book among the few out there."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Dave Lowry offers a perspective in his books not often available to the Western martial arts practitioner - a considered interpretation of modern martial arts in the context of traditional (koryu) arts.Written in a exceptionally approachable style, Lowry tells the story of his introduction to martial arts, interspersed with anecdotes from Japanese martial history.Lowry's books provide me with insights into my own training and have helped me grow as a martial artist.

Woven into this history are the events that lead Lowry into studying this Ryu and his dynamic interaction with his Sensei."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Dave Lowry is a regular contributor to Black Belt magazine. His background is in traditional japanese martial arts. The aspect of Lowry's writing that is so important is that he demystifies the martial arts while at the same time allowing them to keep their special flavor.Autumn Lightening gives the reader a glimpse into Dave Lowry's personal journey as a martial artist and into the interesting history and mythology surrounding his Kenjutsu Ryu.A wonderful, quick read that should be required for all American martial artists."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Dave Lowry, a Yagu-Ryu Swordsman, in the Mid-West, in the 1960's! His work is as pity &amp; sharp as the blades he wields. If his sword is as expertly used as his pen, his skill is mighty indeed. Both his art and his expression of it are works of great beauty, and endless refinement, precision.Autumn Lightning is a fabulous mixture of the ancient fables &amp; stories surrounding the beginnings of this ancient battlefield art; yet, intimately intertwined with Lowry's training experiences today, in the modern world.A memorable &amp; humorous addition to any seeking to understand martial artists, and their seeming paradoxes in the so called &quot;modern age&quot;."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Dave Lowry writes with a clarity that is accessible and moving. In Autumn Lightning, Lowry explores his early interest in the arts of the bugeisha (samurai-in-training). He trains with the ken/katana, and learns much about the world of Japanese Martial Arts.But this is not simply a martial arts book. What makes it so unique is its easy realationship with the reader. It is like having a discussion with an old friend, and hearing all the wonderful stories that friend has to tell. Lowry expands on his experiences with his neighbor/sensei and relates them both to his life and, by proxy, the life of the reader.This is a book I loved from cover to cover not just because it bridges certain cultural constraints (which it does with wit and candor), but also because it is a delightful story. Hearing the stories about the author, his sensei, and even his sensei's wife, are inspiring and thoroughly entertaining. If you have any interest in the martial arts, Japanese culture, or just open thinking in general, this book is most certainly going to excite your literary pallete."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"\`Autumn Lightning' is another well written book by Dave Lowry that explores the history of the Yagyu Shinkage Ryu, as well as his own start in martial arts. Each chapter alternates between life in feudal Japan and the development of the Ryu and life in America and Dave's personal development. This makes for compelling reading and creates a sense of real connection between martial arts of the past and their practise in up-to-date, contemporary times. Lowry writes with his usual candour and descriptive language and from the first page you will be gripped and your interest held until the very end. Lowry's martial arts integrity shines through and you see how this developed under the tutelage of his Sensei and this makes for encouraging reading for those of us who practise martial arts today. If you've read any of Lowry's other books then you know how good they can be and this is no exception, it has rich, tight language and great martial arts history and left me feeling motivated and inspired. Well worth a look.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Mr. Lowry gets much respect from from me for his writing here. He gives an excellent account of what it might be like to study under a classical Japanese martial arts sensei (not that I would know personally). And he ties in the rise and refinement of his school of swordsmanship along with his personal accounts of training. I have learned a lot from his work here and plan to read more of his writing in the future.I will say this, though. I wish his book was more about his training than the history of his style. While the history was fascinating and I felt it gave me a sliver of the complex history that has made Japanese martial arts what they are today I felt that it was more history that I would have liked to read in what I thought was to be an autobiography. And, I am embarrassed to say, the names of many of the historical figures were somewhat hard to follow without flipping back though the pages. This is partially due to many of them being similar in spelling, such as father and son being named differently only by a couple letters, and partially to do with my being unaccustomed to reading foreign names. Though both of these, while relevant as part of a review, are of no bearing on the author or his work.Bottom line: if you are interested in swordsmanship or train in any martial art, then I highly recommend reading this work."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"I have to admit it. I have been a fan of Dave Lowrey's books and columns for many years. This book reads like a novel, even though it is more of a biography of the author's search for the real meaning of Bushido. Just as in many ancient martial art stories, this one begins with the author's quest to learn the martial arts from a Japanese couple living in his area.The journey from novice to expert in Kenjutsu (Sword art) is a long hard road, but the author makes each step an adventure in reading. In conclusion, this is a book for all serious martial artists who desires to learn the true meaning of Budo.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Samurai Aerobics Official Manual)."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Dave Lowry relays his experience studying Japanese Swordsmanship with a clean, enjoyable style. This book is reminiscent of the Karate Kid movies where the young boy approaches the master hoping to learn the secret arts. Mr. Lowry shares his same experience from his own life while creating a written split-screen effect where he toggles back and forth throughout the book with events of the Samurai era.The young boy in St. Louis learns and adopts Samurai culture in the midst of modern day America. It is as though after studying with the Japanese master who happens to live in the same neighborhood, the young boy begins to carry the growing light of enlightenment in the way with him throughout his daily happenings.A fascinating read that would make a great movie!

I was captivated by both threads.The anecdote that explains the title, Autumn Lightning, is evocative of the essence of this book. The book is suffused with a subtle melancholly. The author is well aware that his art is nothing more than a museum piece, without any practicality and receiving little appreciation. Yet it is pursued because it is excellent, beautiful and transformative. In that way it is far more &quot;real&quot; than the ugly, debased &quot;reality&quot; of the modern world.This book will delight natural aristocrats who are at odds with the spirit of the age."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Out of print for nearly ten years, Shambhala Press makes this masterpiece available to another generation of martial arts students and Westerners who are interested in the Japanese &quot;student-teacher&quot; relationship.As a young teenager, Lowry learned of a &quot;Japanese swordsman&quot; living in the same University town. In the tradition of old Japan when a student seeked an instructor, Lowry stopped by the house every day, asking the woman who answered the doorif there was an instructor who would take him as a student. Lowry's persistence paid off and he was &quot;adopted&quot; by Kotaro Sensei (teacher), a master of Yagyu Shinkage-ryu swordsmanship.Lowry instruction was by no means limited to the physical techniques of the sword. As the subtitle implies, Kotaro Sensei transformed this wet-behind-the-ears teenager into an &quot;American Samurai.&quot; Lessons learned within and without the dojo (training hall) taught Lowry that a &quot;samurai&quot; has to live ALL aspects of his or her life to a higher standard. While his schoolmates were busy experimenting with drugs and worrying about the Viet Nam war, Lowry's spare time was spent learning honor, respect, courage, virtue and justice through this sacred relationship between Sensei (teacher) and kohei (student).Lowry takes an interesting and very effective approach to the assembly of the book, alternating chapters that chronologically detail his experience and historical anecdotes about the martial arts that reinforce the lessons he learned. Lowry is a true &quot;master of the sword AND pen,&quot; his masterful re-telling of his experience almost allows the reader to experience the same struggles and joys he experienced, yet he keeps this writing accessable. This book would be equally valuable to a nine-year old beginning karate student as it is to a 80 year old master of the arts.I have been involved in the martial arts for only ten years, but have read and collected more than 100 books on the subject. If I had only one book to recommend to students of the arts seeking the &quot;definitive text&quot; on what the &quot;teacher-student&quot; experience is SUPPOSED to be, this would be it."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"I met David Lowry quite a few years ago, appropriately at the St. Louis Japanese Festival held in Forest Park's lovely Japanese tea garden. It was a good thing I had a chance to meet him--otherwise I might think this story was fiction. It's not, though it reads like a novel, maybe titled &quot;Karate Kid meets Yoda.&quot;Lowry, a country boy living in Springfield, Missouri, went on a youthful quest to find his sensei, his teacher, after hearing rumors that there was a sword master living in town. Unlikely as that was (Springfield is better known for the Ozark Mountains and being near Laura Ingalls Wilder's homestead) it was true. In scenes that follow, Lowry gets training not only from the sensei but from his equally fierce consort. The Japanese couple become a second set of parents and teachers, and they make their indelible mark on David's life.Not only is this an fascinating tale of coming-of-age and two cultures meeting, but it is written with great style. Lowry is a journalist and freelance writer with many, many bylines from top publications. His writing is crisp and visual, and above all, humorous. This is one of my favorite memoirs."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Ostensibly the autobiography of an American bugeisha (practitioner of Japanese martial arts, in this case kenjutsu, &quot;sword techniques&quot;), this book is much more as it delves into an easily-read discussion of different bugei (Japanese martial arts), zanshin (the state of &quot;continual mind&quot;), special skills and hidden methods, the precursors of jujutsu, warrior monks, Zen Buddhism, seppuku and much more. Even if you do not practice a martial art, you are likely to find this a fascinating read, and if you do practice a martial art, this book will inspire you no matter what your own art is (I practice eskrima, which has no relation whatsoever to kenjutsu and yet I found many principles in this which I can apply to eskrima)."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Many books are written on the samurai or budo...often the stories of the master's master are left out.

Dave Lowry manages to blend his training as a modern Samurai with the story of the history of his school. The combination is a fascinating insight into the ideals and philosophies of the Japanese warrior - how they shaped his training and how they grew around the school (ryu) that he has chosen.If you are interested in bushido or Japanese sword arts (such as Kendo) /martial arts - this is a must. Not so much for techniques (I don't think any specific techniques are discussed) but as a look into how a samurai is trained mentally.

I still haven't got my copy back."},{"Title":"Autumn Lightning","review":"Many books about the martial arts are dry and boring.

While reading this book, I was often reminded of the movie; \\"The Karate Kid.\\" In that movie; \\"Daniel Larusso\\" becomes \\"Miyagi-fied\\" and is turned into a great Marshal Artist.

I should know because I've been fascinated by TR history for years! This became one of my immediate favorites. Yes, the reader will get the story of grit and determination and the never-say-die spirit that built the railroad in spite of difficult odds. And that alone would have made it a worthwhile read. But, the author has also provided engaging portraits of the personalities behind the scenes: the pettiness, greed, and corruption of the men who made the railroad and the noble hero whose vision and work made it possible. Without pity, what emerges from an understanding of these figures and the immigrant workers who were used to further their aims, is a work filled with both triumph and tragedy. It's not merely a retelling of a twice-told-tale, but a set of truly original insights. Houghton's book also succeeds where many others have failed by being clear and compelling enough to keep the attention of school age children, while offering the kind of information that can be appreciated by adult readers. It's a winner and a must for anyone who cares about our nation's past."},{"Title":"The Transcontinental Railroad: A Primary Source History of America's First Coast-To-Coast Railroad (Primary Sources in American History)","review":"When I first heard about this book, it sounded old fashioned and reminded me of a civics class I had in fifth grade. But when I got hold of an early copy and dug into it, I found it was colorful, the pictures were dramatic, and it really came down to a regular corporate rip-off, just like the Enron deal. It was kind of reassuring to me to find out that people were just regular people back then, not like stuffed figures in a museum. What's more, I got the sense the writer of the book is both well informed and has a sly eye for what was going down, too. She takes it all in and tells it like it is. The most wonderful paradox of the whole mess, of course, is that this scam actually resulted in the magnificent triumph of the transcontinental railroad, the smash-hit of the nineteenth century and the most gorgeous ride through the mountains that anyone ever saw. I know, because I made the trip once. Out of evil comes good, you could definitely say. So I would recommend this book to any person between the ages of 9 (if they're pretty mature) and 99 (if they still got their wits)."},{"Title":"Lowdown From the Lesson Tee : Correcting 40 of Golf's Most Misunderstood Teaching Tips","review":"I have hundreds of books on golf.

It gives you more to think about than what may seem to be a simple caveat. Example: Instead of keeping your head still, a better key is to avoid excessive head movement.

But if you are a realist about human nature and marriage, you will find this novel erotic, painful, and ultimately insightful about both the strengths and the weaknesses of the marriage bond.Nina Cort, a young widow, moves from modern-day London back to her hometown in Grafton to begin a new life for herself. She becomes friendly with a group of five apparently happily married couples who are all long-time friends, but her loneliness leads her to enter into an affair with one of the husbands in the group. When the affair becomes known, it exposes the hidden faults in the marriages of all five of the couples and starts a chain reaction of infidelities among them. All of the couples in the group, even the lone pair who do not stray, end up redefining the terms of their relationships to determine whether they will - or will not - stay together. As for Nina, she discovers a painful truth about her own marriage, which she had thought was perfect.Rosie Thomas is very skillful at realistically portraying the personalities and thought processes of men as well as women, which is something that not all authors of \\"women's literature\\" can do.

It has four segments and suggests that you use each at least once a day for a week before moving to the next segment. Each segment takes you to a deeper level of brain waves. I have been able to observe my own progress because as I move to the next segment, that segment resonates with me even better than the previous one. Contrary to the previous reviewer, my sense of the music is that it is perfect for helping move me into a place of stillness and meditation, because of the underlying brain-sync sound technology. It is important to use ear phones (as suggested by the CD)and NOT play it through speakers."},{"Title":"Sacred Ground: Music and Window Frequencies for Meditation ('Open the Window to the Core of Your Being')","review":"I bought these tapes 7 years ago and they are so good that I am still using them.I started using them when i discovered yoga and wanted to learn how to meditate. I used these tapes for my first tries at meditation. The information about the tapes talk about \\"kindling\\" or moments of high awareness and or clarity and insight. I didn't know what that meant at the time.I recently picked up the cover again and read the information and realized that I indeed get many moments of kindling that also included some moments of extreme joy but mostly moments of quiet and serenity and many moments of clarity and insight.These are indeed the effects of meditation that you might be looking for as they were for me.Meditation can really affect your everyday life and help you create a more effective and fulfilling life for yourself.

Cosmic Rain -track 3 (Open Higher Consciousness) has some sound effect of water dripping in an echoing cave. It doesn't start until maybe 12 mins in. The waves of music are broken by these crisp semi-loud drops that, to me, don't need to be there. It makes me jump EVERY TIME. I want to skip tracks like these all together.I don't have enough of a 'higher consciousness' opening during or after the use of these tracks to make them worth it.

This book was presented as one of the most entertaining of these mistakes, because although the author used the at-the-time new photo printing technologies, she didn't use it for original sources (manuscript illustrations, etc) but for pictures of contemporary models in her interpretations of medieval clothing. The results are extremely funny. I expect similar problems with the other eras covered.

I'm happy I finally had the opportunity to read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Lady Chatterley's Lover is Lawrence's final novel before his untimely death from tuberculosis at the age of 44, and like every one of his works it follows these same familiar themes: the renunciation of the body in favor of the intellect, epitomized by the wheelchair-bound Clifford (Lord Chatterley) and his unconsummated marriage to Connie. Predictably, then, the novel unfolds Connie's physical flowering, awoken by an initial affair with the populist Irish playwright Michaelis, who fails to satisfy her, and eventually by Oliver Mellors, the local gamekeeper, the lover of the title.It startles me that I have to give this book such a low rating, since I have at least liked, if not loved, almost everything else I have read by Lawrence. Women in Love, in particular, I consider to be one of the greatest novels of the English canon. But Lady Chatterley's Lover pales in comparison to that earlier work. The central reason is that Lawrence provides a cast that is too didactic and one-sided for its own good. The reader is never in any doubt that our sympathies are supposed to lie with Connie and Mellors, with Clifford presented as a fairly straightforward petty tyrant whose sterile emotional and intellectual life cannot make up for his obvious physical limitations. Sorely missing is a character like Gerald Crich (from Women in Love) who, despite repeatedly being in the \\"wrong\\" in terms of Lawrence's philosophy, nonetheless possesses a robust physical presence and energy that lends nuance and ambiguity to his character, making him a worthy counterbalance to Rupert Birkin's role as Lawrence's mouthpiece. In Lady Chatterley's Lover, by contrast, Lawrence fails to give voice to the kind of self-criticism that adds depth and credibility to his other works of fiction.It was because of this lopsidedness in the narrative perspective that I constantly felt in a rebellious mood against the novel's point of view. Connie is supposed to be the sympathetic core of the book, but while I understood her reservations well enough, I couldn't identify with many of her actions. Unlike her Victorian predecessors, this adulteress was not stuck in her marriage to Clifford: she could have walked away at any time, having both the financial means and the legal ability to do so. Instead, she prefers sanctimoniously to torture Clifford from a sense of revenge that completely undermined any sympathy I might have had for her. Sure, Clifford was a mistake and a boor, but Connie's cruelty to him is selfish, immature, and ultimately unwarranted. Her sadistic fantasy of passing off another man's child for him to raise is probably the nadir of her character.Ultimately, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a failure not only for its shrill one-sidedness, but because it fails to extend Lawrence's philosophy in any meaningful way. Certainly the language and sex scenes are more explicit, overlaid as they are with the usual Lawrentian jargon that makes them sound strange and outdated to readers not used to his metaphors, but the whole story is haunted by a sense that we have seen it all before: Mellors, in particular, might be Paul Morel, the protagonist of Sons and Lovers, some twenty years later. The philosophical discussions, similarly, feature an array of forgettable characters who pop up and then disappear without adding anything new to what Lawrence has said before. But what irked me the most was Connie's newfound desire for a child as the symbol of her hope for a better world. This conclusion I found to be the worst kind of emotional blackmail, one that implies that the decision not to have children is an indicator of despair and a renunciation of life.There are times when I have thought, like a young Nicholas Urfe in John Fowles's novel The Magus, that Lawrence was the greatest, most splendid human being of the twentieth century. There is certainly plenty of wisdom and insight in his diagnosis of the underlying problems of modern humanity. But then there are other times, such as when reading Lady Chatterley's Lover, that I find myself unable to follow him any further, not because I have come to a fundamental disagreement with his ideas, but because the terms on which they are offered are no longer acceptable."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"It certainly kept me guessing.

A wonderful classic read."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I fail to comprehend why this book has become such a 'classic'. I've never done so much skimming and speed-reading in my life. Am I missing something?"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Overall I really enjoyed this book. Specifically, I liked the dialogue between the four main characters (Connie, Oliver Mellors, Sir Clifford, and Mrs Bolton) and I thought the plot (a titled British lady having an affair with a commoner game-keeper) was pretty good. The famous (infamous?) sex scenes between Mellors and Connie were entertaining as well, and it was interesting to read this book in 2012--52 years after the historic obscenity trial that allowed this book to be published at all, and also the same year that a book like \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" would find itself on the New York Times bestseller list. How far we've come! However, I was less impressed with the book's underlying theme of the social blight upon England, and found Mellors' solution of dressing miners in red pants and white jackets to be pretty silly. Surely DH Lawrence couldn't have thought that was really the answer to the world's problems?In any case, that aside, I thought this was a good read."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Book was delivered in a timely manner. The book was in good shape for its age.

Definitely will re-read it in the future."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I think this book was Lawrence's attempt at equalizing classes, or perhaps taking the side of the working class. He tries to show that a woman of the upper class can be attracted to a man of the working class, and he probably means Clifford's paralysis to symbolize the paralysis of the ruling class. But I don't know what to make of Mellors, who didn't seem to love Constance in any way other than physically. And the ending wasn't satisfying: it seemed to just slip away. I've read this book twice: once in my teens, once maybe ten or fifteen years later. I often change my opinion of a book in a 15-year span, but in this case I didn't. This book is interesting, especially for its time, but not satisfying."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This version is riddled with typos and mistakes.

Guess you get what you pay for with this one!"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"D.H. Lawrence daringly wrote about sexual mores in this novel, to an extent that his socioeconomic theme may have been lost by many of the readers.Constance Chatterly - affectionately depicted as Connie or Lady Chatterly - is the highlight and nightmare to her husband, Lord Chatterly. After a whirlwind marriage and honeymoon, the lord returns to Word War I's catastrophe and is \\"shipped home smashed.\\" He is a paraplegic for life, and someone who cannot provide an heir to his family's estate: Wragby.While confined to the walls of the stately mansion, she is effectively a widow who will never know her sexuality. But she is not alone as one friend tells her, \\"You have to snivel and feel sinful or awful about your sex, before you're allowed to have any.\\" Sex is a suppressed sin - not an appreciated act.Her lover concedes women are no fun. \\". . . the mass of women are like this: most of them want a man, but don't want the sex, but they put up with it, as part of the bargain.\\" In reflection, being married to a paraplegic may be a blessing to those very women.But, her lover discovers fun with sex, and vice versa. They actually conjoin in orgasm. Lawrence writes about this, he writes about their propinquity of flesh, of cuddling and more. In return, England banned publication of this until 1960. Almost 32 years this book was shelved by the prurient aristocratic publishers who cringed when reading about the sex, and the details of the same.But, Lawrence's statement is stronger. Lady Chatterly does not have sex with one of her class - no she opts for one of the servants of the manor. Oliver Mellors, a bloke who chooses to speak in Derby accent instead of proper English (which he is capable of doing) lights a flame to her inner hay stack. And, she goes wild.Although married to be a Lady, Connie is not from such top-notch stock. But, she is still greater than a commoner, and her sister Hilda remarks about their tryst as \\". . .how impossible it is to mix one's life with theirs. Not out of snobbery, but just because the whole rhythm is different.\\"Those people, the colliers or coal miners, are the people who work the colliery owned by Lord Chatterly. He effectively supplies income to every person's house - at least enough to keep them fed and housed, while they toil in the depths of his mines' bowels in disgusting filth and horrible conditions.Lawrence saw his father in such mines, but saves us from learning too much of the daily toil - this is not a revelation of bad working conditions like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\" But, this is a statement about social injustice, like Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\"In the end, all good comes of a bad situation. The commoner is anything but common and Connie's daddy sits and drinks with this potential Gold Digger and leaves the pub slapping the man on the back and opening his heart and soul to the man who somehow managed to have his daughter leave the comforts and prestige of Magbry.Scenes like that at the pub remind me that Lawrence obviously read Dickens - like probably all his peers did. And, his novel is comparably great as it hits the forefront of not only social injustice, but attacks Victorian restraints on sex, much like other great novelists of England - including Virginia Woolf. But, he attacked such social conservatism head on. This book is a leader of its time."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"As an English-learner, it took me almost two weeks to finish this great book. But I think it deserves my time and efforts. Lawrence facinates me. His pain-staking efforts and subtlety in exploring the balance between men and women are so touching.

Not the stuff of beauty, not even the body of beauty, but a lambency, the warm, white flame of a single life, revealing itself in contours that one might touch: a body!\\"Oh...my...God!!!

Even though it was written in the past with many other societal influences that actually deemed it inappopriate for the US market, almost every single word and ideal still applies, and so profoundly applies! We need every young man and woman, every politician, every puritanical joker or influence on social law to read this.D.H. Lawrence was a man ahead of his time. He had it all figured out: the difficulties and attraction between men and women, the differences between love and sex, the differences between the classes and cultures, and the how and why of our everyday human afflictions that plague us from childhood on. So many views and ideals are inserted into the text that I can't begin to list them, but they're all incredibly important. If only we, as modern generations, could read, consider, and adapt these principles and understandings. The world would truly be a different place.Lawrence gives me new faith in the genre of fiction itself. Never have I seen so much taught in a single made-up volume since reading Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Lady Chatterley's Lover is a work that touches upon and attempts to free of us of all our associated qualms from freedom of speech and sexual expression to the institution of marriage and judgment of others.I agree with authors of erotica and advocates of sexual freedom who promote this book as a must-read, but must also add it to the list of must-reads for the entire population.

I think that the book is better for adults more because of all the detailed sexual contents that were in the book. When I was reading it the information just went in and out of my head. I didn't care much about it because I didn't understand some of the sexual contents were talking about, also there was too much of it that I just got sick of it. There were parts in the book where Lawrence could have just cut short and so that we can just get to the ending faster. He just kept dragging the story on and on, and most of the things were the pretty much the same and only differences was the setting. I wasn't able to finish the book unless I skipped some of the nonsense that was in there. The book got really boring because Lawrence just kept writing the same things over and over again. There was also a lot of nonsense and when I finished the book I was like \\"that was stupid\\" \\"what a waste of my time\\".

She finds that love IS possible when she starts an affair with a hermit- like poor man who also has a strong distaste and bitterness against the anti-romanticism that floods their society. Lady Chatterly's husband is a man who is disabled and finds his comfort in rejecting his body and loves his intellectual pursuits. He is void of any human compassion and is totally blind to his wife's unsatisfaction with him and his life. He then is crushed when he finds out about his wife's affair and becomes like a frightened child who's mother has abandoned him. Like many men, his pride blinded him. He thinks that all MUST agree with his heartless but extremely factual and logical view of life but after all, isn't it obvious things are this way? Even though his wife disagreed with his views and callousness, she didn't have the heart or the true ability to articulate her disagreements. When she finds her lover, he has a way of saying what she thinks. He helps her understand the roots of her heart and allows her to comfortably express all the suppressed feelings deep within. He is not always \\"romantic\\", to the contrary, many times he is vulgar and extremely blunt. He is not cautious of someone's feelings, he simply speaks from his heart's experiences and in doing so he found TRUE love in another who fully agreed. We all should do this and maybe by being more truthful and open to caring we also might find true love instead of dishonest, emotionally distant, controlling, empty, servile, desperate relationships that seem to plague many couples. D.H. Lawrence has the wonderful ablity to make his characters absolutely COME TO LIFE. He makes wonderful points about society's coldness and criticizes modern industrialism as being an uncontrollable machine that oppresses romantic ideals that are the true fuel to the human heart. He attempts to show how being void of emotional needs can create a society that simply pities those who still cling to them. He also shows us that if you do choose cling to them you just might come across the true loving person you have been invisioning. I will continue to read Lawrence because he is a wonderful romantic without all the sappyness of modern love stories. Read this novel is you enjoy an honest and realistic love story."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"The beauty of belonging to a reading group is that everyone is exposed to books that they might not normally read. I don't think that I would have considered reading this book except that it was the choice of my book club.Well, this story was not really what I expected at all. Constance, Lady Chatterley is a rather likeable person who is trapped in a sad and boring life. What happens to her and her lover is something neither really anticipated nor expected. The book starts in 1917 and at the time when it was first published, the subject matter of LADY CHATTERLEY's LOVER was considered to be totally shocking and unacceptable.Yes, a few parts of the book have rather crude passages, and language, but Lady Chatterley herself is a very sympathetic character. The style of writing used by D. H. Lawrence is very descriptive and the pace of the story is probably a little slower than modern readers are used to. Aside from some offensive language, I think that this was a rather interesting, but very depressing book. Many of the characters seemed to be lacking in any kind of a moral code and I found most of the men in the story to be rather despicable."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This story is great in the way it deals with the male -female relationship in a subttle manner. It is erotic, moving and emotional. A powerful story and a great look into human nature and the power that sex has in a relationship. For those whom are interested in understanding the the development in the male and female movements that have grown over the past 100 years."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Lady Chatterley's Lover is not my Lawrece's favourite - see &quot;Women in Love&quot; for that honor-, but I think it is a very great novel, and it is praised as his best. Although the title mention The Lover, in my opinion the book is about Lady Catterley herself.It is very interesting to imagine the effect the story might have caused on people by the time its was first published. It's known that the author had many problems in order to get it released and had to use his own money to get it printed.Even nowadays, Lady Chatterley may shock some puritans, but its effect would never be as strong as in 1928. The large use of slang names for private parts sounds a bit funny, but still disturbing.After finish reading the book, the mainly feeling I had was: selfshiness. All characters most of the time just worry about themselves. On the other hand, I would read very naive if I believed that human beings are not natural born selfish, consequently, people in this book are very close to people we met on the streets when it comes to feelings and emotions. Clifford, the husband, is disgusting. He is a British aristocrat and as so he looks down on everybody all the time.Nobody is good enough to be an equal. Mellors, the lover, appeared to be very polite and open minded in the beginning, but I change my mind in the middle of the novel, after Lady Chatterley spends a Sunday night with him. He sounds very sexist and racist in his speech. However, I think that was the common sense by that time, today readers may feel a bit unconfortable with his opinions- as I did-, but he can still be taken to. But the real 'star' of the novel is Connie, yes, I am talking about Lady Chatterley herself. At first, Clifford takes it out on her all the time- and I felt sorry for her. Later, she finds a new love and starts living her own life - this is the best part of the book. We can't run her down having the love affair because she had such a boring and senseless life before Mellors. By the end - I won't give it - she is not the same person.Some nice twists are saved for the last chapters, what makes the reading much more interesting. I highly recomend this book for whose who are not afraid of reading - and discovering - about sex."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"If you want a good Lawrence book, read Sons and Lovers or Women in Love instead. Lady Chatterly, although written later, is much more immature in terms of style than Lawrence's first book, sons and lovers. The popularity probally results from the scandal that surrounded the book and not the writing or plot. The book only has real importance in a sociological reading, showing the social mores of the period it was written in."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"At the near mention of this book to a mass of people brings forth sexual notions of what people associate this work of literature and most are wrong. I found this book to be filled with intense emotional loneliness and sadness not the sexual adventure most associat with this final work of DH Lawrence.A story of a woman(Lady Chatterly, Connie) who is married to very self involved man that is made more self involved upon his war injuries and her needs for emotional and physical intimacy. With her deep loneliness Connie begins an affair with Mellors the GameKeeper on her husbands estate and struggles with the internal morality of loving someone who is of a lesser class and her real love of him. With Mellors she adores him and needs him away from him she questions herself and feels the shame of her actions.One of the themes I loved about the book was choice. The ability to make ones own choice and live with the consequences. Through out the book Connie makes choices she is willing to live with and Mellor never forces his will on her. She is the Mistress of her Choices and no one else. I thought it interesting that Lawrence would make her so strong willed on one hand and pschologically lonely on the other.This book is a psychological journey of one woman and the man she loves more than it is a sexual escapade. I can see how this book was shocking in the late twenties but seems very tame today.I found this book very sad and wouldn't recommend it to someone on prozac or other anti depressant drugs. I also found the writing very eloquent and filled with lots of quiet observations of relationships between men and women that are true today and in the future. DH Lawrence you could say was ahead of his time or you could say came at just the right time either way you should read his work.This particular book had a introduction and forward written by others that was very insightful. Also, an afterword written by DH Lawrence himself that again extremely insightful. It is hard to beleive he was sick through out the writing and publication of this book that is wonderfully written. Perhaps that is why it is so sad.

This is often a problem with the classics I buy. However...I bought this book after seeing it suggested in an Entertainment Weekly sidebar about books recommended along with 50 Shades of Grey (sort of a historical version of 50 Shades of Grey, if you will.) Now, I read Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence in college and liked it quite a lot, so I figured what the heck? I'll give Lady Chatterly's Lover a try. I could only muscle my way through the first half of the book before I gave up. It was horrible. Just horrible. A few flashes of Lawrence's brilliant mind here and there, but so vague and meandering and phallo-centric I just couldn't stand to keep reading. If you are hoping for a typical \\"classic\\" type read, this is not it."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Male readers may find this book interesting (or at least titillating). I doubt it has many female fans. The female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part (Lawrence likes to call this &quot;gentleness&quot;); and that this type of sexual relationship is all a woman should really need of a man."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I can't fathom why this book is beloved. It's just awful. Alright, that's a little strong. The first third-to-half of the book is just awful: tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless. Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:\\"The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened.\\"That really does say it all. The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story. For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting. But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature: all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short). This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all. Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good. It is not. The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it. This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect that he was emotionally crippled himself). Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor. The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton. The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough. I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota. Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board. But that's about the only good thing I could find to say."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"If yo can read this book till end, you can reclaim your humanity, not taking in account the handicaps of your education (mainly religious). The most important thing to be understood is that happiness is always selfish,whatever the elders ever told you. Charity is the thing that go fine all the times it don't mess with your real inner feeling. But how such a common sense judgement can be reached by the priests of over 1000000000 catholics (in their sayings, not thoughts), or the even more catholics than PAPA anglican reverends? I think that all reviews rejecting the intrinsec value of this book are related not to it's real value, but to the hidden handicaps of missunderstanding the life, the inner substance of humanity, the real substance of the Holly Book commandements"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Published in 1928, Lady Chatterley's Lover was D. H. Lawrence's last novel--it was also his most daring and blatantly erotic work. Even by today's standards, it's erotica, or &quot;erotic romance.&quot; Like two of his previous novels, it was banned on publication, a ban which lasted until 1960. But an uncensored edition of the book was privately printed in Italy and copies were smuggled all over Europe and America.The storyline is quite simple--a bored wife out in the country married to a rich, feeble, annoying husband in a wheelchair falls in love (and lust) with the robust and exciting gamekeeper employed by her husband. Sooner or later things are bound to go wrong, and this can't end happily.This isn't Lawrence's best-written novel, but it is his most groundbreaking work, as it created decades of discussion and debate about what could/should and couldn't/shouldn't be published.David Rehakauthor of Love and Madness"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"The story of a fallen woman with a theme similar to Flaubert's &quot;Madame Bovery&quot; which I have also read. This novel was actually banned I believe because of it's open discussion of the adulterous wife and her passionate love affair. Another theme in the book is the life of the leisured class. These were squires, Lords, Earls and other titled persons who lived lives unencumbered by the need to work. Today's Internet millionaires don't know when to quit. They should walk away from work to pursue hunting duck, quail and pheasant on their large estates. Some of them would also pursue gardening, literature, and painting. The world would be a richer place. Imagine if Picasso had a job: we wouldn't have Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon. Surely that would be a pity."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"His style in Lady Chatterley's Lover is amateuristic, at best. Admittedly, there are parts were the writing takes off and becomes something sublime. However, these passages are few and far between.Lawrence could not but help in adding political statements in the work against his views of the class system in England. These verbal recriminations lack real power or effect today, in the wake of the fall of the powerful socialist and communist nations. Lady Chatterley and her lover are notable socialists in a time before socialism had really taken over a nation. Their dreams and conclusions about the future are not based upon reality, rather upon unsentimental escapism and unthinking immorality. They believed the system was the problem, rather than the people who ran it. Sir Clifford, Lady Chatterley's first husband, was unwilling to chance; thus, the system which was evil would remain so. Lady Chatterley and her lover left a situation that empowered them to make change by placing their child as an heir to the aristocratic system which they blamed for England's problems. As a genre piece, this work is perhaps one of the best. Nonetheless, the overall impression of stylistic expression and thoughtfulness of theory demands I rate this work among the very worst on the great literary lists that major colleges propound as the standard of good literature.Cheers"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"The Great D.H. Lawrence's final work, \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\" is also his most notorious because of the obscenity trial which followed, and the fact that the book was banned in England from the time of its publication which was in 1928 (the year Lawrence's idol Thomas Hardy left us) until 1960.Why the strange title? Well, you probably have not seen the wonderful film \\"Easy Rider.\\" Well if that is true, you are missing out, my friend and dear reader. If I had not seen that classic, I would've never \\"discovered\\" the GREAT D.H. Lawrence. You see, the great actor Jack Nicholson in one of his most famous roles mentions D.H. Lawrence before he takes a drink.I wish I could read this classic masterpiece by one of the greatest writers Britain ever produced (and considering Britain has the greatest writers who ever lived, that's saying something)That's all I have to say my dear readers. I hope to have the pleasure again of speaking to you about the joy of D.H. Lawrence or his idol, the GREAT Thomas Hardy (1840-1928)....but that's another review."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This book is famous for it's descriptive sex scenes. Everyone in Britain ran out to buy a copy after the 1960 trial that ruled the book was not obscene under the law and that Penguin had a right to publish the book in its entirety. But while it may have been sexually explicit for it's time, it's rather tame by 21st Century standards. And in any case, the sexual relations between Lady Chatterley and Mellors take up a proportionally small amount of the book. What everyone always seems to overlook is that this book is overall dreadfully boring. There are whole chapters devoted to completely asinine conversations that have no bearing on the story and make no sense. Such as Chapter 4, where several characters have a mind-numbingly dull conversation about Bolshevism. My advice, just skip these chapters. You'll finish the book a lot faster and you'll probably find it more entertaining. Still, I've never been a big fan of Lawrence and I think his books are all pretty dull and uninteresting. This is probably the most interesting of the lot (which isn't saying much), for the very reason that created all the controversy to begin with: a story of real humans having real experiences.

Now, some 10, 15 years later, I have finally unlocked the mystery of this wonderful book. It is a pity to be put off by the controversy. This book is NOT just 'controversy for contraversy's sake', and it is an injustice to label it such.How someone in the 1920's could write statements and observations about the human condition that would last beyond the end of the millenium is truly fascinating. In this book, you will find the scenes that once ignited controversy, and continue to. At the same time, however, Lawrence is using them to create an in-depth character study of what we have allowed sex to become in our society, blatantly contrasted with all the things it has the potential to be.

He went to the top of the knoll and looked out. There was no sound save the noise, the faint shuffling noise from Stacks Gate Colliery, that never ceased working; and there were hardly any lights, save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half-past two. But even in its sleep it was an uneasy, cruel world, stirring with the noise of a train or some great lorry on the road, and flashing with some rosy lightening-flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal, the cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal, and the endless, endless greed that drove it all. Only greed, greed stirring in its sleep. \\"It was cold, and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever might have to hold her warm in his arms, both of them wrapped in one blanket, and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he would have given to have her there, to be wrapped warm with him in one blanket, and sleep, only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his arms was the only necessity.\\" - D.H. LawrenceAs the coal dust settles over everything and everyone, a woman comes into her own as a woman, and comes to the realization that she despises her arrogant, manipulative husband. The woman begins to long for a child. Her husband, wounded in the war and unable to use his legs, perhaps sensing this longing, has turned into a whining and very demanding child. And in the universal way that these things work, the more he insecurely demandsof her, the more she is repulsed by him. There is a gatekeeper on the estate, and one can well conclude by the title of the book what happens. Begun in 1926, and set in the coal fields of Industrial Age England, this work takes one on a very intimate visit within the class system of that country. It contains a deep, thoughtful examination of English cultures and roots, as well as the values and rules within those various classes and how they intersect and interact within themselves. It is a trip to another time and place which seems altogether too familiar, too unresolved in its issues, and in the structures, restrictions, rules, and cultural foundations. The history of this book is as interesting as the chronicle contained therein.Originally published in Italy, complete with misspellings, it contained \\"shocking words\\" which, along with the subject matter of the book, caused it to be banned in English speaking countries until some court decisions allowed it to be printed. This happened in the U.S. in l959. After completion of the reading of this book, it was interesting to contemplate what had to change in order for this work to be published. This book was a significant factor in the pushing of the envelope in terms of \\"shocking words\\" which are not altogether shocking anymore, because they are ubiquitous. And yet, even though the words, as well as the issues presented in this work no longer cause a violent backlash, the drama is still entirely familiar and very easily understood. It's a cause for one to contemplate how far we have come as a society, and yet how little we have actually accomplished.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the \\"female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part...\\" Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Well, I can see why this book was virtually banned for about 40 years, as it does contain some explicit scenes - although by modern standards, they are not at all oustandingly daring.Overall, I think it was a good read, with interesting insights into the psychology of some really tortuous relationships. Very French, and I say that as a compliment. On the other hand, the end was a bit rushed and anticlimactic, in my opinion. It also annoyed me a bit that the author kept grinding the axe of his own personal ideology - an uncurious mix of Luddism and romanticism. For me, this aspect of the book felt like poor man's Chesterton, although G.K. probably didn't approve of DHL's atttitude to sex, I presume.So, to sum up: if you look for sex, be warned that you'll be getting much less of it than the book's title and fame might lead you to believe.

She was once inthralled by his hopelessly romantic philosophies of life, but grew to find them shallow and superficial. Her pity for Clifford was what held the two together for so long, but Constance, over time, tired of playing house wife, and ventured to find her contentment elsewhere. She didn't have to travel far.

Lawrence's most famous novel, which is a shame because compared to his earlier masterpieces \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" \\"The Rainbow,\\" and \\"Women in Love\\" it's really not very good. It achieved its fame as one of the most censored novels in history, and the legal battles for its completely unexpurgated publication continued for decades after Lawrence's death in 1930. As far as I can tell, the censorship was caused not so much by the subject--the extramarital affairs of a woman trapped in a celibate marriage--but by the explicitly erotic scenes of sexual intercourse and especially the language, which were very daring for the time.Lawrence sets the stage portentously on the very first page by introducing Lady Connie Chatterley's husband, the baronet Sir Clifford, as having been wounded serving in World War I, paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. With this limiting premise, in what direction could the story go other than Connie's quest to fulfill her need for a sexual relationship? She turns her romantic attention first to an unromantic Irish playwright named Michaelis and then to Clifford's gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors, who is separated from a jealous, neurotic wife, while Lawrence describes the sexual encounters with considerable poetic panache. Lawrence labors nobly to make these characters interesting, but they never seem like more than cardboard cutouts of the fuller figures he so richly developed in his three major novels. They are simple people with simple thoughts and desires; their conversations are dreadfully boring.It is surprising for a novel of such risque reputation to contain almost no surprises, but there are a few notable moments, most of which unfortunately serve to illustrate Clifford's impotence in more areas than just sexual. His wheelchair is motorized, and when one day while on a walk the motor fails and Connie and Mellors have to struggle to push him up a hill, Clifford fumes at his helplessness, his mobility at the mercy of others. This is a long, agonizing scene which seems intended to make the reader uncomfortable by cruelly emphasizing the disparity in power between the two men in Connie's life, the wealthy paraplegic and the poor but ambulatory stud. Could Lawrence have been less subtle? Did he feel, two thirds of the way into the novel, that his point had not yet been made clearly?The narrative also suffers from some carelessly bad prose characterized by awkwardly worded metaphors (\\"The fine flower of their intimacy was to her rather like an orchid, a bulb stuck parasitic on her tree of life, and producing, to her eyes, a rather shabby flower.\\") and extraneous misoneism about the urbanization of post-World War I England caused by increasing industrialization; but I could overlook these flaws if the story had given me something more than a prurient attempt to lament the disintegration of the significance of modern marriage. What I got was a D.H. Lawrence who was not firing on all cylinders. The man wrote some great novels, but \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" is not one of them."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Many people dismiss this book as nothing but pervertedness and filthiness. They fail to see the beauty of this tale. This book deserves literary merit, for it's a brave masterpiece. Not, as one prosecutor put it, &quot;dirt for dirt's sake.&quot;This book should not be seen as a piece of work advertising pornography, but rather as a mere attack against industrialization. Perhaps Lawrence, through the tale of Lady Chatterley and her lover, was trying to bring a message across about industry (Clifford Chatterley's coal mine) and the working class (significantly the gamekeeper, Mellors). But, of course, we can't overlook the endless romance between Lady Chatterley and her lover, for it is what this story is about.The fact that it contains that little four-lettered Anglo-Saxon word that begins with an &quot;F&quot; is more reason why this book deserves literary merit, for it is one of the first and foremost important works of literature to contain it. Now, of course, it is hard to find a book, a movie, or a song without that famous word.If D. H. Lawrence should be remembered a thousand years from now, it should be for writing this story. He was a very courageous, very daring person to have written it. This taboo of a story is one that will stay in the reader's mind forever.(Note: If you are to read this book, I'd recommend the unexpurgated version.)"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Wonderful and quick service!

Probably because it was banned, being a bit ahead of its time. In reality, this book is a lovely, wonderful metaphor for the arrival of the era of mechanization and the industrial revolution, as set against the \\"England of the Greenwood\\" (E. M. Forster). Lawrence appears to have had a fascination for this theme, as it occurs in some of his other novels as well. Far from being shunned as inappropriate for young adult readers, Lady Chatterly's Lover ought to be taught, at least at the college level, because it's a marvelous novel and should be appreciated as much, much more than a simple \\"dirty book.\\""},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Like many of us, I read this book in my late teens, but on a reread as an adult in my bookclub I realize the first time it probably went right over my head. Not because of the sex, which by today's standards is pretty tame, but for the astute observations on male and female behavior. I found Connie's ambivalence about her affair to be very believable--when with Mellors she's totally caught up in the moment, but away from him--even when pregnant with their child-- the real world intrudes and she feels ashamed. The description of the smart society of the 1920's and the casual sex was eerily modern. This book is about the conflict between nature and the industrial society, between pure sensuality and sex, between the intellectual life and the body. And parts of it are really funny!--the description of the meeting between Mellors and Connie's father is hysterical--the father is a complete buffoon. Lawrence has some odd ideas about sensuality and male power, and the brief, casual anti-Semitic throw away comments were disturbing, but all in all this was a great book."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I've been catching up on classics by taking advantage of the Barnes & Noble \\"Buy Two, Get One Free,\\" and started with LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER. Instead of being generic paperback volumes, each book has an new introduction along with explanatory footnotes and interesting appendixes.Anyway, I finished LADY but had some misgivings about the novel. I didn't care for the ending because I felt the story just sputtered out. From what I understand, Lawrence was dying at the time he was writing this, so can anyone better versed in his life tell me if this was a factor? (Or did I just miss something?)I realize that he was trying to say something new about sexuality, and that the brazen affair between Connie and Mellors wouldn't necessarily end in despair and death, but it felt like a lot was left hanging. I felt that most of the novel was constructed very well, but I didn't get that feeling by the end.I also now know that Andrew Dice Clay could've scored a respectable country lady if he had lived 100 years ago.I felt that there was a conflict between Connie and Mellors that was only touched on but not played out: she was quite in love with him for his crude way of discussing sex and his \\"tenderness\\" in lovemaking, but he never appeared to feel very deeply for her. At times, he even sounded dismissive of any feelings at all. And the vulgar way in which he talked to her hardly sounded like a great lover but more of a disrespectful player, so it was hard to want to see these two end up together.(I also questioned Mellors' honesty at the way he kept turning on and off his accent).I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't put it up with MADAME BOVARY or even Henry Miller's TROPIC OF CANCER.But I will buy the DVD of the English mini-series directed by Ken Russell and check that out."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the \\"sturdy\\" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands. Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent. A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her. In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of \\"his\\" child. He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist. Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper. Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically. The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her. To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life. Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government. Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living. The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader. Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. Mary WhippleWomen in Love: Cambridge Lawrence Edition (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I opened this book expecting litle more than a fleshed-out porno movie, since it was, after all, the subject of one many years ago and was well thumbed in my high school library, but only at the sexy parts. What a surprise for me to discover a harsh critique of British class structure, the industrial revolution, artists and intellectuals, and self-gratifying sex.Yes, there are explicit sex scenes. Yes, he uses some language that must have been extremely shocking in its time. But my, oh my--if everybody on this planet made love the way Mellors and Constance Chatterly did, with awareness, and tenderness, and absolute vulnerability--well then, I won't go so far as to say we would have world peace, but I bet we'd be a heck of a lot happier.This book is not a great piece of literature. It offers a grim picture of an earlier England by somebody obviously disenchanted with it, a great harpooning of Robin Hood forests, the upper crust, and literary snobs. It's a bit ponderous here and there, and the seasonal metaphors are a bit sophomoric. Still, it was the Lawrence's final book, and embodies a lifetime of thinking about sex, the body, and the spirit. Worth the read!"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I read Lady Chatterly's lover for the first time in high school, and to be honest, it was more for the juicy bits than anything else. Five years later, though, it was an aside from a professor during a lecture on Nabokov that convinced me to pick it up again.This was the first novel that I'd read where I truly felt an inner conflict brewing - but in a good way. Lady Chatterly's Lover, though banned for its immorality on its publication, is a book that will force a person to question their own morality and moral judgements, and perhaps rethink them.It is a story of a young woman married to an older man who is confined to a wheel chair due to a war wound. Her husband and she have a respectful relationship, though she does not love him, and though he may love her, he is not particularly attentive. To cure her boredom and satisfy her libido, she turns to adultery. Her first lover is a egotistical Irish writer, but she leaves him quickly over \\"performance\\" issues. She finds herself attracted to Oliver, the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. They continue the affair under the nose of her husband, who, afraid that she will leave him, pretends not to notice.Lawrence's writing is sublime, to say the least. His descriptions of the estate are picture perfect, and each scene is told almost cinematically. The characters are perfectly developed; you can feel Lady Chatterly's inner turmoil in the beginning of the novel as she copes with caring for her husband and her unsatisfied libido, without any social outlets but her husband's friends. As she begins her affair with Oliver, you notice how that tension that she held is slowly released - and how her husband, paralyzed and coping with a wife who spends less and less time with him, absorbs this tension. Beautiful read."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"On the whole, I would say that this book is considered a classic mostly because of its legendary troubles with the censors. Don't get me wrong - it was an alright book, interesting enough to hold my attention for the most part. However, I don't think that I'll be recommending it any time soon.First off, I agree with the other commenters about Lawrence's basic lack of knowledge about female anatomy. My god. It's as if there's nothing at all that Clifford could have done for Connie. And apparently Connie is (in Lawrence's eyes) the apex of womanhood because she's one of the (very) few who can reach climax without any clitoral stimulation. Jesus christ, this isn't a book about sex. It's a book about misinformation!Aside from that, what do we have?We have Connie, who's barely sympathetic as a protagonist. I'd put her somewhere between Emma Bovary and Anna Karenina on the sympathy scale. On the one hand, who can't sympathize with her situation? She's trapped in an essentially joyless life. On the other hand, she's also a terrible snob. Witness the way that she looks down on the people of Tevershall - \\"Oh, everything is good and beautiful in Ye Olde English Woode where I screw my husband's gamekeeper, but that dirty dirty little town with all those hunched-over people who work for a living... how disgusting!\\"And then we've got Mellors, who, quite frankly, I found kinda annoying. Is it just me, or does he come off as somewhat mentally deficient? Whenever he lapsed into \\"broad,\\" I always imagined him talking like some kind of Scottish version of Cookie Monster.And the ranting, oh my god, the ranting. Ok, Lawrence, we GET IT. Mellors is supposed to be the Man O' The Woods. The Green Man. The Great Horned God. Pan. But did you really have to spell it out for us in heavy handed sermons before and after every sex scene? Couldn't you have left just a little for us to figure out for ourselves?Really, the only character who I kinda liked was Clifford. Sure, he was pathetic. But he knew it. He knew that he was, quite literally, the last of a dying breed. At the same time, though, he had a detached sort of irony, and that great British gift of understatement. You got the feeling that he was smart, and maybe even had a sense of humor. Who knows, perhaps this character would have seemed more terrifying back in the day, back when the British aristocracy was still kind of a threat to someone.Oh yeah, and that one scene where we're really supposed to hate him? The one where his wheelchair gets stuck up on the hill? I actually felt kinda sorry for him there.Ultimately, I'll say this about Lady Chatterly's Lover - I like what Lawrence was trying to do, but I don't really feel like he pulled it off. He makes some valid points about getting in touch with our physical, emotional, and spiritual natures. However, this gets obscured by some of his personal prejudices, as well as his total lack of understanding about women and their anatomy."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"People are often confused about sex, not only when this novel was written, but even in this seemingly oversexed era.DH Lawrence wrote this lyric and sensual book, where the heroine Lady Chatterley, who was well-born and well bred, happens to be married to an invalid, whose injuries were sustained in World War I. Her husband is a baronet, Sir Clifford.The love interest in the book is Sir Clifford's gamekeeper. Connie Chatterley is not a virgin when she has this affair, but Mellors, (the gamekeeper) awakens her to life, to higher consciousness that comes with tender lovemaking.It would be insultingly simplistic to say that Lawrence believed lovemaking is really the solution to the poison of industry, mechanization, and lack of awareness and connectedness to one's environment. Although the invalid and sexually incapable Sir Clifford is a symbol of the impotence of modern mechanization, Lawrence believed that lovemaking is only the solution when it's done right. In other words, with tenderness. The author was certainly not advocating misogyny or meaningless sex. He was saying, with sexual love where the lovers have body awareness, as opposed to cerebral awareness, which is from the mind, only part of the body.Do we have too much sex in our age? What Lawrence would probably say, is that we have too much cerebral sex. We are not connected to our lovemaking.This book is not pornography. Any one who believes that it is porno should read Lawrence's essay entitled \\"Pornography\\", where Lawrence ridicules pornography. Why? Because it does dirt on sex; it makes sex look dirty. In reality, pornographers hate sex; they make it look ugly and trite.In a digital internet age, like the industrial age of the 1920s, there is no connectedness with the body and the world. Our age is filled with pornography but not filled with the kind of sex Lawrence believed in. The search continues."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I picked upLady Chatterley's Lover (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (Barnes & Noble Classics)from Amazon for $6.95. In the absence of an available Everyman's Cloth Edition, the B&N; is likely the way to go. In terms of supplemental material it is quite comparable to this: (Lady Chatterley's Lover (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)). These materials are:1. Brief Author bioptic2. Chronology3. A lengthy (23 pages) and diverse Introduction by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a well credentialed professor of English at Adelphi University (NY).4. Brief footnotes to explain slang / obscure terms5. Thorough Endnotes for references (9 pages)6. Brief comments by thirteen well known writers.7. Four provoking discussion questions8. Bibliography for further reading.The novel centers on the Love affair of the Aristocratic Constance Chatterley. Unique at the time it was released, Lawrence's book, rather than condemning the extra-marital affair, Lady Chatterley and her lover, the groundskeeper Mellors, are in fact spiritually healed from their experience together. In an increasingly industrialized and uniform world, laden with class lines and arbitrary social norms; Lawrence holds that people have become alienated from and ashamed of their bodies; they've forgotten that love between two individuals can spark a sensation of life so primordial that it cannot but be right to pursue.Originally deemed pornographic, Lady Chatterley's Lover may still shock some readers with its frank portrayal of sexual intercourse. The sex-language is much more apparent than it is in Sons and Lovers. Readers who have aversions to seeing words for body parts may be offended. It is all done in good taste, but still must be called R-rated. Likely, it will be offensive to only a small few.Lawrence's writing style consistently flows at a level near perfect. Sometimes there are certain phrases that frequently get repeated; some would say too often, others would point out that this is also the case in real life. I find his prose to be perhaps his ultimate strength.One complaint I have with this book as well as Sons and Lovers, (though it might be deemed trivial) would be his selection of topics. He's always writing about love and relationships. I guess I just prefer topics like Crime, War, Travel, and other general areas of life. Just me though. Still--quite surprisingly--I enjoyed reading Lady Chatterly. Its frank display of love makes it relevant today; while other older novels avoid the actual act as if it were the plague.I find much truth is contained in Lawrence's philosophy about primal instincts, his observations about industrialism, and his suggestions (however one may interpret them) about feminism (a great discussion point for this, his last, book)."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"D.H. Lawrence daringly wrote about sexual mores in this novel, to an extent that his socioeconomic theme may have been lost by many of the readers.Constance Chatterly - affectionately depicted as Connie or Lady Chatterly - is the highlight and nightmare to her husband, Lord Chatterly. After a whirlwind marriage and honeymoon, the lord returns to Word War I's catastrophe and is \\"shipped home smashed.\\" He is a paraplegic for life, and someone who cannot provide an heir to his family's estate: Wragby.While confined to the walls of the stately mansion, she is effectively a widow who will never know her sexuality. But she is not alone as one friend tells her, \\"You have to snivel and feel sinful or awful about your sex, before you're allowed to have any.\\" Sex is a suppressed sin - not an appreciated act.Her lover concedes women are no fun. \\". . . the mass of women are like this: most of them want a man, but don't want the sex, but they put up with it, as part of the bargain.\\" In reflection, being married to a paraplegic may be a blessing to those very women.But, her lover discovers fun with sex, and vice versa. They actually conjoin in orgasm. Lawrence writes about this, he writes about their propinquity of flesh, of cuddling and more. In return, England banned publication of this until 1960. Almost 32 years this book was shelved by the prurient aristocratic publishers who cringed when reading about the sex, and the details of the same.But, Lawrence's statement is stronger. Lady Chatterly does not have sex with one of her class - no she opts for one of the servants of the manor. Oliver Mellors, a bloke who chooses to speak in Derby accent instead of proper English (which he is capable of doing) lights a flame to her inner hay stack. And, she goes wild.Although married to be a Lady, Connie is not from such top-notch stock. But, she is still greater than a commoner, and her sister Hilda remarks about their tryst as \\". . .how impossible it is to mix one's life with theirs. Not out of snobbery, but just because the whole rhythm is different.\\"Those people, the colliers or coal miners, are the people who work the colliery owned by Lord Chatterly. He effectively supplies income to every person's house - at least enough to keep them fed and housed, while they toil in the depths of his mines' bowels in disgusting filth and horrible conditions.Lawrence saw his father in such mines, but saves us from learning too much of the daily toil - this is not a revelation of bad working conditions like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\" But, this is a statement about social injustice, like Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\"In the end, all good comes of a bad situation. The commoner is anything but common and Connie's daddy sits and drinks with this potential Gold Digger and leaves the pub slapping the man on the back and opening his heart and soul to the man who somehow managed to have his daughter leave the comforts and prestige of Magbry.Scenes like that at the pub remind me that Lawrence obviously read Dickens - like probably all his peers did. And, his novel is comparably great as it hits the forefront of not only social injustice, but attacks Victorian restraints on sex, much like other great novelists of England - including Virginia Woolf. But, he attacked such social conservatism head on. This book is a leader of its time."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"a contest as to how many words can be used to describe trivia. very little story encased in a mountain of words"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I'm over half-way through the book and I'm struggling not to just throw it away.

Now, my hubby gave me that book and easy reading for it is on my kindle"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I love books that have been contested, debated, and banned.Now, Lady Chatterley is certainly a bit of a wild woman for her times. Don't go into LCC expecting it to be all that racy by modern standards, and it certainly is not a feminist novel.I think there's quite a bit to the book, but it's not one of the books that changed my life. It certainly was not a female empowerment book- rather, it's all about the power of manhood. At least, that's what it seemed like to me. Even though, there are some gems in there.One of my favorite things about LCC is how Lawrence seems to obsess over legs. Intimate scenes usually have some sort of reference to legs, and there are a few paragraphs dedicated to legs. For example, one of my favorite quotes:\\"The more I live, the more I realize what strange creatures human beings are. Some of them might just as well have a hundred legs, like a centipede, or six, like a lobster.\\"Connie, after leaving home to go on a trip, seems to develop a fascination with legs. The meaninglessness of legs. Sure, this might be a reflection on her own husband's disability, but at the same time it made me think about... legs. Because of LCC, I stare at people's legs now. And I judge them for it.\\"Connie woke up to the existence of legs. They became more important to her than faces, which are no longer very real. How few people had live, alert legs! She looked at the men in the stalls. Great puddingy thighs in black pudding-cloth, or lean wooden sticks in black funeral stuff, or well-shaped young legs without any meaning whatever, either sensuality or tenderness or sensitiveness, just mere leggy ordinariness that pranced around.... The awful mill-posts of most females! really shocking, really enough to justify murder! Or the poor thin pegs! or the trim neat things in silk stockings, without the slightest look of life! Awful, them illions of meaningless legs prancing meaninglessly around.\\"You will never look at legs the same way."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"What I most like about Lawrence is he never ends the story at the end of the novel because life itself is open ended. You close the book wondering what happenned after the story. What a violent love letter at the end, how real a love story can be. It is not a fairy tale. But shocking truth about love, sex, women and men."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This is a beautiful novel that is fragile yet steel-strong. The emotions of its characters are extremely well-developed, for e.g. Connie's dogged loyalty towards Clifford in the beginning turns slowly into doubt, and finally into contempt. This is a novel about the path to freedom, not only sexual freedom, but freedom from pressure, from rules, from the chains of life and society. Although there are only 3 main characters: Connie, Clifford and Mellors, this book does not bore me. Some authors may kill the novel when handling so delicate a subject, but Laurence not only allows the emotions of his characters to live, but also gives them room for expression. Connie's sexual desire is placed in the context of an England that is slowly being brutalised by industrialism, and the author expresses his horror against this world we had created through the eyes of Connie. As Connie is slowly being suffocated by her husband, I feel, surprisingly, not hate for Clifford, but a strange pity. This book sparks neither love nor hate for its characters, but the reader is able to weigh them at their true value. In this way, the novel itself is never overpowered by the strength of its characters. The author allows us to find our own freedom while Connie seeks hers. This book improves with a second reading. At first the characters seem rather detached, but later they fitted out wonderfully. The language, of course, is beautiful. Everyone is in their own way suffocated by something, and that is why as a teenage reader I can relate myself to Lady Chatterley."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This fine book is often overlooked as a commentary on the class structure that separates Connie and Mellors. Crude as he appears, his senses are in some ways more refined than hers, and by sexually enslaving her, he turns convention on its head. The falsity of the social divisions between them makes the reality of their love even more intense. I've recommended this book to Sociology and History students studying this period, and they have thanked me for helping them understand the complexity of inter-class relations in a painless and entertaining way."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Consuming and conscience prodding.Vivid flowing narrations though the writer's objective to include simple scripts did little to undermine the thinly veiled guise of an otherwise shocking and profound story.Good read."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"D.H. Lawrence's most contraversial and classic book, an essential for anyone remotely interested in D.H. Lawrence and modern literature. It is, really, one of the first modern/contemporary novels, (along with Dostoevsky and Somerset Maughaum)although it still has a Victorian feel to it.His book is almost prophetic, in a way. Lady launches the world into the likes of many modern writers (Henry Miller, Hemmingway, me). I'm not saying Hemmingway or Miller couldn't hold their own or write the way they did without Lawrence's influence. But, he did establish a less &quot;popper&quot; feel you get with Austen, the Brontes, Dickens, etc. Lady showed true equality and the absurdity of some traditions of class staus.The only drawback with this novel, and other of Lawrence's books, is how similar the characters and language is in his books. In certain sections of his book(s) he'll overuse words. For example, in Lady and in The Rainbow, for about 50 pages he'll use &quot;acquiesense&quot; too much.But never us mind that! His are excellent novels, beautiful, thoughtful, and sympathetic. Read it, you'll like it (unless you hate it)."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"For .99 cents who could go wrong.

LawrencePlot:The story concerns a young married woman, Constance (Lady Chatterley)--n&eacute;e Constance Reid--whose upper-class husband--Clifford Chatterley--has been paralyzed due to a war injury. Constance--Connie--was brought along her sister Hilda--amongst intellectuals and had lost her virginity as a teenager. She was a well educated and free spirited woman who could hold her own in a conversation with men.Clifford was a a shy man, who was the younger brother--Herbert being the oldest--and was unhappy with inheriting the money and title when Herbert was killed in WWI. He took a wife at the insistence of his father--Sir Geoffrey--and married Connie, after his sister--Emma--rejected the idea of marrying her own brother. Clifford had a one month honeymoon with Connie, and went to war. He survived it paralyzed from the waist down, thus unable to function sexually and fulfill his obligation of creating a heir to the family.In addition to Clifford's physical limitations, his emotional neglect of Constance forces distance between the couple. Clifford asks Connie to father a child with another man, hopefully from the same social class as the Chatterley's. Connie's sexual frustration leads her into an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel which is the unfair dominance of intellectuals over the working class.The novel is about Constance's realization that she cannot live with the mind alone; she must also be alive physically. This realization stems from a heightened sexual experience Constance has only felt with Mellors, proving that love can only happen with the element of the body, not the mind. thus at the end she decides to leave Clifford and marry Oliver.Comments:In Lady Chatterley's Lover, Lawrence comes full circle to argue once again for individual regeneration, which can be found only through the relationship between man and woman (and, he asserts sometimes, man and man). Love and personal relationships are the threads that bind this novel together. Lawrence explores a wide range of different types of relationships. The reader sees the brutal, bullying relationship between Mellors and his wife Bertha, who punishes him by preventing his pleasure. There is Tommy Dukes, who has no relationship because he cannot find a woman whom he respects intellectually and, at the same time, finds desirable. There is also the perverse, maternal relationship that ultimately develops between Clifford and Mrs. Bolton, his caring nurse, after Connie has left.It is a slow read, bordering on the boring...."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Quite a good read. Hadn't previously thought of reading this sort of book however it was mentioned in another read. Once one becomes used to the writing style and the phrasing used it is very interesting.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"\\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\" is one of the most (brutally) honest portrayals of love and intimacy in 20th century literature. Turning away from the flowery and the poetic sentiments of many other writers, Lawrence completely de-romanticizes romance and shows it as something visceral and almost beastial. Written during the span between the first and second World Wars, when industrialization and mechanization seemed to threaten the essence of humanity, Constance Chatterly can, I think, be seen as an Every-Wo/man character searching for intimacy in a society that was increasingly cold and cerebral. Is it possible to love someone when you are alienated from everyone around you? Can you feel passion when you are nothing more than a cog in the gears of some great machine? These are the central questions asked by Lawrence in this novel and of course they are still relevant today.While \\"Chatterly\\" may not be considered Lawrence's best work, it is still a great book and definitely worth reading. Of course, this novel has flaws - notably the characterization of Mellors, and also the very abrupt ending - but Lawrence's beautiful language (minus the various 4 letter words that appear throughout the text) and his keen understanding of humanity make this work really great. Read this book and consider the romantic relationships in your life and I'm sure you will have a lot to think about."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"The most well-drawn character in this novel is not Lady Chatterley (Connie, an INFP personality type), her lover Mellors, her husband Clifford, Clifford's nurse, or any human. It is Clifford's hometown Tevershall and the surrounding coal district. His home Wragby stands where the great Nottingham Forest of legend once dominated the landscape. Now it is coal -- mines, colliers, colliers' shanties, colliers' towns, and, most of all, money and ennui. It is dead, as seen through the eyes of Mellors and Connie -- dead, lifeless, and grim, slowly sucking away at what is left of humanity and of human tenderness. The only idyllic place is the remnant of the Forest where Mellors is gamekeeper, and even it reeks of the smell of coal and of money and of the folly of money. The colliers and those who command them, the Cliffords, are soulless, dead, and, tellingly, impotent in the most important ways.D. H. Lawrence has a unique voice and tells this tale in a unique way, albeit heavy-handedly in places. His characters' sermon-like conversations are sometimes hard to swallow as realistic. But the frustrations and the spiritlessness of the people are real enough and save the novel from becoming too much of an intellectual exercise or a diatribe. I found myself wishing for the more subtle touch of a Victor Hugo in Les Miserables, another novel in which a human story is told against a larger setting, or even of a Tolstoy, but this is more of a story-in-a-box -- a limited box. Recommended if you can suspend belief a bit; if you are looking for a good story rather than a great one; and if you are looking not for puerile pleasure in Lawrence's liberal smattering of &quot;naughty&quot; words, but for a place to begin start asking the questions. There are no answers here, but there is the foundation for a beginning."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"The use of comic strips lamely summarizing scenes from D.H. Lawrence's \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" came as an unwelcome surprise. The edition itself is excellent, with a fine introduction, authoritative text, maps, notes, and bibliography. But the cover (and a gratuitous list of women the author is alleged to have shagged) is more than disgraceful. What conceivable purpose does this serve? The marketing people at Penguin should think twice before defacing a classic text in this way."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Lady Chatterly's Lover is a philosophical novel that asks questions about values and what makes a good life. In it, D. H. Lawrence considers the intellectual life and finds it arid and unreal. (Here, there is an extended, unflattering discussion of the self-promotion that a successful writer must engage in.) He then considers the effect of technology on modern life and finds that it has diminished our human qualities. Finally, he advocates a return to a simpler life where people will meet their deeper needs rather than seeking the superficial things that money can buy. The author thinks that sex has to play a pretty central role in a complete life, and he's probably right about that, but he has some very specific ideas about sex that sound odd to us now.The author also looks deeply into the dynamics of relationships between men and women and explores what we are like, why we have trouble understanding one another, and how men and women can complement one another.Finally, there is a fair amount of racy language and action that, of course, earned this book its notoriety.I enjoyed this book a great deal and I think that the author's critique of modern ethics deserves some attention. It is a mistake to dismiss this book because of its overtly sexual themes."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"D.H. Lawrence touched raw nerves when this was published because it vividly addressed and described what the upper classes have been doing for ages: Having extra-marital affairs with members of their own class and those of the \\"lower\\" classes.The book does have a few scenes of raw passion and thoughts but Lawrence was merely addressing how people feel in such affairs. He had the courage to put down those emotions into Oliver Mellors, the gamekeeper, and also Lady Chatterley herself.This IS a love story, when you get down to it. From an extra-marital affair there comes love, an awakening of the self (and in Lady Chatterley's case, a child). Apparently, more and more people in today's society are putting their desires first, otherwise, why the high divorce rate? (And the book was given much publicity when it was banned - so much so that this book couldn't land in peoples' hands fast enough. Many \\"illegal\\" copies were made and shipped to England and America, becoming an instant classic.)I give David Herbert Lawrence all the credit in the world to address sex in an age of absolute prudishness.

She soon starts an affair with the gruff estate games-keeper, Mellors.The entire book seems to me a direct attack on industrialisation, keeping with that theme (industrialisation v. nature) in Lord Chatterley and Mellors; Connie (perhaps she is the embodiment of the people in our culture) knows what she wants, but is still torn.There is a small scene where Lord Chatterley takes his motorised chair out into the park, and it gets stuck in the mud. He refuses help from Connie or Mellors several times, but when he finally gives up, he ingraciously orders Mellors (who is ill) to push his chair out of the mud. Connie looks down at the muddy tyre marks, and sees all the crushed little bluebells.It's almost like industrialisation doesn't really work, but we feel like it *must*, so we insist that it's fine and there's nothing else we need acknowledge. Sooner or later, however, we're going to throw our hands up and say \\"Fine! You were right.

Each time I read it I am struck by the relevancy of the topics presented and the startling grace of Lawrence's language. I believe we have much to learn from this book about ourselves. Despite the fact that sex is a rather hum drum topic in today's world the book is still shocking in the brutally honest and beautiful way it presents human relations with each other and the world on the whole.Excellent literature instructs, as well as delights, and Lawrence presents an entertaining, but deep and complex lesson for his readers. Take some time and read the book."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This novel is not the explicit sex book that you have been led to believe. instead it is a flawless masterpiece that tells the story of Charlotte, the sexually deprived wife of an invalid husband and her search for true love and sexual fulfillment. As a woman, I have no idea how Lawrence was able to delve into the female mind so thoroughly, but so he has done. This book is a compelling argument in favor of the belief that sexual attraction is certainly one of the most important aspects when we search for a mate-despite what snobbish types may say about how looks don't matter and good sex and attraction grows with time. Baloney! Charlotte's attraction to Mellors was immediate and we watch her life developing with breathless anticipation. Some may feel the ending is too cute and tidy, but knowing the characters as they are, you feel that it could not have ended any other way. A profound book, thoroughly readable, and shockingly modern for its time."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I often find that a number of classics are highly overrated. I believe this to be true of this novel. That it was written so long ago is what makes it noteworthy. The story often feels drawn out; and, during the course of reading this, I found my mind wandering off. I probably would not recommend this book to anyone, but I might not encourage them to avoid reading it either."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the \\"mental life\\" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of \\"woman\\" or \\"man\\"; and so on.Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's \\"wrong\\" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing \\"that kind\\" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward \\"druglike\\" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a \\"user\\", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a \\"user\\".)It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a \\"real\\" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.A woman who lays there \\"unfeeling\\" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he \\"spoilt\\" her.As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and \\"perform\\". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men \\"want to hear\\". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being \\"sexist\\". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not \\"come to the crisis\\" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as \\"intimacy\\" and \\"connection\\", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman \\"should\\" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.There's a lot of talk of \\"tenderness\\" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow \\"lacking tenderness\\" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.)"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"An interesting, but initially somewhat tedious, discussion about the extremes, middle ground and extent of human relationships, the degrees of interdependence or isolation of individuals all expressed through the seemingly sexual/social relationship of a small group of disparate and stylized characters."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I started reading this book and was not enjoying it at all. It may have been the old english that bothered me or the fact that it just wasn't encouraging me to continue reading with the story that made no sense to me. So I deleted it off of my Kindle and won't bother again."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Lady Chatterley's Lover surprised me. Having read two of Lawrence's other works (The Rainbow and Sons and Lovers), I felt with reasonable confidence prepared for LCL. The Rainbow was beautiful, but plotless to a fault--pages of poetic description broken up intermittently by snatches of dialogue--and I often felt that the book was a slog. Part of this was due to the vibrancy of its characters--I simply wanted more of them than I got.Sons and Lovers, on the other hand, was the opposite. The book was a straightforward novel, and lacked much of The Rainbow's poetry. There was plenty of character development, but most of the characters were either unlikeable or boring. Both of these novels, however, were family stories--they began with a parent protagonist, who was slowly and ineluctably overtaken and replaced by a child protagonist. Ursula Brangwen was intelligent, attractive, and full of fight; Paul Morel was self-absorbed, whiny, and weak.LCL avoids the model of family story, however, and the result is a tighter book without the sprawl of a bildungsroman. The story focuses on the most important event in Constance Chatterley's life: her illicit affair with her husband's gamekeeper, Mellors, and the resulting fallout. Lawrence originally wanted to call the book \\"Tenderness,\\" and it would have worked well; hopefully without spoiling too much, Lawrence feels that there is a special \\"something\\" his characters have, a tenderness, that allows them to fully appreciate the sensuality of the human body, without being subsumed by the mechanical Mammon of industrialized England.LCL's sex scenes are not as racy as they were in the late twenties, but they are real. Bad sex scenes abound in novels, and apparently a good one is very difficult to write; too often the reader gets something ridiculous rather than sexy. Lawrence does it well, however, and many authors could learn a thing or two from him. What I particularly enjoyed was how the scenes between Connie and Mellors mixed high and low rhetoric--while the characters use four-letter words to describe their experiences, the reader gets the rolling of the primordial ocean, and a feeling of esoteric initiation. Sex here is equal parts spiritual and sensual, with the truly sexualized body being a state few people are able to reach.Concerning his treatment of women, Lawrence does indeed hold Constance up as an ideal for other women to aspire to, and she's an ideal many progressive women might take offense at. However, I think the only way one can get furious with Lawrence for this is if one expects Lawrence to do something different. I am often guilty of faulting a book for not meeting my expectations, but Lawrence's vision is strong, and I trust the life within his characters. His ideological standpoint does not offend me--as Tolstoy's eccentric standpoint in The Kreutzer Sonata does not offend me--and I am actually thrilled that Lawrence has something to say, no matter how many contemporary and progressive people he's pissed off in the process. If Lawrence thinks all of Europe is effete, that it's OK to call a woman the C-word, and that simultaneous orgasm is the height of sexual excitement and bliss, then I'm fine with that. D.H. Lawrence is not where I draw the line, and his book was quite excellent."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"***SPOILER ALERT***D. H. Lawrence published Lady Chatterley's Lover in 1928, two years before he died, however the novel wouldn't appear in its unexpurgated form until 1960. The story centres on Lady Constance Chatterley and her affairs with two men. Although the title focusses on the singular lover, Lady Chatterley does engage in two extramarital affairs. Lady Chatterley is married to Sir Clifford, who was paralyzed in World War I and left impotent. The Chatterleys are childless and Sir Clifford gives his wife approval to have a whirlwind affair for the sole purpose of getting herself pregnant to produce an heir to his estate and fortune. I am sure the British censors had reasons to disapprove of the novel on this basis alone, before any sex is depicted at all. Permitting members of the aristrocracy to fool around under the full knowledge of both married parties (early twentieth-century \\"swinging\\") was taboo, regardless who was doing it. Lady Chatterley's Lover also caused so much controversy because it crossed British social classes with Lady Constance's long affair with Oliver Mellors, the estate's pheasant-tending gamekeeper.The language used in the novel is another issue in itself, as Lawrence writes unflinchingly with swear words and depicts various sex acts and sex play. In 1928 England, such writing was considered obscene. I myself was surprised that the foulest language of 1920's England would be so close to what is still said today. The lover in the title, Mellors, feels most at ease when he speaks in his Derby dialect, and Lawrence approximates his speech within the confines of modern typeface with plenty of apostrophes and elisions. It was not difficult to read, and easy to figure out if I read the dialect aloud. Mellors often shifts from dialect to proper and formal English, and often confounds the upper classes by being able to speak to them like a perfect gentleman. Mellors speaks like a college-age drunken sailor when engaging in sex or sex play with Lady Chatterley, and Lawrence's Harlequin Romance euphemisms seem beautiful, and not trite, in their imagery.Over the course of my reading of Lawrence's novels, I have noticed his tendency to write one observation then immediately afterward contradict that point or write its opposite. This is encountered throughout Lady Chatterley's Lover. While Constance sits in on a meeting her husband has with some gentleman friends:\\"She liked to hear what they had to say, especially when Tommy was there. It was fun. Instead of men kissing you, and touching you with their bodies, they revealed their minds to you. It was great fun! But what cold minds!\\"And also it was a little irritating.\\"Clifford, paralyzed and in a wheelchair after the Great War and seeking to find new ways to occupy his time, aspires to fame and fortune by being a successful writer. As he embarks on his literary career:\\"Clifford, of course, had still many childish taboos and fetishes. He wanted to be thought 'really good,' which was all cock-a-hoopy nonsense. What was really good was what actually caught on. It was no good being really good and getting left with it. It seemed as if most of the 'really good' men just missed the bus. After all you only lived one life, and if you missed the bus, you were just left on the pavement, along with the rest of the failures.\\"I wonder if Lawrence projected his own literary aspirations onto Clifford. Lawrence probably felt the pull of mass popularity with mediocre work versus obscurity with well-reviewed, yet unsold, work. I found it amusing that he used William James's term for success, the \\"bitch goddess\\", throughout the novel, in Clifford's quest for fame.Lady Chatterley discovers that she is pregnant by Mellors, and while Sir Clifford did give his consent for her to go out and have a fling for the sole purpose of conceiving, he expressly forbade her to carry on a relationship with whatever man who fathered her child. Lady Chatterley and Mellors decide to divorce their spouses and move away, perhaps to British Columbia (I love the Canadian connection) and when Constance tells her husband of her plans, he is left stupefied, immobile, unable to talk and virtually paralyzed across his entire body when he discovers that the man his wife had been carrying on with was his own servant. The final chapters are filled with tension, drama and suspense. I could not put the book down as Lady Chatterley and Mellors devised ways to save their reputations, try to live discreetly and to counter their critics. The tangled web they wove was a rapid page-turner, and made me sad that the novel was not two hundred pages longer like Sons and Lovers or Women in Love."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I enjoyed reading this since it's an icon among banned books. The story was entertaining, but there were long stretches of blah-blah-blah which I just scanned through. Had absolutely no idea of what the author was saying, and didn't care either.

As another poster observed, the book is full of \\"typos\\" like deity/deny, and/arid, finger/linger, knows/knobs, etc. That was annoying, but the book was cheap so I guess that's what you get for cheap."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"An upscale version of the classic book by D.H.

It was a story of classes and self realization. It was thoughtfully written, though it did drag in many parts. Yes, there are many sexual liasons in the story, but I think the author's intent was to make them part of the natural flow of the story instead of a suggestion. In saying that, it was quite evident the love scenes were written by a man. Mostly very mechanical in description and very cut and dry. A female author would have elongated the love scenes and added a bit more detail. Although the focus of the book has always been the sex scenhes, there is more substance to it than that."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"When I thought of &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover,&quot; images of some late night cable movie came to my head. Because of this, I thought of this as just a novel by Lawrence but not something which was really indicative of his work. I was wrong. This is a very good book.As in &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; Lawrence uses the scenery around the characters to give you an idea of something deeper than the interaction between Clifford, Connie, Mrs. Bolton, and Mellors. Flowers play another large role is showing you what he means.Yes, there is frank talk of sex in the novel. I do not find it crude as the history behind the book would lead you to believe (but then, I am reading it over fifty years after it came out). The way Lawrence deals frankly with his characters in their mannerisms and speech is pure art. Even if you have never been in the exact situation that these people are in, you can see things and experience emotions/frustrations that affect you now.At the end of the book is a short section from Lawrence discussing what he was thinking when he put this work together.

According to me, he was a fine man, more cultured and deep-rooted in character and that he possessed that unusual male strength, much more a man than Sir Clifford, with all his riches and wealth of knowledge. WIth Clifford, it is like a show, a facade performed and worn to please others but deep inside, it is rotten bones and a great failure to appreciate life values. But with Mellors, he represent fresh air and beauty that will never cease with time and age.To be frank, one has to admit that the best part of the story is Lawrence's bold and candid descriptions of the sexual exploits of the star crossed lovers. It's just so very beautiful to celebrate love in this fashion.Whew! What a timeless classic..."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Lady Chatterley's Lover is a beautiful love story written by a great artist. It is by no means only a &quot;sex&quot; story, but portrays two individuals quite sensitively. If one sticks to the surface story, one will probably be quite taken with the beauty of it. But there is an underlying theme here which runs throughout all of Lawrence's work: the idea that the world is a dirty, unpleasant place and that people are always small, disagreeable and nasty and that the solutions to all of life's most pressing problems is orgasm. This is rather silly, to say the least. Certain portions of life can be ugly, but the extent to which Lawrence does so in this novel is really stretching it a bit. It seems like a set-up to me: after showing only the negative portion of life and convincing the reader that this is reality as &quot;it really is&quot;, he springs his stock solution: sex. This seems as absurd to me as trying to grab a handful of air; imagination is at the root of the sexual appetite in humans and this he leaves rather untouched. Intellectualism is also disavowed in prference to a sort of bodily exaltation which leaves one at the mercy of one's physical being without recourse to higher faculties (inlcuding those of control and discipline). It is also interesting to note that in his philosophical position, Lawrence is much closer to Sartre than Camus, who although still a pessimist, finds a great deal of exuberance in the physical world of nature that Lawrence and Sartre tend to reject as ugly and forbidding. The philosophical underpinnings sort of ruin the novel for me, although it may not be noticeable until the second or third read."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the \\"sturdy\\" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands. Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent. A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her. In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of \\"his\\" child. He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist. Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper. Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically. The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her. To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life. Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government. Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living. The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader. Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I did not read this book until ten years ago - age forty for those who count - and found it a brilliant work. It touched on every aspect of life in that era, using a difficult premise at the focus.One reviewer called it 'sexist.' In that era, women were kept removed from the world, so men were the ones who made the initial contacts with reality and their sexuality. If Lawrence had written about that society in any other way, he would have been inaccurate. Lawrence shows the social conflict with both subtlety and brutality. Yet, Mellor IS a lover. There are sexual descriptions which are explicit, but within the coccoon of emotional bondings.The way that Lawrence has essayed the class structure of England in that era is brave and accurate in all ways. He makes the posturing of the aristocracy both frivilous and full of assinine criteria at the same time he understands the willingness of those in power to offer their lives in the defense of the general welfare.Lawrence notes again with unpleasant accuracy the detriments of an unchecked Industrial Revolution on the social structure of the time. He has Constance both witness these effects and suffer the olfactory damage.This is a literary work which has an effect across the full spectrum of the possible. Finely drawn characters searching for a better way to survive their lives in a scenario that is rife with obstacles and unpleasantness. He has the touch of the finest artist working with the lightest gossamer and the blunt force of an ogre swinging a stone axe.This was published in an abridged version because it was felt that the societal message it conveyed should be allowed to transit the draconian (by the less filtered standards of today) censorship of the era which DID focus on the sexual descriptions but could NOT stop the voice of social criticism any more than the same group could stop Dickens a few decades earlier."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"When I first began to read Lady Chatterley's Lover I thought it was going to be quite a chore. I'm used to flowery language and all that, but I just wasn't in the mood for what I anticipated to be a sex-charged love story. Much to my surprise I got MUCH more from this wonderful classic.D.H. Lawrence makes some striking observations about the state of the social classes in post WWI England, as well as providing some good insights into tough individual decisions we make in regard to relationships. I had limited knowledge of the post-war subject beforehand, but I felt that I learned a great deal in the process of reading. At times the book seemed repetitive, as if Lawrence were beating me over the head with his message, sacrificing character and plot in the process, but after all was said and done I couldn't say that it was a bad book. It's a very insightful, multi-layered work and I'm very glad I read it. The fact that the book was widely banned from publication in its early days is just another tempting reason to read it although, by today's standards, what was so risqu&eacute; then borders on the ridiculous for us now. As long as you remind yourself of the time period in which it was written you'll be just fine...the laughs and raised eyebrows in conjunction with more serious themes are a pleasant mix."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I was first introduced to D.H. Lawrence in a Brit Lit class when I was in college. We read SONS AND LOVERS, and I was totally blown away by Lawrence's verdant prose and by the novel's brutal, uncomfortable beauty. My professor mentioned LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER frequently while we were studying Lawrence, and since then I've wanted to read this later, more well-known, more controversial work. Finally, two years after that class, I got around to it.LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER tells the story of a young woman named Constance Reid, who marries Sir Clifford Chatterley when he's home on leave for a month from the battlefields of World War I. After a month of honeymooning, Clifford must return to the war; and sadly, when he returns six months later, he comes home \\"more or less in bits,\\" paralyzed from the waist down. The newlyweds settle at Clifford's family home, Wragby, near the industrialized town of Tevershall.Although Clifford cannot please Constance sexually, he and his wife are intellectually connected; they make love with words, and at first this is enough for Constance. However, a brief affair with one of Clifford's colleagues makes Connie aware of her more carnal needs, of her desire for physical pleasure.Enter Oliver Mellors, the Chatterleys' groundskeeper who lives a life of solitude in a secluded wooded cabin. In Mellors, Connie is awakened to a higher consciousness, to the power of sexual pleasure and mutual satisfaction. Her relationship with Mellors helps her emerge from her cocoon of prudishness to become a highly sexualized being. The affair continues under Clifford's nose, and he is either too inattentive to notice or just pretends not to.As a baronet, Clifford is in a position of power, but he finds himself completely powerless. The mines of Tevershall, which he controls, are dying; and not only is his industry dead, so is his sexuality. He, and his business, are impotent. What makes him so interesting is the almost tender way in which Lawrence portrays him. The scene in which he tries desperately to force his wheelchair's dying motor to roll uphill while Connie and Mellors look on is particularly heartbreaking. Clifford is vain, and he has no use for sex or other things of a physical nature, but he also knows that the only way he can produce an heir is if Connie has sex with another man and allows Clifford to claim the child as his own. His lack of power, and his reaction to the knowledge of it, make him compelling.Unlike Clifford, Connie's other love interest, Oliver Mellors, is confident and unashamed and almost pagan in his celebration of physicality. He's a surprisingly endearing character, a common man with some very intelligent things to say, who isn't intimidated by class boundaries, who doesn't chastise himself for ravishing a married woman.Constance Chatterley is a woman awakening to her sexual self, and Lawrence chronicles her metamorphosis in explicit, sensitive detail. It's suprising how well Lawrence was able to write from a woman's perspective. However, Connie's perception of her ideal relationship near the end of the novel probably didn't quite ring true for many female readers of the time (at least, not that they would admit): \\"Complete intimacy! She supposed that meant revealing everything concerning yourself to the other person, and his revealing everything concerning himself. But that was a bore. All that weary self-consciousness between a man and a woman! a disease!\\" It's observations like this that made LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER so controversial.LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER has probably remained so popular for 80 years because of its sexual content, which was undoubtedly completely immoral for the time period in which is was written. But of course the content is not anything too shocking in today's world of pay-per-view pornography and busty women on the covers of erotic fiction sold in supermarkets everywhere. However, this book shouldn't be bunched into that category, by today's standards or any other age's; I would like to think LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is still popular today because of Lawrence's incredibly brave writing.Lawrence expounds on many controversial ideas in this, his last major novel before his death in 1930. The novel is rife with criticism of post-WWI England and the failures of industrialization to support a growing economy. Lawrence believes sensuality should be the means of connecting with environment, not through the workings of iron and gritty coal. In LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER, industry is impotent; but men and women are sexually alive.My only issue with the novel is that some of the sex scenes are absolutely ridiculous, and read like Lawrence was writing them merely for the shock factor. His language is often unnecessarily crude, and the whole \\"John Thomas\\" and \\"Lady Jane\\" thing is just silly. However, this ridiculousness is balanced nicely with some beautiful, sensual descriptions: Connie's first orgasm, the use of twined flowers to symbolize purity in love, the beautiful language Mellors uses in his letter to Connie at the end of the novel: \\"I love the chastity now that it flows between us. It is like fresh water and rain...like a river of cool water in my soul.\\"It's undeniable that Lawrence's prose is absolutely intoxicating and exciting, and he proves it again and again in the pages of this novel, written even as his life was ending. And that's what makes LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER memorable: not the sex, but the words used to describe the sex. LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is an intimate look at love and sex, a novel whose popularity has remained for 80 years--and probably will remain far into the future, and rightfully so."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover remains infamous for the explicit description of sexual encounters between a upper class housewife and a laborer, and eventhough it features among the top lists of the novels written in last centuty, like many others I started reading it with suspicision. What I found was a world with vividly described characters, a frank writing to the degree it talks about all aspects of human emotion, and sexual ones too. Unlike the mainstream writers before him, Lawrence writes a powerful and passionate novel, full of sensuality and natural bursts of energy. So in some respects it is a mature novel, but it if neither porno, nor as sexual by modern standards as it was made out to be in early last century. In fact, by present standards, it does not shock any grown ups, maybe can provide the shock shared by people in 1930s and 1940s to enthusiastic readers in late teenage or early twenties, or for someone whose diet was entirely Victorian before this.So after you get through and over with your own the prejudices and the infamous part, you start to see why Lawrence is one writer from the last century you just should not miss. His description of nature, of forests, of people, emotions, thoughts and actions of both men and women, his references to class struggles, his lyrical style and most importantly the similies swept me off my feet. His words move before your eyes, recreating beautiful imagery, reconstructing (the infamous) Connie, the laborer Mellors or Connie's cripple husband Clifford as completely humanly, falling, fearless or failing, sexually charged or bored or incapable, imaginative, passionate or hateful, lively, lusty or invalid, very lifelike people! The choice of these three characters provides him the ideal meat to create such beautiful poetic, intense prose. So much so, that after finishing this novel you rush off to the store and find yet another Lawrence level. (Picked Rainbow, was equally delighted and amazed:), but that is another story)!I think the most important part of this novel is the sheer brilliance of the style in which it is written. Poetic short sentences, with astute comparisons and frank expression, run from sentence to sentence, and sway you in a strong current of his writing, while you are not only enjoying the ride, but also noticing the beautiful, changing, evolving scenery that you encounter at each instant. This is indeed a rich novel, packed with a natural beauty of human emotions and likes and dislikes, with poetic fervor of the writer that will grip any reader with the beauty of his prose. Unlike most other famous novels, this novel is written in simple English, is short in length, readable at breakneck speed, though so charged and passionate that you have to stop to breathe every few pages, and very open and direct, and yet has exceedingly introspective characters, the progression of their thoughts and feelings are inetgral part of the novel.Read it. Sexuality is no more than found on any adult rating moved these days. Beauty of prose one of the best of the authors of last century. If you have always loved 19th century authors, read most of the romantic classics by Bronte sisters, Austen, Dickens or Thackerey, read this novel and notice why Lawrence shocks and yet the brilliance of his work soon shifts the spotlight to his name into one of the most important novelists of last century."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Constance Chatterley's gamekeeper, Mellors, brings out the animal in Her Ladyship, and he extends the protection to her that he does to all the wild game in the wood. It is Mellors himself who, in the end, understands that his own baronet, Sir Clifford, is the greatest threat to his most vulnerable charge. Constance's own father, Sir Malcolm, fails utterly to appreciate the situation when he refers to Mellors as the quintessential poacher himself. Sir Malcolm's mistake is that he, along with all of polite society, fails to recognize that humans are, in fact, animals, and that the thrill of conjugal intimacy unites us with all other fauna. We strayed from this notion long ago, with Plato extolling virtuous love, and referring to passions and desires as evil (Book IX of the Phaedrus).Sir Clifford, who is impotent as a result of war injuries, suggests to his wife that she have a discrete affair in order to produce an heir to the estate. \\"I don't care who his father may be as long as he is a healthy man not below normal intelligence.\\" His admonition that Connie be careful not to fall in love in the process foreshadows his tragedy. When we see the gamekeeper, Mellors, placing pheasant eggs into the nests of chickens, in order that they may be reared by surrogate hens, we know, before any of the protagonists themselves, just who Lady Chatterley's surrogate husband will be. Ultimately Connie discovers that Mellors has that rarest of qualities in a man; he enjoys making love only when his partner enjoys it, too. These feelings are a sharp contrast with her experience, and they are both immediately ensnared in a tense carnal conspiracy.In the process, we are treated to D. H. Lawrence's craft:\\"Both sisters mixed with...the young Cambridge group, the group that stood for 'freedom' and flannel trousers, and soft shirts open at the neck, and a well-bred sort of emotional anarchy..., and an ultra-sensitive sort of manner.\\"Tevershall village had \\"rows of wretched, small begrimed brick houses with black slate roofs for lids, sharp angles, and willful blank dreariness.\\"One attraction of her first lover, Michalis, is that he had his own ideas and stated them clearly; \\"he didn't merely walk round them with millions of words, in the parade of the life of the mind.\\"Sir Clifford \\"seemed alert in the foreground, but the background was like the Midlands atmosphere, haze, smoky mist.\\"Before her affair with Mellors, Connie saw sex as \\"just a cocktail term for an excitement that bucked you up for a while, then left you more raggy than ever.\\"Connie realizes of Clifford that, \\"like many insane people, his insanity might be measured by the things he was not aware of: the great desert tracts in his consciousness.\\"\\"She saw her own nakedness in his eyes...\\"This book will not titillate the reader of 2008 as it did the reader of 1928. The reaction against it then exposed both widespread hypocrisy and a scientifically illiterate, pre-Kinsey society which extolled Platonic values, and in the process denied the incomparable delight of primitive carnal intimacy."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Constance Chatterley, a beautiful and passionate woman, is deeply unhappy in her marriage to Sir Clifford Chatterley who became an invalid after having been injured in the First World War. His physical condition is mirrored in Constance's emotional paralysis. When she meets the gamekeeper Mellors, she finds refuge in his arms and feels regenerated. Together they shield themselves from the chaos of the outer world and move to the sanctum of the inner world of fulfilment.The character of Constance is an interesting one because there is a certain complexity in her: she is both in touch with nature, yet educated; sensitive, yet wise; female in her sensitivity, yet almost male in her strength and attitude. She is a woman with a social position who is drawn to an outsider of a lower class. The structure of the novel is also interesting because it shows three stages in Constance's relationship with her husband and Mellors. In the first phase, she denies her husband, responding to a failed marriage, she finds refuge with Mellors. Then begins the second stage when Constance regenerates in the peaceful world of her lover's hut. Finally in the third stage, she escapes the world of Wragby Hall as she leaves for a holiday to Venice. There she takes the resolution never to return to Clifford's world. This resolution is taken all the more easily by Constance because being away from Wragby Hall she can reconsider her commitment to Mellors while their relationship is gradually exposed as a scandal which really prevents her from returning to her husband. Then the novel's central struggle shifts from that between a Lady and a gamekeeper to that between Constance's and Mellor's commitment to each other and the forces hostile to their relationship.Constance's transformations occur in an set of tensions and an artistic dualism: tenderness against apathy, nature against culture, wood against stone, flesh against intellect, frankness against manipulation or fertility against sterility. These tensions strongly mark the first phase of the novel where Wragby Hall symbolises sterility and spiritual and emotional apathy, will and intellectual control; the hut symbolises the free play of the instinct and sensual pleasure, the haven of tenderness. The two worlds cannot interact: Clifford intrudes into nature with his mechanical wheelchair as much as Mellors is an intruder and outsider inside Wragby Hall. Perhaps the most striking opposition is that between silence and talk. As Constance and Mellors retreat into the sheltered world of the hut, the author insists on the stillness and the silence of the place, focuses on the internal and emotional feelings since both characters are fugitives from \\"the outer world of chaos.\\" That's why enclosures are so present in the novel: the hut, the clearing, the cottage, an enclosed yard, a bedroom, as many shelters from psychological suffering. Mellors is \\"afraid of society\\" whereas Constance recoils from the \\"insanity of the whole civilised species.\\" They both linger in pure silence, even anonymity since they hardly ever call each other by name.D.H. Lawrence's critics have deplored the numerous love making scenes in which Constance and Mellors induldge and which are described in a surprisingly open language, considering the epoch in which the novel was published. But these scenes show how Constance is \\"reborn\\", how sex is the act that most completely unites a man and a woman and its power of renewal is attuned to day, season or year - it is in this novel the most regenerative experience possible. There is indeed strong hope that John Thomas will be reunited with lady Jane in the future! In this sense, \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" ranks among the 20th century most extraordinary achievements."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"As with any good novel there are several levels on which this book may be read. Taken factually, here a woman forsakes her incapacitated husband and takes the gamekeeper of their estate as her lover. Pretty ugly scenario! How can such a cruel action be justified? Lawrence is not afraid to take on this formidable challenge.To some people there is absolutely no issue here. When you marry, you commit yourself exclusively to your mate. Period! Case closed! But in real life, the matter is not so simple, unless you choose to make it so.On a deeper level a marriage inherently has hidden strings attached. It requires an honest effort by both partners to commit to the marriage, to sense their partner's needs, and to respond to them honestly and with sensitivity. If one mate is not perceptive, not doing their part, not &quot;truly interested&quot; in the marriage, then the marriage is in reality already dissolved, albeit not legally. This was the case with Lady Chatterly and her husband. It was also the case with the gamekeeper and his wife. Lawrence had to courage to recognize and to address this marriage problem, which probably is more common today than we would care to admit.The level at which I most liked this novel was in the descriptions of the actual physical encounters between the Lady and her lover. I have not counted them but there are perhaps four or five, all under different circumstances, all resulting in different degrees of satisfaction. Which suggests to me tht the sex act, in itself, is an almost neutral event. What gives it meaning are the attitudes and sensitivities that its participants bring to the occasion.At its deepest level sex is a reverent act, a sacrament. It is an uncompromising, fully trustful yielding of one's body to the care and love of another person. The result can be the most glorious feeling a human can experience. It can also be the most degrading feeling in the world. In this novel Lawrence follows the Lady and her lover through their progressing relationship. The novel can serve the reader as an inspiring view of the great beauty and joy that a loving relationship may eventually engender.Should teenagers read this book? In my opinion, no. Nevertheless, they will. But, like Shakespeare, they will not be able to absorb its wealth. I encourage them to save its reading for their later years when they are trying to bring new riches to their lives. Sort of like saving the icing on the cake, and eating it last. I think Lawrence would like that."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"One can learn so much from Lawrence's wonderful sense of feminine intuition about people, love, circumstance, politics, environment and the choices humans make, that one read of this book is simply not enough. Personally, I have read this book eight or nine times (usually once a year)and never tire of Lawrence's insight into human nature and why we do the things we do. Don't let the title fool you. This book is much less about sex than it is about us taking charge of our own destiny and not letting the machinery of life bog us down. If you are at a crossroads in your life, you must read this book. If not, you will still enjoy this novel greatly. It is highly recommended. If I could, I would give it ten stars!"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"A 'Novel' Guest Review By Leigh WoodAfter one too many viewing's of the 1992 BBC production of Lady Chatterley, I finally broke down and read the book. I thought the 1928 unedited version of Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence would be a tough book to find. Expensive, rare, old leather, smelly, buried in an antiquarian store-that type of book. Indeed I was very pleased to find the 1928 Unexpurgated Oriali Edition in paperback at my local Borders. $4.95!I wrapped Mists of Avalon as quickly as possible and avoided watching the film before I plunged into Lover. I read other writers' criticisms on D.H. Lawrence and his works before purchasing the book, and I knew the book and movie didn't have the same ending. Of course, I also knew the book's controversial reputation and supposedly salacious use of naughty words and torrid sex talk. My edition opened with forwards and introductions detailing the book's tough road to publication and the aftermath of censorship. Although this story is fairly well known in literary circles, this introduction is informative, with details and facts on the books printing, pirated editions, and trial information. Even if one was a toe towards prudish, you can't not be interested in reading Lady Chatterley's Lover after these words of praise.Although the 1992 adaptation by Ken Russell is quite faithful, Lawrence's work is naturally bigger and more detailed than what can be translated to the screen. I noticed many cases where the film had taken word for word from the book, and also where scenes had been combined or moved and relocated for the film. Still, much was remaining to surprise me. After her Baronet husband's paralysis during World War I, young Constance Chatterley begins to question her mundane existence as Lady of Wragby Hall and nursemaid to her crippled husband. They are educated and literate, but as she listens to her husband and his friends chit chat about war, sex, society, and money, Connie becomes more and more disenchanted with her upper class standing. After a very dissatisfying affair with playwright Michaelis, Connie begins a saucy love affair with her husband's gamekeeper Olivier Mellors. Despite the fear of being caught and societal pressures upon them, Connie and Mellors continue to meet. When the scandal comes out, they take measures to secure a life together, despite the class divisions against them.The great part of Lady Chatterley's Lover is the love discovered between the titular characters, so I was intrigued by the intitial Michaelis relationship. We learn much about Connie intellectually and sexually through this affair, internal thoughts and disappointing feelings that can't be show onscreen. I've read other fans commentaries online about Joely Richardson's performance as Lady Chatterley in the BBC version. Women sometimes find her portrayal conceded and flaky. Connie has nothing to loose, where Mellors has everything to loose. In the novel, this is certainly not the case. Connie is already nothing, an emotionless drone whose stature gives her nothing.Likewise the Mellors in print has everything to gain. His backstory is greatly detailed by Lawrence, yet he maintains his strong silent and mysterious air. Once on officer during the war and a well educated pupil then tutor, Mellors could have the upper class at his fingertips, yet he chooses to be left alone. This book is not just about sex. Our couple is disenchanted with war, industry, money, and the people around them who think that those things give meaning to life. Some of Mellors' dialogue is written in dialect and for an American like me, it took a double take at first. However, Mellors can also speak perfect English, and does so when he chooses, not when people expect it of him. In fact, his speech is often broken when he thinks it will upset people, such as Connie's image conscious sister Hilda.Lawrence spends a great many of the early chapters discussing artists and their self important selves, yet it is a great and subtle revelation when Connie discovers books in Mellor's house. Its often claimed not to be Lawrence's best work, but Lady Chatterley's Lover intricately weaves the love story between Connie and Mellors with multiple commentaries from Lawrence. Without being too obvious with his author views, Lawrence questions the English post war Jazz society and classes as well as the later artistic society Lawrence often found himself outcast from. This catch-22 is again mirrored in the novel. Where Connie and Mellors affair crosses class divides and angers their entire community, her husband Clifford's unusual relationship with his nurse Mrs. Bolton is entirely acceptable. I love Charles Dickens for his veiled or outright social commentaries, and I dare say Lawrence is on par here in asking those same society questions. Who decides these social barriers and imobilities? Why are some invisible to these restraints via power, position, and money? What is the right reason to circumvent these divides and do something about oneself?Lady Chatterley's Lover has kept me thinking about itself long after I've finished the book. I'd like to read it again and find answers to these questions. Although it is a thorough British book in time and place, Lover also presents very modern thoughts and conjecture. After Lawrence's difficulty with self publishing and piracy, the book was banned until a 1960 obscenity trial. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't find the book all that shocking. Was it because I was familiar with the film version, or is it because the book perhaps caused our current liberal ideas and desensitizing? Four letter words and sex talk have always existed, but Lawrence's honest treatment of the subjects opened a Pandora's box on erotica, pornography, nudity, and bad words in art, literature, and film. I can't say the same for other works, but Lover is actually a very tasteful book, rather innocent in a way. The rebirth of the main characters through their love for one another. Lawrence was tempted to call the story \`Tenderness' and the title would have fit.Although the work speaks for itself when it comes to sex, society, and even religion, my edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover came with \`A Propos on Lady Chatterley's Lover' by D. H. Lawrence himself. After finishing the book on a positive note, I was disappointed in this thirty page essay. One should always let his work speak for itself, and there's no need for this redundant and overlong speech from Lawrence. From World War I to Christianity, Lawrence's essays should be cut in half or is perhaps better for a college classroom discussion.If you're looking for porn or sexual gratification, you won't find it in Lady Chatterley's Lover. Most certainly the book is not for everyone, and if frank sexual talk and situations is not your cup of tea, do skip this read. I'lm a fairly straight laced individual, and I only second guessed the book once. In Chapter 16 or 19, I thought the anal sex euphuisms were getting a bit redundant. I giggled a few times over the language, but was moved by other beautiful descriptions from Lawrence. At first I looked for Lover in Borders' small erotica section, but Lawrence's works are found in the general fiction section and in the classics section at my local library.Lady Chatterley's Lover is by no means for children or prudes, but it is a fine novel that has transcended time and place. We may be too loose or vulgar in our society today-celebrities with wardrobe malfunctions and half naked women in music videos. Lover and the books in its wake may have caused this openness, but the book also reminds me of the good things about he past. Women wore gloves, men tips their hats to all, and writers wrote great books."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"A classic book that colors the cheeks with its portrayal of a lady-of-the-manor and her gardener having an affair. I read this is college and enjoyed it, so when I saw it on my Kindle list I had to purchase it. It may have been outlawed back when it was published, but I am glad it is back and available for purchase. It was nice reading a story that left some things to the imagination and didn't feel the need to write every erotic detail."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"i have heard about this book for a long time and finally sat down to read it. it caused alot of scandal whenit was first written in 1928 due to it's descriptions of sex in the book...and my opinion is...(ahem) whencompared to the paperback romance novels of today,it is rather tame,probably a \\"PG 13\\" or maybe rated \\"R\\".i thought the story itself was a bit bland and that is not to say it is badly written,it is quite good but,ijust din't get too involved with it. for people who have not read it,it is the story of constance who ismarried to clifford (who is in a wheelchair). constance has an affair with named mellors(a groundskeeper).d.h.lawrence the author also injected some social commentary regarding rich versus middleclass,such as a\\"middleclass\\" man should watch out fooling around with a wife of a rich man. oh,there was never any threatstowards mellors,i just think the author included it because it had to do with HIS world at that time.overall,i thought the story was just-\\"eh\\",just ok not,over the top spectacular. i just read it to find outwhat the fuss was about."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"D.H. Lawrence's once-scandalous tale of a married woman who finds herself through an affair with another man Constance Chatterley is a lovely woman in her mid twenties who is married to Sir Clifford Chatterley, a wealthy British nobleman many years her senior who is paralyzed from the waist down due to an injury sustained during World War I. While Constance loves her husband, she has grown weary of her life as a bird in a gilded cage, as well as her husband's lack of affection. One day, Constance steps out to take a walk and pauses to tell Parkin, the estate's groundskeeper, that the cook would like him to shoot a pheasant for the evening's meal. Constance discovers Parkin is only half-dressed, and the physical strength of his body makes a strong impression on her. Parkin senses Constance's attraction to him, and he's equally taken by her beauty; in time the two throw caution to the wind and give in to their mutual passion. Constance blooms through her lovemaking with Parkin, and she finds his simple, rustic individualism is more to her taste than the life her husband has given her. But as Constance embraces her love for Parkin, others become aware of their relationship. Lady Chatterley was adapted from Lady Chatterley et l'Homme des Bois, the second of three versions Lawrence would publish of his best-known novel (it was published in English as John Thomas and Lady Jane)A real gem."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Whilst Lawrence wrote an astounding book for the time, this version needs serious editing. The number of typos destroys meaning and reduces parts to drivel."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"It is difficult to believe that this beautiful novel was once banned in many countries and the subject of a sensational trial in the United Kingdom. In Lady Chatterley's Lover, D.H. Lawrence tells the tale of a young married woman, who after her husband becomes paralyzed from the waist down, becomes increasingly sexually frustrated. While her husband is prepared to look the other way as Lady Chatterley has affairs with those of her own class, all hell breaks loose when love blossums between Lady Chatterley and Mellors, her husbands games keeper. Mellors is by no means a good or perfect man, nor is Lady Chatterley the perfect heroine. However, there is something beautiful about their relationship which is based on sexual compatibility, rather than belonging to the same social class.Despite its reputation for a few well-written, but explicit scenes, Lady Chatterley's lover is a beautiful novel that asks many questions about the British class system and the notion of love being more important than duty or status."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I was afraid this book would turn into an erotic Pride and Prejudice with drawn out subplot and hollow or pretentious characters. They were pretentious but I felt a kinship with each. The social life a wealthy person often experiences in this age is cut down to a few essentials and the characters are well chiseled so they are simple to track. The erotic scenes were surprisingly tame or cut short. There was far more philosophy about life, people, and sex than I anticipated. I enjoyed these sections as much as the sex, though for different reasons. The eroticism is more based on the uncomfortable moments of being naked together or initiating sex. These awkwardly unfolding moments gave a sense of realism mostly gone from modern erotica."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"There is no disputing the creative genius of D.H. Lawrence and Lady Chatterly's Lover is an icon of great storytelling and writing. I think everything that can be said about it has been said. However, I take issue with this Penguin Classics edition (2009)in just one regard. The size of the book which apparently determined the typeface size. It is a handsome and informative production and it seems a shame to have not been more generous with the overall size of the book and the size of the typeface. It is a detail that would possibly encourage more readers of all ages to discover or rediscover this splendid and beautiful story."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I heard a lot about Lady Chatterley's Lover, mainly because many people found it pornographic.

A captivating description also of social and industrial situation in England at that timebetween the two wars. I can only warmly recommend to read the original text to anyone interested in real literture."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"Lawrence really lays bare his soul in this book. It is the story of a ripe, red blooded woman who needs a real man. As usual there doesn't seem enough to go around. Ladies! I hope you all meet a Mellor's in your lives. Gardening is indeed a great trade for aspiring lovers. And You'll love this tale - it was one of Lawrence's best.Lawrence wanted to bring us back to our dynamic center; he hated this celebral world and head sex. His domain was the realm of the body ... And all of its pent up sexual dynamisms. If you read Fantasia of The Unconscious you will be able to access his views right from his teeming intelect. He was perhaps one of the finest writers Britain ever produced and his literary output was prodigious indeed!"},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This was the first book by Lawrence that I ever read, and it made me want to read his other works. Something in Lawrence's style, whether it's his complete and almost unsettling way of capturing human thought and emotion, or his flawless way with language, makes you long to be 'subjected' to his words for another 300 pages.Since Lady C's Lover was the first of his books that I read, I had the idea, not surprisingly, that all of his works would contain that purity and honesty of word choice (aka profanity) that this famous work is ripe with. Don't think this for a minute. When you read Sons and Lovers, Women in Love, and The Rainbow, you will get the feeling that Lady C's Lover was Lawrence's great mental eruption. These other works *tremble* slightly with allusions; VERY subtle allusions. It's as though Lawrence's mind was building up and preparing itself with his other works for what would be Lady Chatterley's Lover. Because, if you haven't read anything by Lawrence and know little about him, you will receive a MASSIVE surprise with this book...either a very pleasant (my case) surprise, or an unpleasant one. If you took offence at Holden Caulfield's language, your mind will scream at the language of Lady C's Lover. What we call 'the F word' in our more self-conscious moments, is used surely more than 100 times in this work. I don't think I've ever seen more straight-out connotations, allusions, imagery, everything, than in this book. It's amazing! At times, you will catch yourself marvelling at how Lawrence must have written it in a white hot fever, unable to stop, but surely knowing just how hard it would be to get this puppy published in his day and age. The work, then, is a brutal piece of honesty written, I feel, for the author's sake more than for the public's. That makes it priceless. It's one of the rare moments when we can view a writer's 'literary soul,' the part of their mind that usually will not surface for fear of not being publishable.Whether you'd describe it as beauty, art it would be a good idea to read Lady Chatterley's Lover so that you can know for yourself what you feel about what is probably one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I adored the sexual freedom of this book, the way it voiced an opinion I've held deep inside without voicing it for fear of sacrilege: intellect is not sustenance enough to live on, rather, it can sometimes drain you of sustenance.Though I dare to call myself feminist, my approval of Mellors denies this -- I suppose the female part of me ignores the intellectual feminist part."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"D.H. Lawerence's book of love in the most remote of settings is both compelling enough to read non- stop, while incorporating cultural aspects of the times. As with many of Lawerence's other novels the parallels to that of his own life are plainly seen. The minning buisness that is the center of Clifford's dwindling fortune and the occupation of his studies further into the novel, is directly linked to the boyhood of Lawerence. As with Oliver Mellors's questionable sexuality, that to was an issue that Lawerence had addressed about himself in his adulthood. Overall the only difficulty is found in the Derbyshire english that is used by Mellors. In all the novel was a very intriguing and well endowed for it's time leading to it's banning in both the U.S. and in Great Britian. Challenging reading for anyone that is intrested in exploring both the historical and the romanticism of the cast system."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"David Herbert Lawrence was born on 11th September 1885 in Nottinghamshire, England, little knowing that he would eventually have much in common with writers as varied as James Joyce and Aristopanes.Ulysses by James Joyce was recently selected by the Modern Library as the best novel of the 20th century. Like Aristophanes' Lysistrata and Lawrence's 'Lady Chatterley', it was banned for decades from the U.S. mails under the Comstock Law of 1873. Officially known as the Federal Anti-Obscenity Act, this law banned the mailing of &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;indecent&quot;, &quot;filthy&quot;, or &quot;obscene&quot; materials. The Comstock laws, while now to some extent unenforced, remain for the most part on the books today. The Telecommunications Reform Bill of 1996 even specifically applied some of these outdated and outmoded laws to computer networks.So what's my message here? Simple - if we continue to allow censors to dictate what we can and cannot read, we stand the chance of being robbed of some of the world's finest written works. We're not talking exceptions here. Consider, for example John Cleland's Fanny Hill - Candide, Voltaire's critically hailed satire - Jean-Jacques Rousseau's autobiography Confessions - Chaucer's Canterbury Tales - Boccaccio's Decameron - Defoe's Moll Flanders, and various editions of The Arabian Nights. All were banned at various times in the US.The 1928 Lady Chatterley's Lover is no longer distinguished for the once-shocking treatment of the adulterous affair between a sexually unfulfilled married woman and her husband's game keeper. Now that we're used to hearing and reading about sex, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful writer whose wonderful story takes us bodily into the world of its characters. Of Connie Chatterley's indecisiveness, her husband's callousness, the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors' persuasiveness - all are portrayed in a quiet, even manner until the climactic end. Necessarily, some of the language and imagery is mildly explicit (though you can read a lot worse in many of the magazines that lie around in dentists' waiting rooms), because Lady Chatterley's Lover affirms Lawrence's vision of individual regeneration through freely-expressed sexuality. The book's power and complexity make it a unique, original work-a triumph of passion and eroticism over sterility.The next time you hear that something has been censored, question whether it is really to protect public morals (where war, and starvation appear to be more acceptable than freedom of sexuality), or whether it is to protect the censors' own frustrated identities! Lady C is a powerful reminder that all the censors have ever succeeded in doing is to ban outstanding literature in the name of public morality."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I read 30 pages of the book, and put it down. The author does not make me care about Lady Chatterley as a person. I want to feel some sort of sympathy for a character, even if she makes mistakes.Frankly, Lawrence should have wrote this under a pseudonym and marketed it as erotica/pornography. It would have escaped the censors at the time and he would have made money off of it, at least."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"This novel's explicit sexual descriptions caused a great deal of controversy when it was first published in 1928. However, now that the literary world has embraced erotica, Lady Chatterley's Lover is now considered classic.D.H.

The bold descriptions of the forbidden romance between the protagonists left me longing for more -- so to speak. The novel is mixture of romance and erotica, and said story has inspired authors to venture into this once obscure genre in literature.Are you an erotica enthusiast?

It seems to me that this book gained more notoriety off the fact that it was banned than because it was a great piece of literature. I had to keep reminding myself that it was set in the 1920s, as the writing style was more reminiscent of a Victorian era novel. Furthermore, Lawrence portrayed his characters as if they were in the Victorian era. The characters were not well developed, thus making it hard to have sympathy for anyone in the story. The end was disappointing as it simply fizzled away."},{"Title":"Lady Chatterley's Lover","review":"I usually save two stars for books that I feel have isses with the plot or weak characters, etc. I don't feel that this book had any issues except I found most of it completely boring.

Keble, who was born in 1792 and is credited for having started the Oxford Movement with his Assize Sermon in 1833, was an Anglican priest, poet, and professor. \\"The Christian Year\\" is his book of poetry in which he wrote a poem for each week of the Christian year, as well as a poem for each of the services from The Book of Common Prayer. It's a work that is not much read today but that was wildly successful in the 19th century. While the aesthetic level of the poetry is second-rate compared to Keble's contemporary Romantic poets (at least the more famous ones), when read as devotional poetry that connects one to God through the Church, the Bible, the Prayer Book, and nature, the poetry still has the power to move.While the poetry of \\"The Christian Year\\" will seem outdated to most, if not actually inferior, a proper reading of it in its context will benefit not only students of history and literature but also the patient Christian reader in search of a profound devotional literary work.The full title of the work is: The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and Holydays throughout the Year. The volume begins with a \\"Morning\\" and \\"Evening\\" hymn, corresponding to Morning and Evening Prayer services, followed by a poem for every week in the Church year. These are followed by poems for the various saints' days, Holy Communion, Holy Baptism, and the occasional services. In 1828 poems for the State services were added as well.Keble's poetic life originated in his undergraduate days when he relieved his emotions by composing poetry, often on any scrap of paper he could find. When Keble began around 1819 to compose the poems that would eventually be included in The Christian Year, he had no intention of crafting his poetry into a unified companion to the Prayer Book. He apparently began while a tutor at Oriel College, inspired by his tours back and forth between Oxford and his home in Fairford. Keble's own theory of poetry illuminates the personal and individual aspect of poetry from which his own poetry originally flowed: \\"Let us therefore deem the glorious art of Poetry a kind of medicine divinely bestowed upon man: which gives healing relief to secret mental emotion, yet without detriment to modest reserve: and, while giving scope to enthusiasm, yet rules it with order and due control.\\" Keble's poetry, in keeping with his theory, was written first and foremost for the comfort of his own soul. Its most immediate impression was on that of his close circle family and friends, who universally found something new and powerful in the poems. The comfort for the individual soul that the poems brought appears frequently in the correspondence and remains of Keble's family and friends prior to its publication.Keble continued writing poetry for his own benefit in the 1820s, and, at some point not apparently recorded in Keble's correspondence or in the memoirs of those who knew him, he decided to arrange the poetry so that a poem would be provided for each holy day in the Church year. By 1825 Keble wrote a friend, \\"I have got a few attempts at hymns by me, which I have from time to time written, principally for my own relief . . . . My plan was to have one, if I could, for every Sunday & holiday in the year: taking the hint for the subject of each from something or other in the proper Psalms or Lessons for the day.When he did publish the work in 1827, he added to it his own Advertisement, in which he admirably sets out his aims: \\"The object of the present publication will be attained, if any person find assistance from it in bringing his own thoughts and feelings into more entire unison with those recommended and exemplified in the Prayer Book.\\" Keble makes clear that his goal in publishing his poetry was to have his readers use The Christian Year as a companion to the Prayer Book. A better summary of the purpose and effect of The Christian Year could not be found than what Keble himself wrote in his Advertisement. Keble also expected that his poetry, along with the Prayer Book, would provide a \\"sober standard of feeling in matters of practical religion.\\" The Liturgy, he said, disciplined the tempers which need disciplining in such an age of excitement.There is, therefore, a dual origin and dual purpose of The Christian Year. The original poetic impulse for the poetry came from Keble's own desire to express himself as an individual soul addressing His God, often out of a need for comfort. This original source for the poetry was then fitted for use as an Anglican devotional manual which had specific reference to the Prayer Book. This dual origin and purpose of the poetry is highly significant for explaining the astounding success of the poetry in the nineteenth century and its continuing value.A work of High Church devotional poetry, at a time when interest in poetry in general was beginning to wane, was not expected by many to succeed. Keble himself thought that nothing would come of it. \\"I remember, when it was first in the press,\\" Isaac Williams wrote, \\"coming with Keble out of Baxter's printing-office, when Keble said, \`It will be still-born, I know very well; but it is only in obedience to my father's wishes that I publish it, and that is some comfort.'\\" Keble's perpetual embarrassment by his success provides further evidence that he was never prepared for, and thus never expected, the success he achieved.The Christian Year enjoyed an immediate, lasting, and enormous success. The 1827 first edition of 500 needed little time to sell out and persuade Parker of the need for a second edition. The second edition of 750 also sold out within a few months, and a third edition of 1250 was published around March of 1828. The total number of copies sold in the first year alone, combining the sales of the first three editions, was at least 2500 copies, while the total sold for the first ten years was 26,500. By 1873 when the copyright had expired, 158 editions had been published by Parker, the original publisher, and 379,000 copies had been sold by the same date. My research indicates that approximately 1,000,000 copies of \\"The Christian Year\\" were sold in the 19th century, and many used volumes are available, as well as a plethora of modern reprints.Christians from many different denominations read The Christian Year. One writer said that the spiritual life and feeling of Keble's poetry \\"exist in Christian hearts, whether reared under Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Nonconformist influences.\\" My research indicates that a great number of major figures in the 19th century had read \\"The Christian Year,\\" and many people had virtually memorized it. Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Christina Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, William Gladstone, and many other have left testimony to having read \\"The Christian Year.\\"Those who read The Christian Year most faithfully, however, were likely to be Anglicans due to its connection with the Prayer Book. Many people read Keble's poetry week by week for years: the vast majority of these were Anglicans. This is what one would expect, since the contents of the book were based on an Anglican Church year, a specifically Anglican lectionary, and services which were often specifically Anglican.Finally, many readers of the 19th century wrote that \\"The Christian Year\\" did more to promote High Church and Catholic principles than the Tracts for the Times because Keble wrote through the vehicle of poetry and a poetry that appealed to all Christians, even while it subtly expressed Catholic ideals of the Church and a sacramental worldview."},{"Title":"Forth Programmer's Handbook, 2nd Edition","review":"Are you interested in how the Java virtual machine works? Interested in efficient Java chips? Are you interested in the boot-up software for the latest machines from Sun, DEC and FreeBSD Unix? If so, then you SHOULD be interested in Forth.Forth is the world's premier stack-based language. Some people seem to think of Forth as &quot;aged technology&quot;. But Forth's strength is in the ability to continually re-create itself. For example, &quot;object oriented&quot; features can be added to a Forth compiler without having to re-write the compiler itself. Java has sparked renewed interest in Forth technology because of its VM. If you read the Java VM manual it reads like a Forth text. For this reason chips designed to run Forth also turn out the be the fast &quot;Java chips&quot;. Also the recent &quot;plug and play&quot; solution for Sun hardware is written in Forth. So if you want to write device drivers for Sun workstations you need to know Forth.Ok, enough about the language, now about the book. The &quot;Forth Programmer's Handbook&quot; is probably the best book on Forth since the classic &quot;Starting Forth&quot; by Leo Brodie. This book differs from &quot;Starting Forth&quot; in quite a few ways though. Starting Forth was written with a strong emphasis on &quot;easing the novice programmer&quot; into programming using Forth as a model. The &quot;Forth Programmer's Handbook&quot; lacks the 'cute graphics' of Starting Forth. It also starts out with an in depth discussion of the Forth VM. (Starting Forth puts this off until several chapters later.) Also this new book has updated language features in it, such as a description of exception handling and of dynamic memory management. Also there is a good discussion on using assembler from Forth. While this is definitely not new, it's more in depth than the example in Starting Forth.If there is anything &quot;missing&quot; in this book it's some more concrete examples. There is a short &quot;embedded washing machine controller&quot; example which seems to be an elaboration of an example from &quot;Starting Forth&quot;. But there is nothing in there as in depth as Starting Forth's &quot;3 1/2 examples&quot;. (Which consisted of a language generator, a flat-file database, a simple calculator, and a partial implementation of an assembler.) The Forth Programmer's handbook did allude to the IEEE OpenFirmware standard in its &quot;Programming Style&quot; section, but I was hoping for perhaps a device driver written for OpenFirmware? Forth Inc, the publisher of this book, has been involved in some interesting projects including a robot arm for NASA. I know that some of that code is probably covered by &quot;non-discloser agreements&quot; but some discussion of how Forth helped solve those problems would be nice. Also there was no discussion of object-oriented techniques in Forth. This is understandable because there are various OOForth implementations out there. Still a discussion on OO and Forth would be welcome.Overall its a very good book on a very underated technology."},{"Title":"Forth Programmer's Handbook, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is a great second book on FORTH. If you have never used FORTH or a FORTH derived language before i recommend that you go and read Leo Brodie's &quot;Starting FORTH&quot;.

What makes &quot;N or M?&quot; unusual is that Christie chose to focus on WWII and what was happening in England at that time. Tommy and Tuppence who are living quietly in London suddenly find their routine interrupted when Tommy is called away on a secret assignment to try and find Hitler's most dangerous agent who has infiltrated England in advance of a planned attack by the Nazis. Of course, Tuppence who refuses to be left out of anything, follows him and actively helps him while posing as a garrulous widow. The book is more powerful than most because of the very real sense of menace that Christie creates and the feeling of evil lurking in the air. Wingding suspense and a knock-out ending - the only flaw was the focus on romance. Normally, it is nice to have a romantic attachment develop in Christie's books as they provide a nice relief to the mystery, but in this case I thought she should have concentrated only on the mystery; romance is almost superfluous in such a setting. It's interesting to think that while Tommy and Tuppence never actually existed, there may have been characters like them - ordinary people who possessed above-average intelligence who were picked to lead dangerous spy missions and who succeeded precisely because they were so ordinary and therefore not what the enemy was expecting."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"When one thinks of Agatha Christie, one usually thinks of novels in which a sharp-minded detective--such as Hercule Poirot or Jane Marple--unravels a tightly plotted puzzle from the comfortable safety of an arm chair. But Christie sometimes defies this concept of her work with a spy-thriller, and N OR M?, set during the early days of World War II, is among her best efforts in that direction.The novel re-introduces husband and wife Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, characters Christie originally created for the much earlier spy-thriller THE SECRET ADVERSARY--and they are among her most immediately likable protagonists: quick witted, snappy, and unwilling to sit in an armchair when they can be up and doing things. Although they have been long out of the espionage game, when rumors indicate that one of Hitler's most trusted agents has arrived in England. they are sent to a small coastal boarding house in an effort to unmask the spy who might be hiding among the apparently innocent residents.Readers will enjoy becoming reacquainted with Tommy and Tuppence, who Christie presents with considerable charm--and unlike the other novels in which they appear N OR M? is as much mystery as pure adventure: the book contains one of Christie's trademark twists at the conclusion. Although somewhat mild by the standards of her more famous novels, Christie endows the tale with a subtle sense of menace that serves it well; fans will enjoy the book, and newcomers will have a good time too."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"i have been borrowing a couple of her books from the library after a long hiatus of 5-6 years. n or m is my first introduction to tommy and tuppence, and i must say they are a light-hearted, action-oriented departure from christie's other investigators, who give the impression of spending a lot of time in situ, whether at the murder scenes or comtemplating the case. christie veers from teh pack in her stubborn regard for the facts and teh circumstances; i have never done any professional spying, but i imagine if i did that i could take a few hints from her detailed analysis of how her characters think and act. so many detectives in detective novels strike you as so ordinary - some are not even very smart - but in this book you see the true complexity of wartime counter-espionage come to life, all the more frightening because it lurks beneath a veneer of everyday monotony. i love how she injects obscure words now and then...reminds you of a time when people didn't just use er..awesome as an umbrella expression for pleasure!"},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"During World War II, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford follow an obscure clue to a small English seaside town where a Nazi mastermind is recruiting Englishmen to help their cause.

It's a noteworthy for the political slant she includes, because that's not terribly common for her books. It constantly amazes me the amount of pertinent details Christie includes for the readers. Some are red herrings, and some are decisive. Agatha Christie was certainly the best."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Tuppence (about the British Secret Service): \\"I don't think the Intelligence is anything like what it was in our day.\\"Tommy (gravely): \\"It will attain its former brilliance now we're back in it.\\"As much as I appreciate M. Hercule Poirot's little grey cells and Miss Marple's insight into human nature, my preferred Agatha Christie sleuths are the fun-loving and very engaging Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. Christie, in 5 novels, chronicles their exploits, which, while often containing elements of real peril and intrigue, managed to convey an air of lightheartedness and real fun. And this stems directly from the personalities of Tuppence and Tommy (but mostly Tuppence). Near two decades of married life find them still best pals, still devoted to each other. No change in personalities, either, as Tuppence remains intuitive, quirky, and impetuous while Tommy is solid, practical, and plodding - \\"plodding\\" meaning that he takes his time figuring things out. But he gets there, to the ruin of various so-called clever criminals. Meanwhile, Tuppence's ear for the preposterous surfaces again with the fashioning of her alias. Gotta admit, Mrs. Blenkensop is a pretty silly moniker. Anyway, N OR M? finds the duo back at catching enemy spies.A bit on the plot of N OR M?: Tuppence and Tommy's glorious amateur detecting days are years and years in the past. As we catch up to the Beresford couple, we now find them in their mid-40s and once again inhabiting a war-torn London. The still adventurous couple volunteer but are outraged to find their services spurned by the war effort. Discouraged and feeling useless, they suddenly receive a visit from British Intelligence and are offered a secret mission. Or, rather, Tommy is offered a mission. Tuppence pretty much elbows her way in.A British operative has expired thru mysterious circumstances. His baffling dying words: \\"N or M Song Suzie.\\" British Secret Service has already ferreted out that \\"N or M\\" are codenames for Hitler's two most trusted agents. N and M have been responsible for establishing fifth columns in nations opposed to Germany's warmongering, and it seems one or the other or both are doing their thing in England. N and M's true identities remain veiled in secrecy. \\"Song Suzie\\" might actually be Sans Souci, the name of a sleepy guest house found on Britain's South coast. Tommy's long shot of a task is to take up lodging at Sans Souci and nose around and hopefully unearth a spy or two. Persistence pays off as Tommy and Tuppence (or \\"Mr. Meadowes\\" and \\"Mrs. Blenkensop\\") are soon up to their necks in sinister skulkers, break-ins, kidnappings, and deadly espionage.Reading N OR M?, the Berefords' third outing, is like dropping in on comfy old friends, and Tommy and Tuppence make such charming hosts. I always enjoy re-reading this one. Agatha Christie has always excelled in peeling back the sedate, banal layers of British society to reveal the startling villainy festering beneath. Gradually, the routine of the seaside resort gives way to an atmospheric mood and an air of quiet menace. Written during WW2, the author does her patriotic bit as she has her cast express damning commentary on the appalling rot within the system: English turncoats. The mystery in N OR M? isn't as intricate as in her Poirot or Marple bafflers, but, still, her flair for the clever whodunit, her planting of the odd red herring or two are much in evidence.As usual, she works from an unassuming cast of characters. Who's N, who's M? Is it the blustery Major? The faintly superior landlady or her feisty, moody daughter? The fretful invalid or his fussing wife? The foreign woman who's been spying on the premises? Or the German refugee? Hell, could it be the merry two-year-old girl who enjoys being read \\"Goosey, goosey gander\\"? (well, no, it's probably not her). One letter's identity is stumbled upon, but the other is ferreted out quite nicely in a clever twist. Tommy and Tuppence are urbane and amiable company and make for competent detectives, and I had fun as they bask in the excitement of skullduggery afoot. But these two are now mature enough and have lived long enough that they aren't any more as frivolous in nature. They still live in the moment, but they comprehend the gravity of this war.Whereas Poirot and Marple always seemed old but never aging, Christie does pile the years on Tommy and Tuppence with each progressive thriller/mystery. In five novels (The Secret Adversary, the short story collectionPartners in Crime (Tommy and Tuppence Mysteries), N OR M?, BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS., andPostern of Fate) Christie has Tommy and Tuppence go from the bloom of careless youth to spry middle years and finally on to graceful old age. I've mentioned that the Tommy and Tuppence mysteries had a fun, breezy quality to it, and that definitely holds true for the first three books. But there's a change of pace and feel with the last two books. In BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS and the elegiac THE POSTERN OF FATE, Tommy and Tuppence are decidedly getting along in years, although still with all faculties intact. There's a melancholy, bittersweet flavor in these last books, which satisfyingly round out the lives of this fictional couple. Because I witnessed Tommy and Tuppence get old, they seem more real and resonate more with me than her other, more celebrated detectives. N OR M? finds them a bit long in the tooth but still delightful and still very effective at what they do, even as they have fun in the doing of it. Carpe diem, Tommy and Tuppence."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"This book just goes to show who the master of mystery books is: Agatha Christie!The book kept me guessing all the way until the very end.

Then a covert mission comes along that pits the married pair as strangers in a search to find traitors in their midst. \\"N or M?\\" is a fast-paced thriller, different than Christie's usual mysteries, that fans of her fiction will love for its unique if slightly easy to figure out story.When Tommy is approached by the Home Office to discover German spies at a seaside boarding house, Tuppence feels left out and takes matters into her own hands. As disguised guests \\"unknown\\" to each other, the duo tries to figure out who these spies might be, a male referred to as N and a female known as M. There are several candidates, the most likely being a young German scientist who supposedly escaped the horrors of Germany after his family was imprisoned. But the woman who runs the boarding house is certainly of a foreign descent and strange things begin to occur that let Tommy and Tuppence know they are on the right trail even if they have very little to go on. In an era of suspicion and war, everyone is a likely suspect, especially those who claim to be something they are not. And when Tommy goes missing, Tuppence must call upon her wiliest scheme to rescue him and uncover the treacherous spies.\\"N or M?\\" is an enjoyable thriller, its time period perfectly captured by Christie, as it was originally published in 1941, not long after WWII began. It plays magnificently to the fears that existed that German spies had infiltrated English society and that so-called patriots could be turned by the enemy. Christie plausibly fashioned many suspects, and while one identity may surprise, I felt that one was rather easy to figure out since it was the tried and true least likely suspect. All in all, \\"N or M?\\" is a nice thriller featuring Tommy and Tuppenece, although not quite up to par with their earlier escapades."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"I really enjoy this story! The thrill of the hunt, a few twists and a lifetime of love...what more can you want?! I travel quite a bit and this is a great book for the road. There is nothing like whit Agatha Christie style!

Have fun!"},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Tommy and Tuppence Beresford (SECRET ADVERSARY and PARTNERS IN CRIME) are now a middle aged couple who have two grown children, twins Deborah and Derek. It is the opening days of WWII, England is bracing for the Blitz and all citizens are anxious to \\"do their bit\\". Unfortunately while the twins are away on military assignments, the older Beresfords are deemed to be too old for active service. They are urged to take up service at home, like knitting. Ultimately though Tommy's old contacts pay off - for him at least - he is offered a desk job in a restricted area, Tuppence must remain at home, with the hated knitting.It is later revealed that the desk job is a ruse and Tommy is needed for an undercover assignment. Tuppence is one step ahead as usual and arrives on the scene before Tommy. Together the two work to ferret out a spy ring on the English coast. As always with these two there are deceptions, kidnappings and last minute rescues before the triumphant conclusion.It is nice to see what old friends have been up to in the intervening years and good to see that they haven't lost a step. Christie does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the time, the tension as the war builds and the anxious waiting to hear news of loved ones in peril.There are a couple of problems though for long time fans of this series. Judging from the publication dates of the earlier novels, 1922 and 1929, Tommy and Tuppence are in their early 40s and the twins are 11 years old during this one. Even going by the slighly different time frame listed in this novel the twins cannot be more than teenagers and Tommy would still be very young to be retired.The plot is, as usual for Christie, clever and designed to keep the reader guessing until the end. The final chapter is, in keeping with the rest of the series, a nice, sentimental touch."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"This was a great book.

Her presentation of the characters at the boarding house where the book takes place does keep you guessing as to who the N or M characters are, in addition to the wandering female and the subset of other male characters that add to the plot. It was a good basic mystery that didn't take too much time to read and ended well, as they always do."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"I enjoy a good mystery and this book fills the bill. It is like a collection of short stories that all tie together."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"It is 1940. England is at war. Blitzkrieg is about to begin. Tommy and Tuppence are being told they are too old for active war service. Their twin offspring Derek and Deborah are of course younger and are in the Air Force and nursing respectively.A Mr Grant turns up at the Beresford flat to offer Tommy a clerical job in the wilds of Scotland. When Tuppence is called out to assist a friend Mr Grant tells Tommy that in fact what he is offering is a spy job hunting down some Fifth Columnist Nazi spies known as N and M. The previous agent on their trail is dead, run down by a lorry. Tuppence is to be kept in ignorance of this venture.Tuppence of course adroitly outwits these attempts to exclude her and joins Tommy in Leahampton where they both attempt to track down N and M, but at the same time both under assumed names and definitely not married. But neither are as clever as they think.This is #3 in the Tommy and Tuppence stories (see below).#1, THE SECRET ADVERSARY, was not published until 1922 but was set mainly in 1919, when World War I was fresh in readers' minds. As I said in my review I thought Christie was probably reflecting contemporary paranoia with Bolshevism and secret agents and conspiracies, and showed a political awareness that we don't often give Christie credit for. THE SECRET ADVERSARY was also Agatha Christie's second published novel and had many signs of an author still coming to terms with her craft.#2 in the Tommy & Tuppence series, PARTNERS IN CRIME, published in 1929, was set mainly in 1925. Tommy now has a desk job with the British Secret Service, and Tuppence, much to her displeasure is at home, though when the Chief of British Intelligence asks them to take over the International Detective Agency, both jump at the chance of new adventures. The fifteen stories contain parodies of fictional detectives who were well-known to readers of the 1920s. In each story Tommy and Tuppence assume the mannerisms and methods of a different detective or detective team, including Sherlock Holmes. The stories are bound together with an overall theme of a rather vague Russian plot. Again Christie appears to be reflecting popular paranoia.So World War II is the perfect opportunity for Christie to add to the Tommy & Tuppence series (and you may want to reflect whether they would have made another appearance without the war) but now Christie is a well established and successful novelist with 30 novels to her credit, so she doesn't wait for the war to end, but publishes N or M? while the issues it reflects are still topical.Once you recognise that, you realise that Christie is reflecting a lot of contemporary thinking. It certainly must have made the average English reader look carefully at those around him. It is a very patriotic novel.Christie introduces the idea of a \\"wooden horse\\", Fifth Columnists, people who are very attracted by Hitler's ideas, a network that has infiltrated English society and infrastructure.N or M, you see, is a term we have heard before. It refers to two of the most important and trusted German agents. We have come across their activities in other countries and we know just a little about them. It is their mission to organise a Fifth Column in foreign countries and to act as liaison officer between the country in question and Germany. N, we know, is a man. M is a woman. All we know about them is that these two are Hitler's most highly trusted agents.\`But there are those for whom we've neither respect nor liking-and those are the traitors within our own ranks-the men who are willing to betray their country and accept office and promotion from the foreigner who has conquered it.'\`We know The Day is fixed. We know, or think we know, roughly, where...(But we may be wrong there.) We're as ready as we can be. But it's the old story of the siege of Troy. They knew, as we know, all about the forces without. It's the forces within we want to know about. The men in the Wooden Horse! For they are the men who can deliver up the keys of the fortress. A dozen men in high places, in command, in vital spots, by issuing conflicting orders, can throw the country into just that state of confusion necessary for the German plan to succeed. We've got to have inside information in time.'Our Leader does not intend to conquer this country in the sense that you all think. He aims at creating a new Britain-a Britain strong in its own power-ruled over, not by Germans, but by Englishmen. And the best type of Englishmen-Englishmen with brains and breeding and courage. A brave new world, as Shakespeare puts it.There are some interesting little cameos too. I was very taken with little Betty Sprot, not yet 3 years old, but exploring language and relationships in a very engaging way.I think it is a very powerful novel in which Christie pins her own colours to the mast so to speak. If there is a weak part, it is the final roundup of information, where Christie ensures that no stone is left unturned for the reader."},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"Agatha Christie has done it again!

Meanwhile Tuppence and Tommy Beresford investigate and solve a mystery about German spies N and M. I would recommend N or M because it has a complex mystery, suspense and interesting characters.The N or M mystery is very complex because usually in a mystery you are looking for one criminal, but in this you are looking for two. On top of that, there weren't 2 or 3 candidates, there were 10 or 15 suspects. Also these criminals were not normal criminals. They were very determined because they supported the Nazis. One other thing was the criminals looked like normal everyday people . They were good at fooling people like when Mrs. Sprot kidnapped Betty and she pretended she was a mom. Also they studied English to make it look like they were English, not German.N or M has a lot of suspense. For example Mrs. Sprot's daughter Betty was being kidnapped by a mysterious Polish woman. They were near a big cliff and a roaring ocean. You don't know if the Polish woman is armed. Another suspenseful part is when Tommy is at Commander Haydock's house. It is suspenseful because Tommy finds a secret compartment with the telegraph in it and realizes Haydock is a spy. One other suspenseful part is when Tuppence talks to Commander Haydock. It is suspenseful because Haydock was interrogating Tuppence. You don't know if Tuppence will get rescued in time and Commander Haydock has a gun.N or M has many interesting characters like Mrs. Sprot because she is brave. Also you don't know what will happen. She was very good at fooling people. She was smart enough to kidnap a kid. Also Commander Haydock is interesting too because he is a spy so you don't know what he will do next. He is also brave to be a spy because he could get in serious trouble for spying. One other interesting character is Tuppence because she has an amazing mind. Also she is brave for messing with the criminals. Also she is enduring because she doesn't stop when the mystery is hard.N or M is a heart pounding mysterious things and interesting chapters and a unusual setting. I would recommend this book.A Bynum"},{"Title":"N or M?","review":"This story has Tommy and Tuppence serving as spies during WWII. It is the third of five T&T mysteries that Agatha wrote, and fairly typical of the series. In the series, each story has T&T roughly 10-15 years older than the last, so you see how they age and how their adventures change over time. In N or M, T&T are middle aged, too old to enlist and too young to stand by and do nothing. The identities of the baddies were fairly evident to me rather early in the story and Tommy's rescue involves some rather unlikely coincidences (Albert the (former) butler makes a key appearance), but the story has its charms. It provides an interesting perspective on the British view of things during WWII.

While telling a story, simply stop in the middle of it. If no one asks, \\"So what happened next?\\" then you can be sure no one was listening.While reading \\"Where the Wild Rose Grows\\" by Penny Fletcher, I had to stop in the middle to photographs a few events. I left wondering what will happen next. In fact, I couldn't wait to get back to the book to find out.Where the Wild Rose Grows is a story of a gifted young woman growing up in a difficult, actually tragic time. Fletcher skillfully opens a door in the pages of her book allowing the reader to come inside. Without resorting to gimmicks, she allows the reader to vividly experience both the sadness and joy of a setting that for some is not purely fiction. The imagery is finally crafted and the story unfolds in the mind of the reader rather than simply on the printed page.Despite never having personally experienced it, I was able to feel only too well the desolation and, for many at least, the loss of hope created by the abject poverty of her 1960s rural Tennessee setting. And despite what seemed to be an utterly hopeless situation, the reader is never left to feel hopeless. Throughout the book, the reader is allowed to hold on to a strong sense of goodness and hope that transcends the story.In terms of the story, it is good. Actually, it is excellent. There is enough detail to allow the reader to feel they know the characters, both good and bad, yet one is never mired down by an overabundance of minutiae. The story is so finely paced that even gaps of months in the storyline do not leave the reader feeling as though they were forced to jump from one period to the next. The story flows well from beginning to end.In technical terms the books shines as well. Quite often books that were not produced by the major publishing houses suffer from a lesser degree of proofreading and editing. The stories are often among the best but the message is distorted by forcing the reader to overcome a limited editing budget. This is simply not the case with Where the Wild Rose Grows. Editing is extremely tight and no proofreading omissions were found. This is clearly a book of the highest standards.Even some of our most famous authors often have difficulty ending their books. Fletcher managed to quickly wrap up her story and it ended well. In finishing the book, I only had one problem with it. I wanted to know what happened to Wild Rose as she grew up. I closed the book wondering, \\"What happens next?\\"SUMMARY: South Hillsborough County has produced a number of outstanding authors and Penny Fletcher has taken her place at the top of that select group. Her story is no lightweight; it is thoughtful, painful and joyful with outstanding imagery. The setting is powerful and the characters come to life in the mind. I would highly recommend Where the Wild Rose Grows.Reprinted with permission from the Observer News (www.observernews.net)"},{"Title":"Where the Wild Rose Grows","review":"I really loved this story... It spoke to me in many ways, not the least of which was Ms. Fletcher's writing. It began in 1960. Funny, for me, that doesn't seem long ago and, what was striking was that it opened into a scene that, perhaps, really would have more naturally occurred one hundred years before that...John Elk was in the midst of a healing. The white woman had been brought because the white man's medicine was not strong enough. John Elk had no problem in using his gift from the Great Spirit for all... But in the midst of that activity, another was started. Two white men rode into the camp--to kill, to steal, and to seek babies they could later sell. Wild Rose was one of those children. She was four when taken--this is her story.By 1968, Priscilla (Cilla) was living with a woman she considered her stepmother, along with her two children. Like Cinderella, as the oldest, Cilla was made to do most of the work and care for the two little girls. But Cilla had grown to love them as sisters and had even begun to steal in order to ensure the little girls had something to eat.Rayline was an alcoholic who worked in bars and then later partied there. While the children slept on a bare mattress in a corner of a kitchen, Rayline would share her bed with the latest man she met. Sometimes her ex-husband, who had first stolen Cilla and brought her there, would come to visit. If a man was already there, he would sleep on the couch. He was the father of the two little girls and was grateful for Cilla's care. But he would soon leave to continue his life of thievery.Cilla was in school, but her mother had made it quite clear that Cilla was never to tell anybody about where and how it was at home. No friends were ever to be invited. Fortunately, they did have a television and old reruns of shows with Donna Reed and other home-related stories allowed her to learn how \\"some\\" families lived. Cilla was also lucky that their school provided two meals and some of that food and what she could steal from the lunch bags of other children was oftentime only what was provided to her sisters.Cilla was intelligent and had learned of Robin Hood so she knew it was alright to steal from the rich and give to the poor--so she chose only the lunches of those children she knew had rich parents...Cilla was also a special little girl. Since she had been stolen, she had had guardians who came to her in her dreams to guide her and teach her of the ways of her ancestors. While she had not realized she was \\"not\\" white as a younger girl, she began to notice and understand more as she got older.But as Cilla grew older, she had learned from her mother that smoking took away the desire for food, so she started to steal cigarettes. That plus other issues began to have a concerned teacher quietly monitoring what Cilla was doing. When Cilla had to stay later, for instance, she would watch as she left, lit a cigarette and hitched a ride home. One day she started asking Cilla questions and soon Welfare officials were involved.The children were taken from Rayline, but when they tried to place her, no birth certificate could be provided and no research resulted in who Cilla really was. For Cilla's name was really \\"Wild Rose.\\" And everything had been arranged by her guardians to bring her home!The climatic conclusion of this story is soooo satisfyingly wonderful. It might have been Penny Fletcher's imagination that wrote this, but the story readers will actually see the workings of the Great Spirit as He might have done it through his own activities!

A combination of advanced physics and mathematics, it is used to describe dynamic systems moving towards equilibrium and quantum mechanics applied to systems. The level of this book is advanced, generally the material would only be suitable for students at the graduate level. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter, although solutions are not provided. Additional background material on the necessary physics is included in a series of appendices.The treatment of thermodynamic formalism is brief, detailed and complete. I strongly recommend the book as a textbook or study aid in that area."},{"Title":"French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"The French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary is an outstanding resource for learning French (or even learning English) because it uses a sort of \\"Rosetta Stone learning style\\". You see the picture and then the French word to skip the middle step of translating the French into English before associating the English with the object. You directly associate the French with the object. This is how we learned as children because it is natural. In fact this user friendly book is helpful for both adults and children in learning French. The English words are also available above the French words in case there is any confusion as to the object in question. I very highly recommend this book for personal personal French study!"},{"Title":"French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"I went to the tattered cover bookstore in Denver.

At school, all we've learned like say for body parts is the head, arm, leg, etc. I was serious about it and I figure the parts we haven't learned at school or online.

I have always been a visual person, and this dictionary helps me remember the vocabulary since i can match it up to a picture.The best thing about this dictionary is that it covers almost every topic imaginable, topics not even my French textbooks would cover such as health, clothing, services, shopping, food, studies, work, transportation, sports, leisure and the environment.It covers such details such as computer and camera parts, to the positions in a football game, or members of a rock band.

The chapter on eating out will be especially helpful to travelers who may be required to order food in French.This book is also small enough to keep in your backpack and many of the translations are very easy to learn. Like pizza is la pizza and sandwich is le sandwich. So reading menus will become much easier if you have this guide with you or could be useful while reading cookbooks.The Dictionary is divided up into main sections:PeopleAppearanceHomeServicesShoppingFoodStudyWorkTransportationSportsEnvironmentEach picture is accompanied by a French and English Word.

Number one complaint: the book should have been bigger. Honestly the pictures were well selected and there is a lot of valuable information given, but the print and images are just too small to be pleasing. There's a picture, for example, of a television studio and there are six different items that are named, like la grue de camera (camera crane), but the page is so small that the publisher was forced to us an 8pt font. That's just not kid and old person friendly.Our second complaint is that there is no pronunciation guide. I'm thinking they didn't include one because the pages are so small that would have compounded the text/image problem. Adding more information, in other words, would have just made things overly crowded. But I'm sure that there are plenty of people out there who are even moderately skilled speakers for whom a pronunciation guide would have been useful. (We can hope for an expanded addition.)THE SKINNY:::Wonderful book for those who are extremely fluent in French, but who need to learn the names of less common objects.Somewhat useful for kids or adults at earlier learning stages.

I moved to Germany two years ago without an adequate vocabulary so I was motivated to not make that mistake twice. I did not go wrong with this dictionary. The best part is that covers so many aspects of daily life - almost too much information - put you can just focus on what's important to you. - James"},{"Title":"French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"This is a unique dictionary that for each word there is an illustration which is labelled in both French and English. The illustrations are in colour which clearly identifies the object being shown. This is an excellent learning and memory tool as this makes use of our natural abilities to think in pictures. For example, I often had difficulties in learning various names of trees, birds, insects or types of food etc because I did not know the English equivalent but because of the use of illustration, I can see clearly the item in question which facilitate and simplify the learning process..The dictionary covers a wide range of areas including health, leisure, environment, work, services, shopping, people, food, sports, work, transport and the home which we encounter on a regular basis. Because of this, those who are learning the French language are greatly assisted in grasping some of the common everyday terminology.Among the drawbacks I encountered was on the pronunciation of certain terms, so often I need to refer to another dictionary. Also the font is very small. Such limitations may be the price for keeping the book small and portable, which allows me to carry it with me when I travel.All in all, a good dictionary that is helpful and handy and is recommended for those learning the French language."},{"Title":"French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"...would also recommend Oxford's Picture Dictionary which also offers good value, presents material in alternate settings as well as presents supplementary material."},{"Title":"French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"I just love this dictionary!

It is thick though, and has a LOT of content.My main positive is that the words are listed in French first and boldly and in English below and less noticeable. This is great for those like me who want to look at the picture and the French term and not rely so much on the English translation. This is better than the Oxford visual French dictionary which has the English translation more prominent and bolder.There are many useful words, and the book is broken down into sections based on subject. So if you want to learn about the French words relating to say... a rock band, then go to that section. If you want to know about astronauts and the International Space Station, there is a section for that. (Seriously!)It's a handy reference useful at just about any level. I highly, highly recommend it!Update: Really unclear why the picture shows the Italian version now...

This is the most thoroughly researched book on the subject I have read to date. It is also very interesting to read and hard to put down.The author does an excellant job of presenting the events leading up to (causing) the invasion. Each chapter is accompanied by the author's extensive notes detailing her research (at the back of the book). Although much of the book contains the author's opinion, those opinions are credible and backed up by her extensive research.This author portrays the Cattlemen unfavorably. Until this book, I have always leaned toward the Cattlemen's cause. This author's thorough research and presentation have changed my POV.I will humbly point out a possible minor error on page 283. The author writes \\"A daughter of the lively rustler Lee Moore... married a son of W.C. Irvine.\\" I think it is the other way around. W.C. Irvine, an invader, owned the Ogallala ranch. The Ogallala Ranch is still in operation today, but it is owned by the Moore family.History is written by the victors, and the Johnson County War is no exception. There are plenty of books available, written by both sides, and I have read several. I feel this one is the most thorough presentation."},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"I had the privilege of living in Wyoming for seven years. If you want to spark a LIVELY discussion,bring up the Johnson County War(which is the subject of this fine book) anywhere in Johnson or Sheridan counties. Decendents of both factions still live there & continue to have strong opinions on this event. Cutting to the chase,this was nothing other than an armed invasion of an American state by a mercenary army of gunmen hired by The Wyoming Stockgrowers Association with the express purpose of killing aproximately 125 people on a (very real) hit list & seizing control of established local government. The enormity of the conspiracy far exceeded any of the various western range wars of the period-even though the total body count was fairly minimal. Fortunately for the residents of Johnson county,these Texas thugs were about as adept at the blitz invasion business as were the ATF incompetents when attempting to enter the Branch Dravidian compound in Waco. It would be gratifying to say that these hired murderers were repulsed,arrested & punished. Unfortunately,that didn't happen. Cavalry from nearby Fort Kinney saved their bacon by rescuing the invaders from the furious residents & whisking them away to Cheyenne where the the entire matter finally fizzled out with no charges or trial. It did,however,effectively blunt the unchallenged power of the monopoly WSGA. Internecene sniping continued until 1902 with the hanging of their hireling Tom Horn. As Ms. Smith amply points out,however,Wyoming justice has rarely been a polished or unambiguous affair. I would say that this is the classic & most even handed account of a most extraordinary event even by Wyoming standards."},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"This is a great book, well written, accurate,and easy to read.

This book is part of our family history.Of all the books that I have read on what happened there in Wyoming in 1892, this one seems to be the fairest on all counts.

A detective working for the Wyoming Stockgrowers Association led the gang of lynchers.Johnson County's hard-up cowboys turned homesteaders, whom the cattlemen labeled cow \\"rustlers,\\" reacted with anger and fear and began arming themselves for the pending invasion of gunslingers hired by the cattle barons.This true crime story --- if the West could have true crime before it actually had much law --- is recounted in wonderful detail by Helena Huntington Smith.Smith tells this story with an engaging true to life flavor. To accomplish this she uses letters written by the cattlemen themselves, an abundance of not-quite-objective but many sided accounts by writers from the East and by Wyoming's country editors at the time. All this is supplemented with information from a few books and \\"confessions\\" produced by participants.For anyone who has been fascinated by Westerns in film and on TV, this book should become a must read. It is as close as anyone is likely to come to \\"the true story\\" behind the myth that underlies the West."},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"and corruption ruled.Helena Huntington Smith's rendition of the Johnson County War is a thorough investigation into the homesteader versus the cattle baron in late nineteenth century Wyoming.The author prods, pokes and jabs into every facet of what occurred before, during and after the Wyoming Stock Growers Association's invasion upon the alleged rustlers.With round-ups controlled by the WSGA in a time of overstocking and open range, coupled with the \\"Maverick Law\\" in favor of the Association's members, it was open warfare for cattle.Although the invaders lost in the field, they won courtside due to the fact that an impartial jury could not be found; they had the backing of President Harrison, Wyoming's acting governor Barber; Senators Carey and Warren, the legislature and the courts; plus Johnson County itself couldn't pay for prosecuting fees.A knock down dismantling of a tightfisted and gluttonous association."},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"This is a very fine, well-written book, and it has become pretty much a standard text in the history of the West. Though the setting is by and large eastern Wyoming of the late nineteenth century, and the subject matter is cattle ranching, this book will be much more satisfying to liberal-minded historians and populists than typical cattle ranchers. Anyone who appreciates or sympathizes with the underdogs in SHANE but would like a more historically accurate picture of the struggles for land and cattle in the West might want to give this a look. It is wholly satisfying from expository, sociopolitical, and historical standpoints."},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"Impeccably researched and written with beauty, verve and charm, this book is far and away the best on the biggest event in Wyoming history."},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"The Johnson County War was well known in its day. It inspired many works of film and fiction. In April 1892 the big cattlemen with their hired gun men from Texas invaded Johnson County to drive off or kill the small ranchers and homesteaders. The sheriff, deputies, and some county commissioners were on their death list. This book tells about the preceding events and the aftermath. Those who planned this and murdered two men on the death list were able to escape justice after being rescued by the US Army; they had the support of politicians like President Harrison, US Senators, the Governor of Wyoming, plus the usual flunkies.The cattle rush was on by 1879. Corporations stocked the plains for a later bonanza of beef. But changing conditions led to overstocking (too many cattle for the land), and the bankruptcy of many large businesses. The big cattlemen blamed the problem on small ranchers and homesteaders, not their mismanagement. The word \\"rustler\\" defines a person who is pushing, energetic, smart, and successful; they can take care of themselves. It was also used to refer to a cattle thief. It usually referred to any small rancher who tried to do business for themselves. Any cowboy who tried this would be blacklisted from a job. The big cattlemen, whose headquarters were the Cheyenne Club, formed a cartel where they would claim all cattle that were in Wyoming. But the citizens of Johnson County would not allow their property to expropriated. The first victims were Ella Watson and James Averell, lynched by a big cattleman who wanted their property (Chapter 18). One of the witnesses to this died, and the others disappeared, so there was no prosecution!The classic Western film had a similar story. The people in the valley were oppressed by a crooked mayor and sheriff who were in cahoots with the big rancher. But when the people united they were able to win over this gang of crooks. In real life it wasn't this way. [If you think this is just fiction you may not know what is happening in your city, county, or state.]After the usual conspiracy to affect reality, big ranchers and their hired gun men invaded Johnson County in April 1892. They killed two cowboys who were on their death list. The alarm went out and the citizens of Johnson County gathered together like the Minutemen of 1775. They surrounded and besieged this gang until the US Army cam to arrest this gang. The prisoners were taken away, then released on orders of politicians like the Governor. Witnesses were lured away, and the charges were dropped.The author points out that other states (like Montana) did not have these feuds over stock. Unbranded cattle became county property and were sold for tax money. You can read this book to learn about American history that won't be found in official school history books. The author should have dedicated this book to George Dunning the gun man from Idaho (Chapter 36). This book also tells about the journalism practices of that era (and today?). The author did not note the future fates of those big cattlemen. Could they have been going insane?The dust jacket has an illustration by Frederic Remington \\"The Price of a Maverick\\". This fantasy painting lacks any date and place to authenticate its subject matter. How many other paintings are like that?"},{"Title":"The War on Powder River","review":"I only read about 1/3 of this book before completely losing interest. The prose is dull and the chronology isn't straight-forward. The facts in one chapter may be about the year 1885, while in the next chapter, its gone back to 1875. This makes it difficult to follow the chronology of events leading up to the conflict.My guess is that, during her research for this book, the author discovered many manuscripts, letters, newspaper articles, etc. that held her personal interest. She then decided to somehow incorporate all of this information into her book, regardless of whether it was directly related to the Johnson County War.Examples of this include: (1) the detail in which she describes the Wyoming home (castle) of Moreton Frewen, with its two fireplaces, solid walnut staircase, etc.; (2) she also unnecessarily delves into the private lives and personal habits of the ranch hands and other people not directly involved; and (3) she devotes three pages to inform the reader to never use the word \\"the\\" to preface Powder River.I do have an interest in the Wyoming cattle war and plan to purchase another book on the subject.

I have never seen such a lavishly illustrated book on flower arranging. Over 2,000 photographs will inspire you to arrange your own flowers.There are hundreds of ideas for using fresh and dried flowers. The step-by-step sequences make the techniques clear and simple. When you start arranging flowers, you quickly find out you need an \\"essential kit\\" in order to complete even a basic flower arrangement. This is where \\"Practical Techniques\\" comes into play.You will want to buy a glue gun, floral wires, pruning knife, florist's scissors, etc. All the essential supplies are listed with pictures. This book is filled with pictures! The first chapter discusses Flowers In Civilization and shows flowers in history and art.Elements of Design is a visual guide to flower colors and the pages are filled with piles of wonderful petals in every color. I loved the Container Shapes section. There are two sections, with one further into the book.This book is SO INCREDIBLE! .....Shall I continue..?Then, we get to Inspiration. You will find page after page after page of mini-floral displays with the page number so you can learn how to make the arrangement with precise instructions. There are arrangements in this book you would not even imagine in your wildest floral dreams.For instance, on page 96 there is an underwater floral arrangement. There are upside down glasses, with flowers in them, floating in the water and facing outwards in a huge vase. Then, OH MY..I happen upon page 212 and there is a hanging upside down Christmas Tree dangling dangerously from the ceiling. I am not sure I approve! Decorating the tree looked a bit dangerous, but it sure was creative.A Floral Ice Bowl on page 248 is one of my favorite ideas as the flowers are suspended in their original beauty in ice. Then, in the summer...how about a \\"watermelon vase?\\" The Floral Place Setting is a way to beautifully decorate each place setting is a wonderful summer idea or dried herbs could be used in the winter. The mini-christmas trees are an idea even children could help make.An A-Z plant guide is a huge section. This visual guide will introduce you to just about every flower you would ever want to use in an arrangement. Some useful addresses complete with Web site addresses gives you even more information. An easy-to-use Index helps you locate your favorite flowers.If you want inspiration and information, this is the book for you!~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Flowers: The Book of Floral Design","review":"This is one of the best books I read on floral design. This one is very visual : it has gorgeous pictures. It makes a great present for flowers lovers or even as a coffee-table book. For each arrangement you get to know the proper season to find the flowers, how long it will last, how difficult it is. This book clearly brings inspiration. The choice of containers is daring. The only critics I will make : not enough step-by-step instructions for some arrangements, the use of scientific (latin) names instead of the common name, and as usual in this kind of book, you need a lot of flowers to reach the pictured effect, which means that these arrangements are not affordable to anyone. Still, I love it !"},{"Title":"Flowers: The Book of Floral Design","review":"This is a gorgeous book, with gorgeous flowers. However, it's less of a learning tool, then a recipe book. While it does grace upon a few floral design basics, it doesn't spend a great deal of time on it. The raw information it conveys is pretty light, having more to do with warm, neutral, and stark colors, as well as a few techniques on drying flowers and taping them (etc). The bulk of the book is taken up by pictures of arrangements, and little \\"recipes\\" on how to make them. A good book for someone who doesn't want to learn the mechanics of floral design, a good book for the coffee table -- but ultimately, not a good book for someone who wants to study design on a more advanced or technical level."},{"Title":"Flowers: The Book of Floral Design","review":"Any book on flowers by Malcolm Hillier is bound to be a winner. His passion for fresh and dried flower arrangements spans more than thirty years and his experience and innate sense of design is brilliantly displayed in this latest effort on fresh floral design.This 500 page full color coffee table book is hard to put down. Page after page of floral arrangements are displayed with lists of ingredients, tips on display vessels, and alternative suggestions should the original design not quite suit the surroundings or available materials.It is a fun book with suggestions most of us would not readily think of like, Peonies arranged in Chinese lettuce. Instructions are given for choosing the peonies, conditioning the flowers, extending the life of the lettuce leaves, or chicory if you prefer, and suitable conditions under which to use such an arrangement.Or, how about a box with a wok inside to hold water for hosta leaves, iris flowers and a rose, appropriately named the Blue Lagoon.There is so much to read and try in this book that the senses cannot take it all in in one sitting. And, yet many of the decorations contain only a few carefully chosen elements.Chapters include Elements of Design, Inspirations for the Home, Seasonal Arrangements, and Special Occasion. The chapters on Practical Techniques are presented by a master and his words are personal and direct.The A-Z Directory of plants is a work of art all its own. Each plant is presented in color in flower with its most often used common name, its scientific name, the season it flowers, care tips for extending vase life and and estimate of vase life.Perhaps, the only thing better than Mr. Hillier's lusty flower arrangements and explicit directions are the incredibly beautiful photographs taken by Stephen Hayward.This book will take your breath away and reward you with a little bit of heaven."},{"Title":"Flowers: The Book of Floral Design","review":"This is a very wonderful book, which the Floral Design Institute uses as a supplement \\"textbook\\" to their syllabus.

This is a well-rounded account, including perspectives on the political issues, negotiations, and reactions on the home fronts. Of course, full accounts of the progressive military campaigns fill out the rest of the book. Sandler does a good job of encapsulating this in 270 pages. He is at times supportive and at times critical of the U.S. and U.N. effort in Korea. The same can be said of the personalities involved on all sides, except for both Kim Il Sung and Syngman Rhee who were determined to pursue the war to disasterous ends.But, like the conflict itself, this book is not inspiring. Not that the author or his writing lack inspiration. The book does what it sets out to do. It provides a detailed account of the contentious and uncertain time. Yet, Sandler didn't seem to offer much new information in his text besides some perspective on Stalin's motivations from now-available Soviet documents. But, this was relatively minor. The opening of records in P'yongyang one day will provide much new information. In the mean time, Stanly Sandler's offering is a good place to start. And the impressive bibliography points to many good sources for future reference."},{"Title":"The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished","review":"Jes&uacute;s TorresProfessor WoolleyWar, Peace and Arms12/8/04The Korean War: No Victors, No VanquishedReaching back into the memories of childhood, and inevitably sifting through the archival collections in my ever-expanding filing cabinet of a brain, I can honestly say that I draw a blank when thinking about the Korean War. Ask me about any other war in American history, and I can undoubtedly recall what the issues were and what actually happened. Not Korea. In fact, I cannot recall any time, at any point in any of the years of elementary school up having studied the Korean War in any depth. That is, the brief overviews of the Korean War only offered that there was a dispute over borders, and not much more.The Korean War, for whatever reason, has been dubbed such names as the \\"Unknown War,\\" or the \\"Forgotten War,\\" and seems to go down in history as something that shouldn't be discussed. Maybe this is because American forces suffered humiliating losses on and off the battlefield, and failed to win decisively, instead settling for an armistice peace treaty that left no victors. However, this armistice proved to show that the United States was not invincible, and seemed to put its ignorance in check. Or, maybe the Korean War failed to reach the esteem of other wars, such as World War II or the Vietnam War, because there were no heroic figures such as MacArthur, there were no battles of Iwo Jima, and there were no major controversies such as Vietnam. All these seem to be plausible theories on why the Korean War has remained such a mystery to most Americans. Rather than being studied in great detail, such as wars like World War II and the Vietnam War, the Korean War has been shuffled to the side, and has remained, even in classrooms, a hushed issue.That is why Stanley Sandler, in The Korean War, No Victors, No Vanquished, has, in my opinion, done such a good job in bringing to the public a work that examines the Korean War from all aspects and all viewpoints. Sandler brings to light the relevance and enormity of this war that went far beyond a simple border dispute between North Korea and South Korea. The implications of this war reached far beyond what any course throughout my career has taught me. Sandler, in his book, is largely responsible for this.Sandler methodically and analytically works through the book from the beginning of Korea's history until the end of the war. Opening up the book, he starts off with an account of the causes of the war, and the implications behind it as well. He examines the advantages to all parties concerned about entering the war, and explained that the United States did not actually want to engage in a war with North Korea. Along with other Western powers, the United States couldn't be bothered with Korea, and didn't have much interest in waging war with Kim Il Sung. However, with the Cold War in full swing, the threat of Soviet domination was reason enough to go to war.Sandler acknowledges the fact that the Korean War had not reached the esteem of other wars, yet seems convinced, and with solid evidence, that this third costliest war should be ranked much higher than it has been. The Korean War, he argues, would have never even begun had the Cold War not been such a terrible threat to the American people. The extreme fear that the American people lived with back then was more than ample enough to justify a war with an enemy that most could not even point out on a map.With the causes and implications behind the justification for the war out of the way, Sandler than goes on to examine the actual history of the war, and everything that goes on in war. From pre-diplomatic discussions to all the actors involved in the war, including the Chinese, Japanese and Soviets, Sandler does a thorough and complete examination of the Korean War.While offering a general overview of the history and background of the Korean War, Sandler than gets more specific and detail-oriented in breaking down into subcategories the various elements of the war itself. He examines the major offensives and retreats that marked significant and proved to be of vital importance. While some may see this book as biased towards Americans and their doings in Korea, it is necessary to look beyond that and realize that what he is writing about is factual information.Although the factual information does not make a book noteworthy or necessarily important, what does make it noteworthy is the fact that Sandler wrote this book and offered various different perspectives other than the traditional American viewpoint. While he did discuss America's roles, beliefs and ideologies in the war, he also touched upon the ideologies of other groups as well.This, in my opinion, is the strongest point of the book. Different chapters are designated to the role in which each actor played a part in. For example, Sandler discusses in length the involvement of the Chinese and how they affected not only the outcome of the war, but how that affected the international political system as well. He shows the enormous effect that they had on the way war was waged after their involvement and how they were such a pivotal force in the Korean War. Additionally, along with the US perspective, he examines the role the United Nations, along with member states, played in this highly involved war. While discussing their involvement in the war, and the significant effect they had on the ability to sustain the war with North Korea, Sandler also discusses their ultimate short-comings and attributes the outcome of the war somewhat to the UN. This, to me, is very important in providing a detailed and thorough sketch of a war that most people know little about.That point raises one issue of criticism on behalf of this book. For all its good qualities, the book, in my opinion, is somewhat long-winded and wordy. That is, it seems difficult for me to imagine this book capturing an audience and making them want to continue reading. While it is of high historical value, the complexity and detailed nature of this book would seem to be a turnoff from those who are not being forced to read it. Rather than concentrating so much on detailed accounts and factual data and statistics, a more illustrative and animated book would, in my opinion, make it a much appealing and interesting book.While the book may tend to be dry at times, and lengthy in point, the fact remains that nevertheless, this book is crucial in shedding light on a subject that has been forgotten by so many. While people of all ages are readily familiar with other wars such as the Vietnam War, it is crucial for more writers to designate an appropriate chapter in history to bringing into perspective a war that meant so much to the history of its peoples. Like stated above, this war had enormous implications, with the Cold War raging, yet didn't have the magnificent dimensions of heroism and scandal that accompanied so many other wars. That, however, is not justification for abandoning a crucial and significant chunk of American history. This book, overall, does a fantastic job of re-examining the Korean War."},{"Title":"The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished","review":"Stanley Sandler provides the reader with an in-depth look at a very broad range of topics on the Korean War in his work \\"The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished.\\" Sandler covers some new topics I had not seen before, but for what he offers in breadth, he sacrificed the depth of coverage. For a 270-page book, it was a very effective trade-off.Sandler offers insight into the modern history of Korea through the end of World War II, and the series of strategic miscalculations that led to Kim Il Sung's invasion of South Korea. The discussion of the ebb and flow of battle was at the Corps level, with Sandler making examples of units of interest. There are far too many to mention, but two of these examples are the US Marines \`attack in a different direction' to leave the Chosin Reservoir, and one of the allied contributions, \\"The Immortal Glousters\\", whose exploits are highlighted in the outstanding book \\"The Edge of the Sword\\", by Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley.From an airpower perspective, his brief discussions on the USAF are both accurate, but not all encompassing. Sandler mentioned that USAF budgetary position, pursued the acquisition of a strategic nuclear bomber force (i.e. the B-36) at the sacrifice of the some of the fighter skills learned during World War II. Once the first MiGs were deployed to Korea, Sandler briefly mentions the deployment of the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing and the latter approval to send 75 more F-86 Sabres. What Sandler omitted from this discussion on Airpower was the overall worldwide strategic context at the time. The USA was still convinced Korea was a feint to draw American forces into Korea, leaving Western Europe without a major contributor to repel a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. With this mindset in place, the USAF was reserving the \\"front line\\" F-86 aircraft for service in Germany, not Korea. He mentions this strategy elsewhere, but he failed to include this analysis in his discussion on the aviation contributions.Sandler does provide a very comprehensive discussion on all the contributions of all the United Nations who deployed forces to Korea. He also provides insight into many other sociological issues such as racial integration of American forces, and the situation on the homefront. Sandler also discusses some of the technological innovations (helicopter, medical facilities) that took place during the war.It is by no means a comprehensive book, but overall it is a very good survey book providing the reader with a very broad introduction to the Korean War."},{"Title":"The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished","review":"After watching the MASH series, i figured out i needed some more information about the war.

I have been quilting for 3 years and had to adjust some of the techniques back to basics found in other quilt books. But, sometimes it's good to try different techniques.However, I did buy this book as I have an avid interest in the Civil War, particularly the railroad. Such braves souls operated this escape to freedom. In honor of that, I wanted to do a quilt for my King size bed. I used the largest size blocks in the book and did 16 blocks. When I added borders, it fit my bed. I have shown it at a local Heritage Festival and the story of each block was admired by many. Having the story block as the final block reminds me and others of the arduous journey taken on the UGRR."},{"Title":"Underground Railroad Sampler","review":"I have made several Quilt in a Day quilts, but this one is a difficult piece of work.

It's quite easy if you look at the size the pieces of the block should be before sewing them together. For some reason she uses more steps then needed to make a block. Do not buy her Flying Geese template...waste of money. There are a lot of errors in the measurements, especially in the Bear Paw block..if you follow her directions you'll end up 1/2\\" too big (claw part).

I was very confused and irritated at the methods used by the authors and would love to find a book where you REALLY can make a quilt in a day.I loved the pictures in the book, but not the directions. I found them to be too difficult for a beginner and it should not say that a block is for a beginner when obviously it is not at all for a beginning quilter.Over all, I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Underground Railroad Sampler","review":"While the authors, Eleanor Burns and Sue Bouchard, are well known published authors and quilting instructors (Ms. Burns has her own TV series), the methods to construct all the blocks in this book are more complex than necessary. Even the blocks the authors rated as &quot;easy&quot; are definitely not for any novice quilter. I purchased the special &quot;Quilt in a Day&quot; rulers to facilitate accuracy as well as measured and squared each block to the precise specifications...ensuring exact 1/4&quot; seam measurements along the way. I also had all the pieces for each block labeled and divided into their respective individual zip lock bags before beginning to construct any of the blocks. There is no way possible this quilt can be constructed in one day. With the simplified methods of rotary cutting, strip piecing and assembly-line stitching, these authors need to revise this entire book. Unless I reach a point where I am desperate to construct another &quot;Quilt in a Day&quot; quilt design, I will probably avoid purchasing any more of their books."},{"Title":"Underground Railroad Sampler","review":"I really like this technique. It allows for uniform sized blocks if you follow instructions and use the rulers as stated. The 12\\" blocks are quicker and easier than the 6\\" blocks, some of them were a challenge.

And the photos for finished quilts are not always exact matches to the instructions, ie the North Star sample quilt is what I started with then realized the sample quilt is two different star blocks and the instructions are for only one. I've been quilting for 20+ years so could make my quilt like the one in the photo, but a beginner would likely be frustrated by this.Bears In The Woods, Quilts Through The Seasons, and Egg Money Quilts are my other favorites by Quilt In A Day.

Sher's ability to capture the longing and hope of a son toward his absent father - amidst the spectacle of a failed space mission and resulting media frenzy - is stunning. From this foundation Sher builds a grand story that explores the broader human need to believe in and connect to entities greater than themselves (governments, space programs, politicians, and so on). There are passages so exhilerating, so charged with intelligence and invention that I felt as if I were reading a new Ishiguro novel written under a pseudonym. This is a brilliant debut; one that - like The Intuitionist from Colsen Whitehead - indicates a major mind and voice and very good things to come."},{"Title":"Gentlemen of Space","review":"What a great surprise it was to pick up Ira Sher's book - after reading a great review in Time Out - to find a novelist with such wisdom and compassion and instinct for storytelling. The way he recreates the mood and mindset of a surburban family in the 70s is so impressive. There is a great narrative kick toward the end of the book that calls everything you've read into question and - though it will surely confuse some - if read carefully it illuminates great meaning as well as a the mind of a great novelist. Can't wait to read what he does next."},{"Title":"Gentlemen of Space","review":"This debut by Ira Sher was like nothing I've read before. It took me several pages to get into the groove of the author's writing style - he demands a close reading, choosing to pack in a sentence, say, what other writers take a paragraph or two to convey. But, the prose is gorgeous, the imagery beautiful and haunting. The book is about a boy's father who is chosen to be the first \\"non-astronaut\\" to walk on the moon. When his father goes \\"missing,\\" the reaction is not exactly what you'd envision. The novel captures the lost innocence of a previous era, where America held wide-eyed wonder at man's accomplishments, yet it also foretells the squander of the crass and shallow emotionalism and misguided intentions of today's frenzied media exploitations. The novel is not for everyone: I would definitely classify it as \\"post-modern\\", for the ending is anything but tidy, but that is, perhaps, exactly what the author intended."},{"Title":"Gentlemen of Space","review":"I bought this book looking for a whimsical journey. That's not what I found. It's a good idea, even a great idea. A boy's father is chosen to represent \`the common man' on a trip to the moon.

But then the shattering news comes that the father is lost on the moon. Is he lost, though, or has he escaped a scandle that surely awaits him at home?Great idea? Yes. Sure!But the book is wildly overwritten. I love lyrical prose but this was too much. Sher loses the reader (OK, at least he lost me on many an occasion) by drifting off into some unnecessary wordplay. I'm reminded of those long, boring drum solos at concerts -- you know, the ones that are only entertaining to the guy doing the drumming and not to the people who have to listen to it.The story becomes too thick. I felt like Sher lost control of the story. And the ending is an unraveled mess. It doesn't leave me anywhere. Oh, but he's sure to leave you with some wordplay... that left me holding onto nothing at all."},{"Title":"Gentlemen of Space","review":"It's a taunting mystery. It's an ode to disillusionment.

In truth this is a collection of three books that were published as far back as the early 1980's. Magician's Law, Demon's Law, &amp; Death's Law make up the three original volumes, published in Paperback I only wish I could get them in Hard Back. The original Art Work fully complimented the volumes and the amazingly original fictional mythology contained within. Unfortunately they are very difficult to find, so what a treasure to find this collection. I have always wanted to share these volumes but had no wish to release the original books to others, they were so important to my collection.Scott creates a world so real you can almost hear the voice of the Bard as he works his magic. Scott peoples his creation with creatures both original and incredible, a unique class of characters that have both depth and substance. He weaves a web of intrigue and action and populates it with creatures of nightmare and wonder. One of the most important characters is of course the Bard, a man or a monster. He is seen as a Demon, a DemiGod but never a mere man, except when Scott allows us to enter his mind.Scott is a true Seanachie, and one of the best Authors I have ever had the pleasure to read. This is one investment you will never regret."},{"Title":"The Culai Heritage","review":"This is a collection of the three books: Magician's Law, Demon's Law and Death's Law by Michael Scott.Scott weaves a fluid story, introducing the character of Paedur the Bard. A man of learning, with a hook in the place of his left arm, he is chosen as the Champions of the Old Faith. Setting out to gain followers and stand against the rise of the New Religion and its gods, Paedur enlists the aid of an errant bandit with a claim to the thrown, a Weapon Master, a slave, a priestess, a long-dead warrior, and many others. He becomes embroiled in wars between the gods and man, making enemies among both the Pantheon of the Old Faith and the New Religion gods.The mythology of Paedur's world is brought to life in the stories that he relates while on his mission... stories which then take on new meaning as the events they depict have fallout in the present day. The climax brings the story full circle, actually having caused me to flip back to the beginning of the first book to doublecheck something.If there is one fault in Scott's writing, it is that the stories are woven so naturally into the tale that when the events come up again, I frequently found that I couldn't remember the details earlier presented. A timeline would have proven useful. But this is really a minor hindrance, and the series is overall extremely enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Culai Heritage","review":"This is an outstanding series. Rich with colorful characters, both Gods and men. A rich archeological history unfolds as the Bard attempts to save all the planes of existance from the folly of man and deity.

Granted, her solution is an excellent solution that is viable in many cases. Nevertheless, the author does not delve into the origin of the problem. Therefore, she does not eclectically adapt her solution nor provide a more circumspective solution plan when the origin of the behavior is complex. Is the dog aggressive when on leash due to a lack of socialization? A traumatic experience? Fear? Poor handling skills? Anxiety transfered by the handler? Insufficient respect toward the handler/owner? Territoriality? Object guarding? Opposition reflex? Barrier frustration? Excitability? Generalized aggression? Insufficient stimulation and exercise? There is no factfinding to inquire about the preceding issues of causation. In addition, she never asks the reader to contemplate whether the dog's behavior varies depending on which specific human is holding the leash. Whether the dog is social off-leash and exclusively aggressive or excitable when on-leash. Whether the behavior is new or has existed for a prolonged time. Whether the behavior's onset occurred during puppyhood or is a more latent behavior that only manifested itself during adulthood. Whether the behavior is increasing in frequency or severity. Or whether the dog's aggressive, excitable or \\"feisty\\" behavior is more generalized than solely manifesting itself when walked on-leash. Thus, the author's solution is overly simplistic and in many cases will be insufficient in it's quest to accomplish goal-level solutions."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"She found it to be very helpful."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"Ordered this book and received with in new condition in a reasonable time from ANYBOOK."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"This book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then.

I have read sooooo many dog training/behavior books, and this one is one of the best. Why? 1) It gets right to the point. 2) There are only 3 main techniques to remember and practice (plus a few \\"panic button\\" tactics). 3) It's fewer than 60 pages.This book is easy to understand and doesn't muddy the issues with a lot of extra stuff. The techniques are non-violent but work. I've been through several dog trainers that told me that I wasn't correcting my dog hard enough so he wasn't getting the message. Things were only getting worse. The corrections were only making him more agitated, so that he began aggressing earlier and earlier when he saw another dog.This book helps you train your dog to have a different reaction to whatever sets him off so that his habit is to look at you when another dog (or person) comes around, instead of freaking out.McConnell anticipates that things always don't go as planned; one heading is titled, \\"Oops! My Dog Looked Away Before I Said Okay.\\" She also gives suggestions for troubleshooting.I highly recommend this booklet!"},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"This book is primarily for dogs aggressive on leash, same dogs off leash are fine with most, if not all, other dogs. It is only one of 28 catagories of aggression or combination thereof. The benefit to getting this booklet is that 1) you can determine if this is really the problem before you invest in a lot of more expensive books that deal with all manner of aggression. AND 2) You should be working with a trainer on ANY kind of aggression issue. This booklet will help you to know what type of methods are likely to be effective and you will have something to refer to as you are working with the trainer - I would not work with anyone who is not familiar and endorses at least some of McConnell's positive training recommendations.Her booklets in general cover more information with more pages than you will find in a single chapter of a lot of training or dog problem books. This gives you 59 pages dealing with just one very common, very specific issue! You would get far less for a lot higher price if you brought a book on a more general behavior topic.If you found the booklet useful, great!

This book fills out the notes from that session. An incredible assest for trainers dealing with all levels of agression in dogs. I have used the methods with good sucesson three client cases. Reading this gives trainers more options for dealing with feisty fido's that show up with unhappy owners."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"This book is short, and clearly written. It is often funny, and is very easy to understand. The author goes into enough detail and gives advice on enough side issues (car aggression, techniques for specific kinds of dogs or owners) that I get the sense that she has worked these principles for a very long time with pretty much every kind of dog out there. In other words, at no point did I think, \\"but what about my dog, he's different because\\" without the author addressing the issue a few paragraphs later.If you want volume for your book-spending money, you may be a little unhappy with how short the book was, but I was relieved by it -- I wanted to finish the book and start applying the training ASAP, so the shorter the better.The \\"watch\\" technique is working for my dog. He's not \\"cured\\", but we are having positive events -- I got him to watch me while we were in my truck instead of lunging and barking at a dog that was walking by. He also let a cow (we hike, and ranchers let their cows out in the high country to graze) walk within ten feet of us and did not even bark. He actually stayed calm and kept looking back to me for treats. Maybe he doesn't mind cows (!), but staying that calm near another strange animal is new behavior.I still expect it to take several months before he lets a dog go by us on the trail without trying to tear it apart, but I am seeing very small results just one week into using the watch command. Like the author suggests, we are working with easy to moderate situations, and just getting those down before we move on to high stress situations.I have worked with 2 different $80 an hour dog trainers on this problem with my dog, and while they did teach me helpful things, I think I've gotten more useful information out of this book. If you can't afford a trainer, and you feel like you can't go another day with your dog acting like a maniac, definitely give this book a try."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"I just took a class with my two dogs, both rescue animals. One is leash reactive due to nerves/fear of other dogs. My other dog is leash reactive from barrier aggression toward the leash. Two problems. One answer. This book.I was very lucky to have a dog trainer in my town offering a special class for leash reactive dogs. This book was the first thing he handed out. He asked all of us to read the book as prep for the first class with dogs. Best homework anyone has ever given me!It is a quick and easy read. The tone is upbeat. No time is wasted getting to the good stuff.I'm very happy to have taken my dogs to a professional and to have this book to help me continue to practice out in the real world. I agree with other's reviews that it is very important to work with a professional, although it is expensive. Getting feedback on what you are doing right and wrong is very valuable. This is a big challenge to face alone.As a final note, on our last day of class I and my husband had a short personal chat with the instructor. He stated that there are only 4 professionals he knows of in my state that focus on this type of work. And he told us that if he had to choose just one area to continue to teach in dog training, this would be it. To him (and us) it is so important to arm dog owners with helpful and hopeful strategies for their feisty fidos. There is noting sadder than a dog confined to a life behind closed doors because the owner gave up or was too scared or uneducated to face the dog's bad behavior on leash."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"I had read McConnell's book The Other End of the Leash and really appreciated her scientific approach to the dog-human relationship. I rescued a big mix (3 years old, 70 pounds) about a year ago and once he got used to life with me and got his confidence up he started acting like a maniac on the leash when we would see other dogs. I took him to 2 rounds of obedience training which helped our bond and was good for his brain, but didn't do much for his \\"leash reactivity\\" as McConnell calls it. So I went online to see what I could find and ended up buying Feisty Fido as well as the Cautious Canine.I have been following Feisty Fido to the letter for 2 to 3 weeks and have already started to see results. I bought the equipment that she recommends (leash, collar, and bait bag) and am following the regiment exactly. It's a lot of work, but it's totally worth it to not own the Neighborhood Menace. The book is an excellent step by step way to rehabilitate a leash reactive dog. Feisty Fido is a program to correct one behavior, but I think the method could be applied to any kind of fear-induced reactive behavior.I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"This brief, concise guide does not pretend to be a comprehensive tome for curing canine aggression; what it does address is one aspect of canine behavior that is troublesome to many owners--leash aggression. As a trainer, I see many people who understand that their dogs might not ever play off-leash at a dog park, but would like to be able to take them for a daily walk. The majority of the time that is a realistic goal, and this book explains how it can be achieved.McConnell explains the foundation skills owners should teach their dogs, such as giving attention and an emergency U-turn, as well as detailing when to use each one. She explains how to begin as well as how to progress through the behavior modification process. The overall approach is gentle, humane, and based on sound scientific principles. While McConnell is a recognized expert in the field, she has a gift for explaining theory and techniques in language that the average dog owner can easily understand. She and Karen London, a fellow Ph.D., have produced a guide that is well organized, easy to follow, and extremely helpful.- Nicole Wilde, author Help for Your Fearful Dog: A Step-by-Step Guide to Helping Your Dog Conquer His Fears and So You Want to be a Dog Trainer (2nd edition)"},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"This short book is a cheap and cheerful guide to dealing with leash aggression in dogs. The author suggests reasons that dogs may behave in an aggressive manner when on leash, and then goes on to describe three simple and positive exercises that owners can use to manage or change their dog's on-leash behaviour.The booklet is well written and easy to understand, and the exercises are easy to implement. I imagine the information would be very useful for the owners of fear aggressive dogs - which to be fair, make up the majority of leash aggressive dogs. However, it has several limitations that prevent it being universally relevant.Most importantly, this book only addresses dogs that attack due to fear or insecurity. Little mention is given to dogs that aggress for other reasons such as medical problems, misdirected prey drive, dominance issues or innate high fight drive. And although the suggestions in the book would probably work very well to desensitise a fear aggressive dog to the presence of other dogs, I know for a fact that they would be less useful to treat the less common dog who actually finds fighting self-reinforcing. No information is provided about how to recognise, or how to treat, a dog that isn't merely fearful of other dogs.Secondly, although I suppose this short booklet can't be expected to include all relevant information, I feel that leaving out all mention of how to deal with an aggressive dog on a daily basis is a fairly big omission. Information on how to manage an aggressive dog's lifestyle is very important, especially for dogs that display signs of aggression not just to strange dogs, but also towards their human or canine family. There are several \\"hands off\\" lifestyle approaches that can really help with aggression, such as the commonly quoted \\"Nothing in Life is Free\\" programme, that could easily have been included in this booklet.Thirdly, the authors are from the \\"purely positive\\" school of thought, and claim that any form of punishment (and especially any form of training collar) is of no use at all in dog-dog aggression. This is true as a general principle, and probably universally true for fear aggressive dogs - and for everyone's sake, positive based training is indeed the only type of training you would want to suggest a novice trainer attempt at home with an aggressive animal. However, when used under the guidance of an experienced and skilled trainer, aversive training collars and low-stim e-collar \\"crittering\\" can be very useful for SOME non-fearful aggressive dogs. Yet in this booklet no information is given about what to do, or where to go, if the suggested methods don't work for your dog.In short - if you have a leash aggressive dog you might as well buy this booklet; it is cheap, cheerful and has some useful practical suggestions. But please don't give up on your dog if these methods don't fix him. There's a lot more information out there!"},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"This is a short and straight book on how to deal with a very common and specific issue. It explains in great detail how to apply the method developed by the authors, consisting of one command and 2 or 3 \\"emergency commands\\". Like most things in dog training, the commands are very simple to undertand, but demand a lot of patience and training to be useful in a real-life situation. The authors know it and give a lot of details on how to apply different levels of difficulty, how to do a training session, what to do when things go wrong and insights on WHY the dog is misbehaving on-leash.I definetly recommend this book to anyone who has a dog with similar issues - on-leash agression toward other dogs - or trainers who want to learn more about it. I'm already applying this commands with my dog, and we're getting better results every day, although it's a work for weeks/months of training. It's not for dogs who are agressive even when off-leash. It's not for owner/dogs with no training experience, for I think it will be really hard to apply if you've never teached your dog some basic commands (heel/sit/stay)."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"The book is brief and as it clearly states it only will help a dog that has fear-based aggression while on leash.

After another 6, the conditioning has become even stronger. Neighbors (we live in a condo) have commented that they've noticed that our beagle is much quieter (as opposed to the daily outbursts we'd have as our beagle would flip out at the sight of another dog!)

I especially like working with the reactive dogs. A lot of what's in this book is in her other, longer books. This is a quick read that walks you right through what to do to help your dog. I've read other reviews that complain that you have to be an instructor, or have lots of dogs to work with your dog. Most people can come up with one or two friends that could help out. It requires a little effort on the owner's part, but can be accomplished. Any reactive dog is going to take effort on the part of the owner. I have seen these steps work first hand, both with other people's dogs and my own. Persistent consistency is what it takes. Take the steps in this book slowly and apply them consistently.

It just requires working with them & following the book."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"I have a 4 year old rescue who is highly reactive on leash/behind a fence. He is fine at the dog park and doggie daycare. Basically, any time he is restrained from immediately running up and greeting any dog he sees he flips super quickly, lunging and barking. His obedience classes were not set up for this kind of behavior modification. (He did pass all his obedience skills, though)The local \\"growly dog\\" program that addresses this costs $600. ONE private training session from trainers experienced with behavior modification will run around $100 - $150. So I figured I can't really go wrong with $10 for this book.Buying this book was the best decision. In less that a month, my dog is starting to automatically look to us instead of barking/lunging when he sees another dog. His reactive distance is decreasing, and he is losing the \\"tunnel vision\\" when he does react and we are able to redirect him. For the first time in the 7 months we've had him, I'm starting to believe that my dog can learn to be a good canine citizen and come with us to fun doggy places, busy trails, and outdoor dining that requires polite leash manners."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"A couple weeks ago, we added a third rescue to household and he's a wonderful dog. However, our little guy gets really overwhelmed when he walks past dogs or people or anyone comes close to the car while he's in it.We've been working with our local dog school to improve his obedience and to get him socializing more but we really need to make sure we can go on hikes and walk our dog without fear he will hurt another dog or the people we pass, and we really want to be able to drive him fun places without the cacophony.This is the second book from McConnell Publishing that I've read since getting our new dog and both times I've been really impressed. The authors start out by giving you an understanding of how dogs with these problems appear to be interpreting their situation. This isn't a bunch of wishy washy anthropomorphization. Instead, the authors deduce, from years of working with dogs with these problems, that, for instance, using a choke collar on a dog who is out of control, will simply add pain to the mix. If the dog barks and growls and the stimulus goes away, then the choking subsides which means the dog feels rewarded for barking. Practical information like this not only gives greater insight into why a dog may continue to be reactive despite one's best efforts but also gives one empathy for the dog which helps control one's frustration.The methods outlined in this book will not give results overnight but any real solutions for working through behavioral issues will always take time. What I can say is that the methods are simple and workable for the vast majority of people. They will require that you spend some time and work consistently with your dog but it's good to remember that this is a fantastic chance to bond with your dog as well as improve his or her behavior.And while I know another reviewer considered this the idea of running away from a stimulus a negative point for this book, I really appreciate that the authors offer solutions for avoiding setbacks in training when the stimuli are too great for your dog's current level of training.All in all, I have no qualms with enthusastically recommending this book to anyone who considers it time well spent to work with your dogs."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"Thank you!

Outside of seeing dogs on walks on a daily basis where we have used her techniques, there have been a couple occasions where we have come around a corner face to face with another dog and I quickly use the commands we've learned and off we go for a little run in the other direction! She's covered everything in this tiny little booklet! It's been fabulous! I highly recommend this to anyone with a \\"feisty fido\\"!

When we first went out for walks she would bark, growl and lunge at dogs that you could barely see down the street or all the way across the park. At a fit 70lbs she was very scarey. I bought this book just 2 weeks ago. The techniques in this book really work! She now only has problems with very reactive dogs that are on the same sidewalk and even then I can redirect her quickly and move off or do a U turn. Yesterday an off the leash dog came up to us on our hike and she did great! She really seems to like the watch me game when we see other dogs and is much less stressed out. Hopefully over the next few months she will continue to improve and we will work on close by reactive dogs."},{"Title":"Feisty Fido: Help for the leash aggressive dog","review":"Yet another winning book from the dog world of Patricia Mc'Connell!

I used to be a dog trainer so much of what it talked about was a review for me, but I still learned a ton and got a lot of great new ideas to try with my dog. It's also nice to have it written down so you can make a checklist of how you're going to work with your dog. Even if you are going to a trainer (which I highly recommend for ANY behavioral issue) I think this is a great knowledge base to have and I am starting to read all of McConnell's books.

It's only been 2 weeks since I started but I 've noticed an amazing improvement. The methods in &#34;Feisty Fido&#34; need to be consistent & a new part of one's life.

I have been obedience training my dog in a classroom setting for 8 months now and have had difficulty finding a real solution to his leash reactive behavior during training because his behavior is less reactive in class when he's working than when we are on a walk. On walks he goes wild if he sees another dog. In class we were taught the \\"Look\\" command. If you are soft spoken like me the \\"Watch\\" command is somehow more effective. It takes time but I am beginning to see positive results.

Barrett's introductory essay and Suzuki's \\"The Zen Doctrine of No-Mind,\\" I learned that Zen is not for me. Suzuki has a great command of the English language, and everything is very clear - though sometimes intricate and hairsplitting. It's a very excellent and clear exposition of the philosophy of Zen.I could pick a fight with Zen's denial of anything empirical in favor of intuitionism. Okay, just a few words. Say I'm walking my puppy down the street after a few cups of tea thinking, \\"This is great. I've dropped body and mind and am seeing with my Third Eye. Cool.\\" That is a delusion of my own mind. Ask any neighbor who sees me walking my blue heeler mix. I still have a body she can see, and hopefully a mind.My point is, subjectivism is head-in-the-sand BS.

T. Suzuki","review":"This was the first book I ever read on Zen, and it remains, in my mind, one of the best. D.T Suzuki is thorough and imaginative, linking the principles of Zen to the culture and history of Japan, as well as to Western philosophy. Suzuki has a well-deserved reputation as the 20th century's foremost authority on Japanese Zen. While perhaps more of a scholar's book than a practitioner's book, this selection of essays from Suzuki's Zen and Japanese Culture do a wonderful job of conveying the spirit and rich history of Japanese Zen, and its roots in Chinese Ch'an. Faced with a complex topic that by its very nature does not lend itself to written accounts, Suzuki manages to neither over-analyze the topic nor sidestep the issues by refusing comment. The essays selected give a good taste of the complex spectrum of Zen, and its many cultural and historical manifestations, without swamping the reader with material. A fine and complex work by a well-respected figure of the Zen tradition."},{"Title":"Zen Buddhism: Selected Writings Of D. T.

Whether they agree with all of his positions or not, nobody in the western Zen community would deny the importance of Suzuki's role on bringing Zen to awareness in the West.William Barrett has done an extraordinary job in compiling and introducing Dr. Suzuki's writings in this book, which is a veritable horn of plenty when it comes to the classic teachings of Zen Buddhism. Barrett's introduction alone (around 100 pages) is massive treatise on the core teachings of Zen.A great read for all! Zen students that have not yet tackled the massive corpus of D.T.

I've read quite a bit on the subject and I believe Suzuki has the best grasp of Zen. The reading is difficult, but so is the topic. I highly recommend this book if you really want to get deep into Zen. Another slightly easier book to understand, \`Living Zen' by Robert Linssen uses Suzuki's material quite extensively."},{"Title":"Zen Buddhism: Selected Writings Of D. T.

This is not a bad book, if you are looking for an in depth analytical look into Zen's history, but be warned you must come into it with already some knowledge of names and terms. Suzuki never explains these and it is assumed you should already know them. As one of the first to bring these teachings to the West, this is to be expected and as such will seem quite dated. For those looking for a way to apply the teachings of Buddhism and Zen to their lives, I recommend instead Zen Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki, as well as books by Alan Watts (The Way of Zen) and Thich Naht Hanh (The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching). I am a Westerner and quite frankly I do not care about the dogma and terms spoken in another tongue, this does not apply to me in my life in any practical manner.

Suzuki","review":"Over the years I have read Suzuki's Essays (all 3 volumes) his Manual and Introduction, etc. Lately I have been re-reading Selected Writings as a shortcut to the best of his essays (William Barrett's foreword is thoughtful, encouraging and amazing). What can I say, but deep gassho to Daisetz Teitaro, Joseph Campbell, Reginald Horace, Nyogen Senzaki...and Soen Nakagawa. After re-reading D.T.'s Selected Writings recently, another insight hit me re: Huineng's (the 6th Patriarch) \\"awaken the mind without fixing it anywhere\\". Once you crack the meaning of these words, enlightenment is sure to find you, no matter what 'baggage' you are carrying or perchance hiding behind! \\"Awaken the mind without fixing it anywhere.\\" This is awesome (in a very positive way), such as when the monk (I forget his name) goes to visit the 6th Patriarch himself to verify what he has learned from another master and Huineng generously confirms, \\"what he has told you is correct, simply keep your mind as free as space and yet do not entertain or grasp any thought of space or emptiness.\\" (these are not direct quotes, I don't have the book in front of me). There is no clearer way to put it in words than that. And that's it! Is this all there is to the essence of \\"seeing into your own nature?\\" Now, I have been reading and re-reading these incredible texts for many years, and with this new insight, what have I attained? Absolutely nothing...yet how refreshing, how wonderful, how free, how immense this moment is, endless, every breath is, inexpressively beautiful...is this enlightenment? I don't know, but I can honestly tell you, I no longer harbour any negative thoughts about anything anymore...now you add your attention/time/effort and see where you can go..."},{"Title":"Zen Buddhism: Selected Writings Of D.

Furthermore, it's fairly accurate, following the Koran line by line and balancing the need to make things make sense in English with the need to hold to the actual text. Reading other translations (Arberry comes to mind), I've had the impression that the author had decided to rewrite what many consider a holy book. As a practicing Muslim, Pickthall knew better and so produced the only translation I would recommend."},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"This is a very good translation of the Holy Quran by a native English speaker who was also a Muslim. It reads quite well, and the accuracy of the translation was checked by sheikhs at Al-Azhar.In addition, the volume contains a useful introduction to the life of the Prophet and the early history of Islam. An index of legislation (in the hardcover version) provides a handy guide for quickly looking up the laws relating to drinking, divorce, etc. The verses are numbered exactly as in the Arabic, and this enables one to refer to the original without the ambiguity that can sometimes arise when the English version runs together a number of Arabic verses in order to make a more &quot;poetic&quot; rendering."},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"If you're looking for a translation that will help you understand the Qur'an, this is not the one for you. It's cheap and widely available, but can leave you with false impressions of what is basically a very difficult text for people who have not read the original Arabic. When I bought the Pickthall translation, I had no idea that which translation you got made any difference. It was my first introduction to Islam and I was surprised and disappointed by it. It was a perplexing book without much explanation and I couldn't see what the big deal was all about. Since then, I have spent years reading different translations, (including Arberry, which at least came closer than Pickthall to preserving the poetry of the Qur'an) until I finally found the Muhammad Asad translation and got the guidance I needed to understand this valuable treasure. If you're sincerely after an understanding of the Qur'an, either learn Arabic and read it (translations are not technically \\"The Qur'an\\"), or buy \\"The Message of the Qur'an, translated and explained by Muhammad Asad\\". I still have the Pickthall translation, mainly because I don't want to confuse anyone by giving it to them. But having gained a much deeper understanding of the Qur'an through the light of the Asad translation, I have to say that Pickthall's is miles from helpful for anyone who hasn't already developed an understanding of his subject. If you're going take the time to read a translation of the Qur'an, take care to get the best one."},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"A very good translation of the Quran by an Englishman who converted to Islam. The only drawback to this particular translation is that the style of English used is reminiscent of the Old English style used in the King James translation of the Bible, and so can be a bit difficult to understand on occasion. Other than this, very good. An easier to understand translation would be \\"The Meaning of the Holy Quran\\" by \\"Abdullah Yusuf Ali\\". Often that translation also contains historical commentary to make it easier to understand the history and context of much of what is written, and helps to eliminate many common misunderstandings and misconceptions."},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"The book arrived new as advertised, however, it arrived with the top front corners bent back. People stuffing the books into the envelopes should take care to insert them spine edge first."},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"This is actually not a bad translation of the Qur'an, but I really must recommend the version by Abdullah Yusuf Ali instead of this one. (Especially if you know Arabic; it makes a lot more sense and is much more poetic.) The truth is, Islam IS a religion of peace, but, like Christianity, it has been subjected to perversion and twisting for a wide array of very un-Islamic purposes. Also, there are a million different \\"flavors\\" of Islam... Sunni and Shi'a are just the beginning, and only the most militant sects preach the hate and rabid condemnation of gays, extramarital sex, and the basest human impulses (I would add, however, that the Bible and Torah do the exact same thing.) If there is any doubt in your mind that Islam is, at its base, a religion of peace and acceptance, read Rumi or Ibn 'Arabi. They're two Sufis with an incredibly loving message! Many of the things people condemn Islam for are not even Islamic traditions AT ALL (the wearing of the veil, FGM, honor killings, hijackings...) Those things were all adopted 200 years or more after the Prophet died, taken from Persian or Turkish or Mongolian or deep-dark-Africa tribes.As a side note, just reading the Qur'an will NOT give you the whole picture of Islam. You must supplement that with Hadith (Sunna), Sira (the Prophet's biography), Tafsir (interpretations of the Qur'an), and real, unbiased history of the development of Islam.(FYI, I'm not a Muslim, but I lived in the Middle East for almost 8 years and know a ton of really great Muslim Arabs.)"},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"The only reason Pickthall is still popular is due to its mass circulation in nations such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia and parts of Africa. Firstly he uses archaic language which does not make it easy for individuals to understand the themes and meaning of the Quran in a coherent fashion.People \\"claim\\" that he is very much true to the Arabic of the Quran; that his is a very literal translation but lost in context. Well that is the point how can it be a \\"literal\\" translation when it is infact out of context in most places.There is also an issue of a history with this translation, it has been edited more times than most other translations and not by the original translator (Pickthall) but other individuals.Most Quranic translations have this humble claim that they are doing their best and they ask for forgiveness if there is indeed any error. That is the problem, most readers who rely on the English (first hand) may not even know if there are errors.Not only is this translation subjective, nor has it been supported by historical explanations of the Quran and lastly most people consider it to be out of context where the translation is NOT substantiated for with explanatory material or evidence of why the translater chose to render certain controversial passages as he; (or now in the case of so many revisions, as \\"they\\") did."},{"Title":"The Glorious Quran","review":"I heard that Pickthall's translation was quite good... but I don't think so.

Maybe try keeping in mind that the original text was revealed around 1400 years ago and in an Arabic that is out of date now. Plus, as close as this translation may be to the literal, we as people living 1400 years after this cannot relate to the way people spoke back then. They were less learned, however the Arabs, specifically the Muslims of the time were more learned than the rest of the world. Because of this, there are people who study a lot to be able to understand what it actually means.

Anything else is approximation, but Pickthall does a good job in translating.For those of you who cannot see the wonderful message in the quran, I refer you to verses 2:6-7:\\"As for the disbelievers, whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is one for them; they believe not.Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering.

While the authors' commentary is accurate and moving, nothing can compare to the shock of realizing that the irregularly shaped blotch above an anesthetized chimp's head is his detached scalp. The reader is confronted with image after image of chimps, both in the wild and in captivity. To the authors' credit, they reveal instances of violence among chimps, from hunting to warfare, suggesting a genetic legacy of aggression among both men and chimps.Despite the shocking and disturbing material, this book also affirms the beauty of chimps. The final picture of the series is of two orphaned juveniles living in an African sanctuary. They are standing upright, embracing, with expressions reminding me of two schoolyard buddies as they decide to face the bullies together.This is indeed a difficult book to page through. After I had bought this book, I left it on my desk for several weeks before I had the courage to crack it, but, when I finally did, I was glad I had. The brutality on display here contrasts sharply with the gentle love the authors have for chimps and their cause. Sometimes we need to see the truth before we can accept it, and this book will go a long way to strengthening public support for protecting primates."},{"Title":"Michael Nichols: Brutal Kinship","review":"Brutal Kinship wonderfully showcases Michael Nichols' artistic and lovely color photos which are perfect accompaniments to wildlife expert Jane Goodall's informed and informative essay backing up the photos as she deftly explains and explores the relationship between humankind and the chimp. The gorgeous, striking, and often memorably stunning photography pack discussions of chimp issues and human treatment. Brutal Kinship is a welcome and entertaingly educational contribution to personal, academic, and community library Animal Photography collections."},{"Title":"Michael Nichols: Brutal Kinship","review":"A sad tale of the many ways we mistreat our nearest relatives, BRUTAL KINSHIP is a photographic excursion aimed at the heart. Nichols and Goodall have been working together for a decade to raise awareness about chimpanzees, to save the species from extinction and to end the butcher-shop, pet business, scientific and entertainment industry abuse that is prevalent world wide. To anyone with even passing familiarity with Goodall's life and work these past 40 years, the pain she must feel visiting laboratories where chimps are imprisoned in life-long isolation, slowly going mad while being infected with human diseases seems nearly unbearable. As she asks, \\"How should we relate to beings who look into mirrors and see themselves as individuals, who mourn companions and may die of grief, who have a consciousness of \`self'? Don't they deserve to be treated with the same sort of consideration we accord to other highly sensitive, conscious beings -- ourselves? For ethical reasons, we no longer perform certain experiments on humans; I suggest that it would only be logical to refrain from doing those experiments on chimpanzees too.\\" Logical, indeed. Michel Nichols, whose words and photos comprise most of this volume, has captured the wild beauty and complex interaction of natural chimp society, as well as the abject state of captive creatures. The juxtaposition of these opposites says it all. Would you treat your worst enemy the way we treat the chimps? And when will it end?

The book tends to whitewash certain controversies and treat presidents in a more favorable light than might a longer, adult oriented book. Still, the book gives the basics of major scandals in the presiencies of Grant, Harding, Nixon, etc. Furthermore, the book gives the reader a basic understanding of who each of our presidents was and what the basic issues were during the presidency of each. Knowing the basics of each of our presidents is important for good citizenship and this book fills the bill nicely. I hope that this book will encourage readers to want to read full legnth biographies of some of the presidents profiled or, at least to delve deeper into their presidencies by reading a more complex, adult level book of this type. I highly recommend this great introduction to our presidents."},{"Title":"The look-it-up book of Presidents","review":"My first exposure to Wyatt Blassingame's The Look-It-Up Book of Presidents was the early 90's when my Aunt and Uncle gave the tome to me as a gift. Back then the book ended with President Reagan. Later on I updated my copy as President Bush 41 took and left office. In early 2009 I brought a copy of the book (after not owning a copy for several years) in order to have a book on the Presidents with President-elect Barack Obama in it.What keeps me coming back to the Look-It-Up Book of Presidents is how clearly the biographies of each President are written without any confusing jargon. I'm also impressed with how neutral he is toward each President. For example Blassingame's narratives about President's Clinton's scandals and his foreign policy are written better than most news stories were during those years. This neutrality also extends to the major events of President Bush's term such as 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. However I was disappointed that there was no mention of Hurricane Katrina, which one would think would be a given. The biography of President-elect Obama is well written and neutral as well. Other facts such as the 1994, 2004 and 2006 deaths of Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Ford are included.There is one weakness however. The list of Presidents in the front only includes general comments on how historians rank the Presidents up to Eisenhower. I think it would be a good idea to update the rankings to include the most recent Presidents after Eisenhower.Above all I'm glad I own the Look-It-Up Book of Presidents again. The book got me interested in history. I fully recommend it to children who need a basic reference and to adults who need a refresher on our Presidents."},{"Title":"The look-it-up book of Presidents","review":"Very interesting book.

The first chapter turned me off almost immediately for a couple of reasons: 1) the author's \\"authoritative\\" somewhat pompous tone; and 2) the first chapter is all about the \\"business\\" of radio rather than about production.I believe it's ok to have a chapter about the business of radio except the author uses it as an excuse to lay out his extended resume attempting to impress the reader. This is supposed to be a book about production. If a chapter about business needs to be included, it should be closer to the end of the book.From the second chapter on, there is a decent amount of good, solid fundamental audio production info. At the same time, the fundamental information this book provides can be found online for free these days.I am still looking for better books on audio production and I'm sure there have to be more than a few."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Italian Verbs","review":"This is a good little verb book. There are 200 verbs fully conjugated and a list of 3,000 more which refer to particular conjugated verbs as models. This is a good book for the price and includes examples of how these verbs might be used in typical speech, phrases, idiomatic expressions and it lists words sharing the same origin as the verb."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Italian Verbs","review":"I'm an intermediate student of Italian who has dabbled with the language for 15 years. I've looked at several verb reference texts over the years and I have never found one better than this one. I really like the print size and format for each of the 200 sample verbs. The verb list (3,000 verbs...with an Italian to English translation for each verb) in the back of the book ties each of these 3,000 Italian verbs to one of the sample 200 verbs in the body of the book...so the book is easy to use. I also like the compact size (I had this book with me for a six week trip to Italy this past fall). One knit-pick that I have heard about this book is the lack of an English to Italian listing of verbs. I think most people possess and carry an English/Italian dictionary along with a verb reference book...so I do not view this as a valid criticism. I am on my second version of this book. I wore out a copy of the 1994 edition."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Italian Verbs","review":"After three years of learning Italian I frequently return to this great book! I actually didn't use it as a reference, which is what it's meant for but I actually read the whole thing cover to cover.

The pictures and maps have helped me may times to find locations to dig for fossils. Hundreds of beautiful drawings and complete descriptions help to identify the fossils you find. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fossils","review":"It would be impossible, I'm sure, for a field guide to North American Fossils to provide us with every single fossil that can be found on our continent. No doubt the Audobon Society did not have in mind for a user of this guide to be able to identify everything they find, but to at least highlight the more common fossils, and to guide the reader to look for answers to all the rest. For instance, in Nebraska there are at least 3 types of horn coral that can be found near the Omaha region alone, and there is doubtless many more species that can be found. The guide helps you find the most common and to surmise what you have found by those examples.Furthermore, no book to be placed in the back pocket of us fossil enthusiasts could possibly be made very thin if it included every illustration, and every detailed description of every type of fossil.If I have one complaint about this book, its that the maps are difficult to read, and could have been simplified a bit more.. and printed clearer. But, that is a small complaint as I am able to get further detailed maps, and descriptions from the State of Nebraska Geological Survey and other sources.Get this book if you want to seriously hunt for fossils.. and identify them."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fossils","review":"If you're looking for an excellent fossil fieldguide, look no further. This is the first book I purchased to help me identify fossils, and have since purchased seven more but keep going back to this one. Why? First of all, the format is great. Tons of full-color photos and precise descriptions of the pictured specimens, including which areas of North America they normally occur in and when the organism existed (or exists) in geological time. Also lists similar fossils that are sometimes mistaken for or confused with the one illustrated.Second, this book focuses specifically on North American fossils, which means that you get more concise information. Many other fossil guides attempt to cover fossils of the world in the same size book (or smaller), which is doubtless a very ambitious project, but probably impossible to do successfully in the form of a fieldguide. So with the National Audobon guide, you get more pertinent information. Granted, not everyone is looking for an American-specific guide. But if youwant information on, say, European or Morrocan fossils, the same concept applies: Purchasing a more specific guide gives you more specific information for your money.Third, the photos in this guide look like fossils as they occur in nature (as opposed to some fossil guides picturing specimens that have been prepped and polished and perfectly repaired). This is an obvious advantage when trying to identify a specimen that you have just brushed the soil off of. (In fact, most &quot;serious&quot; paleontologists recommend that the natural condition of a fossil be altered as little as possible.)Fourth, the book diagrams and labels the different parts of the major fossil types. So by studying the diagrams, one can learn the paleontological names for the parts.I will say that the book focuses mainly on invertebrate fossils, so if you're interested specifically in vertebrate paleontology this would not be the book for you. But again: Purchasing a more specific guide gives you more specific information for your money.In conclusion, I very highly recommend this book to someone that is interested in identifying and learning more about invertebrate fossils. I have yet to find a guide that tops it!"},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fossils","review":"I am certainly not an expert in this field, have no formal training. I am simply a rather old man who has been grubbing in the ground and dirt and in the rocks for most of my life and have had a fascination with fossels since a very, very young child. This particular book has brought me a lot of pleasure and added greatly to the enjoyment of my hobby of \\"grubbing.\\" I realize that no one book can provide all the answers and identify all the fossil remains known (good grief, there are new ones being discovered every day it seems), but this work certainy meets my needs. I have yet to find a fossel that I was unable to identify with it's use, and at the very least, has given me clues as to where I might go to find the answers I needs. The photographs are great as are the written discriptions. I carry this one with me always when out in the field.

However, it contained little information on plant and Vertebrate fossils which are my main interest. About 90% of the book focused on Shells, Corals,Sponges,Triliobites, Bryozoans, Sand Dollars, etc. In that subject matter the photos and detailed information about each was excellent. It was a bit trying to read the map plates; the text was small and difficult to find in the shaded areas. On another note it has great information about Geologic time and where to look for fossils.This is a great reference for any fossil collector, however, if you are more interested in detailed information and photographs about fossils of plants, reptiles, fish, and mammals this book will disapoint with its lack of information"},{"Title":"National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fossils","review":"I really enjoy this book because I travel and camp alot.

As I read more, I came upon the food pyramid and was referred to a later chapter. Disappointingly, I found separate food pyramids for Asian-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and African-Americans. I was shocked to read some of the content of the food pyramids and found it to be extremely offensive and prejudice. Lumping an entire race into a different \\"food consumption\\" category is unbelievable and very untruthful. For this reason alone, I stopped reading the book halfway through. The book has a copyright date of 2002, which makes the food separate food pyramids even more appalling.I have found more helpful information for soon to be pregnant women on Internet searches, especially in terms of nutrition and fitness.

Maybe it's just me, but these issues are slowing down my reading of this book :(."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I found this book to be very general and overall just OK. It doesn't touch in depth on any one subject, which means I might as well have gone on the internet for the same info. For example, there was virtually nothing detailed about trying to conceive and what was there was BEYOND basic (and inaccurate according to some), the nutrition could have been more detailed and was not well researched, and most importantly this book did a very poor job of helping me find a birth center or hospital or figuring out how to evaluate my OB/midwife. That is because in cities where baby catchers are far and few between, it is not a bad idea to find someone BEOFORE you have even conceived. I ended up having to change my practice after I became pregnant because I found other books that made me rethink the kind of birth experience and medical care I was going to need and that should be addressed more carefully in a book like this; finding a practice when you are already pregnanct can be stressful. Genetic testing is a consideration I think people should make up their minds about BEFORE they even conceive; it's much harder to do so after the fact for obvious reasons. In other words, you should attempt to consiider your feelings about the possibility of not haviing a 100% healthy fetus BEFORE you ever even conceive, without it being in an alarmist fashion. My opinion is that there are better books out there with more comprehensive information about the entire process of pre-pregnancy and pregnancy that will tell you what you really want to know."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This book is full of helpful information that women need to know before they get pregnant.

Following that is a portion on medicine, herbs, teas, etc. that will impact a healthy conception and pregnancy--I turned back to these chapters many times even during pregnancy.
